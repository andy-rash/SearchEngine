I'll use [[Russian:Various stuff]] to practice my own Russian. Probably it will contain stuff that can be used later at other places. [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 00:36, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

----

I vote for using Unicode stress marks to indicate stress (as in [[Russian:Possessive pronouns]]) and reserving boldface for emphasis (e.g. to highlight changing word endings).  This would be more consistent with traditional textbooks.  For new content, you can copy and paste the stress character if you don't have another way of inputing them. Any thoughts? [[User:Fleminra|Fleminra]] 20:21, 14 Mar 2004 (UTC)

----

Would it make more sense to put the stress marks over the vowel of the syllables?

----

I agree about the stress marks- the way it looks right now is very confusing. [[User:Paul_Lynch|Paul_Lynch]] [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 02:06, 8 October 2005 (UTC)
== Verbal Aspect ==

I've added as section on verbal aspect to the grammar section of the page.  I am not a native speaker of Russian, but rather an American who has studied Russian.  If I've made mistakes, particularly in examples, please feel free to correct them.  In any case, I believe the addition of the verbal aspect page was needed, and what I've put up is a start.  (No user account - 8 April 2005)

==

I guess that `Самый лучший урок русского языка интернета только на земле!' is a joke, since the sentence is translated as `The best lesson of Russian language of Internet only on earth.' Please, state its status to avoid confusion among non-speakers.

==

I am a russian. And I hope I can help you. Do not hesitate, ask me your questions. User:Nemoj 07:50, 29 October 2005 (UTC)


==

Can accent marks be added to indicate the stressed syllables?

== Who is writing this book? ==

I'm new here, and can see some obvious things that should be changed, and other things that should be added... should I go ahead and change them, or is there someone I should check with for? (don't hate me for being new) [[User:Paul_Lynch|Paul_Lynch]] [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 02:09, 8 October 2005 (UTC)

== Planning ==

After 6 months of being away (studying in Moscow) and no one doing anything to this wikibook, I'd like to start the page [[Russian/Planning]]. This page will state what this book needs (and it needs a lot) and how it should be organized. If anyone at all still looks at this wikibook, please leave me a message on my user page. I plan on going onto the russian wikibooks site in the next few days, to look for native speakers to help with audio files, dialogues, and exercises. I would really like this wikibook start to resemble something close to the [[French]] or [[Spanish]] wikibook, or something even better than those. Any help would be appreciated! [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 14:19, 18 April 2006 (UTC)

Why is some of the language links go to the French Wikibooks?--[[User:68.170.86.111|68.170.86.111]] 22:29, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

Never mind.  I figured it out.  For some reason the Russian Language template interwiki linked to the French Language wikibooks in several languages.  I removed that.--[[User:68.170.86.111|68.170.86.111]] 22:33, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

== Download ==

It says download or print version, how do I download the wikibook

== Construction ==

Planning seems to [[Russian/Planning|fall through]] after a couple of efforts, so I propose we structure it here and play it by ear. Mostly, editors come on spurts and then get bored and leave. I for one ''hope'' I can stay to improve this lacking Wikibook, and it won't work if we're all afraid to go against a plan. I'm going in. [[User:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;.ıl&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Note''': NEVER hesitate to change something! If you disagree with it, change it. Wikibooks is not that large enough of a project to get picky over things like proper references and things. I'm trying to start a general restructure, so try to follow that, but if you hate the seal on the front page, go change it (I think it's nice-looking though). [[User:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;.ıl&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:12, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Note''': Be harsh on the '''Stage''' templates, please. A cursory glance through most articles gave me the impression none of it is more than 25% done. Even though [[Russian/Lesson 1|Lesson 1]] has much of the basic text, I rate it 25% because it is hardly structured and formatted as a ''lesson''. It has a while to go before it is of much use. [[User:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;.ıl&lt;/font&gt;]] 05:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Note''': I like the ''cheat sheet'' in the [[Esperanto]] book. [[User:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;.ıl&lt;/font&gt;]] 09:12, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

Thus begins another attempt at working on this book. [[User:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;.ıl&lt;/font&gt;]] 09:03, 11 February 2008 (UTC)

Removed intro: may use later, but seems to be most effective when getting right to material:
:&lt;small&gt;Welcome to the Russian Wikibook. Russian is an East Slavic language, and is grouped with [[Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian]]. Russian is written with the [[w:Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]]. Russian was the defacto universal and official language of the Soviet Union, and remains the official language of Russia and the CIS. Russian is also an official language in Belarus and Kazakhstan, and it is an official language of the United Nations. Outside the former USSR, there are large communities of Russian-speakers in every part of the world. Even astronauts, who work with the International Space Station, are trained to speak Russian to some form of fluency as there are Russian cosmonauts who operate the ISS.

:Knowledge of the Russian language will increase appreciation of a rich and diverse body of literature, and assist in learning other languages of the Slavic family (like [[Polish]], [[Czech]], [[Slovak]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Slovenian]] and [[Bulgarian]]). It is not an easy language to take on, as an entirely new alphabet and grammatical structure slow down beginners. With practice and immerssion, Russian will become a passion, and soon after, an acquired language.

:The '''Russian Wikibook''' is structured in a way to present the most integrated material in short, easy to digest ''lessons''. To begin, read the Introduction and learn how best to learn with this book.&lt;/small&gt;
[[User:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot; size=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ALTON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Alton|&lt;font color=&quot;#808080&quot;&gt;.ıl&lt;/font&gt;]] 01:44, 4 August 2008 (UTC)

== Any new lessons coming soon? ==

Could someone Russian talking create some easy texts with translations because it would be alot easier to learn Russian with examples and by seeing the language in use?
--[[User:Mikaell|Mikaell]] ([[User talk:Mikaell|talk]]) 14:20, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
'''I am a native speaker'''. Often too busy but willing to help bit by bit. Throw some ideas about what you learners want to see here and I will see what I can do. You '''can also help''' by structuring the lessons, so a native speaker could only fill the gaps - Russian text, pronunciation etc. If interested post to my talk page. --[[User:Atitarev|Atitarev]] ([[User talk:Atitarev|talk]]) 12:13, 14 August 2008 (UTC)</text>

==Address notation==
The lines are marked with abbreviations:  г. (город - city), ул.  (улица - street), д. (дом - building) or бл. (блок - blok), кв. (квартира - apartment) or ап. (апартамент - apartment):

Борису Иванову &lt;br&gt;
115114 г. Москва &lt;br&gt;
ул. Петрова, д. 14, кв. 15 &lt;br&gt;


Note  the name is in the dative case (because the letter is being sent to this person).

Also note that an индекс (6 digits), which is something like an American zip code, should probably be included as well, but I've been told by Russians that the индекс is not vital to the arrival of your parcel. But correct индекс makes arrival more predictible in measure of time.

Finally:  If sending mail internationally between Russian post and non-Russian post, I recommend including the name of the addressee country in the language of the postal service of origin, as this part of the shipment must of course be handled by domestic post.  The rest of the address should be written in the language (and script) of the destination.  For example, if sending a letter to the address listed above from the United States, append the line &quot;RUSSIA&quot; to the beginning.  Likewise if sending mail home to the U.S. from Russia, append &quot;США&quot; to the head of the address.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[w:Russian alphabet|Russian alphabet]] has 33 letters. It descended from the [[Modern Greek/Alphabet|Greek alphabet]], so while some may appear like the English alphabet, the pronunciation might be very different. It consists of 21 consonants, 10 vowel letters, and two letters, '''ь''' and '''ъ''', that do not designate sounds.

==Basic pronunciation rules==
'''Notes on the Alphabet and Pronunciation of Russian'''&lt;br&gt;
# While Russian has a mostly [[w:en:phonetic|phonetic]] [[w:en:orthography|orthography]], there are a few exceptions:  
#* The letter &quot;&amp;#1075;&quot; between the letters &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;  and between two &quot;o&quot;'s it is pronounced as /v/, e.g. &quot;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1086;&quot; (his, him) is pronounced /jevo/. This rule only applies when &quot;&amp;#1077;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1086;&quot; is at the end of the word. Note that this applies only to the case endings (genitive and accusative), there are words that fit this description but are pronounced normally, e.g. &quot;много&quot; /mnogo/ - many, much, a lot (of) &lt;br&gt;
#* Voiced consonants with voiceless counterparts lose their voicing at the end of a word, e.g. &quot;&amp;#1089;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1088;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1075;&amp;#1072;&amp;#1085;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1074;&quot; (stroganoff) is pronounced /stroganof/.&lt;br&gt;
#* Voiced consonants with voiceless counterparts become unvoiced before voiceless consonants, e.g. &quot;&amp;#1074;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1076;&amp;#1082;&amp;#1072;&quot; (vodka) is pronounced /votka/.
#*Similarly, voiceless consonants with voiced counterparts become voiced before voiced consonants, e.g. &quot;&amp;#1092;&amp;#1091;&amp;#1090;&amp;#1073;&amp;#1086;&amp;#1083;&quot; (soccer/football) is pronounced /fudbol/.&lt;br&gt;
#*Vowels are only fully pronounced when they are accented. In the non-accented (weak) position, vowels are &quot;reduced&quot; to the neutral sound. Spelling, on the other hand, doesn't depend on whether their position is accented or not. This particularly applies to the 'o'.
# The hard sign (&amp;#1066;/&amp;#1098;) indicates that the preceding consonant is not palatalized. However, it has been very rarely used since the spelling reform of 1918. Its use now is to indicate that the following vowel like &quot;е&quot; or &quot;я&quot; is to be pronounced iotated (that is, as if it was the first letter in the syllable).&lt;br&gt;
# The soft sign (&amp;#1068;/&amp;#1100;) indicates that the preceding consonant is palatalized. In the middle of a word, it also has the same effect &quot;ъ&quot; does.&lt;br&gt;
# The vowels &amp;#1045;/&amp;#1077;, &amp;#1025;/&amp;#1105;, &amp;#1048;/&amp;#1080;, &amp;#1070;/&amp;#1102;, &amp;#1071;/&amp;#1103; make the consonants before them [[w:en:palatal consonant|palatal consonant]].  This means that one pronounces the consonant with the middle of the tongue raised, pressing against the hard palate.&lt;br&gt;

=== Pronunciation mnemonics ===
# Letters identical to their latin equivalents : к о м е т а (comet)
# &quot;Greek&quot; letters: г л ф (as in Gamma, Lambda, Phi).  Try also, the Russian word, флаг, which means &quot;flag&quot;.
# да (da) нет (nyet): two easy Russian words that show you how д, н and е are pronounced
# суши-бар (sushi-bar): these are popping up all over the place in St. Petersburg... this word is a very useful way of learning how с, у, ш, и, б and р are pronounced
# хип-хоп (hip-hop): actually, the х is a much harsher sound, like the &quot;ch&quot; in Scottish &quot;loch&quot;, but otherwise хип-хоп music can help you learn х and п
# союз (Soyuz): useful for learning the ю and the з (which you should just think of as a cursive latin Z)
# я (ya/I;) and вы (vy/you): pronouns you'll be using most often when talking with strangers, as in &quot;do you speak English?  I do not speak Russian&quot;. Unlike English, pronouns can be omitted due to context in the present and future tenses.
# царь (tsar) and чай (chai): for keeping your ц and ч straight

[[Image:Nori.jpg|right|thumb|Sheets of prepared nori]]
'''Nori''' (&amp;#28023;&amp;#33492;) is a Japanese term used to refer to edible varieties of algae in the various species of the red algae ''Porphyra'', including most notably ''P. yezoensis'' and ''P. tenera''.  A few other algae are used as well, including some cyanobacteria.  Nori is also commonly used to refer to the food products created from these so-called &quot;sea vegetables&quot;.  Finished products are made by a shredding and rack-drying process that resembles papermaking. Nori is commonly used as a wrap for [[Cookbook:Onigiri|Onigiri]] and [[Cookbook:Sushi|Makizushi]]. 

''Nori'' is sometimes translated ''laver'' in English, but the term usually applies to plants of the genus ''Porphyra'' and not to the finished edible sheets of nori. The English term is in any case not well known, and in the United States, the term ''nori'' is more common.

Other edible algaes commonly served in Japan include wakame, which is usually dried nori baked and seasoned with sweet soy sauce.

=== Attempt at Meta Tag ===
How do I fix the meta tag that goes to Wikipedia?
:You use [[w:InterWiki|InterWiki]] links.
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:InterWiki|]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

:People sometimes use &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:InterWiki|InterWiki]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. However, |]] hides the w: part and makes the WikiText cleaner. [[User:Midnightcomm|Midnightcomm]] 17:34, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

=== Merit Badge List ===
Should we have a template where we provide:
* The '''name''' of the merit badge
* The id '''number''' used by meritbadge.com

The name of the merit badge should be able to use for boyscouttrail.com as they use (mostly) proper names with the spaces squashed out. I'm not quite sure how to do this. Looking at [[w:Template:Gutenberg|Template:Gutenberg]] for starters.

== Why link to secondary web site meritbadge.org instead of the BSA web site? ==

Why not use links to the pages under [http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges.aspx http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges.aspx] instead of the ones to meritbadge.org used at present? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 09:24, 17 July 2011 (UTC)

Among scouts, meritbadge.org is the favourite  source of merit badge information, as it is easier to navigate and ti generally more helpful. [[User:DamaniRD|DamaniRD]] ([[User talk:DamaniRD|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DamaniRD|contribs]]) 21:58, 15 August 2015 (UTC)</text>

Note: a Wikipedia book on [[First Aid]] is under development.

==Requirement 1==
See [[/Earning the Scout Badge/]], [[/Earning the Tenderfoot Rank/]], [[/Earning the Second Class Rank/]], and the First Class Rank.

==Requirement 2==
:''Explain how you would obtain emergency medical assistance from your house, on a wilderness camping trip, and during an activity on open water.''
'''At home''': Keep emergency numbers posted at the phone along with your address. 911 service is available in most areas. If phones are not working, go to a neighbor that has emergency training.

'''Wilderness''': Cell phone, radio, messenger, or evacuate. Signal fires and sounds are a last resort if you cannot evacuate. Be sure to leave a map and schedule at home to trigger an automatic rescue response.

'''Open Water''': Powered craft should be equipped with a marine band radio tuned to the emergency channel (#16). Flares and smoke bombs can be carried on any boat but must be used with caution. A distress flag (orange with a black dot and a black square) or signal mirror may be useful over short distances.

:''Explain the term triage.''
'''Triage''': the process of sorting victims, as of a battle or disaster, to determine medical priority in order to increase the number of survivors; the determination of priorities for action in an emergency. 

:''Explain the standard precautions as applied to blood borne pathogens.''
Treat all blood as if it were contaminated with blood borne pathogens. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before and after treating a sick or injured person. Never use your bare hands to stop bleeding. Use a protective barrier, preferably nonlatex disposable gloves (a new, unused plastic food storage bag will work in a pinch). Safely discard all soiled bandages, dressings, and other used first aid items by putting them in a double bag until they can be disposed of properly in a receptacle for bio-hazards

:''Prepare a first aid kit for your '''home'''. Display and discuss its contents with your counselor.''

|}

==Requirement 3==
:''Explain what action you should take for someone who shows signs of a heart attack, shock, and stroke.''
Lay the victim down and elevate legs. Call 911. Keep warm, calm and comfortable. Monitor breathing as CPR may be required before help arrives. Transport only if no EMS is available. Under no circumstances should the patient attempt to drive to the hospital.
:''Identify the conditions that must exist before performing CPR on a person.''
Rescue breathing is used if the victim does not begin breathing when the airway is opened. It also helps warm a severely hypothermic person who is breathing very slowly. Chest compressions should only be used when there are no signs of circulation: coughing, moving, pulse, skin color takes more than 2 seconds to return after finger pressure is removed. 
:''Demonstrate proper technique in performing CPR using a training device approved by your counselor.''
See [[First Aid/CPR summary]]
:''Show the steps that need to be taken for someone suffering from a severe cut on the leg and on the wrist. Tell the dangers in the use of a tourniquet and the conditions under which its use is justified.''
The four steps of severe bleeding are:
*Direct pressure -- place a hand firmly over the wound and press hard
*Elevation -- if on an extremity, lift the limb over the person's heart
*Pressure point -- place directed pressure at one of the &quot;pressure points&quot;.  On the arm, this is between the bicep and tricep on the upper arm (a pulse is normally palpable) and on the leg midway down the thigh and between the two leg muscles.
*Tourniquet -- (For use in emergencies only) tie a cravat, rope or belt above the wound as tight as possible, in order to completely cut off circulation to the injured area.  The most typical method of tying it is a simple overhand knot, held tight while a pencil or stick is placed on top of the middle of the knot.  Another overhand knot is tied, and the pencil or stick can be twisted to tighten the knot.  Cutting off circulation for extended periods can lead to the amputation of the limb, so this must not be used unless all other methods have been tried and there is no hope for help in the near future.  The time should be noted when the tourniquet is applied, as this will be helpful for the doctors.
:''Explain when a bee sting could be life threatening and what action should be taken for prevention and for first aid.''
Bee stings can cause a fatal reaction called [[w:Anaphylaxis|anaphylaxis]] in people who have a severe allergy to bee venom.  It is possible to have the same reaction to foods and medicines (peanuts and shellfish are also common causes of anaphylatic reactions).  The effects are nearly immediate -- swelling of the neck and face, sweating, difficulty breathing and hives are among the most common signs.  Many people with severe allergies, especially bee stings, carry a device called an ''Epi-Pen''.  An Epi-Pen is a dosage of a powerful hormone, epinephrine, which counteracts an anaphylactic reaction.  To use it, remove the safety cap and simply press the needle end firmly against the victim's thigh, about midway between the knee and hip.  The spring-loaded needle will automatically extend, delivering the epinephrine into the muscle where it will be rapidly transferred into the bloodstream. The effect of the epi-pen is temporary, however, and the person must still get medical attention quickly.
:''Explain the symptoms of heat stroke and what action needs to be taken for first aid and for prevention.''
Heatstroke occurs when the core body temperature rises too far for the body's natural defense mechanisms to function. Ordinarily, if the body temperature goes up, sweat is released; the sweat evaporates from the surface of the skin, thus removing heat from the body. In an absence of water or salt, sweating can not occur and heatstroke begins. It is a serious, life-threatening problem that can cause death in minutes. A victim should be cooled down, by removing clothing, placing in the shade or other methods, and should be given water to drink in small sips. Do not give large gulps. This will make it worse. If convulsions occur, do not attempt to restrain the victim. Definitely, do not move the victim!

==Requirement 4==
:''Describe the signals of a broken bone. Show first-aid procedures for handling fractures, including open (compound) fractures of the forearm, wrist, upper leg, and lower leg using improvised materials.''
[[File:Epiphysenfrakturen new.png|thumb|right|400px|Types of fracture]]
Definition: If more pressure is put on a bone than it can stand, it will split or break. A break of any size is called a fracture. If the broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open fracture (compound fracture). A stress fracture is a hairline crack in the bone that develops because of repeated or prolonged forces against the bone.
:There are several types of bone fracture, including: 
::•	Oblique - a fracture (also called a simple fracture) which goes at an angle to the axis 
::•	Comminuted - a fracture of many relatively small fragments 
::•	Spiral - a fracture which runs around the axis of the bone 
::•	Compound - a fracture (also called open) which breaks the skin 
:Broken Bone Don'ts:
::•	DO NOT move the person unless the broken bone is firmly secured with a splint or sling. 
::•	DO NOT move a person with an injured hip, pelvis, or upper leg unless it is absolutely necessary. If you must move the person, pull the person to safety by his clothes (such as by the shoulders of a shirt, a belt, or pant-legs). 
::•	DO NOT move a person who has a possible spine injury. 
::•	DO NOT attempt to straighten a bone or change its position unless blood circulation appears hampered. 
::•	DO NOT try to reposition a suspected spine injury. 
::•	DO NOT test a bone's ability to move. 
::•	DO NOT give the person anything by mouth.
:''Describe the symptoms and possible complications and demonstrate proper procedures for treating suspected injuries to the back, neck, and head. Explain what measures can be taken to reduce the possibility of further complicating these injuries.''
Anybody that has fallen more than 15 feet, been in a car crash, or hit their head should be suspected of having a back or neck injury. Symptoms may include the person is complaining of any pain in their head, neck, or back, or they have numbness in any of their extremities. However, the person may not be complaining of any pain at all and still have an injury.
The problem with these injuries is that any damage to the back and especially the neck can lead to paralysis or even death. A head injury can lead to brain damage, blood loss, or death.
The most important thing to remember about spinal injuries is not to move the person unless absolutely necessary. Moving the person can make a bad injury worse. The only times when you should move such a person is if:
::•	You must move them to get to a more seriously injured person.
::•	The person is in a dangerous position and you are able to move them to a safer place
::•	You need to perform CPR and need to place the person on a hard surface
The best thing that you can do is to tell the person not to move. If needed, hold their head in place. Medical professionals call this &quot;holding C-Spine, &quot; or the inline neutral position. Make sure that the person can breath and they have a pulse, then wait for help to arrive.
If the person is bleeding from the head, try to stop the bleeding. Direct pressure is important here, but do not press too hard as you might further injure the skull. This is the one case where you do not treat for shock! If you notice a clear fluid coming from the ears, nose or mouth, do not stop it.

==Requirement 5==
''Describe the symptoms, proper first-aid procedures, and possible prevention measures for the following conditions''
:''Hypothermia''
Hypothermia occurs when the core body temperature becomes too cold.  Ordinarily, the body begins shivering to regain lost heat.  When there is no longer enough energy for this to occur, hypothermia begins and the victim will stop shivering and become confused or unconscious.  Warming the victim's body may require extra clothing (or the replacement of wet clothing) or using a fire or body heat.  Re-warming should occur over time (rather than suddenly) unless the victim's body temperature also dropped suddenly (i.e. fell into an icy lake).  Rapid re-warming of a chronic hypothermia patient can lead to re-warming shock
:''Convulsions/Seizures''
Convulsions are involuntary muscle spasms that can be caused by a variety of diseases and injuries.  There is no emergency treatment, but it is important to not hold the victim down or otherwise restrain him, and to give nothing by mouth (contrary to widely-held opinion, the victim will not &quot;choke on his tongue&quot;).  These seizures are not uncommon in people afflicted with epilepsy, and these convulsions are generally not dangerous (though a doctor should still be consulted if the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes).  You should also remove all loose furniture that the victim could injure themselves by flailing a body part into it. If the person does not regularly have seizures, medical help should be call for. Try to reassure the person and be sure that they can breath. Medical professionals will want to know how long the seizure lasted and if the person injured themselves in any way, especially their head, neck, or back.
:''Frostbite''
Frostbite occurs when an extremity, often fingers or toes, freezes completely. The skin will first turn blue, then white, and finally black. Get the person to a warm area. Then warm the hand or foot slowly in water, beginning with a room temperature and gradually adding warmer and warmer water. Don't wrap the affected area in anything, this could cause the affected tissue to be killed off.
:''Dehydration''
Dehydration occurs when there is insufficient amount of water for the normal functioning of the body. It is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that can result in lowered blood pressure, dizziness, and fainting, among other things. Treatment is usually by replenishing the body with necessary water and electrolytes. It is most important to give the person water. Beverages like soda are not good but are better than nothing. Eating solid food without water content does not help the condition.
:''Bruises, strains, sprains''
Black and blue marks are common bruises.  Keep a cold, wet towel over the bruise for 30-60 minutes to help prevent more blood from leaking into the tissues.  Next day apply a warm wet cloth. 
A Strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon. Apply ice pack to reduce swelling and pain.  Wrap firmly with an elastic bandage to limit the swelling and to protect the injury.  Stay off the injury. Good physical conditioning and proper warmup before exercise help to prevent strained muscles and tendons. 
A sprain is cased by twisting, wrenching, or lifting movements that tear or stretch tissues around a joint.  Raise the injured part, apply cold compresses, and treat as a fracture or broken bone. 
:''Burns''
Mild burns cause a painful reddening of the skin.  A typical first-degree burn is a sunburn. A second-degree burn is a burn that raises blisters. Severe or third-degree burns char layers of skin and flesh. Do not treat burns with jellies, creams, greases, or sprays. First aid for mild burns, apply ice packs or damp, cold cloths, do not break blisters, let dry and cover it with a loose bandage.  For serious burns, protect the burn by draping it with a clean, damp cloth. Do not apply ice, because it could cause shock.  Treat for shock. If victim is able to drink, give lots of milk or water or other fluids.  Seek medical attention, quickly. 
:''Abdominal pain''
A stomachache is nothing more than a pain caused by overeating, eating too fast, or eating an odd mixture of strange or unusual foods.  Have person lie down.  Give an antacid to help relieve the pain. Don’t give the person anything solid to eat.
:''Broken, chipped, or loosened tooth''
Gently clean. Place cold compress on face, to minimize swelling. Go to the dentist immediately. 
:''Knocked-out tooth''
Pick up tooth carefully by the crown, not by the roots. If dirty gently rinse with water or victims saliva
.     place in container of milk or sterilized water and go immediately to the dentist. The dentist will prescribe antibiotics for infection.
:''Muscle cramps''
Muscle cramps are usually caused by lack of water. Muscle cramps can be minor or painful. Apply firm pressure or gently massage to help relieve the muscle spasms. Drink water to help prevent future cramps.

==Requirement 6==
Do TWO of the following:
:''If a sick or injured person must be moved, tell how you would determine the best method.''

With helpers under your supervision, improvise a stretcher and move a presumably unconscious person.

'With your counselor's approval, arrange a visit with your patrol or troop to an emergency medical facility or through an American Red Cross Chapter for a demonstration of how an AED is used.''

==Requirement 7==
:''Teach another Scout a first-aid skill selected by your counselor.'' Use the EDGE system if needed.

'''''Discuss with your counselor the influence that EIGHT of the following people had on the history of medicine:'''''
 
[[Image:Hippocrates.jpg|thumb|250px|Hippocrates]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates Hippocrates] of Cos (c. 460 BC - 377 BC) was an Ancient Greek physician, is commonly regarded as one of the most outstanding figures in medicine of all time and has been called ''the father of medicine''.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Harvey William Harvey] (April 1, 1578 - June 3, 1657) was a doctor who first correctly described in exact detail the circulatory system of blood being pumped around the body by the heart.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_van_Leeuwenhoek Anton van Leeuwenhoek] (October 24, 1632 - August 26, 1723) was a tradesman and scientist from Delft, in the Netherlands. He is best known for his contribution to improvement of the microscope and his contributions towards the establishment of cell biology. Using his handcrafted microscope he was the first to observe and describe muscles fibres, bacteria, spermatozoa and blood flow in capillaries (small blood vessels).

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Jenner Edward Jenner] (May 17, 1749 - January 26, 1823) was an English country doctor practicing in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, England, made famous by his invention of the vaccine.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale Florence Nightingale] (May 12, 1820 - August 13, 1910) - The Lady With The Lamp - was the pioneer of modern nursing.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur Louis Pasteur] (December 27, 1822 - September 28, 1895) was a French scientist who was a pioneer in microbiology.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel Gregor Mendel] was born on July 22, 1822, in Heinzendorf, Austria (now Hyncice, Czech Republic). He studied the inheritance of traits in pea plants, discovering the basic laws of inheritance. He is often called the father of genetics.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lister Joseph Lister], 1st Baron Lister (April 5, 1827-February 10, 1912) was a famous British surgeon who promoted the idea of sterile surgery while working at the Glasgow Infirmary. He came from a rich Quaker home in Yorkshire.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Koch Robert Koch] (December 11, 1843 - May 27, 1910) was a German physician. He became famous for the discovery of the tubercle bacillus (1882) and the cholera bacillus (1883) and for his development of Koch's postulates. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905. He is considered one of the founders of bacteriology.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Conrad_R%C3%B6ntgen Wilhelm Röntgen] (March 27, 1845 - February 10, 1923) was a German physicist, of the University of Würzburg, who, on November 8, 1895, produced wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that are now known as x-rays. The machine which Röntgen built to emit these rays, was the x-ray machine.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie Marie] (November 7, 1867 – July 4, 1934) and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Curie Pierre] (May 15, 1859 – died April 19, 1906) were pioneers in the early field of radiation. Both were Nobel Laureates in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed Walter Reed] (September 13, 1851 - November 23, 1902) was an American Army surgeon who led a team which discovered that yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitos rather than direct contact. This insight opened entire new fields of epidemiology and biomedicine and most immediately allowed the resumption and completion of work on the Panama Canal (1904-14) by the United States.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner Karl Landsteiner] (June 14, 1868 - June 26, 1943), was an Austrian biologist. In 1909 he developed the modern system of classification of blood groups and later identified agglutins and Rhesus factor for which he won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Fleming Alexander Fleming] (August 6, 1881 - March 11, 1955) a Scottish biologist and pharmacologist. Fleming published many articles on bacteriology, immunology, and chemotherapy. His best-known achievements are the discovery of the enzyme lysozyme in 1922 and isolation of the antibiotic substance penicillin from the fungus Penicillium notatum in 1928, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk Jonas Salk] (October 28, 1914 - June 23, 1995) is the discoverer/inventor of the vaccine for Polio which proved to be the first successful vaccine against a virus. The vaccine provides the recipient with immunity against Polio, and was seminal in the near eradication of a once widely-feared disease.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_D._Watson James Watson] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick Francis Crick] are American molecular biologist who are best known as the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA. This earned them the 1962 Noble Prize in Physiology and Medicine and a correct understanding of how &quot;the molecular structure of nucleic acids transfer information in living material&quot;.[1]

==Hippocratic Oath==
'''''Explain the Hippocratic Oath to your counselor, and compare the original version to a more modern one. Discuss to whom those subscribing to the original version of the oath owe the greatest allegiance.'''''

* Original text of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath Hippocratic Oath]:

{{cquote|I swear by [[Apollo]], [[Asclepius]], [[Hygieia]], and [[Panacea]], and I take to witness all the gods,   all the goddesses, to keep according to my ability and my judgment, the following Oath. To consider dear to me as my parents him who taught me [[medicine|this art]]; to live in common with him and if necessary to share my goods with him; To look upon his children as my own brothers, to teach them this art I will [[Medical prescription#History|prescribe]] regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone. To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death. Nor will I give a woman a [[pessary]] to procure [[abortion]]. But I will preserve the purity of my life and my arts. I will not cut for [[kidney stone|stone]], even for patients in whom the disease is manifest; I will leave this operation to be performed by practitioners, specialists in [[Surgery|this art]]. In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients, keeping myself far from all intentional ill-doing and all seduction and especially from the pleasures of love with women or with men, be they free or slaves. All that may come to my knowledge in the exercise of my profession or in daily commerce with men, which ought not to be spread abroad, I will keep secret and will never reveal. If I keep this oath faithfully, may I enjoy my life and practice my art, respected by all men and in all times; but if I swerve from it or violate it, may the reverse be my lot.}}

* Modern text (from the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Geneva Declaration of Geneva]):

===Diagnostic Testing===
'''''Describe the characteristics of a good diagnostic test to screen for disease (e.g. routine blood pressure measurement). Explain briefly why diagnostic tests are not perfect.'''''

Each diagnostic tests has different properties or abilities to accurately determine results. A good diagnostic test would be one in which the test is highly reliable for accurately diagnosing the condition of interest, would be inexpensive to administer, and would provide results quickly. In addition to how the test itself performs, one must ask if the result from test can be used to guide subsequent decisions on starting, stopping, or modifying treatment. Consequently, the practical value of a diagnostic test can only be assessed by taking into account subsequent health outcomes. In determining the value of various diagnostic tests, it is important to distinguish between these two features of the test (accuracy of the test itself) and (ability of the test to guide therapeutic decision making in  altering health outcomes). 

In terms of accuracy, diagnostic tests are judged by several characteristics, including:

==Health Care System==
* '''''Discuss the roles medical societies, the insurance industry, and the government play in influencing the practice of medicine in the United States. 
** ''Medical Societies.'' These groups, made up of physician members of a designated specialty or common interest, can have a significant influence over the way their specialty is practiced. The traditional role of these societies has been to certify or license or practice in the designated field. Medical societies can be very effective in protecting the interests of the society through political action groups, accelerate the sharing of best practices across the field, and as an organizing influence for ongoing education, specialization, and training. 
** ''Insurance Industry'' - this industry has a major impact on medicine as it has developed into the primary means (~55%) whereby health care services are paid for. The essential idea behind insurance is to protect against risk - meaning that people are willing to pay insurance companies  a ''known'' quantity of money (in the form of a monthly/annual &quot;premium&quot;) to protect them against ''unknown'' medical expenses. Insurers often set the prices, determine if a medical expense meets their criteria for payment, and can significantly influence practice patterns by how they reimburse, or pay, for various healthcare services. Given the way the current insurance industry has been organized, they are often in an adversarial relationship with medical providers and the patients they serve. 
** ''Government.'' In the United States, the government pays for ~45% of all health care expenses. As a result, they have significant ability to influence the way medicine is practiced, the way that it is paid for, and how the delivery of health care is legislated.  Government needs to be careful of this influence, and the traditional accepted role of government is not to intervene with the free market, but rather create an environment of standards, interoperability, and similiar policies that enable 

* '''''Briefly tell how your state monitors the quality of health care within its borders, and how it provides care to those who do not have health insurance.
** Monitoring Quality - There are multiple quality organizations in the state of California. Medical Societies police themselves through a combination of licensure, certifcation, and ongoing education. Medical Boards are created as to ensure that standards of care are set and maintained by those who practice within that specialty. In addition, their are [http://www.chcf.org/topics/index.cfm?topic=CL117 multiple public-private] initiatives within the state to measure, monitor, and report the quality of care within the State. 
** Caring for those with no health insurance - This is an extremely challenging problem as there are more than 45 million people in the United States who do not have health insurance. In California, approximately 7 million people are uninsured. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed for sweeping changes in California's health care system to ensure that all Californians can obtain health care insurance. He presented the [http://gov.ca.gov/pdf/press/Governors_HC_Proposal.pdf outline] of his proposal in February 2007, and later called a special session of the state legislature in the fall of 2007, to debate the proposal. The essential concept is that we must provide insurance to all through a &quot;shared responsibility&quot; which includes taxes to businesses, hospitals, and physicians; some combination of touch credits/vouchers for the uninsured, and an increased public health awareness on prevention and healthy choices.

=='''Requirement 1'''==

:&quot; in a particular country.  The revised 2006 merit badge booklet requires input from the individual scout as this is a subjective question.  An example for the answer is, &quot;I believe a citizen in the world is one who contributes to society in one way or another.&quot;

:''...and what '''you''' think it takes to be a good world citizen.''
This is also a subjective question that requires the individual scout put in his opinions.  An example for this part is, &quot;I believe a good world citizen is one who contributes effort to strive for the good of his/her fellow citizens.&quot;

=='''Requirement 2'''==


:'''''2A)''''' ''Explain how one becomes a citizen in the United States...

One can become an American citizen in various ways.  The 2005 BSA &quot;Citizenship in the World&quot; handbook points these out:
1) &quot;By blood if born to parents who are already citizens of [The United States]&quot;
&quot;By soil if born within the legal borders of a nation&quot;
 -&quot;Through naturalization&quot; (in which the person must meet certain requirements which can be found [http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/natz/index.htm here])
 -&quot;Through naturalization of parents&quot;

:'''''2B)''''' ''...and explain the rights, duties, and obligations of U.S. citizenship.


American citizens have a number of rights, such as freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, due process, religion, against quartering soldiers, and against double jeopardy (most of these rights also apply to non-citizens) and are also taxed in order to provide money for essential services.  Other duties of American citizens might include obeying laws and voting. Obligations are those elements of citizenship which are required under the law, for example, the obligation to obey the law.

:'''''2C)''''' ''Discuss the SIMILARITIES and DIFFERENCES between the rights, duties, and obligations of U.S. citizens and of two other countries.''

A U.S. citizens' rights, duties, and obligations are briefly explained in subsection 2B.  Here are examples of how they are similar from those of Chinese and Irish citizens' rights, duties, and obligations in the following manner:
 -Both Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens have the obligation to receive education.
 -Both Chinese citizens and U.S. citizens have the duty to get a Visa to travel to other countries.
 -Both Irish citizens and U.S. citizens have the right to vote.
 -Both Irish citizens and U.S. citizens have the duty to serve on a jury when called upon.

=='''Requirement 3'''==
''Do the following:''

:'''''A)''' pick a current world event.  In relation to this current event, discuss with your counselor how a country's national interest and its relationship with other countries might affect areas such as its security, its economy, its values, and the health of its citizens.
 
:'''''B)''' Select a foreign country and discuss with your counselor how its geography, natural resources, and climate influence its economy and its global partnerships with other countries. 

After World War 1, Germany's economy was hard struck by the effects of the Treaty of Versailles, leading to a national sense of bitterness towards countries like France and the United Kingdom, which help set the stage for World War 2, when Germany invaded many of its neighbors. After World War 2, Japan adopted a constitution that does not allow the creation of a military force, hampering the country's ability to help in military operations with the United Nations and allies like the United States. In the run-up to the 2003 occupation of Iraq, many American commentators expressed bitterness over France's refusal to support the invasion. Many perceived a lack of gratitude for American aid during World War 2, while France's defenders pointed out that country's aid during the American War for Independence. Culture includes a society's language, religion, lifestyle, clothing, decor and many other aspects. Cultural splits within countries sometimes lead to strife because different parts of the country have different interests. The American Civil War is an example of a country torn apart by the opposing interests of culturally distinct regions.

More recently, religious animosity has led to violence and chaos in many Middle-Eastern countries, especially Israel. The creation of Israel was prompted by fears of anti-Semitism leading to a repeat of the attempted genocide of the Jews during the Holocaust, and Israel's foreign relations have long been affected by fears of anti-Semitism harming Jews abroad. Conflicts over religion, geography, ethnicity and other issues have spread in different countries has caused strife and war. For example, the Kurds live in several countries, including Iraq and Turkey, the latter a key US ally in the region. With Kurdish leaders calling for an independent Kurdistan, the US was torn between supporting its Kurdish allies and the Turkish government, which believed that any independence for Iraqi Kurds could spur a revival of similar hopes among Turkish Kurds. Nationalism plays an important role in this phenomenon, which has also included calls for a Greater Somalia, a view that has twice led to war with Ethiopia over the Somali Ogaden region, and Greater Serbia|, a motivation for the Kosovo War. Demographics are the make-up of a country. Some countries have a very young population, such as Zambia, while others have a large elderly population, such as Sweden. Some countries are made up nearly entirely of one ethnic group speaking a single language, such as Iceland, while others are a melting pot of dozens or hundreds of ethnic groups, such as many of the equatorial African countries like the Republic of the Congo.

Demographic conflict has long been a source of strife on the diverse continent of Africa. In South Africa, for example, a white minority long controlled a huge black majority (Apartheid), eventually straining relations with countries like the United States, which imposed an embargo as a result. Ethnically diverse states such as most of the Sub-Saharan African countries were created from European colonies in the region, which had no basis in rational geographic or cultural boundaries. As a result, many of the earliest leaders in these countries pursued as a high priority the formation of a national identity; this occurred in nations across Africa, including Zambia and Sudan. In the rush to create a distinctive culture, minorities and dissenters were often marginalized or oppressed, leading to revolutions and civil strife. Politics can occur within a single country or among countries. Activities involving the internal political landscape of a country can have an affect on national interests and foreign relations through the election or installment of leaders who enact foreign policy, while laws passed by a particular country may have an affect on the economy of a different country.

Internal conflicts between political blocs of capitalists and socialists led to a polarization of international relations. Countries like the United States, France and Italy jockeyed for power with the Soviet Union and satellites in newly-independent countries across Africa, South America and Asia (see The Cold War). Following the internationally divisive US-led occupation of Iraq in 2003, foreign countries around the world were forced to pay close attention to the American political landscape. Some, like Israel, were supportive of the conservative right, while others, like France, supported the liberal left.

The national interests of a country are often very complex, and hinge on multiple factors involving geography, natural resources and climate, as well as social values, security issues and concerns regarding foreign countries.

Geography can affect a country's national resources through several ways. A country's shape can dictate its national interest.

Nearly all countries have some kind of natural resources. It is always in the best interest of the producers of a product (for example oil) to keep prices and demand high.

Because all countries need food and water, climate is extremely important. Without adequate rain, for example, agriculture can not occur and food will have to be imported and this can make a country's economy fall. Weather can also have debilitating effects on trade, both within and outside the boundaries of country.

Below are two links to additional information.  They will provide informative graphs that had answered the previous question 4, which is worded exactly as the current question 3b.

=='''Requirement 4'''==
''Do TWO of the following:''
:'''''A)'''Explain international law and how it differs from national law.  Explain the role of international law and how international law can be used as a tool for conflict resolution''
A state is ordinarily said to be sovereign - i.e. capable of enforcing its own laws on its own territory, and only on its own territory (for example, American laws do not apply in France, even if the people involved are all American). International law is a relatively recent invention, and concerns agreements between countries in pacts called treaties. International law can enforce standards (such as standardized weights and measures for the purposes of trade) and proscribe conduct according to treaties concerning human rights. With international organizations enforcing these treaties, often ineffectively, but also often with great success, countries whose governments ignore human rights treaties can be dealt with by multi-national alliances, which are perceived as having more legitimacy if a broken human rights treaty can be blamed.

:'''''B)''' Using resources such as major daily newspapers, the Internet (with your parent's permission), and news magazines, observe a current issue that involves international trade, foreign exchange, balance of payments, tariffs, and free trade.  Explain what you have learned.  Include in your discussion an explanation of why countries must cooperate in order for world trade and global competition to thrive.''This option requires the scout to do independent research.

:'''''C)''' Select TWO of the following organizations and describe their role in the world.''
''  
* The United Nations- is an international organization whose stated aims are facilitating cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achievement of world peace.
* The World Court- is the primary judicial organ of the United Nations. It is based in the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. Its main functions are to settle legal disputes submitted to it by states and to provide advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by duly authorized international organs, agencies, and the UN General Assembly.
* World Organization of the Scout Movement-The mission of WOSM is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Scout Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. World Organization of the Scout Movement is organized into regions and operates with a conference, committee and bureau.
* The World Health Organization-providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
shaping the research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge;
setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
articulating ethical and evidence-based policy options;
providing technical support, catalysing change, and building sustainable institutional capacity; and
monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.
* Amnesty International- is a non-governmental organisation focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. The objective of the organisation is &quot;to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.&quot;
* The International Red Cross- is an international humanitarian movement with approximately 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide which was founded to protect human life and health, to ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering, without any discrimination based on nationality, race, sex, religious beliefs, class or political opinions.
* CARE-It helps with health with almost all of the countries.

=='''Requirement 5'''==
''Do the following:''
:'''''A)''' Discuss the differences between constitutional and nonconstitutional governments.''
Constitutional governments have a written document stating their laws, rights and responsibilities. It must also be limited in power, follow a higher law, and have constitutional stability.
Nonconstitutional governments are dictatorships and absolute monarchies. These are hard on the citizens because they don't have many rights. Totalitarian and authoritarian are the two types of nonconstitutional governments. In an authoritarian government, the power to make decisions is in the hands of one person or a small group. Totalitarian government is another form of authoritarian in which the government controls every aspect of society.
:'''''B)''' Name at least five different types of governments currently in power in the world.''
United States- Federal republic''',''' Representative democracy(democratic republic)''',''' 
Canada- Federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy''','''
Spain- Parliamentary monarchy''','''
Poland- Republic''','''
Libya- People's Congress''','''
North Korea- Single-party state''','''
Brazil- Democratic federal republic''','''
Niger- Parliamentary democracy'''.'''
:'''''C)''' Show on a world map countries that use each of these five different forms of government.''

=='''Requirement 6'''==

''Do the Following'':

:'''''A)''' Explain how a government is represented abroad and how the United States government is accredited to international organizations.''
A government is represented abroad by an ambassador or a consul.  The United States government is accredited to international organizations based on the requirements of each individual organization. For example, here are the requirements for the [http://www.un.org/en/members/about.shtml United Nations]

:'''''B)''' Describe the roles of the following in the conduct of foreign relations:''

'''Ambassador''': a diplomatic official of the highest rank, sent by one sovereign or state to another as its resident representative (ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary), usually for a specific length of time. He or she is a diplomatic official heading his or her country's permanent mission to certain international organizations; such as the United Nations; and is an authorized representative of a nation to deliver their nation's messages and protect the national interest of the nation they represent through diplomatic means. 

'''Consul''': an official appointed by the government of one country to look after its commercial interests and the welfare of its citizens in another country, as well as providing assistance to Americans traveling abroad. 

'''Bureau of International Information Programs''': The Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) is the principal international strategic communications service for the foreign affairs community. IIP designs, develops, and implements a variety of information initiatives and strategic communications programs, including Internet and print publications, traveling and electronically transmitted speaker programs, and information resource services. These reach--and are created strictly for--key international audiences, such as the media, government officials, opinion leaders, and the general public in more than 140 countries around the world.

'''U.S Agency for International Development''': The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is the United States federal government agency primarily responsible for administering civilian foreign aid. President John F. Kennedy created USAID in 1961 by executive order to implement development assistance programs in the areas authorized by the Congress in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. An independent federal agency, USAID receives overall foreign policy guidance from the United States Secretary of State  and seeks to &quot;extend a helping hand to those people overseas struggling to make a better life, recover from a disaster or striving to live in a free and democratic country.

'''United States and Foreign Commercial Service''': The U.S. Commercial Service (CS), the trade promotion arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration, helps U.S. companies succeed in markets around the world. Led by Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General Suresh Kumar and located across the United States and in U.S. Embassies and Consulates in nearly 80 countries, the CS global network of trade professionals helps thousands of U.S. companies to export goods and services worth billions of dollars every year.
 

:'''''C)''' Explain the purpose of a passport and visa for international travel.''
A passport is an official document issued to a citizen by a government affirming the individual’s nationality. The passport permits the citizen to travel or live abroad and entitles the citizen to privileges guaranteed by international custom and treaties: safe passage, lawful aid, and protection while under the foreign government’s jurisdiction. A visa is a permit to enter another country and must be issued by the country one wishes to enter. It is a special seal stamped on a valid passport that indicates an official of that country has approved the visit. Prior to leaving, the traveler should apply for a visa-if required by that particular country-at the appropriate foreign embassy or nearest consulate. A foreign national wishing to enter the United States must apply for a visa outside the United States at embassies and consulates worldwide. An immigrant visa permits a person to stay in the United States permanently. A non-immigrant visa allows a foreign national to enter the country for a temporary stay. Tourists, temporary workers, missionaries, business professionals, artists, and athletes travel on temporary visas.

=='''Requirement 7'''==

[[Image:Salt - close-up.jpg|thumb|right|Close-up image of salt crystals]]
'''Salt''', or sodium chloride, is a mineral, one of the few that people eat. Saltiness is one of the basic flavors perceived by our taste buds, along with sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. Salt is required for life, but overconsumption can increase the risk of health problems, including high blood pressure. Salt can be reduced by 20% to 45% without compromising taste if a small amount of [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]] is added to the food. Salt is also used to preserve food.

==History==

Salt has a long, varied, and sometimes violent history. It has been a highly valued trade item throughout history. Wars have been fought over it, states formed and destroyed because of it. During the late Roman Empire era and throughout the Middle Ages, salt was a precious commodity carried along the &quot;Salt Roads&quot; into the heartland of the Germanic tribes. Cites, states and dukedoms along the salt roads exacted heavy duties and taxes for the salt passing through their territories. This practice has caused wars, and it even started the formation of cities, such as the city of Munich in 1158 when the then-duke of Bavaria, Henry II, decided that the bishops of Freising no longer needed their salt revenue.

==Types of salt==

For the most part, the various grades of salt are all the same; chemically most are greater than 99% sodium chloride, but the structure varies widely.  

*Simple '''table salt''' consists of small, compact cubic grains, usually with iodine added .

*'''Kosher salt''' has a much more irregular structure, no iodine, and a larger surface area. Chefs prefer it for some dishes because of its texture and a seemingly &quot;cleaner&quot; taste from being without iodine.. The name comes its role in &quot;koshering&quot; meat: preparing it in accordance with Jewish dietary law (''kosher'').

*'''Popcorn salt'''/Canning and pickling is ground salt that dissolves very quickly and able to dissolve in cold fluid.  

*'''Rock salt''' is large chunks of sodium chloride. 

These differences in structure can cause a significant change in the perceived flavor of the salt and its usefulness for particular recipes.  The speed with which it dissolves is also very important, with finer salts such as [[Cookbook:Pickling salt|pickling salt]] even dissolving readily in cold liquid.

Table salt also contains anti-caking agents to allow it to flow freely, and sometimes contains very small amounts of iodine.

Sea salt, which is made from evaporating seawater, also varies considerably.  Because there are impurities in the water, each sea salt has a unique taste and is prized in different cuisines or for different applications.  Sea salts often tend to cost considerably more than other kinds of salt; however, in areas with large seawater evaporation industries (such as California) the &quot;table salt&quot; in local stores may actually be sea salt.

==Production==

Salt comes from two sources, mining natural halite deposits and evaporation of seawater.

==Uses==

Salt has many uses in cooking beyond simple flavoring.  Its chief utility lies in its osmotic properties. Salting the surface of food draws out water and anything dissolved in it.  When meat is koshered, it is heavily salted to draw out any remaining blood.  Kosher salt, because of its structure, is perfectly suited to this task.  This technique is also applied to eggplant to remove bitter flavors and alter the texture of the plant, and also when sweating aromatic ingredients such as onion or garlic over low heat to draw out their moistures and soften them.

Salt is frequently used in [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented foods]], both for drawing the liquids out of vegetables and to inhibit the activity of undesirable bacteria. It is generally recommended that non-iodised salt be used for fermenting, because iodine is an effective antibacterial substance and can thus inhibit the fermentation a little. Iodised salt will work in a ferment, but it is better to use a non-iodised salt like pickling salt or kosher salt.

Salt also tends to enhance our perception of other flavors, particularly that of sweetness.  This explains its use in ice cream, for example, or kettle corn.  Most candy recipes have a small amount of salt which cannot be directly detected, but has a noticeable effect on the final result. This is because salt lands on the taste buds and sort of opens them up for other flavors

Salt's thermal properties are useful in a few applications, notably in home-made ice cream.  The action of rock salt dissolving in ice water makes a solution colder than ice itself..  Ice cream makers, then, sit the salt-and-ice mixture in an insulated container, and inside that is placed a highly conductive container of the cream mixture, which freezes rapidly.

Salt can be used to &quot;fry&quot; food as well.  Large amounts of rock salt are heated in an oven to temperature (varies, generally about 400°F or 200°C).  After the salt gets hot, the food is placed in the salt and an additional layer of pre-heated salt is poured on top.  This method is an extremely fast way to get heat into food, second only to [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep frying]], consequently, cooking times will be very short.

When salt is added to boiling water for pasta or potatoes, the temperature of the water can rise by a very slight amount (less than a degree).  The main effect is flavoring.  However, you are salting the water, not directly salting the food.  Thus the amount of salt should vary according to the amount of water; quite a bit is usually required.

Lastly, salt is of course used as a direct flavoring.  Ordinary table salt is most often used for this purpose; it brings out the taste of the other ingredients and has added iodine which prevents goiter. Many gourmets, however, prefer uniodized coarse salt because they have a sort of &quot;cleaner&quot; taste. Sea salt also has a potential to have health benefits that other salts lack because of the minerals and whatnot in the ocean.

==Use of numerals in context==

In English (and in many other Indo-European languages) the items being counted by a numeral are found following the numeral, and in the plural form.  In Russian, the syntax is somewhat more complex.  The case of the item must first be considered.  If the item needs to be in the nominative or inanimate accusative case, use the following rule.  

The numeral один (1) should be used in the proper form to indicate gender (and, number, believe it or not).  For example: один мальчик (one boy), одна девушка (one girl), одно животное (one animal), одни джинсы (one [pair of] jeans).  The plural form of the numeral (1) is a bit of an oddity, but its use will become clear with time.  Following a form of один should come the item at hand in the nominative or inanimate accusative case, as appropriate.

The numerals два (or две), три, and четыре all require the following item to be presented in the genitive singular form.  The numeral два has two forms: два for masculine and neuter items and две for feminine items.  After the numeral два, each numeral has only a single form.  See for example:  две девушки (two girls), три кошки (three cats), четыре мальчика (four boys).  

The numerals пять (5) through двадцать (20) require their attached items in the genitive plural forms, as in these examples:  пять девушек (five girls), десять копеек (ten kopeks), шестнадцать рублей (sixteen rubles).  

Numerals larger than twenty follow the above rules using the last digit.  Think of numerals ending in zero as ending in ten.  For example:  тридцать три рюмки (thirty-three shot glasses), сорок один год (forty-one years), шестьдесят девять слов (sixty-nine words).  

Numerals larger than 99 follow the above rules using the last two digits. For example: двести три собаки (two hundred and three dogs), двести тринадцать собак (two hundred and thirteen dogs).

When the items at hand belong not in the nominative or inanimate accusative case, the numerals themselves must be declined in addition to the declension of the items following them.  This topic shall be discussed here later.  For now, be glad that these forms are relatively uncommon.  Examples follow:  Я видел двух друзей (I saw two friends), Ты не съела ни одной штуки (You didn't eat a single piece).

In short, for nominative (and inanimate accusative) items, use the following rule to select the proper form of the item:

1 -&gt; nominative

2, 3, 4 -&gt; genitive singular

5 and more -&gt; genitive plural

===A few more examples===
* один час
* два часа
* пять часов 
* двадцать один час
* двадцать два часа
* двадцать три часа
* двадцать четыре часа

* один год
* два года
* три года
* четыре года
* пять лет
* пятьдесят один год
* пятьдесят два года
* пятьдесят пять лет
    
* одна минута
* две минуты
* три минуты
* четыре минуты
* пять минут
* шесть минут
* двадцать одна минута
* тридцать две минуты
* тридцать три минуты
* сорок пять минут

==Ordinal numbers==

Ordinal numerals in Russian are relatively easy to deal with.  They all decline like adjectives.  For example: Только что фотографировала восемнадцатую девушку (She just photographed the eighteenth girl).

# п'''е'''рвый, п'''е'''рвая, п'''е'''рвое
# втор'''о'''й, втор'''а'''я, втор'''о'''е
# тр'''е'''тий, тр'''е'''тья, тр'''е'''тье
# четв'''ё'''ртый
# п'''я'''тый
# шест'''о'''й
# седьм'''о'''й
# восьм'''о'''й
# дев'''я'''тый
# дес'''я'''тый
# од'''и'''ннадцатый
# двен'''а'''дцатый
# трин'''а'''дцатый
# чет'''ы'''рнадцатый
# пятн'''а'''дцатый
# шестн'''а'''дцатый
# семн'''а'''дцатый
# восемн'''а'''дцатый
# девятн'''а'''дцатый
# двадц'''а'''тый
# дв'''а'''дцать п'''е'''рвый
# дв'''а'''дцать втор'''о'''й
30th тридц'''а'''тый &lt;br&gt;
40th сороков'''о'''й &lt;br&gt;
100th с'''о'''тый &lt;br&gt;
1000th т'''ы'''сячный&lt;br&gt;
10000th десятит'''ы'''сячный&lt;br&gt;
1000000th милли'''о'''нный&lt;br&gt;

The category of '''side dishes''' is a somewhat general '''super-category''' in any cookbook.  

One might best define a side dish in terms of the way it is served for a particular meal, as being:  

*“A medium-size portion of any primarily vegetable dish (including, for certainty, all grains and starches), which is served on the same plate with, or in a dish alongside, the main dish, that is not intended to be the main dish or a co-equal of the main dish, and, if in a separate dish, is not intended to be some other course, such as an appetizer or a dessert.  The serving size of a side dish is larger than that of a mere accent item or condiment.”  

In other words, the definition of a side dish is primarily based on what the item is intended to be, and is served as, taken in context.

For a complete, automatically generated,  alphabetical list of pages which have been categorized, on their individual pages, as being a side dish see: [[:Category:Side dish recipes|Side dish recipes]].

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called COMPATT. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name COMPATT~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

'''Beef''' is meat obtained from a bull, steer (castrated bull), or cow.
Beef is one of the more common meats used in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] and [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North American]] cuisine. Beef is an important part of [[Cookbook:Tex-Mex cuisine|Tex-Mex cuisine]].  Beef is also important in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Argentina|Argentina]].

There are two different beef production methods. In some parts of the world (eg. Australia and South America), the beef cattle self-feed on grass and weeds while roaming around. This produces beef with the [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] deposits on the outsides of the beef cuts where they can be removed before cooking for [[Cookbook:Eating for Health|healthful eating]].

In the USA and some other countries, 'feedlot' beef is much more common. These animals are confined to a small stockyard and fed primarily on grain. Feedlot animals produce beef which is tender, mild flavored, and marbled with large amounts of fat. The USDA beef rating system encourages beef with high ammounts of intramuscular fat by giving high scores to beef that is highly marbled. From least marbled to most marbled, the grades are: standard, select, choice, and prime. For example, the lean part of a 3&amp;nbsp;[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] eye of round with 1/4&amp;nbsp;[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] trim will have 3&amp;nbsp;[[Cookbook:g|g]] of fat if it is USDA Select, but 5&amp;nbsp;g of fat if it is USDA Choice. Subdivisions have recently been added; a &quot;-&quot; indicates a a cut with less marbling while a &quot;+&quot; indicates a more marbling. The letter grades refer to age of the animal, with &quot;A&quot; being for the youngest animals.

There is a special kind of beef produced in Japan called [[w:Kobe beef|Kobe beef]], which goes a step beyond feedlot production. Beef cattle of the [[w:Wagyu|Wagyu]] breed are hand-raised, fed on a diet of beer and the &quot;highest&quot; quality grain, and given regular massages. This produces super-tender beef. Kobe beef sells at a premium price because of the higher costs of feed and production. The meat has lots of fat, containing more unsaturated fat than most beef.

Beef is carved into several sections, called cuts, which can be further divided into steaks, pot roasts, short ribs, and ground into hamburger. Beef heart is somewhat springy. Other beef variety meats include the tongue, tripe from the stomach, various glands—particularly the pancreas and thyroid—referred to as sweetbreads, the brain, the liver, the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull commonly known as &quot;calf fries&quot;, &quot;prairie oysters&quot;, or &quot;Rocky Mountain oysters.&quot;

Several Asian and European nationalities include the [[Cookbook:Blood|blood]] in their cuisine --  the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|British]] use it to make &quot;black pudding&quot;, and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Philippines|Filipinos]] use it to make a stew called [[Cookbook:Dinuguan|dinuguan]].  Other beef foods include the [[Cookbook:Tongue|tongue]], which is usually sliced for sandwiches; [[Cookbook:Tripe|tripe]] from the stomach; the thymus glands of calves known as [[Cookbook:Sweetbread|sweetbread]]; the tender testicles of the bull, commonly known as beef balls or [[Cookbook:Sweetmeat|sweetmeat]]; the brain, used in the fried brain sandwich; the [[Cookbook:Liver|liver]], used in [[Cookbook:Liver and onions|liver and onions]]; [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|and so on]].

[[Image:Witte_kool.jpg|thumb|right|200px|cabbage]]

The '''cabbage''' (''Brassica oleracea var. capitata'') is an edible plant of the family Brassicaceae (or Cruciferae, the cruciform vegetables).

The cabbage head was bred into the species from the leafy wild plant, found in the Mediterranean region around 100 CE. The English name derives from the French ''caboche'' (head). Varieties include red cabbage, savoy cabbage, and [[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|nappa cabbage (Chinese leaves)]].

Cabbages are commonly used both cooked and as a [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] vegetable. They keep well and were thus a common winter vegetable before refrigeration and long-distance shipping of produce. [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|Sauerkraut]] is a fermented cabbage often used as a condiment or side dish.

==Preparation and Cooking==
Like all [[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassicas]], cabbage is a potentially smelly vegetable that needs to be handled with care to avoid creating unpleasant lingering odours in the cooking space. There are two ideal ways to cook cabbage - either very quickly (or not at all), or in a slow-cooked flavoursome dish.

Cabbage tastes good [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] and served with vinegar on it. Cabbage can be [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]], [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]], [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanched]], or even stuffed and [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cereal}}

An ingredient used in many foods, '''flour''' is a fine powder made from [[Cookbook:Cereal Grain|cereal grain]] or other starchy food sources. It is most commonly made from [[Cookbook:Wheat|wheat]], but also [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], [[Cookbook:Rye|rye]], [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]] and [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], amongst many other grasses and even non-grain plants.

Flour is always based on the presence of starches, which are complex [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]].

Usually, the word &quot;flour&quot; used alone refers to wheat flour, which is one of the most important foods in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|American]] culture.  Wheat flour is the main ingredient in most types of [[Cookbook:Bread|breads]] and pastries.  Wheat is so widely used because of an important property:  when wheat flour is mixed with water, a complex protein called gluten develops.  The gluten development is what gives wheat dough an elastic structure that allows it to be worked in a variety of ways, and which allows the retention of gas bubbles in an intact structure, resulting in a sponge-like texture to the final product.

==Types of Flours==

===Wheat Flour===

The vast majority of today's flour consumption is of wheat flour.

Wheat varieties are typically known as '''&quot;hard&quot;''' or '''&quot;soft&quot;''', depending on gluten content.  Hard wheats are high in gluten, and soft wheats are low.  Hard flour, or &quot;bread&quot; flour, is high in gluten and so forms a certain toughness which holds its shape well once baked.  Soft flour is low in gluten and so results in a finer texture.  Soft flour is usually divided into &quot;cake&quot; flour, which is the lowest in gluten, and &quot;pastry&quot; flour, which has slightly more gluten than cake flour.

In terms of the parts of the grain (the grass seed) used in flour -- the endosperm or starchy part, the oil-containing germ or protein part, and the bran or fiber part -- there are three general types of flour.  &quot;White&quot; flour is made from the endosperm only.  &quot;Whole wheat&quot; flour is made from the entire grain.  A &quot;germ&quot; flour may also be made from the endosperm and germ, excluding the bran. The germ is sometimes sold by itself, as &quot;wheatgerm&quot;.

*[[Cookbook:Whole Wheat Flour|'''Whole wheat flour''']] (or wholemeal flour) is ground from the entire wheat kernel, including the germ and the bran. 

*[[Cookbook:Graham Flour|'''Graham flour''']] is a white flour with coarsely ground bran and wheatgerm mixed back in. It thus contains all three parts of the wheat kernel as whole wheat flour does, but it has a different texture.

*[[Cookbook:Cake Flour|'''Cake flour''']], is a milled, bleached flour containing a low amount of gluten (around 7%), and therefore bakes with a fine texture.

*[[Cookbook:Pastry Flour|'''Pastry flour''']] is slightly stronger (higher in gluten) than cake flour.

* '''All-purpose flour''', (known as plain flour in Europe) is a blended white flour containing a medium amount of gluten (around 10%).

*[[Cookbook:Maida|'''Maida''']] is a super-refined white flour used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]].

*[[Cookbook:Flour|'''Self-rising flour''']] (also called &quot;Self-raising flour&quot;) is an all-purpose flour that has a [[Cookbook:Leavening Agent|leavening agent]] blended into it for convenience.

===Flours from other cereals===

*Corn flour is an ambiguous term that can mean [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] or finely ground [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]]. Cornmeal which has been leached with lye is called [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|corn masa]] (''masa harina'') and is used to make [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamales]] and [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn tortillas]] in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican cooking]].

*[[Cookbook:Atta|Atta]] is a popular flour used in [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]], and is made by grinding whole wheat. 

*100% [[Cookbook:Rye|rye flour]] is used to bake the traditional sourdough breads of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germany]] and Scandinavia.

*[[Cookbook:Rice Flour|Rice flour]] is of great importance in [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-east Asian cuisines]].

*[[Cookbook:Sorghum|Sorghum flour]] (jowar) is used in many parts of [[Cookbook:African cuisines|Africa]] and [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]].

*[[Cookbook:Spelt|Spelt]] flour is an alternative to wheat flour. Note: although some people with wheat allergies can tolerate spelt, other wheat-allergic patients have adverse reactions to spelt flour as well. Spelt also has less [[Cookbook:Gluten|gluten]] than wheat, but it is '''not''' [[Cookbook:Gluten-Free|gluten-free]].

*Other grains (cereal and non-cereal) ground into flours include [[Cookbook:Amaranth|amaranth]], [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]], [[Cookbook:Buckwheat|buckwheat]], [[Cookbook:Millet|millet]], [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]], [[Cookbook:Quinoa|quinoa]], [[Cookbook:Teff|teff]], and [[Cookbook:Triticale|triticale]].

===Flours Made of Legumes, Tubers, Pulses, Etc.===
*[[Cookbook:Chickpea Flour|Chickpea flour]] (besan) is of great importance in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian cuisine]]. Some other [[Cookbook:Legumes|legumes]] ground for flour include [[Cookbook:Soy|soybeans]], [[Cookbook:Mung Bean|mung beans]], [[Cookbook:Pea|yellow peas]], [[Cookbook:Urad Dal|urad dal]], and [[Cookbook:Fava Bean|fava beans]].

*Flour can also be made from various various roots and tubers, including [[Cookbook:Arrowroot|arrowroot]], [[Cookbook:Cassava|cassava]] (manioc, tapioca), [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Taro Root|taro root]]; and other non-grain foodstuffs.

===Flours Made of Nuts===
*[[Cookbook:Almond Flour|Almond Flour]] Finely ground almonds (much finer than almond meal) is a flour sometimes used in cooking
*[[Cookbook:Coconut Flour|Coconut Flour]] Used often in gluten free cooking, coconut flour is considered a healthier alternative to wheat or grain flours

*Flour may also be made from most nuts using a food processor, including [[Cookbook:Brazil nut|Brazil nut]], [[Cookbook:Cashew|Cashew]], [[Cookbook:Pistachio|Pistachios]], [[Cookbook:Macadamia|Macadamias]]

===Fruit Flours===
*[[Cookbook:Banana Flour|Banana Flour]] A seldom produced flour made from bananas, Banana flour contains resistant starch and is currently only produced by Mt Uncle in Australia, also the process in which they produce the product is not disclosed.

==Flour Products==

== Saudi Arabia map ==

The map of Saudi Arabia should be from the WikiCommons.

== Merit Badge Update ==

This merit badge was updated this year.  The requirements should change to reflect the recent changes.

== Don't merge this. ==

Please, don't merge the Family Life MB with this so as not to confuse the two together. [[User:LaughingReaper|LaughingReaper]] ([[User talk:LaughingReaper|talk]]) 01:59, 1 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Onion.jpg|right|thumb|Onions]]

'''Onion''' in the general sense can be used for any plant in the genus ''Allium'' but used without qualifiers usually means ''Allium cepa'', also called the '''garden onion'''. Onions (usually but not exclusively the bulbs) are edible with a distinctive strong flavour and pungent odour which is mellowed by cooking. They generally have a papery outer skin over a fleshy, layered inner core. Used worldwide for culinary purposes, they come in a wide variety of forms and colors (but generally brown, white or purple). 

The common brown onion tends to have a very pungent odour, and it makes the eyes water. Some varieties have more or less of the eye-watering chemicals, which also makes them taste milder. 'Spanish onions' (the large white onions with a purple skin and purple flecks) are much milder than brown onions, making them more suitable for raw use in salads. 

Onions may be grown from seed or very commonly from &quot;sets&quot;.  Onion sets are produced by sowing seed very thickly one year, resulting in stunted plants which produce very small bulbs.  These bulbs are very easy to set out and grow into mature bulbs the following year, but they have the reputation of producing a less durable bulb than onions grown directly from seed and thinned. 

Either planting method may be used to produce [[Cookbook:Spring Onion|spring onions]] or green onions, which are just onions harvested while immature, although &quot;green onion&quot; is also a common name for the '''welsh onion''', ''Allium fistulosum'' which never produces dry bulbs and the 'Spring onions' used in Asian cooking are an entirely different variety which never grows a full bulb.

== Preparing ==
[[Image:Red onion, half.jpg|thumb|A red onion cut in half]]

Onions may be either served raw or cooked.  Cutting onions can be a harrowing experience and often bring tears to the eyes.  Folklore says that burning a candle close to the cutting board may decrease the pain. Also, refrigerating onions for an hour or so beforehand will reduce crying and discomfort when cutting.

Onions have a pungent aroma. To remove the smell from hands simply rub hands on the surface of a stainless steel sink and rinse well. White vinegar can also be used to rinse hands, cutting boards, and other utensils to eliminate the onion smell. 

Red onions have a milder flavor and may be safely added raw to dishes, most typically salads.

White and brown onions are best cooked.  Boiling an onion only creates a bitter flavor, unless steps are taken to reverse the bitterness (boiling in salty water may help).  Typically, onions are fried, usually in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] in a [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] or [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]]. The time for which onions are fried before other ingredients are added varies in different cuisines; in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]], onions are typically fried until transluscent, while in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] recipes, they are fried on a low heat until they are caramelized and turn brown, which produces a different flavour.  It's best to fry onions with like vegetables -- [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Leek|leeks]], or [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallions]].  Cooking with acidic vegetables (e.g., [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillos]], or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]) will disrupt the carmelization process and the onion will never soften.  It's best to add acidic vegetables or [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] (for deglazing) after the onions are soft.

== Related species ==

The genus ''Allium'' is a large one, and most of the species are considered to be &quot;onions&quot; in the looser sense.  Commonly raised vegetable alliums include the [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]]s, [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], [[Cookbook:Elephant garlic|elephant garlic]], [[Cookbook:Chives|chives]], [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]s, [[Cookbook:Welsh onion|welsh onion]]s and [[Cookbook:Garlic chives|garlic chives]].

The [[Cookbook:Wild onion|wild onion]] (allium ursinum) is collected in the wild, its leaves and bulbs used as food.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yes, [[Wiktionary:Vietnamization|Vietnamization]] has to do with the [[w:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]], but that's not what it means in this case.

With the dawn of television, computers, and the Internet, the use of words that originated with English has increased greatly. This has both increased the importance of English and diminished the importance of other languages. For other languages to keep up, their speakers have to come up with practical translations or transliterations. For Vietnamese, these translations and transliterations are called Vietnamizations. We'll take a look at:

*how to pronounce English words the way Vietnamese speakers would understand them,
*how to &quot;Vietnamize&quot; English words, and
*commonly Vietnamized words

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{meat}} | [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|Basic foodstuffs]]

'''Pork''' is the meat from hogs, or domestic swine. The domestication of &quot;pigs&quot; (immature hogs) for food dates back to about 7000 B.C. in the Middle East. However, evidence shows that Stone Age man ate wild boar, the hog's ancestor, and the earliest surviving pork recipe is [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]], at least 2000-years old. While it is one of the most common meats eaten by the Chinese and Europeans, it is considered inedible under Islamic and Orthodox Jewish law.

==Retail Cuts of Fresh Pork==

There are four basic (primal) cuts into which pork is separated: shoulder, loin, side and leg.

===Shoulder===

* Shoulder Butt, Roast or Steak
* Blade Steak
* Boneless Blade Boston Roast
* Smoked Arm Picnic
* Smoked Hock
* Ground Pork for [[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]]

===Side===

* [[Cookbook:Barbecued_Spare_Ribs|Spare Ribs]]
* Back Ribs
* [[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]]

===Loin===

* Boneless Whole Loin (Butterfly Chop)
* Loin Roast
* Tenderloin
* Sirloin Roast
* Country Style Ribs
* Chops

===Leg===

* [[Cookbook:Ham|Ham]]/Fresh or Smoked and Cured

Other parts include pigs' feet (what these are called differs between the United States and Great Britain; in the United States only the front feet are used, and the entire front foot [ankle and foot] is called the ''hock'', while in Great Britain both the front and back feet are used, and only the ankle is called the hock, the foot proper being termed the ''trotters''.)  Sausage is often made from miscellaneous meats, and scrapple is another aggregate meat-food derived from pigs.  Pork intestines are called chitterlings or chitlings.
Some pork products, such as pigs' feet, hog jowls, and other parts, not wanted by whites, figured prominently in the traditional diets of southern African-Americans because they were a) available to them and b) affordable for the very poor.

Pork products are often cured by [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] ([[Cookbook:Pickling|pickling]]) and [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoking]]. The portion most often given this treatment is the ham; pork shoulder, or front haunch, is also sometimes cured in this manner.

==Safety considerations==
===Microorganisms===
Pork must be adequately cooked to eliminate disease-causing parasites and bacteria that may be present. Humans may contract trichinosis (caused by the parasite, ''Trichinella spiralis'') by eating undercooked pork. Much progress has been made in reducing trichinosis in grain-fed hogs and human cases have greatly declined since 1950. Today's pork can be enjoyed when cooked to a medium internal temperature of 145 °F (62 °C) or a well-done internal temperature of 170 °F (76 °C).

Some other foodborne micro-organisms that can be found in pork, as well as other meats and poultry, are ''Escherichia coli'', ''Salmonella'', ''Staphylococcus aureus'' and ''Listeria monocytogenes''. They are all destroyed by proper handling and thorough cooking to an internal temperature of 145 °F (62 °C).

===Hot Fat===
Additionally, pork contains fats, when cooked the fats partially liquefy.  These rendered fats are flammable.  Water drops coming in contact with hot grease or fat may cause splattering and possible burns.  Appropriate fire and personal safety measures should be taken when cooking pork or any other fatty meat.

==Other varieties==

==Pork Recipes==

{{wikipedia|butter}}
[[Image:Buttered crumpet2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|buttered crumpet]]
[[Image:NCI_butter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1/4 lb. stick of butter]]

'''Butter''' is a dairy product made by churning fresh [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]. It consists of an emulsion of water and milk proteins in a matrix of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], with over 80% being fat. It is used as a condiment and for cooking in much the same ways as [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]s or [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]. 

It is solid but soft at room temperature, and melts easily. Its color is generally pale yellow, but can vary from deep yellow to nearly white depending largely on what type of food the animals were eating. (Butter is typically paler in the winter, for example, when dairy cattle feed on stored hay rather than fresh grass).

It is easy to make your own butter in small batches and often worthwhile when serving butter on the table, such as with fresh bread.  Take a small clean jar with a tight-fitting lid, and pour in heavy cream or whipping cream, no more than one third full.  Shake the jar until you can feel or hear that a solid mass has formed.  If the cream becomes too thick to shake easily, add a bit of water. Pour off the liquid and use a spatula or spoon to collect the butter.  This soft whipped butter can be served on its own, or mixed with herbs or spices.  You can also add flavor by pouring a small measure of flavored liquor in with the cream.

==Regional variations==

===Australia===

In Australia both salted and unsalted butter are readily available, and no preservatives, additives or colorings are allowed in standard butter unless they are labeled as a 'spread'.

===Europe===

European butter typically contains 82% to 84% butterfat and comes in salted and unsalted varieties. The greater portion of butterfat makes European butter taste richer than American butter.

===United States===

Butter sold in United States markets is typically 80% to 82% butterfat and salted, unless marked otherwise. Flavorings, colorings, and preservatives may also be added. European style butter, at 82% or greater fat content, is referred to as &quot;dry butter&quot;, and is available in specialty shops.  Salted butter is generally sold in sticks wrapped in wax paper, while unsalted butter is sometimes wrapped in aluminum foil.

===South Asia===

Most often used as [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]], or clarified butter.

Bird and fish '''eggs''' are common food sources. For [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] eggs, see [[Cookbook:Caviar|caviar]]. Reptile eggs, particularly turtle eggs, are sometimes eaten as well. [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]] eggs are standard. [[Cookbook:Duck|Duck]], [[Cookbook:Goose|goose]], [[Cookbook:Quail|quail]], and [[Cookbook:Ostrich|ostrich]] eggs (the largest edible bird eggs in the world) are occasionally used as gourmet ingredients.

Eggs are frequently used to bind other ingredients together, trap air in the food, or create an emulsion. Depending on the intended product, only the [[cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolk]], only the [[cookbook:Egg White|egg white]], or both may be used for preparing a food. In most recipes, a whole egg may be replaced with two egg whites to make a dish lower in [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] and cholesterol.

The primary cooking techniques for eggs are: 

* [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] 
* [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]]

Eggs are a common food allergy.

==Egg sizes==
The &quot;USDA Large&quot; egg is about the same as the &quot;EU size M&quot; egg. (each being the standard choice in the respective locale) So, for normal recipes, it is best to avoid specifying egg size. USDA eggs are specified as the minimum weight of a dozen. EU eggs are specified as per-egg weight ranges, plus a per-100 minimum.

 EU weight standard
 
 SIZE             PER EGG        PER-100 MIN
 XL-very large    73 g and more   7.3 kg
 L-large          63 to 73        6.4
 M-medium         53 to 63        5.4
 S-small          under 53 g      4.5

 USDA weight standard
 
 CLASS         MIN NET PER DOZEN CONVERTED TO MIN GRAMS/EGG
 Jumbo         30 ounces         70.9
 Extra Large   27 ounces         63.8
 Large         24 ounces         56.7
 Medium        21 ounces         49.6
 Small         18 ounces         42.5
 Peewee        15 ounces         35.4

==Rotting and disease==
Eggs may also be pickled, hard-boiled and refrigerated, or eaten raw, though the latter is not recommended for people who may be susceptible to salmonella, such as the elderly, the infirm or pregnant women. 

When eggs become rotten, the yolk will turn green and the egg will emit a sulphurous smell when broken. Although deemed offensive by most Western palates, fermented eggs are considered a delicacy by some in China, when prepared using a special method which includes letting them sit for three months to age, however they can be considered dangerous, as they are most recently believed to have been the cause of the hospitalisation of British comedian Freddie Starr in the UK reality series &quot;I'm a Celebrity, Get me out of here&quot;

It is possible to test an egg for freshness, prior to breaking. To do so, drop the egg into a cup of water. A fresh egg will sink to the bottom of the cup, while an older or rotten egg will float towards the surface due to the build up of gases within the shell.

Raw eggs may carry salmonella bacteria contamination, and should be avoided by those with weak or undeveloped immune systems.  The bacteria will be killed in fully cooked eggs, which may be considered safe.

Eggs should always be broken into a cup one at a time and the white and yolk separated from each one, before adding to a mixture, and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs this way allows for the bad ones to be easily rejected without ruining the others.

==Frozen eggs==
For baking, frozen eggs can be used in place of fresh ones, if used as soon as thawed soft. Drop them into boiling water that has been removed from the heat source, letting them remain until the water is cold. They will be soft all through and beat up as well as fresh eggs do.

==Peeling fresh eggs==
The membrane and shell of fresh chicken eggs cling to the egg white when it is hard-boiled, making it nearly impossible to de-shell/peel. This is a common problem with an easy solution. Simply add a couple tablespoons of salt to the water when you boil your eggs and your eggs will peel easily.

==Separating eggs==
{{main|Cookbook:Separating Eggs}}
The traditional way to separate an egg (into yolk and white) is to crack the egg into two roughly equal parts, and pass the yolk from one half of the shell to the other, letting the white fall into a bowl below. A simpler way is to form a slack fist with one hand, crack the egg into it, and let the white run through your fingers into a bowl. It's a bit unnerving at first, but you soon develop a feel for the yolk. And if you are using the yolk for [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] for example, the heat from your hand will helpfully warm it. Don't forget to wash your hands first!

==Egg products==
Of the 71 billion eggs consumed in the United States in 2000, more than 30 percent were in the form of egg products (eggs removed from their shells). Liquid, frozen, and dried egg products are widely used by the foodservice industry and as ingredients in other foods, such as prepared [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]] and [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]]. 

The term &quot;egg products&quot; refers to eggs that are removed from their shells for processing. The processing of egg products includes breaking eggs, filtering, mixing, stabilizing, blending, pasteurizing, cooling, freezing or drying, and packaging. Egg products include whole eggs, whites, yolks and various blends with or without non-egg ingredients that are processed and pasteurized and may be available in liquid, frozen, and dried forms.

Eggs are used in many recipes; the ones below feature eggs as a primary ingredient.  For a full list of recipes using eggs, see [[:Category:Egg recipes|egg recipes]].

==Alternatives==
Some people can't eat eggs because of allergies or because of ethical convictions about egg production. People who have allergies are usually allergic only to the egg whites, due to the much higher protein content of the white as opposed to the yolk (the white is nearly pure protein, while the yolk is mostly fat.) Often people are only allergic as children and later grow out of it. People with ethical convictions against eggs include vegans and some vegetarians.

All these people must use egg substitutes if they wish to eat anything like an egg. No egg substitutes are perfect replacements, and most are very application-specific, but in many recipes an acceptable finished product can be achieved. Common substitutes from scratch include corn starch (2T per egg) or soy flour (1T + 2T water). Many use ready-made substitutes such as Ener-G brand egg replacer, which is largely made from potato starch. [[Cookbook:Tofu|Tofu]] plus seasonings are often used as a substitute for scrambled eggs.

'''Statistics''' - Area of applied mathematics concerned with the data collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation.

Statistics is used in almost every field of research: the discovery of the Higgs particle, social sciences, climate research,...  With this, and with its well established foundations, it is very well suited for a wikibook. This book is an ongoing effort to make this basic knowledge available for free.

British cookery is sometimes regarded as a figure of fun but actually it ranks with the best cuisines in the world. British cooking, however, is not just traditional '[[Cookbook:Roast Beef|Roast Beef]] and Yorkshire Pudding'. It reflects and incorporates something from all the cultures and countries Britain has had contact with throughout her long history.  Indeed British cooking has inspired many culinary traditions around the world. We hope this cookbook reflects the rich tradition of British cooking in its broadest sense.

==The simple multiplier==
The number of times total income increases corresponding to an increase in the investment is known as investment multiplier

==Assumptions:==
*Two sector economy
*Induced consumption and savings only
*Constant prices
*Some unemployed resources in the economy

==Formula==

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;math&gt;k = {1 \over MPS}\ \ \ OR\ \ \ k = {1 \over 1 - MPC}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
:The simple investment can also be expressed by:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{\Delta Y \over \Delta I}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
*For example if Y (national Y) rises by $5000 as a result of an increase in investment of $1000 then the k coefficient is 5 (5000/1000).
===Note:===
#The larger the MPC the larger the multiplier
#The multiplier process also operates in reverse.
==Derivation==
Assume the MPC of a hypothetical economy is 0.5. If a person spends $1 on a widget, then the person who sells it receives $1 of income, of which a portion is spent (MPC), this person then uses their $0.5 to purchase another good ''ad infinitum''. Expressing this mathematically:
:&lt;math&gt;1+MPC+MPC^2 + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
:As &lt;math&gt;MPC \leq 1 &lt;/math&gt; then what results is the limiting sum of a geometric sequence.
:i.e. &lt;math&gt;S_{ \infty}=1+MPC+MPC^2 + \cdots = {1 \over 1 - MPC} &lt;/math&gt; (letting a=1, r=MPC)
:letting &lt;math&gt;S_{ \infty}=k \Rightarrow k = {1 \over 1 - MPC} &lt;/math&gt;
:As &lt;math&gt;MPS + MPC = 1 &lt;/math&gt; then,
:&lt;math&gt; k = {1 \over 1 - MPC} = {1 \over MPS} &lt;/math&gt;

:The multiplier shows how one man's spending creates another man's income, through several time periods. In this case an initial new investment of $10 creates new income of $10, which is either spent or saved by those who have earned it. The proportion which is spent creates income for others in the second time period (shown by arrows from one period to the next). This is also spent or saved. The final new income which has flowed from the initial investment can be determined using the formula [&lt;math&gt;Y = k \times initial\ investment&lt;/math&gt;] (i.e. &lt;math&gt; 5 \times 10 = 50&lt;/math&gt;). Had the MPC been higher (say 0.9) the multiplier would be larger and more income would have been created.

==Graph:==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:multiplier.png]] --&gt;
:.This diagram assumes no government and no trade, so AE = C + I.
:Initial equilibrium occurred at the &lt;i&gt;red dot&lt;/i&gt; on the upper panel of the diagram, where $300 was earned and spent by households and firms. S = I at $60 (&lt;i&gt;red dot&lt;/i&gt; on the lower panel).
:Then firms decided to increase I by $10 (shown on the diagram as I + &amp;Delta;I). This created extra income in the economy, which gave consumers extra spending power. Because one man's spending is another man's income, there was a series of C, S and Y increases similar to those at the &lt;i&gt;green dot&lt;/i&gt; on the upper panel of the diagram, where planned levels of expenditure and income had risen to $350. Once again, S = I at $70. The new equilibrium occurs at a higher level of income. A small change in investment has resulted in a large change in AY.

*The simple k assumes no government or overseas (o/s) sectors in the economy. In reality Y will be subject to taxation, imports and savings before it will be spent in the domestic economy. Thus various complex multipliers incorporates these flows and is a smaller coefficient than [k = 1/MPS].

&lt;math&gt;{1 \over 1 - [ b\cdot(1 - t) - m]}\ \ \ i.e\ \ {1 \over 1 - [ 0.7(1 - 0.1) - 0.2]} = {1 \over 0.57} \approx 1.75&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
*The operation of the multiplier is essentially the same but consumption is reduced by acknowledging the other leakages in the economy.
*This multiplier is applicable to all direct spending in the economy, including government spending.
==Taxes/Transfers Multiplier==

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;

&lt;math&gt;{-b \over 1 - [ b\cdot(1 - t) - m ]}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
*This multiplier is applicable to all indirect injections into the economy, such as cutting taxes or increasing government transfers. The multiplier is positive because it implies a positive change, or increase, in the input. (taxes).

==Balanced Budget Multiplier==

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{1 - b \over 1 - [ b\cdot(1 - t) - m ]}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|}
*This multiplier is used when the government &lt;b&gt;increases&lt;/b&gt; spending and uses a tax &lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt; to pay for the spending. To model change in expenditure when the government &lt;b&gt;decreases&lt;/b&gt; spending and &lt;b&gt;cuts&lt;/b&gt; taxes to cover the costs, multiply by a negative input in expenditure.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;center&gt;
As you can see, the result is still positive if you &lt;b&gt;increase&lt;/b&gt; both government spending and taxes. On the other hand, if you &lt;b&gt;decrease&lt;/b&gt; both government spending and taxes, you have a negative change in expenditures, i.e. &lt;b&gt;widening&lt;/b&gt; the recession gap.
&lt;/center&gt;

==Waves in Two and Three Dimensions==

In this chapter we extend the ideas of the previous chapter to the case of waves in more than one dimension. The extension of the sine wave to higher dimensions is the ''plane wave''. Wave packets in two and three dimensions arise when plane waves moving in different directions are superimposed.

''Diffraction'' results from the disruption of a wave which is impingent upon an object. Those parts of the wave front hitting the object are scattered, modified, or destroyed. The resulting ''diffraction pattern'' comes from the subsequent interference of the various pieces of the modified wave. A knowledge of diffraction is necessary to understand the behavior and limitations of optical instruments such as telescopes.

Diffraction and interference in two and three dimensions can be manipulated to produces useful devices such as the ''diffraction grating''.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recognising Characters ==

&lt;!-- note: assume the user already knows his alphabet, but now wants to recognise them when written --&gt;

Written [[Wikipedia:Arabic|Arabic]] has 4 forms for each letter.  This might appear much at first, but it's not as hard as you might think.  For starters, Arabic does not have any capital letters, so this drops us from 4:1 ratio with the Roman alphabet to a meager 2:1 ratio.  Secondly, Arabic does not have a separate cursive and manuscript versions of the letters; since what you're learning already ''is'' cursive, one could conceivably argue that we're dropping from a 2:1 to a 1:1 ratio.  

There's better news still.  A lot of these letters are really just derivations of other letters, and many of the ones that aren't derivations behave in a similar enough fashion to be learned together.  This page is aimed at exploiting these similarities to help you learn how to read and write Arabic letters.

===  At a glance ===

Here are the letter-groups at a glance.  We mentioned earlier that there are 4 forms for each character: isolated, initial, medial and final.  In this table, we '''only show the isolated form''' of each character.  But we also break the letters into groups that have similar shapes.  Notice how some letters are derived from other letters by adding dots above or below some base form.  You might be wondering why it is claimed that certain letters are similar to each other. (FIXME: for example).  This is because the table is organised by similarity the medial form of each letter, that is the shape the letter takes when it is in the middle of a word.  Let's proceed to the next set of tables, where you shall learn about these forms in greater detail.

''Disclaimer: the organisation of letters into groups is based strictly on the authors' personal opinions.  If an authority on the Arabic language tells you that things are otherwise, you should believe them and not us''

== Arabic letters in detail ==

Now, we will look at each of the letter classes in detail.  Every row in this table represents a separate letter.  There are 8 constant letters, 6 isolated ones, 5 curve-pointy ones, 5 hook ones, and 4 other ones.  You'll note also that we group the rows by number of dots; this is to show you the similarities between letters that differ only by the dots that they use.  Even though ba ( ب ) and tha ( ث ) are completely different letters, they pretty much act the same way.

=== Constant ===

The constant forms behave roughly the same way no matter what position they are in.

|}

Note: technically fa and qa are not related to each other, but for us, being beginners, we'll pretend that they are for now.

=== Isolated ===

The isolated characters do not connect to the next letter in the medial form.  Consider alef and lam... written in the middle of words, they would look almost the same, but because alef does not connect to the next character (ـاـ) but lam does (ـلـ), you can tell them apart.

{| border=1 border=1 style=&quot;font-size:150%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;

|-
|colspan=4 bgcolor=&quot;gray&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;
|}

=== Curve-pointy ===

The curve-pointy letters have a single curve in isolated or initial form, but when they are in the middle of a word, they form a simple point up.

{| border=1 border=1 style=&quot;font-size:150%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| final 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| medial

|-
|colspan=4 bgcolor=&quot;gray&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;
|}

=== Hook ===

The hook letters have a downward hook in their final form and an upward hook in their medial form.

{| border=1 border=1 style=&quot;font-size:150%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| final 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| medial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| initial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| isolated

|| ـجـ
|| جـ
|| ج
|-
|colspan=4 bgcolor=&quot;gray&quot;|&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;
|}

=== Other ===

Finally, there are four letters which have their own idiosyncratic behaviours. 

{| border=1 border=1 style=&quot;font-size:150%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| final 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| medial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| initial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| isolated 
|-

|| كـ

|| ـلـ
|| لـ
|| ل
|-
|| ـم
|| ـمـ
|| مـ
|| م
|-
|| ـه
|| ـهـ
|| هـ
|| ه
|}

== Special letters ==

=== Tâ marbûta ===

One letter which you will encounter rather frequently is the tâ marbûta (ة, not to be confused with ه).  This letter always occurs in final position and has two forms:

{| border=1 border=1 style=&quot;font-size:150%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| final 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| medial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| initial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| isolated 
|-
|rowspan=4| 2 dots
|| ـة
|| 
|| 
|| ة
|}

=== Ligatures ===

Sometimes two letters combine (and form a ligature) to be written in a prettier or more convenient manner.  When lam ( ل ) is followed by alif ( ا ), it generally forms the lam-alif ligature ( لا ):

{| border=1 border=1 style=&quot;font-size:150%; border-collapse: collapse;&quot;
!style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| final 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| medial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| initial 
|style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;| isolated 
|-
|rowspan=4| no dots
|| ـلا
|| 
|| 
|| لا
|}

=== Plane Waves ===
A plane wave in two or three dimensions is like a sine wave in one dimension except that crests and troughs aren't points, but form lines (2-D) or planes (3-D) perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Figure 2.5 shows a plane sine wave in two dimensions. The large arrow is a vector called the wave vector, which defines (1) the direction of wave propagation by its orientation perpendicular to the wave fronts, and (2) the wavenumber by its length. We can think of a wave front as a line along the crest of the wave. The equation for the displacement associated with a plane sine wave in three dimensions at some instant in time is
:'''&lt;math&gt; A(x,y,z) = \sin (\mbox{k} \cdot \mbox{r} ) = \sin (k_x x + k_y y + k_z z) . &lt;/math&gt;''' (3.9)

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.5.png|Figure 2.5: Definition sketch for a plane sine wave in two dimensions]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.5''': Definition sketch for a plane sine wave in two dimensions. The wave fronts are constant phase surfaces separated by one wavelength. The wave vector is normal to the wave fronts and its length is the wavenumber. &lt;/div&gt;
Since wave fronts are lines or surfaces of constant phase, the equation defining a wave front is simply '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{k} \cdot \mbox{r} = const&lt;/math&gt;'''.

In the two dimensional case we simply set &lt;math&gt;k_z = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a wavefront, or line of constant phase &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; in two dimensions is defined by the equation
:'''&lt;math&gt; \mbox{k} \cdot \mbox{r} = k_x x + k_y y = \phi \quad \mbox{(two dimensions)} . &lt;/math&gt;''' (3.10)

This can be easily solved for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the slope and intercept of the wavefront in two dimensions.

As for one dimensional waves, the time evolution of the wave is obtained by adding a term &lt;math&gt;- \omega t&lt;/math&gt; to the phase of the wave. In three dimensions the wave displacement as a function of both space and time is given by
:&lt;math&gt; A(x,y,z,t) = \sin (k_x x + k_y y + k_z z - \omega t ) . &lt;/math&gt; (3.11)

The frequency depends in general on all three components of the wave vector. The form of this function, &lt;math&gt;\omega = \omega (k_x , k_y , k_z )&lt;/math&gt;, which as in the one dimensional case is called the ''dispersion relation'', contains information about the physical behavior of the wave.

Some examples of dispersion relations for waves in two dimensions are as follows:

* Light waves in a vacuum in two dimensions obey
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = c ( k_x^2 + k_y^2 )^{1/2} \quad \mbox{(light)} , &lt;/math&gt; (3.12)
:where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in a vacuum.
* Deep water ocean waves in two dimensions obey
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = g^{1/2} ( k_x^2 + k_y^2 )^{1/4} \quad \mbox{(ocean waves)} , &lt;/math&gt; (3.13)
:where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the strength of the Earth's gravitational field as before.
* Certain kinds of atmospheric waves confined to a vertical &lt;math&gt;x-z&lt;/math&gt; plane called ''gravity waves'' (not to be confused with the gravitational waves of general relativity)3.1 obey
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = \frac{N k_x}{k_z} \quad \mbox{(gravity waves)} , &lt;/math&gt; (3.14)
:where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a constant with the dimensions of inverse time called the Brunt-V&amp;auml;is&amp;auml;l&amp;auml; frequency.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.6.png|Figure 2.6: Contour plots of the dispersion relations for three kinds of waves in two dimensions]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.6''': Contour plots of the dispersion relations for three kinds of waves in two dimensions. In the upper panels the curves show lines or contours along which the frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega &lt;/math&gt; takes on constant values. For light and ocean waves the frequency depends only on the magnitude of the wave vector, whereas for gravity waves it depends only on the wave vector's direction, as defined by the angle &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; in the upper right panel. These dependences for each wave type are illustrated in the lower panels. &lt;/div&gt;

Contour plots of these dispersion relations are plotted in the upper panels of figure 2.6. These plots are to be interpreted like topographic maps, where the lines represent contours of constant elevation. In the case of figure 2.6, constant values of frequency are represented instead. For simplicity, the actual values of frequency are not labeled on the contour plots, but are represented in the graphs in the lower panels. This is possible because frequency depends only on wave vector magnitude &lt;math&gt;(k_x^2 + k_y^2 )^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; for the first two examples, and only on wave vector direction &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; for the third.</text>

=== Superposition of Plane Waves ===

We now study of wave packets in two dimensions by asking what the superposition of two plane sine waves looks like. If the two waves have different wavenumbers, but their wave vectors point in the same direction, the results are identical to those presented in the previous chapter, except that the wave packets are indefinitely elongated without change in form in the direction perpendicular to the wave vector. The wave packets produced in this case march along in the direction of the wave vectors and thus appear to a stationary observer like a series of passing ''pulses'' with broad lateral extent.

Superimposing two plane waves which have the same frequency results in a stationary wave packet through which the individual wave fronts pass. This wave packet is also elongated indefinitely in some direction, but the direction of elongation depends on the dispersion relation for the waves being considered. One can think of such wave packets as steady ''beams'', which guide the individual phase waves in some direction, but don't themselves change with time. By superimposing multiple plane waves, all with the same frequency, one can actually produce a single stationary beam, just as one can produce an isolated pulse by superimposing multiple waves with wave vectors pointing in the same direction. 

==== Two Waves of Identical Wavelength ====

If the frequency of a wave depends on the magnitude of the wave vector, but not on its direction, the wave's dispersion relation is called isotropic. In the isotropic case two waves have the same frequency only if the lengths of their wave vectors, and hence their wavelengths, are the same. The first two examples in figure 2.6 satisfy this condition. In this section we investigate the beams produced by superimposed isotropic waves.

We superimpose two plane waves with wave vectors '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_1 = (- \Delta k_x , k_y )&lt;/math&gt;''' and '''&lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_2 = ( \Delta k_x , k_y )&lt;/math&gt;'''. The lengths of the wave vectors in both cases are &lt;math&gt;k_1 = k_2 = ( \Delta k_x^2 + k_y^2 )^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \sin ( -\Delta k_x x + k_y y - \omega t ) + \sin (\Delta k_x x + k_y y - \omega t ) . &lt;/math&gt; (3.15)

If &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_x &lt;&lt; k_y&lt;/math&gt;, then both waves are moving approximately in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction. An example of such waves would be two light waves with the same frequencies moving in slightly different directions.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.7.png|Figure 2.7: Wave fronts and wave vectors of two plane waves with the same wavelength but oriented in different directions]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.7''': Wave fronts and wave vectors of two plane waves with the same wavelength but oriented in different directions. The vertical bands show regions of constructive interference where wave fronts coincide. The vertical regions in between the bars have destructive interference, and hence define the lateral boundaries of the beams produced by the superposition. The components &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt; of one of the wave vectors are shown. &lt;/div&gt;

Applying the trigonometric identity for the sine of the sum of two angles (as we have done previously), equation (3.15) can be reduced to
:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \sin (k_y y - \omega t) \cos (\Delta k_x x) . &lt;/math&gt; (3.16)

This is in the form of a sine wave moving in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction with phase speed &lt;math&gt;c_{phase} = \omega / k_y&lt;/math&gt; and wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_y&lt;/math&gt;, modulated in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction by a cosine function. The distance &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; between regions of destructive interference in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction tells us the width of the resulting beams, and is given by &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_x w = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, so that
:&lt;math&gt; w = \pi / \Delta k_x . &lt;/math&gt; (3.17)

Thus, the smaller &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_x&lt;/math&gt;, the greater is the beam diameter. This behavior is illustrated in figure 2.7.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.8.png|Figure 2.8: Example of beams produced by two plane waves with the same wavelength moving in different directions]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.8''': Example of beams produced by two plane waves with the same wavelength moving in different directions. The wave vectors of the two waves are &lt;math&gt;\mbox{k} = (\pm 0.1 , 1.0)&lt;/math&gt;. Regions of positive displacement are illustrated by vertical hatching, while negative displacement has horizontal hatching. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 2.8 shows an example of the beams produced by superposition of two plane waves of equal wavelength oriented as in figure 2.7. It is easy to show that the transverse width of the resulting wave packet satisfies equation (2.17).

==== Two Waves of Differing Wavelength ====

In the third example of figure 2.6, the frequency of the wave depends only on the direction of the wave vector, independent of its magnitude, which is just the reverse of the case for an isotropic dispersion relation. In this case different plane waves with the same frequency have wave vectors which point in the same direction, but have different lengths.

More generally, one might have waves for which the frequency depends on ''both'' the direction and magnitude of the wave vector. In this case, two different plane waves with the same frequency would typically have wave vectors which differed both in direction and magnitude.

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.9.png|frame|right|
'''Figure 2.9''': Wave fronts and wave vectors of two plane waves with different wavelengths oriented in different directions. The slanted bands show regions of constructive interference where wave fronts coincide. The slanted regions in between the bars have destructive interference, and as previously, define the lateral limits of the beams produced by the superposition.]]

Mathematically, we can represent the superposition of these two waves as a generalization of equation (2.15):
:&lt;math&gt; A = \sin [ - \Delta k_x x + (k_y + \Delta k_y ) y - \omega t ] + \sin [ \Delta k_x x + (k_y - \Delta k_y ) y - \omega t ] . &lt;/math&gt; (3.18)

In this equation we have given the first wave vector a &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; component &lt;math&gt;k_y + \Delta k_y&lt;/math&gt; while the second wave vector has &lt;math&gt;k_y - \Delta k_y&lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the first wave has overall wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_1 = [ \Delta k_x^2 + (k_y + \Delta k_y )^2 ]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; while the second has &lt;math&gt;k_2 = [ \Delta k_x^2 + (k_y - \Delta k_y )^2 ]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;k_1 \ne k_2&lt;/math&gt;. Using the usual trigonometric identity, we write equation (2.18) as
:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \sin (k_y y - \omega t ) \cos ( - \Delta k_x x + \Delta k_y y ) . &lt;/math&gt; (3.19)

To see what this equation implies, notice that constructive interference between the two waves occurs when &lt;math&gt;- \Delta k_x x + \Delta k_y y = m \pi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. Solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;y = ( \Delta k_x / \Delta k_y )x + m \pi / \Delta k_y&lt;/math&gt;, which corresponds to lines with slope &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_x / \Delta k_y&lt;/math&gt;. These lines turn out to be perpendicular to the vector difference between the two wave vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_2 - \mbox{k}_1 = ( 2 \Delta k_x , -2 \Delta k_y )&lt;/math&gt;. The easiest way to show this is to note that this difference vector is oriented so that it has a slope &lt;math&gt;- \Delta k_y / \Delta k_x&lt;/math&gt;. Comparison with the &lt;math&gt;\Delta k_x / \Delta k_y&lt;/math&gt; slope of the lines of constructive interference indicates that this is so.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.10.png|Figure 2.10: Example of beams produced by two plane waves with wave vectors differing in both direction and magnitude]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.10''': Example of beams produced by two plane waves with wave vectors differing in both direction and magnitude. The wave vectors of the two waves are &lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_1 = ( -0.1 , 1.0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_2 = ( 0.1, 0.9)&lt;/math&gt;. Regions of positive displacement are illustrated by vertical hatching, while negative displacement has horizontal hatching. &lt;/div&gt;

An example of the production of beams by the superposition of two waves with different directions and wavelengths is shown in figure 2.10. Notice that the wavefronts are still horizontal, as in figure 2.8, but that the beams are not vertical, but slant to the right.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.11.png|Figure 2.11: Illustration of factors entering the addition of two plane waves with the same frequency]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.11''': Illustration of factors entering the addition of two plane waves with the same frequency. The wave fronts are perpendicular to the vector average of the two wave vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_0 = ( \mbox{k}_1 + \mbox{k}_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, while the lines of constructive interference, which define the beam orientation, are oriented perpendicular to the difference between these two vectors, &lt;math&gt;\mbox{k}_2 - \mbox{k}_1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 2.11 summarizes what we have learned about adding plane waves with the same frequency. In general, the beam orientation and the lines of constructive interference are not perpendicular to the wave fronts. This only occurs when the wave frequency is independent of wave vector direction. 

==== Many Waves with the Same Wavelength ====

As with wave packets in one dimension, we can add together more than two waves to produce an isolated wave packet. We will confine our attention here to the case of an isotropic dispersion relation in which all the wave vectors for a given frequency are of the same length.

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.12.png|frame|right|
'''Figure 2.12''': Illustration of wave vectors of plane waves which might be added together.]]

Figure 2.12 shows an example of this in which wave vectors of the same wavelength but different directions are added together. Defining &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; as the angle of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th wave vector clockwise from the vertical, as illustrated in figure 2.12, we could write the superposition of these waves at time &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt; as
&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_i A_i \sin ( k_{xi} x + k_{yi} y )&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt;= \sum_i A_i \sin [kx \sin ( \alpha_i ) + ky \cos ( \alpha_i ) ]&lt;/math&gt; (3.20)

where we have assumed that &lt;math&gt;k_{xi} = k \sin ( \alpha_i )&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_{yi} = k \cos ( \alpha_i )&lt;/math&gt;. The parameter &lt;math&gt;k = \vert \mbox{k} \vert&lt;/math&gt; is the magnitude of the wave vector and is the same for all the waves. Let us also assume in this example that the amplitude of each wave component decreases with increasing &lt;math&gt;\vert \alpha_i \vert&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; A_i = \exp [-( \alpha_i / \alpha_{max} )^2 ] . &lt;/math&gt; (3.21)

The exponential function decreases rapidly as its argument becomes more negative, and for practical purposes, only wave vectors with &lt;math&gt;\vert \alpha_i \vert \le \alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; contribute significantly to the sum. We call &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; the ''spreading angle''.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.13.png|Figure 2.13: Plot of displacement field]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.13''': Plot of the displacement field &lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; from equation (2.20) for &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{max} = 0.8&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 2.13 shows what &lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; looks like when &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max} = 0.8 \mbox{ radians}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that for &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; the wave amplitude is only large for a small region in the range &lt;math&gt;-4 &lt; x &lt; 4&lt;/math&gt;. However, for &lt;math&gt;y &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; the wave spreads into a broad semicircular pattern.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.14.png|Figure 2.14: Plot of displacement field]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.14''': Plot of the displacement field &lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; from equation (2.20) for &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{max} = 0.2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 2.14 shows the computed pattern of &lt;math&gt;A(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; when the spreading angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max} = 0.2 \mbox{ radians}&lt;/math&gt;. The wave amplitude is large for a much broader range of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; in this case, roughly &lt;math&gt;-12 &lt; x &lt; 12&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, the subsequent spread of the wave is much smaller than in the case of figure 2.13.

We conclude that a superposition of plane waves with wave vectors spread narrowly about a central wave vector which points in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; direction (as in figure 2.14) produces a beam which is initially broad in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; but for which the breadth increases only slightly with increasing &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. However, a superposition of plane waves with wave vectors spread more broadly (as in figure 2.13) produces a beam which is initially narrow in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; but which rapidly increases in width as &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; increases.

The relationship between the spreading angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and the initial breadth of the beam is made more understandable by comparison with the results for the two-wave superposition discussed at the beginning of this section. As indicated by equation (2.17), large values of &lt;math&gt;k_x&lt;/math&gt;, and hence &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;, are associated with small wave packet dimensions in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction and vice versa. The superposition of two waves doesn't capture the subsequent spread of the beam which occurs when many waves are superimposed, but it does lead to a rough quantitative relationship between &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; (which is just &lt;math&gt;\tan^{-1} (k_x / k_y )&lt;/math&gt; in the two wave case) and the initial breadth of the beam. If we invoke the small angle approximation for &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max} = \tan^{-1} (k_x / k_y ) \approx k_x / k_y \approx k_x / k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;k_x \approx k \alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and equation (2.17) can be written &lt;math&gt;w = \pi / k_x \approx \pi / (k \alpha_{max} ) = \lambda / (2 \alpha_{max} )&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we can find the approximate spreading angle from the wavelength of the wave &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; and the initial breadth of the beam &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_{max} \approx \lambda / (2d) \quad \mbox{(single slit spreading angle)} . &lt;/math&gt; (3.22)</text>

=== Diffraction Through a Single Slit ===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.15.png|Figure 2.15: Schematic behavior when a plane wave impinges on a narrow slit and a broad slit]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 2.15''': Schematic behavior when a plane wave impinges on a narrow slit and a broad slit. &lt;/div&gt;

How does all of this apply to the passage of waves through a slit? Imagine a plane wave of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; impingent on a barrier with a slit or opening of width &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;. The barrier transforms the plane wave with infinite extent in the lateral direction into a beam with initial transverse dimensions equal to the width of the slit. The subsequent development of the beam is illustrated in figures 2.13 and 2.14, and schematically in figure 2.15. In particular, if the slit width is comparable to the wavelength, the beam spreads broadly as in figure 2.13. If the slit width is large compared to the wavelength, the beam doesn't spread as much, as figure 2.14 illustrates. Equation (2.22) gives us an approximate quantitative result for the spreading angle if &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the width of the slit.

One use of the above equation is in determining the maximum angular resolution of optical instruments such as telescopes. The primary lens or mirror can be thought of as a rather large “slit”. Light from a distant point source is essentially in the form of a plane wave when it arrives at the telescope. However, the light passed by the telescope is no longer a plane wave, but is a beam with a tendency to spread. The spreading angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is given by equation (2.22), and the telescope cannot resolve objects with an angular separation less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt;. Replacing &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; with the diameter of the lens or mirror in equation (2.22) thus yields the telescope's angular resolution. For instance, a moderate sized telescope with aperture &lt;math&gt;1 \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; observing red light with &lt;math&gt;\lambda \approx 6 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; has a maximum angular resolution of about &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ radians}&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

== Two Slits ==

=== Narrow Slits ===

[[File:Two-Slit Experiment Approximation.svg|frame|right|'''Figure 2.16''': Light passing through slit B travels an extra distance to the screen equal compared to light passing through slit A. This distance is &lt;math&gt;\Delta l = d \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;]]

Let us now imagine a plane sine wave normally impingent on a screen with two narrow slits spaced by a distance ''d'', as shown in Figure 2.16. Since the slits are narrow relative to the wavelength of the wave impingent on them, the spreading angle of the beams is large and the diffraction pattern from each slit individually is a cylindrical wave spreading out in all directions, as illustrated in figure 2.13. The cylindrical waves from the two slits interfere, resulting in oscillations in wave intensity at the screen on the right side of figure 2.16.

Constructive interference occurs when the difference in the path lengths of the two rays is an integer multiple of the wavelength, ''λ'':
{{eqn|Condition for constructive interference}}
:&lt;math&gt;l_2 - l_1 = m\lambda, \quad m = 0 , \pm 1 , \pm 2 , \ldots  \,&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, destructive interference occurs at:
{{eqn|Condition for destructive interference}}
:&lt;math&gt;l_2 - l_1 = \left( m + \frac{1}{2} \right) \lambda, \quad m = 0 , \pm 1 , \pm 2 , \ldots  \,&lt;/math&gt;

If the distance from the slits to the screen, ''L'' is much greater than the slit separation, ''d'', the rays ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are approximately parallel and we can say that the path length difference is:
{{eqn|Path length difference for ''L'' &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ''d''}}
:&lt;math&gt;l_2 - l_1 = d \sin \theta\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting these two equations gives the following conditon for constructive interference:
{{eqn|Condition for constructive interference}}
:&lt;math&gt;d \sin \theta = m\lambda, \quad m = 0 , \pm 1 , \pm 2 , \ldots  \,&lt;/math&gt;

The integer ''m'' is called the ''interference order'' and is the number of wavelengths by which the two paths differ. At every angle corresponding to integer ''m'', constructive interference will be greatest and a &quot;fringe&quot; will be formed.

The distance from a point on the screen to the centre line, ''s'', is related to ''θ'' as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta = \frac{s}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''θ'' is small, we can say that:
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \theta \approx \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

We can therefore equate the expressions for position on the screen and fringe angles:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{m \lambda}{d} \approx \frac{s}{L}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging gives an expression for the fringe spacing:
:&lt;math&gt;s \approx \frac{n \lambda L}{d} &lt;/math&gt;

The following conditions have to hold for this to be a good approximation:
* The distance from the slits to the screen, ''L'', must be much larger than the slit separation, ''d''.
* The angle, ''θ'', to the fringe from the slits must be small.
* The slits must be narrow compared to the wavelength, ''λ''.

==== Example ====

Let us consider a setup with the following parameters:
* ''d'' = 0.1 mm
* ''λ'' = 2500 nm (infrared)

We expect to see a fringe spacing at 10m of:
:&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{\lambda L}{d}=\frac{2500 \times 10^{-9} \times 10}{0.1 \times 10^{-3}}=0.25m&lt;/math&gt;

First, let's look at a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the wave at a certain instance in time. The amplitude at a point, (''x'',''y''), is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y,t)=
a\sin \left( k \sqrt{ \left( x-\frac{d}{2} \right)^2 + y^2} \right)+
a\sin \left( k \sqrt{ \left( x+\frac{d}{2} \right)^2 + y^2} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''k'' is the wavenumber, given by 2''π''/''λ''. In this exercise, we will neglect the decreasing amplitude with distance, so the fringes stay bright over all space. The plot below shows a plot of this function. You can clearly see the circular propagation of each source, but an overall fringe structure is difficult to make out.

[[File:Two Slit Interference, 2500nm wl, 0.1mm d, close up.png|center|600px]]

Now, the human eye and all light-measuring equipment do not detect the individual oscillations of a light wave, they measure intensity. Here, intensity is a function of the phase difference between the two sources, which in turn is directly related to the path length difference.
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\Delta l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I \approx 4 a^2 \cos^2 \frac{\delta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
The plot below shows this intensity function. We see that a very clear fringe structure is revealed:
[[File:Two Slit Interference, 2500nm wl, 0.1mm d, close up average.png|center|600px]]

At this scale, the fringe structure is not clearly radial, it &quot;bends&quot; around  the source. However, we can see that if we were to zoom out, the frenges diverge, and the ones near the centre, which are closest to perfectly radial, will be the ones that matter:
[[File:Two Slit Interference, 2500nm wl, 0.1mm d, distant average.png|center|600px]]
In this plot, we see the predicted bright fringes at x=0mm, x=±250mm and x=±500mm.

=== Diffraction Gratings ===

Since the angular spacing &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; of interference peaks in the two slit case depends on the wavelength of the incident wave, the two slit system can be used as a crude device to distinguish between the wavelengths of different components of a non-sinusoidal wave impingent on the slits. However, if more slits are added, maintaining a uniform spacing &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; between slits, we obtain a more sophisticated device for distinguishing beam components. This is called a ''diffraction grating''.

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.17.png|frame|right|'''Figure 2.17:''' Amplitude and intensity of interference pattern from a diffraction grating with 2 slits]]

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.18.png|frame|right|'''Figure 2.18:''' Amplitude and intensity of interference pattern from a diffraction grating with 4 slits]]

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 2.19.png|frame|right|'''Figure 2.19:''' Amplitude and intensity of interference pattern from a diffraction grating with 16 slits]]

Figures 2.17-2.19 show the amplitude and intensity of the diffraction pattern for gratings with 2, 4, and 16 slits respectively. Notice how the interference peaks remain in the same place but increase in sharpness as the number of slits increases.

The width of the peaks is actually related to the overall width of the grating, &lt;math&gt;w = nd&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of slits. Thinking of this width as the dimension of large single slit, the single slit equation, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max} = \lambda /(2w)&lt;/math&gt;, tells us the angular width of the peaks.

Whereas the angular width of the interference peaks is governed by the single slit equation, their angular positions are governed by the two slit equation. Let us assume for simplicity that &lt;math&gt;\vert \theta \vert &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; so that we can make the small angle approximation to the two slit equation, &lt;math&gt;m \lambda = d \sin \theta \approx d \theta&lt;/math&gt;, and ask the following question: How different do two wavelengths have to be in order that the interference peaks from the two waves not overlap? In order for the peaks to be distinguishable, they should be separated in &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; by an angle &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta = m \Delta \lambda /d&lt;/math&gt;, which is greater than the angular width of each peak, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \theta &gt; \alpha_{max} . &lt;/math&gt; (3.24)

Substituting in the above expressions for &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{max}&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda&lt;/math&gt;, we get &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda &gt; \lambda /(2mn)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n = w/d&lt;/math&gt; is the number of slits in the diffraction grating. Thus, the fractional difference between wavelengths which can be distinuished by a diffraction grating depends solely on the interference order &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and the number of slits &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the grating:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} &gt; \frac{1}{2mn} . &lt;/math&gt; (3.25)

=== Total Internal Reflection ===

When light passes from a medium of lesser index of refraction to one with greater index of refraction, Snell's law indicates that the ray bends ''toward'' the normal to the interface. The reverse occurs when the passage is in the other direction. In this latter circumstance a special situation arises when Snell's law predicts a value for the sine of the refracted angle greater than one. This is physically untenable. What actually happens is that the incident wave is ''reflected'' from the interface. This phenomenon is called ''total internal reflection''. The minimum incident angle for which total internal reflection occurs is obtained by substituting &lt;math&gt;\theta_R = \pi /2&lt;/math&gt; into equation (3.2), resulting in
:&lt;math&gt; \sin ( \theta_I ) = n_R / n_I \quad \mbox{(total internal reflection)} . &lt;/math&gt; (4.3)

=== Anisotropic Media ===

Notice that Snell's law makes the implicit assumption that rays of light move in the direction of the light's wave vector, i. e., normal to the wave fronts. As the analysis in the previous chapter makes clear, this is valid only when the optical medium is isotropic, i. e., the wave frequency depends only on the magnitude of the wave vector, not on its direction.

Certain kinds of crystals, such as those made of calcite, are not isotropic -- the speed of light in such crystals, and hence the wave frequency, depends on the orientation of the wave vector. As an example, the angular frequency in anisotropic medium might take the form
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = \left[ \frac{c_1^2 ( k_x + k_y )^2}{2} + \frac{c_2^2 ( k_x - k_y )^2}{2} \right]^{1/2} , &lt;/math&gt; (4.4)
where &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light for waves in which &lt;math&gt;k_y = k_x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; is its speed when &lt;math&gt;k_y = - k_x&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.3.png|Figure 3.3: the fate of a light ray normally incident on the face of a properly cut calcite crystal]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.3''': The right panel shows the fate of a light ray normally incident on the face of a properly cut calcite crystal. The anisotropic dispersion relation which gives rise to this behavior is shown in the left panel. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 3.3 shows an example in which a ray hits a calcite crystal oriented so that constant frequency contours are as specified in equation (3.4). The wave vector is oriented normal to the surface of the crystal, so that wave fronts are parallel to this surface. Upon entering the crystal, the wave front orientation must stay the same to preserve phase continuity at the surface. However, due to the anisotropy of the dispersion relation for light in the crystal, the ray direction changes as shown in the right panel. This behavior is clearly inconsistent with the usual version of Snell's law!

It is possible to extend Snell's law to the anisotropic case. We will not derive the equations here, but they are
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx_i}{dt}=\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k_i} \quad
\frac{dk_i}{dt}=-\frac{\partial \omega}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Later we will see a suggestive resemblance between these equation of geometrical optics and the equations of classical mechanics.

For now, though, we will assume that isotropic optical media are used, and discuss  optical instruments.

=== Thin Lens Formula and Optical Instruments ===

Given the laws of reflection and refraction, one can see in principle how the passage of light through an optical instrument could be traced. For each of a number of initial rays, the change in the direction of the ray at each mirror surface or refractive index interface can be calculated. Between these points, the ray traces out a straight line.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.4.png|Figure 3.4: Bending of a ray of light as it passes through a prism]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.4''': Bending of a ray of light as it passes through a prism. &lt;/div&gt;

Though simple in conception, this procedure can be quite complex in practice. However, the procedure simplifies if a number of approximations, collectively called the ''thin lens approximation'', are valid. We begin with the calculation of the bending of a ray of light as it passes through a prism, as illustrated in figure 3.4.

The pieces of information needed to find &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt;, the angle through which the ray is deflected are as follows: The geometry of the triangle defined by the entry and exit points of the ray and the upper vertex of the prism leads to
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha + ( \pi / 2 - \theta_2 ) + ( \pi /2 - \theta_3 ) = \pi , &lt;/math&gt; (4.5)

which simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \theta_2 + \theta_3 . &lt;/math&gt; (4.6)

Snell's law at the entrance and exit points of the ray tell us that
:&lt;math&gt; n = \frac{\sin ( \theta_1 )}{\sin ( \theta_2 )} \qquad n = \frac{\sin ( \theta_4 )}{\sin ( \theta_3 )} , &lt;/math&gt; (4.7)

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of refraction of the prism. (The index of refraction of the surroundings is assumed to be unity.) One can also infer that
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \theta_1 + \theta_4 - \alpha . &lt;/math&gt; (4.8)

This comes from the fact that the the sum of the internal angles of the shaded tetrahedron in figure 3.4 is &lt;math&gt;( \pi /2 - \theta_1 ) + \alpha + ( \pi/2 - \theta_4 ) + ( \pi + \theta ) = 2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining equations (3.6), (3.7), and (3.8) allows the ray deflection &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; to be determined in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt;, but the resulting expression is very messy. However, great simplification occurs if the following conditions are met:

    * The angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;.
    * The angles &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta_4 \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;.

With these approximations it is easy to show that
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = \alpha (n - 1) \quad \text{(small angles)} . &lt;/math&gt; (4.9)

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.5.png|Figure 3.5: Light ray undergoing deflection through an angle theta by a lens]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.5''': Light ray undergoing deflection through an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta &lt;/math&gt; by a lens. The angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the tangents to the entry and exit points of the ray on the lens.&lt;/div&gt;

Generally speaking, lenses and mirrors in optical instruments have curved rather than flat surfaces. However, we can still use the laws for reflection and refraction by plane surfaces as long as the segment of the surface on which the wave packet impinges is not curved very much on the scale of the wave packet dimensions. This condition is easy to satisfy with light impinging on ordinary optical instruments. In this case, the deflection of a ray of light is given by equation (3.9) if &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is defined as the intersection of the tangent lines to the entry and exit points of the ray, as illustrated in figure 3.5.

A ''positive lens'' is thicker in the center than at the edges. The angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt;/math&gt; between the tangent lines to the two surfaces of the lens at a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the central axis takes the form &lt;math&gt;\alpha = C r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. The deflection angle of a beam hitting the lens a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the center is therefore &lt;math&gt;\theta = C r (n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;, as indicated in figure 3.5. The angles &lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; sum to the deflection angle: &lt;math&gt;o + i = \theta = C r (n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;. However, to the extent that the small angle approximation holds, &lt;math&gt;o = r/d_o&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i = r/d_i&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d_o&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the object and &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the image of the object. Putting these equations together and cancelling the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; results in the ''thin lens formula'':
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i} = C(n - 1) \equiv \frac{1}{f} . &lt;/math&gt; (4.10)

The quantity &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''focal length'' of the lens. Notice that &lt;math&gt;f = d_i&lt;/math&gt; if the object is very far from the lens, i. e., if &lt;math&gt;d_o&lt;/math&gt; is extremely large.

'''Figure 3.6''': A positive lens producing an image on the right of the arrow on the left. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 3.6 shows how a positive lens makes an image. The image is produced by all of the light from each point on the object falling on a corresponding point in the image. If the arrow on the left is an illuminated object, an ''image'' of the arrow will appear at right if the light coming from the lens is allowed to fall on a piece of paper or a ground glass screen. The size of the object &lt;math&gt;S_o&lt;/math&gt; and the size of the image &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; are related by simple geometry to the distances of the object and the image from the lens:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{S_i}{S_o} = \frac{d_i}{d_o} . &lt;/math&gt; (4.11)

Notice that a positive lens inverts the image.

[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.7.png|Figure 3.7: Production of a virtual image by a positive lens]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.7''': Production of a virtual image by a positive lens. &lt;/div&gt;

An image will be produced to the right of the lens only if &lt;math&gt;d_o &gt; f&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;d_o &lt; f&lt;/math&gt;, the lens is unable to converge the rays from the image to a point, as is seen in figure 3.7. However, in this case the backward extension of the rays converge at a point called a ''virtual image'', which in the case of a positive lens is always farther away from the lens than the object. The thin lens formula still applies if the distance from the lens to the image is taken to be negative. The image is called virtual because it does not appear on a ground glass screen placed at this point. Unlike the real image seen in figure 3.6, the virtual image is not inverted.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.8.png|Figure 3.8: Production of a virtual image by a negative lens]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.8''': Production of a virtual image by a negative lens. &lt;/div&gt;

A ''negative lens'' is thinner in the center than at the edges and produces only virtual images. As seen in figure 3.8, the virtual image produced by a negative lens is closer to the lens than is the object. Again, the thin lens formula is still valid, but both the distance from the image to the lens and the focal length must be taken as negative. Only the distance to the object remains positive.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.9.png|Figure 3.9: Production of a real image by a concave mirror]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.9''': Production of a real image by a concave mirror. &lt;/div&gt;

Curved mirrors also produce images in a manner similar to a lens, as shown in figure 3.9. A concave mirror, as seen in this figure, works in analogy to a positive lens, producing a real or a virtual image depending on whether the object is farther from or closer to the mirror than the mirror's focal length. A convex mirror acts like a negative lens, always producing a virtual image. The thin lens formula works in both cases as long as the angles are small.

=== Fermat's Principle ===

An alternate approach to geometrical optics can be developed from Fermat's principle. This principle states (in its simplest form) that light waves of a given frequency traverse the path between two points which takes the least time. The most obvious example of this is the passage of light through a homogeneous medium in which the speed of light doesn't change with position. In this case shortest time is equivalent to the shortest distance between the points, which, as we all know, is a straight line. Thus, Fermat's principle is consistent with light traveling in a straight line in a homogeneous medium.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.10.png|Figure 3.10: Definition sketch for deriving the law of reflection from Fermat's principle]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.10''': Definition sketch for deriving the law of reflection from Fermat's principle. &lt;math&gt;\theta _I&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of incidence and &lt;math&gt;\theta _R&lt;/math&gt; the angle of reflection as in figure 3.1. &lt;/div&gt;

Fermat's principle can also be used to derive the laws of reflection and refraction. For instance, figure 3.10 shows a candidate ray for reflection in which the angles of incidence and reflection are not equal. The time required for the light to go from point A to point B is
:&lt;math&gt; t = [ \{ h_1^2 + y^2 \}^{1/2} + \{ h_2^2 + (w - y)^2 \}^{1/2} ]/c &lt;/math&gt; (4.12)

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light. We find the minimum time by differentiating &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and setting the result to zero, with the result that
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{y}{ \{ h_1^2 + y^2 \}^{1/2}} = \frac{w - y}{ \{ h_2^2 + (w - y)^2 \}^{1/2}} . &lt;/math&gt; (4.13)

However, we note that the left side of this equation is simply &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_I&lt;/math&gt;, while the right side is &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_R&lt;/math&gt;, so that the minimum time condition reduces to &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_I = \sin \theta_R&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\theta _I = \theta _R&lt;/math&gt;, which is the law of reflection.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.11.png|Figure 3.11: Definition sketch for deriving Snell's law of refraction from Fermat's principle]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.11''': Definition sketch for deriving Snell's law of refraction from Fermat's principle. The shaded area has index of refraction &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

A similar analysis may be done to derive Snell's law of refraction. The speed of light in a medium with refractive index &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;c/n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is its speed in a vacuum. Thus, the time required for light to go some distance in such a medium is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; times the time light takes to go the same distance in a vacuum. Referring to figure 3.11, the time required for light to go from A to B becomes
:&lt;math&gt; t = [ \{ h_1^2 + y^2 \}^{1/2} + n \{ h_2^2 + (w - y)^2 \}^{1/2} ]/c . &lt;/math&gt; (4.14)

This results in the condition
:&lt;math&gt; \sin \theta_I = n \sin \theta_R &lt;/math&gt; (4.15)

where &lt;math&gt;\theta _R&lt;/math&gt; is now the refracted angle. We recognize this result as Snell's law.

Notice that the reflection case illustrates a point about Fermat's principle: The minimum time may actually be a local rather than a global minimum -- after all, in figure 3.10, the global minimum distance from A to B is still just a straight line between the two points! In fact, light starting from point A will reach point B by both routes -- the direct route and the reflected route.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.12.png|Figure 3.12: Ellipsoidal mirror showing minimum and maximum time rays from the center of the ellipsoid to the mirror surface and back again]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 3.12''': Ellipsoidal mirror showing minimum and maximum time rays from the center of the ellipsoid to the mirror surface and back again. &lt;/div&gt;

It turns out that trajectories allowed by Fermat's principle don't strictly have to be minimum time trajectories. They can also be maximum time trajectories, as illustrated in figure 3.12. In this case light emitted at point O can be reflected back to point O from four points on the mirror, A, B, C, and D. The trajectories O-A-O and O-C-O are minimum time trajectories while O-B-O and O-D-O are maximum time trajectories.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Introductory Physics fig 3.13.png|Figure 3.13: Ray trajectories from a point O being focused to another point I by a lens]]&lt;br&gt;
Figure 3.13: Ray trajectories from a point O being focused to another point I by a lens. &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 3.13 illustrates a rather peculiar situation. Notice that ''all'' the rays from point O which intercept the lens end up at point I. This would seem to contradict Fermat's principle, in that only the minimum (or maximum) time trajectories should occur. However, a calculation shows that all the illustrated trajectories in this particular case take the ''same'' time. Thus, the light cannot choose one trajectory over another using Fermat's principle and all of the trajectories are equally favored. Note that this inference applies not to just any set of trajectories, but only those going from one focal point to another.

=== Math Tutorial - Four-Vectors ===

We have seen that a wave is described by four numbers, the components of the spatial vector '''k''', and the frequency &amp;omega;

In special relativity these four numbers form a four-vector

It is called a ''four''-vector because it has 3 spacelike components, forming a vector, and one timelike component when there are 3 space dimensions. It is called a four-''vector'' because of the way it behaves when we change reference frames.

The spacelike component of the wave four-vector is just  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; when there are 3 space dimensions, while the timelike component is &lt;math&gt;\omega/c&lt;/math&gt; where the ''c'' is in the denominator to give the timelike component the same dimensions as the spacelike component. 

Let us define some terminology. We indicate a four-vector by underlining and write the components in the following way: &lt;math&gt;\underline{k} = (k , \omega /c )&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\underline{k}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave four-vector, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is its spacelike component, and &lt;math&gt;\omega /c&lt;/math&gt; is its timelike component. For three space dimensions, where we have a wave vector rather than just a wavenumber, we write &lt;math&gt;\underline{k} = (k , \omega /c )&lt;/math&gt;.

Another example of a four-vector is simply the position vector in spacetime, &lt;math&gt;\underline{x} = ( x, ct )&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\underline{x} = ( \mathbf{x}, ct )&lt;/math&gt; in three space dimensions. The &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; ''multiplies'' the timelike component in this case, because that is what is needed to give it the same dimensions as the spacelike component.

In three dimensions we define a vector as a quantity with magnitude and direction. Extending this to spacetime, a four-vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction in spacetime. Implicit in this definition is the notion that the vector's magnitude is a quantity independent of coordinate system or reference frame. We have seen that the invariant interval in spacetime is 

:&lt;math&gt;I = \sqrt{x^2 - c^2 t^2}&lt;/math&gt;, 

so it makes sense to identify this as the magnitude of the position vector. This leads to a way of defining a dot product of four-vectors. 

Given two four-vectors 

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} = ( \mathbf{A} ,A_t ) \quad 
\underline{B} = ( \mathbf {B} , B_t )&lt;/math&gt;
then  the dot product is 
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{B} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} -
	A_t B_t \quad \mbox{(dot product in spacetime)} &lt;/math&gt;

This is consistent with the definition of invariant interval if we set 
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} = \underline{B} = \underline{x}&lt;/math&gt;,

since then 

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{x} \cdot \underline{x} = x^2 - c^2 t^2 = I^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, the key point about dot products for 3-vectors is that they are scalars, independent of the observer. They do not change if the axes are rotated, as was proven earlier.

For our definition of the dot product of four-vectors to be useful, it should also be independent of the observer. In particular, it should not depend on the observers velocity, else it would violate the principle of relativity.

We can easily check that our definition does satisfy this criterion.

It's clear that its independent of rotation, since it is the difference between a dot product and the product of two scalars, both of which terms aren't affected by rotating the coordinates.

Is it also frame velocity independent?

To check, first we need to be able to write down our four-vectors in the new reference frame. We know how to do this for the position vector &amp;mdash; use the Lorentz transform. It can be shown that the same transform must hold for all vectors &lt;!-- an exercise for the reader --&gt;, so the components of a four vector in the new reference frame, moving at velocity v along the ''x''-axis  with respect to the previous one, are

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
A'_x &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( A_x - \frac{v}{c} A_t \right) 
\\ A'_y &amp; = &amp; A_y \\ A'_z &amp; = &amp; A_z \\
A'_t &amp; = &amp; \gamma \left( -\frac{v}{c} A_x + A_t \right)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product in this frame is

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A'} \cdot \underline{B'} =
 A'_x B'_x + A'_y B'_y + A'_z B'_z - A'_t B'_t &lt;/math&gt; 

Simplifying, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\underline{A'} \cdot \underline{B'} &amp; = &amp; 
\gamma^2 \left( A_x B_x -\frac{v}{c} (A_x B_t + A_t B_x) + \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; &amp; +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z &amp;\\
 &amp; &amp; - \gamma^2 \left( \frac{v^2}{c^2}A_x B_x -\frac{v}{c} (A_x B_t + A_t B_x) + A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; \left(1- \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{-1} \left( A_x B_x  + \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_t B_t \right) \\
&amp; &amp; +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z \\  
&amp; &amp; - \left(1- \frac{v^2}{c^2} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{v^2}{c^2} A_x B_x  - A_t B_t \right) \\
 &amp; = &amp; A_x B_x  +  A_y B_y + A_z B_z   - A_t B_t 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is just the dot product in the original frame, exactly as we wanted.

We now know that the dot product of two four-vectors is a &lt;i&gt;scalar&lt;/i&gt; result, i. e., its value is independent of coordinate system.  This can be used to advantage on occasion.

In the odd geometry of spacetime it is not obvious what ''perpendicular'' means.  We therefore &lt;i&gt;define&lt;/i&gt; two four-vectors &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\underline{B}&lt;/math&gt; to be perpendicular if their dot product is zero, in the same way as with three-vectors.

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Because the dot product is a scalar, if vectors are perpendicular in one frame, they will be perpendicular in all frames.

We can also consider the dot product of a four-vector &lt;math&gt;\underline{A}&lt;/math&gt; which resolves into &lt;math&gt;(A_x , A_t )&lt;/math&gt; in the unprimed frame.  Let us further suppose that the spacelike component is zero in some primed frame, so that the components in this frame are (0, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;t'&lt;/sub&gt; ) The fact that the dot product is independent of coordinate system means that 

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{A} \cdot \underline{A} = A_x^2 - A_t^2 = - A_t'^2&lt;/math&gt;

This constitutes an extension of the spacetime Pythagorean theorem to four-vectors other then the position four-vector. Thus, for instance, the wavenumber for some wave may be zero in the primed frame, which means that the wavenumber and frequency in the unprimed frame are related to the frequency in the primed frame by &lt;math&gt;k^2 - \omega^2 / c^2 = - \omega'^2 / c^2&lt;/math&gt;.


===Proper time===

Classically, the temporal derivative, ''d''/''dt'' acts like a scalar so we can multiply a vector by it, and get another vector.

In relativity ''t'' is part of a four-vector, which means ''d''/''dt'' also is, so we can't simply differentiate vectors with respect to ''t'' and expect to expect to get vectors.

For example, the position of a stationary particle is (0, ''ct'').

Viewed from a frame moving at ''v'' to the right, its position becomes (-''v''&amp;tau;, ''c''&amp;tau;), where &amp;tau;=&amp;gamma;''t'' is the time as measured in the moving frame.

If we differentiate with respect to &amp;tau; the velocity would be (-''v'', ''c'')

If we differentiate with respect to ''t'', we get (0, ''c'') in the stationary frame, which would be (using the Lorentz transform) (-&amp;gamma;''v'', -&amp;gamma;''c'') in the moving frame, if this were a four vector.

These two expressions differ by a factor of &amp;gamma;, when measured in the same frame, so this can not be a four vector.

However, if the moving observer divides by &amp;gamma;, which is the time dilation, they will get the same vector as the stationary observer.

Doing this is equivalent to differentiating by the time ''in the particles own rest frame''. Since this works for the position vector, we can expect it to work for all vectors.

The time measured in a particle's rest frame is called its ''proper time''.

Differentiating a vector with respect to proper time gives another vector, which is the relativistic equivalent of the temporal derivative.

===An application of relativity to waves ===

Returning to the phase of a wave, we immediately see that

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} - \omega t =
	\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x} - ( \omega /c)(ct)
	= \underline{k} \cdot \underline{x} .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a compact way to write a wave is
&lt;math&gt;A( \underline{x} ) = \sin ( \underline{k} \cdot \underline{x} ) .&lt;/math&gt;(6.8)

Since &lt;math&gt;\underline{x}&lt;/math&gt; is known to be a four-vector and since the phase of a wave is known to be a scalar independent of reference frame, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\underline{k}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a four-vector rather than just a set of numbers.  Thus, the square of the length of the wave four-vector must also be a scalar independent of reference frame

:&lt;math&gt;\underline{k} \cdot \underline{k} =
	\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k} - \omega^2 / c^2 = const .&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
[[image:Introductory_Physics_fig_5.2.png|Figure 5.2: Resolution of a four-vector into components in two different reference frames.]] Resolution of a four-vector into components in two different reference frames.&lt;/div&gt;

Let us review precisely what this means. As this figure shows, we can resolve a position four-vector ''x'' into components in two different reference frames, e.g (''X'',''T'') and (''X&amp;prime;'',''T&amp;prime;''), but these are just different ways of writing the same vector.

This is exactly the same as the way a three-vector has different components in a rotated frame.

Similarly, just as a three-vector has the same magnititude in all frames, so does a 4-vector; i.e,

:&lt;math&gt;X^2-c^2 T^2 = X^{\prime 2} - c^2 T^{\prime 2}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Applying this to the wave four-vector, we infer that 

:&lt;math&gt;k^2-c^{-2} \omega^2 = k^{\prime 2} - c^{-2} \omega^{\prime 2}&lt;/math&gt;

where the unprimed and primed values of ''k'' and &amp;omega;  refer to the components of the wave four-vector in two different reference frames.

Up to now, this argument applies to any wave. However, waves can be divided into two categories, those for which a ''special'' reference frame exists, and those for which there is no such special frame. 

As an example of the former, sound waves look simplest in the reference frame in which the gas carrying the sound is stationary. The same is true of light propagating through a material medium with an index of refraction not equal to unity. In both cases the speed of the wave is the same in all directions only in the frame in which the material medium is stationary.

If there is no material medium, then there is no unambiguous way of finding a special frame so the waves must fall into the second category. This includes all waves in a vacuum, such as light.

In this case the following argument can be made. An observer moving with respect to waves of frequency &amp;omega; and wave number ''k'' sees waves of frequency &amp;omega;&amp;prime; and wave number ''k&amp;prime;''. If the observer can tell in any way that they come from a source moving with respect to them, then they can use this to identify a special frame for those waves, so the waves must look just like ones from a stationary source of frequency &amp;omega;

This forces us to conclude that for such waves

:&lt;math&gt; \omega^2= c^2 k^2 + \mu^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;mu; is a constant. All waves in a vacuum must have this form, a much more restricted choice than in classical physics.

In classical physics, &amp;omega; and ''k'' for light are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = c k  \,&lt;/math&gt;

In relativistic physics, we've seen that for waves with no special reference frame, such as light, &amp;omega; and ''k'' are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 + \mu^2  \,&lt;/math&gt;

If &amp;mu;=0 then the relativistic equation reduces to the classical, so we can assume that, for light, &amp;mu; does equal zero. 

This means that light does not have a mimimum frequency.

If &amp;mu; is not zero then the wave being described are dispersive. The phase speed is
	
:&lt;math&gt;u_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{c^2 + \frac{\mu^2}{k^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

This phase speed always exceeds ''c'', which at first may seem like an unphysical conclusion. However, the group velocity of the wave is
	
:&lt;math&gt;u_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{kc^2}{\sqrt{k^2c^2+\mu^2}}
= \frac{kc^2}{\omega} = \frac{c^2}{u_p}&lt;/math&gt;

which is always less than ''c''. Since wave packets and hence signals propagate at the group velocity, waves of this type are physically reasonable even though the phase speed exceeds the speed of light.

Another interesting property of such waves is that the wave four-vector is parallel to the world line of a wave packet in spacetime. This is easily shown by the following argument. 

The spacelike component of a wave four-vector is '''k''', while the timelike component is &amp;omega;/''c'' . The slope of the four-vector on a spacetime diagram is therefore &amp;omega;/''kc''. However, the slope of the world line of a wave packet moving with group velocity is ''c''/''u&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is also &amp;omega;/''kc'' .

Note that when we have ''k'' is zero we have &amp;omega;=&amp;mu;. In this case the group velocity of the wave is zero. For this reason we sometimes call &amp;mu; the rest frequency of the wave.

The Doppler Effect

You have probably heard how the pitch of a train horn changes as it passes you. When the train is approaching, the pitch or frequency is higher than when it is moving away from you. This is called the Doppler effect. A similar, but distinct effect occurs if you are moving past a source of sound. If a stationary whistle is blowing, the pitch perceived from a moving car is higher while moving toward the source than when moving away. The first case thus has a moving source, while the second case has a moving observer.

In this section we will compute the Doppler effect as it applies to light moving through a vacuum. The figure below shows the geometry for computing the time between wave fronts of light for a stationary and a moving reference frame. 

*The time between wavefronts for the ''stationary'' observer, in the ''stationary'' frame, is ''T''.  

*The time between wavefronts for the ''moving'' observer, in the ''stationary'' frame, is ''T&amp;prime;''.  

*The time between wavefronts for the ''moving'' observer, in the ''stationary'' frame, is &amp;tau;

Since the world lines of the wave fronts have a slope of unity, the sides of the shaded triangle both have the same value, ''C''. If the observer is moving at speed ''U'' , the slope of the observer's world line is ''c''/''U'', i.e

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{U}=\frac{cT+X}{X}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving this for ''X'' and substituting in give ''cT&amp;prime;''=''cT''+''X'' gives

:&lt;math&gt;T'=\frac{T}{1-\frac{U}{c}} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

In classical physics ''T&amp;prime;'' and &amp;tau; are the same so this formula, as it stands, leads directly to the classical Doppler shift for a moving observer. 

However, in relativity ''T&amp;prime;'' and &amp;tau; are different. We can use the Lorentz transformation to correct for this.

The second wavefront passes the moving observer at (''UT&amp;prime;'',''cT&amp;prime;'') in the stationary observers frame, but at (0,''c''&amp;tau;) in its own frame. The Lorentz transform tells us that.

:&lt;math&gt;c\tau = \gamma \left( cT'-\frac{U}{c}UT' \right) 
= cT' \gamma \left( 1 - \frac{U^2}{c^2} \right) = cT'/ \gamma &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in equation (1) gives

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\tau &amp; = &amp; T \frac{ \sqrt{ 1 - U^2/c^2 }}{1-U/c} \\
&amp; = &amp; T \sqrt{ \frac{ (1-U/c)(1+U/c)}{(1-U/c)^2}} \\
&amp; = &amp; T \sqrt{ \frac{c+U}{c-U} } 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

From this we infer the relativistic Doppler shift formula for light in a vacuum:
	
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\prime}= \omega \sqrt{ \frac{c-U}{c+U} } &lt;/math&gt;

since frequency is inversely proportional to time.

We could go on to determine the Doppler shift resulting from a moving source. However, by the principle of relativity, the laws of physics should be the same in the reference frame in which the observer is stationary and the source is moving. Furthermore, the speed of light is still ''c'' in that frame. Therefore, the problem of a stationary observer and a moving source is conceptually the same as the problem of a moving observer and a stationary source when the wave is moving at speed ''c''. 

This is unlike the case for, say, sound waves, where the stationary observer and the stationary source yield different formulas for the Doppler shift.

In classical physics, velocities simply add. If an object moves with speed ''u'' in one reference frame, which is itself moving at ''v'' with respect to a second frame, the object moves at speed ''u''+''v'' in that second frame.

This is inconsistant with relativity because it predicts that if the speed of light is ''c'' in the first frame it will be ''v''+''c'' in the second.

We need to find an alternative formula for combining velocities. We can do this with the Lorentz transform.

Because the factor ''v''/''c'' will keep recurring we shall call that ratio &amp;beta;.

We are considering three frames; frame O, frame O' which moves at speed ''u'' with respect to frame O, and frame O&quot; which moves at speed ''v'' with respect to frame O'.

We want to know the speed of O&quot; with respect to frame O,''U'' which would classically be ''u''+''v''.

The transforms from O to O' and O' to O&quot; can be written as matrix equations,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ ct' \end{pmatrix} = 
\gamma \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta \\ -\beta &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ t'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma' 
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta' \\ -\beta' &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x' \\ ct' \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where we are defining the &amp;beta;'s and &amp;gamma;'s as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\beta = \frac{u}{c} &amp; \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2 }} \\
\beta^\prime = \frac{v}{c} &amp; 
\gamma^\prime  = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\beta^\prime}^2 }} 
\end{matrix} &lt;/math&gt;

We can combine these to get the relationship between the O and O&quot; coordinates simply by multiplying the matrices, giving

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \gamma^\prime 
\begin{pmatrix} 1+\beta \beta' &amp; - (\beta + \beta') \\
- (\beta + \beta')  &amp; 1+\beta \beta'  \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

This should be the same as the Lorentz transform between the two frames,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = 
\gamma'' \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \beta'' \\ -\beta'' &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} \quad (2) \mbox{  where }
\begin{matrix} \beta'' &amp; = &amp; \frac{U}{c} \\
\gamma'' &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-{\beta''}^2 }} \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

These two sets of equations do look similar. We can make them look more similar still by taking a factor of 1+&amp;beta;&amp;beta;' out of the matrix in (1) giving#

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix} x'' \\ ct'' \end{pmatrix} = \gamma \gamma' (1+\beta \beta')  
\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; - \frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'} \\
- \frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'}  &amp; 1+  \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ ct \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

This will be identical with equation 2 if

:&lt;math&gt;\beta''=\frac{\beta + \beta'}{1+\beta \beta'} \mbox{ (3a)   and } 
\gamma'' = \gamma \gamma' (1+\beta \beta')  \mbox{ (3b)}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the two equations ''must'' give identical results, we know these conditions must be true.

Writing the &amp;beta;'s in terms of the velocities equation 3a becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{U}{c}=\frac{\frac{u}{c} + \frac{v}{c}}{1+\frac{uv}{c^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which tells us ''U'' in terms of ''u'' and ''v''.

A little algebra shows that this implies equation 3b is also true &lt;!-- exercise --&gt;

Multiplying by ''c'' we can finally write.

&lt;math&gt;U = \frac{u+v}{1+\frac{uv}{c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that if ''u'' or ''v'' is much smaller than ''c'' the denominator is approximately 1, and the velocities approximately add but if either ''u'' or ''v'' is ''c'' then so is ''U'', just as we expected.

'''Veal''' is [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat]] from calves, the young of cattle. It is much softer, tender, pale and less strongly flavored than [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]. This is because the calves are milk-fed and do not have much iron in their bodies. (Iron is used to make haemoglobin and myoglobin, respectively the red oxygen-carrying proteins in blood and muscle tissue.) They also have not developed much muscle.

You may find that some guests reject veal, believing that the calves are restricted to a small dark crate to cut costs or to keep the flesh pale and tender. (Of course, many people would not be bothered by this.) To varying degrees, such practices are illegal now.

[[Image:Spruitjes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brussels sprouts]]

'''Brussels sprouts''' are a member of the ''brassica'' family, resembling a miniature cabbage. This is a vegetable that people either love or hate, with few remaining neutral in the face of its distinctive flavor and odor. Most people severely overcook this vegetable, then attempt to bury their mistake in thick creamy [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauces]].

Brussels sprouts were first cultivated in Belgium, and are therefore named after its capital, Brussels.

Brussels sprouts grow on long thick stalks, from which they must be picked off, usually by hand. In the UK, they are a traditional winter vegetable, and are often eaten boiled with a roast dinner. They can also be [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir fried]] or made into [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]].

According to a survey in 2002, Brussels sprouts are Britain's most hated vegetable. Brussels sprout aficionados attribute the hatred of the sprouts to overcooking, pointing out that if this is avoided, the vegetable possesses a delicious, delicate flavour.

==Preparation and Cooking==

Slice off the base of the stem and remove the outer layer or two of leaves, which may have become battered during transport and storage, and wash the bud well. Brussels sprouts are a small vegetable, so they are generally cooked whole. It's wise to cut a small cross in the base to let the water in and let the sprout cook evenly. Alternatively, they can be halved. Overcooking is a common problem with brussels sprouts, it will make them soggy and discoloured, and release the strong 'cabbagy' odour of all brassicas. Whole brussels sprouts have a cooking time from 4 minutes to [[Cookbook:blanching|blanch]] to 10 minutes to cook large sprouts thoroughly. It's best to taste test the sprouts during cooking to see whether they have the desired tenderness. Steaming time ranges from 8 to 15 minutes. When done, the Brussels sprouts should be bright green. 

Brussels sprouts can also be [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]] with a little [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]. At [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|450°F]], they take about 40 minutes or until about half the outsides of the sprouts are dark.

Simple serving suggestions include sprinkling the sprouts with lemon juice, salt, fresh nutmeg, or grated cheese, possibly with a light coating of butter or olive oil. 

==Seasonality==

{{Seasonality|Brussels Sprouts|3|3|2|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3}}

Brussels sprouts are a typical winter vegetable. Frost is generally considered to improve their flavor, which means, that though they are available from october or earlier, the real season starts in november.

[[Image:Romanesco Broccoli.jpg|right|thumb|A head of broccoflower]]
A '''broccoflower''' (also known as '''romanesco broccoli''') is a hybrid created by crossing [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] with the related [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]]. It has a very unusual apearance, being a bright yellow-green with spiky florets. Another variety is identical in shape to the cauliflower, but with lime-green flesh. Both taste more like cauliflower than broccoli, and are generally served [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] or lightly [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]].

'''Venison''' is the meat of the deer and related species. As with the meat of other large animals, it is eaten as [[Cookbook:Steak|steaks]], roasts, [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausages]] and ground meat. [[Cookbook:Organ Meat|Organ meats]] are sometimes eaten but would not be called venison. Venison is lower in calories, cholesterol and fat than common cuts of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] or [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]].

==Types of venison==
[[Image:Elk_Fawn_in_Grand_Teton_NP_-NPS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|elk (fawn)]]

Deer live in woodlands all over Europe, Asia, northern Africa and America. There are many deer species of various sizes but all the males grow antlers. The meat is lean and has a gamey flavor that can be made milder if soaked overnight.

Elk meat tastes like mild (almost sweet) beef, with only a very faint venison flavor. Elk can be substituted equally for venison in most standard venison recipes. Elk are from North America, Europe, and Asia.

Moose is the largest member of the venison family standing about 6 1/2 feet at the shoulder. It’s native from North America. The meat is similar to elk.

Caribou (reindeer) are slightly larger than white-tailed deer. Both males and females have antlers. The meat is somewhat sweeter than other venison. They live primarily in North America and Siberia.

Antelope are currently farmed in Texas, where black buck and nilgai antelope, native to Africa, are allowed to roam on huge preserves. Males are called bucks, bulls, or stags; females, does or cows; and unweaned young are fawns or calves. Antelope meat is leaner, but similar in taste, to that of deer.

Pronghorn (once classified as &quot;antelope&quot;) is the last survivor of a species native to North America, with the largest herd in Wyoming. Pronghorn meat is leaner, but similar in taste, to that of deer.

==Venison as &quot;red&quot; meat==

All venison is red meat.  The coloring comes from myoglobin, a protein in muscle tissue that stores oxygen for later use, and not from blood, which is red due to hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen throughout the body.

In extremely fresh meat, the myoglobin is a dark purple color, but it quickly brightens to cherry red when exposed to oxygen in the air, usually within 15 minutes.  Over several days, the meat will darken to a brown color as the oxidation of the meat continues.

==Cooking guidelines==

The tenderness of a particular cut of venison is similar to the corresponding cut of domestically-raised meat. All game tends to be leaner than that of domesticated animals, which have been bred for tenderness and fat marbling. Overcooking can toughen venison. You can use moist heat, basting, and larding or barding (inserting slivers of fat or wrapping in bacon) to help keep the meat tender during cooking. Fast searing over high heat can also work for smaller cuts, such as tenderloin medallions or rib chops.

[[Image:Broccoli plant.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Broccoli.]]

'''Broccoli''' is a member of the ''brassica'' family, like [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] and [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]. The part of the plant that is eaten is actually an undeveloped flower head with many tiny flower buds crowded onto it. When left to grow, the heads turn a bright yellow. Broccoli with yellow buds should be avoided, as this is a clear indication that the broccoli is old.

== Types ==

The most common type of broccoli is green, and is also known as '''calabrese'''. '''Purple sprouting broccoli''' has a purple tinge to the heads and is finer and leafier than the calabrese with smaller heads. As its name suggests, it is harvested closer to sprouting age, making it softer and bendier. A less common variety is the '''white sprouting broccoli''', which behaves much like its purple brother.

== Buying broccoli ==

* When buying broccoli, look for clean stems that are not dry or split.
* Avoid broccoli with yellow buds, as this is a sign of age.
* When buying sprouting broccoli, the stalks should bend flexibly without breaking.
* Broccoli is best when kept in the fridge no longer than two days.

== Preparation and use ==
=== Cooking ===
Broccoli can be eaten raw, lightly cooked, roasted, or slow-cooked.

Broccoli can be eaten raw although many people prefer it once it has been lightly [[Cookbook:Blanching|blanched]] or cooked more thoroughly. If it is overcooked it takes on a yellow-brown cast and becomes mushy, so handle it with care. Properly cooked standard broccoli is very bright green, having lost the bluish cast of raw broccoli but not gained any hint of a yellow-brown cast.

Because it only needs a very light cooking, broccoli is usually added to recipes near the end of their cooking time, and it is ideal for [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-frying]] or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]]. The stem, cut into thin disks, goes well in stir-fry as if it were a different vegetable than the flower buds.

Broccoli can be [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]]; a thin coating of oil is useful to prevent drying out and burning, and cooking at high temperature (425°F, 220°C) yields a crisped exterior. Cut into pieces, toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic, then roast for 30–40 minutes.

Alternatively, broccoli can be [[Cookbook:Braising|braised]] or [[Cookbook:Stewing|stewed]] slowly for a long time.

=== Stem ===
The thick stem is usually cut off, but it is edible and tastes  the same as the florets. The only difference is that the outside is rather fibrous. Slicing crosswise into thin disks will solve this problem; alternately, and more wastefully, the stem can be peeled or trimmed to remove the tough part. Note that the thick green outside can easily be peeled off by hand (once peel is started with a knife), but the fibrous part is actually a thin layer inside the outer peel, and the fibers require a peeler or knife to remove.

The stem can be peeled, chopped or finely sliced and used in [[:Category:Casserole recipes|casseroles]] because it withstands more cooking than the florets. Stems can also commonly be seen in grocery stores in matchstick or julienne form, packaged as broccoli slaw.

=== Purple sprouting broccoli ===
Unlike the calabrese, purple sprouting broccoli can cooked whole, with leaves and stem attached.

=== In dishes ===
Steamed broccoli goes very well with [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].

Broccoli may be added to chicken or [[Cookbook:Turkey Soup|turkey soup]], and to [[Cookbook:Omelet|omelets]].

Broccoli goes very well on [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]], but must be protected from drying and then burning. A thin coating of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] will do the job. It can be expedient and efficient to use the oil from an [[Cookbook:Anchovy|anchovy]] can, assuming one also puts anchovies on the pizza. Place chopped broccoli in a bowl twice as large as needed to hold the broccoli. Pour the oil over the top, then work the oil in with your hands.

== Seasonality ==

{{Seasonality|Broccoli|1|1|1|1|1|2|2|3|3|2|1|1}}

The calabrese broccoli season starts slowly in the summer, and peaks in the autumn.

{{Seasonality|Broccoli (sprouting)|2|3|3|2|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1}}

Purple and white sprouting broccoli have their seasons in the late winter, making them ideal for bridging the gap between the winter and spring vegetables.

Out of season broccoli can be imported from countries near the equator. It is sometimes available frozen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An angle is the union of two rays with a common endpoint, called the ''vertex''.  The angles formed by vertical and horizontal lines are called right angles; lines, segments, or rays that intersect in right angles are said to be perpendicular. 

Angles, for our purposes, can be measured in either degrees (from 0 to 360) or radians (from 0 to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;). Angles length can be determined by measuring along the arc they map out on a circle. In radians we consider the length of the arc of the circle mapped out by the angle. Since the circumference of a circle is &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, a right angle is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; radians. In degrees, the circle is 360 degrees, and so a right angle would be 90 degrees.

==Naming Conventions==
Angles are named in several ways.
*By naming the vertex of the angle (only if there is only one angle formed at that vertex; the name must be non-ambiguous) &lt;math&gt;\angle B&lt;/math&gt;
*By naming a point on each side of the angle with the vertex in between. &lt;math&gt;\angle ABC&lt;/math&gt;
*By placing a small number on the interior of the angle near the vertex.
Hai

== Classification of Angles by Degree Measure ==
'''Acute Angle'''
*an angle is said to be acute if it measures between 0 and 90 degrees, exclusive.
[[File:Ángulo agudo.svg|150px|Acute Angle]]

'''Right Angle'''
*an angle is said to be right if it measures 90 degrees.
*notice the small box placed in the corner of a right angle, unless the box is present it is not assumed the angle is 90 degrees.
*all right angles are congruent
[[File:Right angle.svg|100px]]

'''Obtuse Angle'''
*an angle is said to be obtuse if it measures between 90 and 180 degrees, exclusive.
[[File:Ángulo obtuso.svg|150px|Obtuse Angle]]

== Special Pairs of Angles ==
*adjacent angles
**adjacent angles are angles with a common vertex and a common side.  
**adjacent angles have no interior points in common.

* complementary angles
**complementary angles are two angles whose sum is 90 degrees.
**complementary angles may or may not be adjacent.
**if two complementary angles are adjacent, then their exterior sides are perpendicular.
*supplementary angles
**two angles are said to be supplementary if their sum is 180 degrees.  
**supplementary angles need not be adjacent.  
**if supplementary angles are adjacent, then the sides they do not share form a line.
*linear pair
**if a pair of angles is both adjacent and supplementary, they are said to form a linear pair.
*vertical angles
**angles with a common vertex whose sides form opposite rays are called vertical angles.  
**vertical angles are congruent.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

[[Probability]] theory provides a mathematical model for the study of randomness and uncertainty.  Many important decisions, whether from business, government, science, recreation or even one's personal life must be made with incomplete information or some degree of uncertainty.  Hence, a formalized study of uncertain or random outcomes occupies an important role in modern society. In situations where one of any number of possible outcomes may occur, the mathematical model of probability theory offers methods for quantifying the likelihoods associated with those outcomes.  Probability also provides tools which allow us to move beyond simply describing the information contained within a set of data (descriptive statistics) to actually inferring further information from that data (inferential statistics).  Many of the early attempts to model likelihood arose from games of chance.  For a brief history of probability see [[w:Probability#History|this]] Wikipedia article.

Although probability theory is now a very formal branch of mathematics, the language of probability is often used informally in everyday speech.  We express our beliefs about likelihoods of outcomes in situations involving uncertainty using intuition guided by our experiences and in some cases statistics.  Consider the following examples:

*Bill says &quot;Don't buy the avocados here; about half the time, they're rotten&quot;.  Bill is expressing his belief about the probability of an event &amp;mdash; that an avocado will be rotten &amp;mdash; based on his personal experience.
*Lisa says &quot;I am 95% certain the capital of Spain is Barcelona&quot;.  Here, the belief Lisa is expressing is only a probability from her point of view, because only she does not know that the capital of Spain is Madrid (from our point of view, the probability is 100%).  However, we can still view this as a subjective probability because it expresses a measure of uncertainty.  It is as though Lisa is saying &quot;in 95% of cases where I feel as sure as I do about this, I turn out to be right&quot;.
* Susan says &quot;There is a lower chance of being shot in Omaha than in Detroit&quot;.  Susan is expressing a belief based (presumably) on statistics.
*Dr. Smith says to Christina, &quot;There is a 75% chance that you will live.&quot; Dr. Smith is basing this off of his research.
*Nicolas says &quot;It will probably rain tomorrow.&quot; In this case the likelihood that it will rain is expressed in vague terms and is subjective, but implies that the speaker believes it is greater than 1/2 (or 50%).  Subjective probabilities have been extensively studied, especially with regards to gambling and securities markets.  While this type of probability is important, it is not the subject of this book.  A good reference is &quot;Degrees of Belief&quot; By Steven Vick (2002).

Notice that in the previous examples the likelihood of any particular outcome is expressed as a percentage (between 0% and 100%), as is common in everyday language.  However, probabilities in formal probability theory are always expressed as real numbers in the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. a probability of .25 may be expressed as 25%, or a probability of &lt;math&gt;1/\pi&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed as approximately 31.83%).  Other differences exist between common expressions of probabilities and formal probability theory.  For example, a probability of 0% is typically taken to mean that the event to which that probability is assigned is impossible.  However, in probability theory (usually in cases where there are infinitely many possible outcomes) an event ascribed a probability of zero may actually occur.  In some situations, it is certain that such an event will occur (e.g. in selecting a real number between 0 and 1, the probability of selecting any given number is zero, but it is certain that one such number will be selected).

Another way to express the probability of an outcome is by its ''odds'': the ratio of the probability of &quot;success&quot; (event occurs) to the probability of &quot;failure&quot; (event does not occur).  In gambling odds are expressed as the ratio of the [[w:Graded_stakes_race|stakes]] risked by each participant in a wager.  For instance: a [[w:Bookmaker|bookmaker]] offering odds of 3 to 1 &quot;against&quot; a horse will pay a [[w:Gambler|punter]] three times their stake (if the horse wins).  In fact, the bookmaker (ignoring factors such as his potential need to &quot;lay off&quot; bets which are exposing him to the possibility of an unacceptable overall loss) is announcing that he thinks the horse has a 1/4 chance of winning.  If we express odds as &quot;chance of winning&quot; : &quot; chance of not winning&quot;, then 3 to 1 against would be represented as 1:3 = 1/4:3/4 or 1/3.  So an event with a probability of 1/4 or 25% has odds of 33%.  This disparity is even more clear where an event has a probability of 50% (e.g., the odds of a coin showing heads is 50%:50% = 1:1 or 1).

==Types of probability==

As mentioned earlier, probability can be expressed informally in a variety of different ways, but even formal definitions and approaches vary.  The most general and rigorous approach is known as axiomatic probability theory, which will be the focus of later chapters.  Here we briefly discuss a few other approaches, their uses and limitations.  All of these approaches rely in one way or another on the concept of an ''experiment''.  Recall that probability provides means to study randomness and uncertainty.

An '''experiment''' is any action or process whose outcome is subject to uncertainty or randomness.

Here the term experiment is used in a wider sense than its usual connotation with controlled laboratory situations.  Further clarification on experiments will be given later, but for now the following examples of experiments will suffice:
* observing whether or not a commercial product is defective.
* tossing a coin one or more times or selecting a card from a card deck.
* conducting a survey.
* measuring the wind speed or rainfall in a particular area.

Assuming that an experiment can be repeated under identical conditions, then each repetition of an experiment is called a ''trial''.

===Basic Concepts===

There are two standard approaches to conceptually interpreting probabilities: the relative frequency approach and the subjective belief (or confidence approach). In the Frequency Theory of Probability, probability is the limit of the relative frequency with which certain outcomes occur in repeated trials (note that the outcome of any single trial cannot depend on the outcome of other trials).  The relative frequency approach requires that experiments be random and that all possible outcomes be known before execution of the experiment. The probability of any set of outcomes is expressed as the relative frequency with which those outcomes will occur among many repeated trials.

Physical probabilities fall within the category of objective or frequency probabilities, and are associated with random physical systems such as roulette wheels, rolling dice and radioactive atoms. In such systems, a given outcome (such as a die yielding a six) tends to occur at a persistent rate, or 'relative frequency', in a long run of trials. Physical probabilities either explain, or are invoked to explain these stable frequencies.

Relative frequency probabilities are always expressed as a figure between 0% (the outcome essentially never happens) and 100% (the outcome essentially always happens), or similarly as a figure between 0 and 1. According to the Frequency Theory of Probability, saying that &quot;the probability that A occurs is p%&quot; means that if you repeat the experiment many times under essentially identical conditions, the percentage of time for which A occurs will converge to p. For example, a 50% chance that a coin lands &quot;heads up&quot; means that if you toss the coin over and over again, then the ratio of times the coin lands heads to the total number of tosses approaches a limiting value of 50% as the number of tosses grows. Notice that the outcome of one toss never depends on another toss, and that the ratio of heads to total number of tosses is always between 0% and 100%.

In the Subjective Theory of Probability, probability measures the speaker's &quot;degree of belief&quot; that a set of outcomes will result, on a scale of 0% (complete disbelief that the event will happen) to 100% (certainty that the event will happen). According to the Subjective Theory, saying that &quot;the probability that A occurs is 2/3&quot; means that I believe that A will happen twice as strongly as I believe that A will not happen. The Subjective Theory is particularly useful in assigning meaning to the probability of outcomes that in principle can occur only once. For example, how might one assign meaning to the following statement: &quot;there is a 25% chance of an earthquake on the San Andreas fault with magnitude 8 or larger before 2050&quot;?  It would be very hard to qualify this measure in terms of relative frequency.

One way to represent an individual's degree of belief in a statement, given available evidence, is with the Bayesian approach.  Evidential probability, also called Bayesian probability, can be assigned to any statement whatsoever, even when no random process is involved. On most accounts evidential probabilities are considered degrees of belief, defined in terms of dispositions to gamble at certain odds. The primary evidential interpretations include the classical interpretation, the subjective interpretation, the epistemic or inductive interpretation, and the logical interpretation.

The next several sections discuss the principal theories within the relative frequency approach to probability.

===Classical theory of probability===

The classical approach to probability expresses probability as a ratio of the number of favorable outcomes in a series of successive trials to the number of total possible outcomes.  Note the immediate implication that the number of total possible outcomes be known.  Furthermore, all possible outcomes are assumed to be equally probably and no two possible outcomes can both result from the same trial.  Here, the term &quot;favorable&quot; is not subjective, but rather indicates that an outcome belongs to a group of outcomes of interest.  This group of outcomes is called an ''event'', which will be formalized with the introduction of axiomatic probability theory.

&lt;center&gt;

|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Classical definition of probability&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|If the number of outcomes belonging to an event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;N_{E}&lt;/math&gt;, and the total number of outcomes is &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, then the ''probability'' of event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;p_{E} = \frac{N_{E}}{N}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

For example, a standard deck of cards (without jokers) has 52 cards.  If we randomly draw a card from the deck, we can think of each card as a possible outcome.  Therefore, there are 52 total outcomes.  We can now look at various events and calculate their probabilities:
*Out of the 52 cards, there are 13 clubs.  Therefore, if the event of interest is drawing a club, there are 13 favorable outcomes, and the probability of this event is &lt;math&gt;\frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
*There are 4 kings (one of each suit).  The probability of drawing a king is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}&lt;/math&gt;.
*What is the probability of drawing a king OR a club?  This example is slightly more complicated.  We cannot simply add together the number of outcomes for each event separately (&lt;math&gt;4 + 13 = 17&lt;/math&gt;) as this inadvertently counts one of the outcomes twice (the king of clubs).  The correct answer is &lt;math&gt;\frac{16}{52}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\frac{13}{52}+\frac{4}{52}-\frac{1}{52}&lt;/math&gt; where this is essentially &lt;math&gt;p(\textrm{club})+p(\textrm{king})-p(\textrm{king\ of\ clubs})&lt;/math&gt;.

Classical probability suffers from a serious limitation.  The definition of probability implicitly defines all outcomes to be equiprobable.  While this might be useful for drawing cards, rolling dice, or pulling balls from urns, it offers no method for dealing with outcomes with unequal probabilities.

This limitation can even lead to mistaken statements about probabilities.  An often given example goes like this:
:I could be hit by a meteor tomorrow.  There are two possible outcomes: I will be hit, or I will not be hit.  Therefore, the probability I will be hit by a meteor tomorrow is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2} = 50%&lt;/math&gt;.
Of course, the problem here is not with the classical theory, merely the attempted application of the theory to a situation to which it is not well adapted.

This limitation does not, however, mean that the classical theory of probability is useless.  At many points in the development of the axiomatic approach to probability, classical theory is an important guiding factor.

===Empirical or Statistical Probability or Frequency of occurrence===

This approach to probability is well-suited to a wide range of scientific disciplines.  It is based on the idea that the underlying probability of an event can be measured by repeated trials.

&lt;center&gt;
{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot; | style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top
|-
|&lt;center&gt;&lt;big&gt;Empirical or Statistical Probability as a measure of frequency&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|-
|Let &lt;math&gt;n_{A}&lt;/math&gt; be the number of times event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; occurs after &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; trials. We define the ''probability'' of event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as 

&lt;math&gt;p_{A} = \lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{n_{A}}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

It is of course impossible to conduct an infinite number of trials.  However, it usually suffices to conduct a large number of trials, where the standard of large depends on the probability being measured and how accurate a measurement we need.

A note on this definition of probability: How do we know the sequence &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_{A}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; in the limit will converge to the same result every time, or that it will converge at all?  The unfortunate answer is that we don't.  To see this, consider an experiment consisting of flipping a coin an infinite number of times.  We are interested in the probability of heads coming up.  Imagine the result is the following sequence:
:''HTHHTTHHHHTTTTHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT''...
with each run of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; heads and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; tails being followed by another run twice as long.  For this example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_{A}}{n}&lt;/math&gt; oscillates between roughly &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; and doesn't converge.

We might expect such sequences to be unlikely, and we would be right.  It will be shown later that the probability of such a run is 0, as is a sequence that converges to anything other than the underlying probability of the event.  However, such examples make it clear that the limit in the definition above does not express convergence in the more familiar sense, but rather some kind of convergence in probability.  The problem of formulating exactly what this means belongs to axiomatic probability theory.

===Axiomatic probability theory===

Although axiomatic probability theory is often frightening to beginners, it is the most general approach to probability and has been employed in tackling some of the more difficult problems in probability.  It begins with a set of axioms which, although not immediately intuitive, are guided by the more familiar classical probability theory.  These axioms are discussed in the (as yet unwritten) following chapter.

'''Roux''' is a base sauce in international cuisines, originally [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]], composed of varying ratios of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (usually [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]), useful for making sauces, and for thickening [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]] or [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravies]]. The benefits of using a roux include: It does not have to be cooked very long to remove a floury taste, clumps of flour are removed, and it creates unique flavors. It can be cooked to different degrees:

*White roux 
*Blonde roux  
*Brown roux 
*Dark/Brick roux
*Burnt roux

Depending upon the intended use, and a darker roux (one that has been cooked longer) will also be thicker and have more flavor, but will have less thickening power.

== Ingredients ==
A basic roux may be composed of equal parts [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] by weight.

== Procedure ==
# Melt the butter in a thick-bottomed sauce pan over medium heat, then add flour. 
# Mix well and cook to desired color, stirring constantly to prevent burning. This may well take up to twenty minutes.

== Oven-Made Roux ==
Some people find it easier to finish a roux in the oven so as not to burn it with direct heat.

===Ingredients===
#1 part fat
#1 part by weight flour


===Procedure===
Preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Heat the oil in a skillet for 10 minutes on medium-high. Stir constantly for 15 minutes until roux starts to brown. Place the skillet in the oven and cook for 1 hour stirring every 15-20 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 and cook for an additional stirring every 15-20 minutes until your roux reaches the desired doneness. The roux may be stored in the freezer in an airtight container indefinitely.

== Notes, tips and variations ==
* Depending upon how you plan to use your roux, you may need to add the sauce's other ingredients before the roux is fully cooked.
* One way to use a roux, is to add liquid to it, stirring it in as you go. Don't go the other way, adding the roux to the liquid, as you will get lumps. Once enough liquid has been added to the roux (you'll know), you can safely add it back into another liquid. 
* A good roux will have a slight shine to it, and neither the texture nor the taste of the flour will be apparent.
* When making a dark roux, switching from butter to an oil with a high [[Cookbook:Smoke Point|smoke point]] (such as [[Cookbook:Soybean Oil|soybean oil]] or [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|Canola oil]]) will allow for a higher cooking temperature, decreasing cooking time. Keep in mind that different fats will give the roux a somewhat different taste.

==Escoffier on Roux==
===White Roux (''Roux blanc'')===
Same quantities as for brown or pale ''roux'', but the time of cooking is limited to a few minutes, as it is only needed, in this case, to do away with the disagreeable taste of flour which is typical of those sauces whose ''roux'' has not been sufficiently cooked.

===Pale Roux (''Roux blond'')===
The quantities are the same as for brown ''roux'', but cooking must cease as soon as the colour of the ''roux'' begins to change, and before the appearance of any colouring whatsoever.
The observations I made relative to brown ''roux'', concerning the thickening element, apply also to pale ''roux''.

===Brown Roux (''Roux brun'')===
''Quantities for making about one pound'':
* 8 ozs. by volume clarified butter
* 8 ozs. by weight flour  

''Preparation.''&amp;mdash;Mix the flour and butter in a very thick saucepan, and put it on the side of the fire or in a moderate oven. Stir the mixture repeatedly so that the heat may be evenly distributed throughout.  Brown ''roux'' is known to be cooked when it has acquired a fine, light brown colour and when it exudes an odour resembling that of the hazel-nut, characteristic of baked flour.
 
It is very important that brown ''roux'' should not be cooked too rapidly.  When cooking takes place with a very high heat in the beginning, the starch gets burned within its shrivelled cells.  The binding principle is thus destroyed, and double or triple the quantity of ''roux'' becomes necessary in order to obtain the required consistency.  But this excess of ''roux'' in the sauce chokes it up without binding it, and prevents it from clearing.  At the same time, the cellulose and the burnt starch lend a bitterness to the sauce of which no subsequent treatment can rid it.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Auguste Escoffier (1907), ''Le Guide culinaire''&lt;/ref&gt;

I'm excited to see how this book takes shape.  One of my great hopes, though, is that the book breaks out of the traditional mold.  I have a recommendation -- tie spectroscopy in to structure &amp; bonding and introduce it early.  Most lab courses these days have students using IR within the first semester, often long before the topic is covered in the lecture part of the course.  I've had good luck teaching IR &quot;out of order,&quot; and I'd like to expand that to UV, MS, and especially NMR in the next few years.  Especially with spectroscopy having gained greater importance than we might have predicted 20-30 years ago, this idea (and this text as a whole) might be a great showcase for an important philosophical change in how we teach organic chemistry.</text>

[[Image:washing_peppers.jpg|right|bell peppers]]

The '''bell pepper''', sometimes ambiguously known simply as &quot;pepper&quot; or &quot;capsicum&quot;, is a type of large mild [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]] that is considered by many to be without heat. Bell peppers are often considered to be merely [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetables]], not [[Cookbook:Spice|spices]], even though some people find them to be slightly hot.

Bell peppers are green while developing and then ripen to a variety of colors, of which red and yellow are the most common but purple and orange are also found. They are edible while still unripe and have a distinctly different (and milder) taste in that state. Compared to green ones, red ones have three times as much vitamin C and 11 times as much beta carotene. Red ones are often heated over a fire, such as a gas [[Cookbook:Range|range]], to remove the skins. Some methods of doing this can add a distinctive smokey flavor. 

Bell peppers are commonly added to [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]], [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir-fry]], and [[Cookbook:Sweet and Sour|sweet and sour]]. They can also be opened at the top and deseeded, then stuffed and [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]].

For general usage: slice in half lengthwise, then remove the stem, core, seeds, and white veins.
==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Bell Pepper|2|2|2|2|2|3|3|3|3|3|3|2}}
Green (unripe) bell peppers are available all year, with their peak season falling between July and November. The ripe varieties are more sensitive to season and will reach their peak towards the end of the green pepper's season.

[[Image:Capsicum0.jpg|thumb|right|inside a chili pepper]]
[[Image:Chilis-2.jpg|thumb|right|chili peppers]]
The '''chilli pepper''' (also spelled chili or chile) is the fruit of the plant ''[[w:Capsicum|capsicum]]'' of the nightshade (''Solanaceae'') family. Cultivated since prehistoric times in Peru and Mexico, it was discovered in the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus. He thought them as a more masculine version of Old World peppers, so he named them ''pimento'' in contrast with ''pimenta''. This however was not understood abroad, which is why many languages know chile as pepper. Diego Alvarez Chanca, a physician on Columbus' second voyage to the West Indies in 1493, brought the first chile peppers to Spain, and first wrote about their medicinal effects in 1494.

Chiles are infamous for their heat, which is caused by the substance [[w:Capsaicin|capsaicin]] (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide). This chemical compound causes pain and inflammation if consumed to excess, and can even burn the skin on contact in high concentrations (habanero peppers, for example, are routinely picked with gloves). It is also the primary ingredient in pepper spray, which is used as a defensive weapon. The &quot;heat&quot; of chili peppers is measured in Scoville Heat Units (SHU). Bell peppers rank at zero SHU, jalapeños at 3000-6000 SHU, and habaneros at 300,000 SHU. The [[w:Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the highest number of Scoville units in a pepper was awarded to the [[w:Carolina_Reaper|Carolina Reaper]] in August, 2013 at 1,569,300 - 2,200,000 SHU.

==Types of Chile Peppers==

The most common species of chile peppers are: ''Capsicum annuum'', which includes many common varieties such as [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]] and [[Cookbook:Jalapeño|jalapeños]]; ''Capsicum frutescens'', which includes [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|cayenne]] and tabasco peppers; ''Capsicum chinense'', which includes the hottest peppers such as [[Cookbook:Habanero|habanero]]s and Scotch bonnets; ''Capsicum pubescens'', which includes the South American rocoto peppers; and ''Capsicum baccatum'', which includes the Ají Amarillo and Lemon drop.

Though there are only a few commonly used species, there are far more cultivars and different ways preparing chile peppers that have different common names for culinary use. Green and red bell peppers, for example, are the same cultivar of ''C. annuum'', with the green ones being immature. In the same species are the jalapeño, the chipotle, which is a dried smoked jalapeño, the poblano, ancho (which is a dried poblano), New Mexico, Anaheim, Serrano, and others. Jamaicans, Scotch bonnets, and habaneros are common varieties of ''C. chinense''. Species ''C. frutescens'' appears as chiles de arbol, aji, pequin, tabasco, cayenne, cherry peppers, and others.

However, every Capsicum species produces edible fruit.

==Consumption and Methods of Preparation==

The fruit is eaten cooked or raw for its fiery hot flavor. [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]], Szechuan and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thai cuisines]] are particularly associated with the chile pepper, although the plant was unknown in [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asia]] until Europeans introduced it there.

Well-known dishes with a strong chile flavor are [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]], New Mexican [[Cookbook:Chili con carne|chili con carne]] and Indian vindaloo. Chili powder is a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] made of the dried ancho chiles plus other seasonings added, such as cumin and oregano.  Bottled [[Cookbook:Red Chile Sauce|hot sauces]] such as Tabasco sauce are made from chiles such as the cayenne (not, oddly, from tabasco peppers, but named for marketing purposes after the town in Mexico), which may also be fermented.

===Consumption by Other Animals===

Since birds don't have the same sensitivity to capsaicin as mammals, chile peppers are a favorite food of many birds living in the chile peppers' natural range (along with many birds living in captivity).  The flesh of the peppers provides the birds with a nutritious meal rich in [[Metabolomics/Nutrition/Vitamin C|vitamin C]].  In return, the seeds of the peppers are distributed by the birds, as they drop the seeds while eating the pods or the seeds pass through the digestive tract unharmed. This relationship is theorized to have promoted the evolution of the protective capsaicin.

==Precautions==
Be careful when handling chiles. For some particularly strong chiles it is advised to wear gloves and to wash them immediately after use. If using bare hands, soak your hands in a soulution of 1 part bleach to 2 parts water, and wash hands immediately afterwards. The bleach will turn the capsiacin into a water-souluble salt. The water will then dissolve it. Do not touch your eyes or any other sensitive body part after handling chilis. If you burn your tongue with chiles, fullfat [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] or [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] is more effective at cooling the mouth - again this is because capsaicin is soluble in fat and alcohol, and because casein sort of blocks capsiacin, but not water; water merely spreads the burn. It's worthwhile to note that [[Cookbook:alcoholic drinks|alcoholic drinks]] will not help much, as one would need to be drinking something over 80% [[Cookbook:alcohol|alcohol]] (160 proof) for any real effect to take place. In all likelihood, the burn from the chile pepper would be preferable to the burn from the high-proof liquid.

== Note on Spelling ==
*Chile is actually the original spelling. When Cristopher Columbus found them, he didn't name them &quot;chili&quot;, as most people think.
*This vegetable is not related to the country [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]], which is not a producer of chili peppers. Note: In Chile, as in many other Spanish-speaking countries, the vegetable is known as ají.

[[Image:Garlic.jpg|right|thumb|Garlic]]
Garlic is a pungently odoriferous member of the ''allium'' family (like [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] and [[Cookbook:Leek|leeks]]). Garlic is generally used as a spice or a seasoning rather than as a vegetable due to its extremely strong flavour. 

Garlic grows in large papery heads. A novice mistake is to massively overgarlic things by following instructions incorrectly. Remember that the large bulb of garlic you buy is NOT one 'clove'. The whole garlic is called a 'head' or 'knob'. Each small, individual segment of a garlic head is a clove. 

==Storing Garlic==

Fresh garlic heads will keep for a long time as long as they are stored in a cool dark place. Do not keep them in the fridge or they will start to sprout and become bitter. They can be frozen without ill-effect, or simply stored in a dark cupboard away from moisture. Garlic braids should be hung to prevent crushing any of the cloves.

If you want to store the cloves individually and ready for use, the garlic must be either dried or processed. One good way to freeze prepared garlic is to crush or mince it in a food processor and mix it with a little water, then freeze it in ice cube trays so you can get cubes out as needed. Otherwise it can be frozen in olive oil, or frozen whole. 

Never EVER store garlic in olive oil at room temperature or leave garlic in oil to sit on the counter. Because garlic is grown in the ground it is frequently contaminated with botulism spores, which are almost impossible to remove. These are harmless in their normal state, but because they are an anaerobic bacteria they will grow if the conditions are 'right' - i.e. submersed in oil and stored at room temperature. The spores can not grow in the cold, so freeze or refrigerate it, or better yet, store the garlic in vodka, wine or vinegar rather than oil.

==Preparing Garlic==

As a rule, the finer you chop or especially crush fresh garlic, the stronger the flavour will be. This is because the flavour compounds are released by breaking cell walls. It is usually crushed with the side of a knife (which also aids in peeling) or finely minced and used to season other dishes, especially [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] recipes. You can also use a [[Cookbook:Garlic press|garlic press]], or bash it in a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|pestle and mortar]] with a bit of salt added to help reduce the garlic to a smooth paste. But it can also be used in slivers or as whole cloves, with a much milder result. Whole cloves are often roasted, and as they cook their flavour changes dramatically to become sweeter and less pungent.

One way to avoid the problem of how much garlic to use in a recipe and how to prepare it without ruining a chopping board and smelling up the kitchen is to buy it precrushed or prechopped in a jar. This type of preprepared garlic keeps basically forever in the fridge or freezer, and the garlic odour can not penetrate the glass. It is milder and often sweeter than fresh garlic because the 'garliciness' declines slightly with time.
Rubbing your hands underwater on any stainless steel utensil will remove garlic odor from them.

==Measurements==

For cooking purposes, garlic is often measured in &quot;cloves&quot;. A word of caution though: Depending on where you are in the world, an average clove can vary from 1 g to 6 g, not to mention the variations in taste. One should also consider the origin of the recipe. 

North American manufacturers of pre-packaged minced garlic consider 2.5 g per clove, although one clove of fresh garlic can easily go up to 6 g in stores. One teaspoon of minced garlic would contain the equivalent of 2 cloves.

===2-2 Shopping-related Verbs===

There are a lot of verbs that have to do with shopping for clothes. The most prominent are listed below.

&lt;b&gt;
anziehen - to put on (clothes)&lt;br&gt;
aussehen - to appear&lt;br&gt;
nehmen - to take&lt;br&gt;
wollen - to want (somewhat impolite)&lt;/b&gt;

These verbs are used often, so it is necessary to learn them. Among them are separable verbs, irregular verbs, and modals.

&lt;big&gt;Separable Verbs&lt;/big&gt;

Anprobieren, aussehen and anziehen are ''separable verbs''. It is easy to see this, as they each have a prefix of 'aus' or 'an'. When using the verb as the main verb of a sentence, separate the prefix and put it at the end of the sentence. When the verb is in infinitive form, leave it just as you see it.

&lt;big&gt;Irregular Verbs&lt;/big&gt;

Ausehen and nehmen are the two irregular verbs on this list. Both experience a change in the first 'e' in the du-form and er/sie/es-form. Du siehst ... aus und er/sie/es sieht ... aus. Du nimmst und er/sie/es nimmt.

&lt;big&gt;Modals&lt;/big&gt;

Möchten and wollen are the two modals introduced here. Modals are similar to the helping verbs in English and cause the other verb to go to the end in the infinitive form. They also have a strange conjugation. Möchten changes in er/sie/es form to möchte (the same as the ich-form). In fact all modals have the same er/sie/es-form and ich-form.

Wollen is like most other modals: it has a different vowel in singular and plural, except when using formal you. Ich will (not to be confused with future tense), du willst, er/sie/es will, wir wollen, ihr wollt, und sie/Sie wollen.

All of this verb conjugation and more can be found in [[German/Appendix 4|Reference Table II]].

==3 Accusative Case==
You have already learned the pronouns and articles in the ''nominative case''. Now it is time for the ''accusative case''.

===3-1 Example Story 2===

You now need more clothes. You drive to a mall and go to the clothing department store.

Du suchst zwei Jeans, drei Hemden und einen Gürtel. Du siehst die Jeans und nimmst zwei. Du kaufst jetzt nur die Hemden und den Gürtel.

VERKÄUFERIN: Die Gürtel sind da.&lt;br&gt;
DU: Haben Sie auch Gürtel in Braun?&lt;br&gt;
VERKÄUFERIN: Ja, da hinten.

Du nimmst den Gürtel in Braun, aber er ist billig. Du kaufst zwei.

VERKÄUFERIN: Noch etwas?&lt;br&gt;
DU: Ja, ich brauche drei Hemden.&lt;br&gt;
VERKÄUFERIN: Hemden haben wir. Sie sind hier.&lt;br&gt;

Du nimmst ein Hemd in Blau, und zwei in Rot. Du probierst die Hemden, die Jeans, und die Gürtel an. Alles passt.

DU: Was kosten diese Klamotten?&lt;br&gt;
VERKÄUFERIN: Zwei Jeans, drei Hemden, und zwei Gürtel kosten fünfundsechzig Euro.

You give the clerk the money and take the clothing home.

===3-2 Accusative Case Articles===
Remember that in the nominitive case, the articles are ''der, die, das,'' and ''die'', listed in MFNP (masculine, feminine, neuter, and plural) order. Well, in the accusative case, only the masculine form changes to den. An easy memory hook is &quot;Der goes to den and the rest stay the same.&quot;

The ein-forms undergo the same change. Masculine &quot;ein&quot; goes to &quot;einen&quot; and the rest stay the same.

===3-3 Prices===
Two easy words describe prices.

&lt;b&gt;billig - cheap&lt;br&gt;
teuer - expensive&lt;/b&gt;

These adjectives are applied to the products you buy, never to the word &quot;Preis&quot;. Anyway, you rather say &quot;Das ist billig/teuer.&quot; (meaning the product you buy) than &quot;Der Preis ist niedrig/hoch.&quot;

===3-4 A DDR Joke===

In einem Kaufhaus in der DDR fragt ein Kunde: &quot;Haben Sie keine Unterhosen?&quot;.

Die Verkäuferin antwortet: &quot;Nein, wir haben keine Badehosen. Im zweiten Stock haben wir keine Unterhosen!&quot;

 fragen            to ask
 DDR               Deutsche Demokratische Republik (German Democratic Republic, long since reunited with the BRD)
 Kaufhaus          very big shop
 Kunde             client
 Unterhosen        underpants
 Badehosen         swimming trunks
 Im zweiten Stock  on the second floor

Wild '''quail''' were once a popular game bird. The [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s of the quail are considered a delicacy, and are sometimes used raw in [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]]. The Common Quail was previously much favoured in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French cooking]], but quail for the table are now more likely to be domesticated Japanese Quail.</text>

== Preface ==
{{Prerequisite|Calculus|Special Relativity}}
{{Reading level|Advanced}}
This book is going to cover the topic of electrodynamics using vector calculus. We will provide a brief refresher to the topics of vector calculus, but this book does not intend to teach that topic to students who do not have any background in it. For more information about calculus and vector calculus topics, see [[Calculus]] and [[Linear Algebra]]. Because this book is part of a series of books on [[Modern Physics]], the reader is assumed to have a background in relativity theory, or to be able to concurrently read the [[Special Relativity]] book. 

This book is going to discuss the electric and magnetic fields and forces, and related subjects. It is intended to be read by advanced undergraduates in the field of physics or engineering.

'''This book is new and needs a lot of work. This is a wiki, so ''you'' can contribute.'''

==Number System (數字系統)==
{{wikipedia|Chinese Numerals}}
===基本用字 Basic Characters=== 
{{audio|Zero to ten in Mandarin Chinese.ogg|Listen to audio}}
*0: 零： líng
*1: 一 (壹) ee
*2: 二 (Traditional:貳) èrh
*3: 三 (Traditional:參) san
*4: 四 (肆) sìh
*5: 五 (伍) ǔ
*6: 六 (Traditional:陸) lioù
*7: 七 (柒) chi
*8: 八 (捌) ba
*9: 九 (玖) jioǔ
*10: 十 (拾) shíh
*100: 百 (佰) bǎi
*1000: 千 (仟) chien
*10,000: Traditional 一萬 wàn
*100,000: 十 萬
*1,000,000: 一百萬
*100,000,000: Traditional 一億 yì
*1,000,000,000,000: 兆 jhào
Parenthesized entries are the complex forms, which are used mainly in notarized, official documents, and when writing checks. An exception is zero; the complex form is more widely used. The complex forms are known in English as banker's anti-fraud numerals, in Chinese as 大寫 ''dà siěh'' (which is the same term for &quot;capital letter&quot;). They are necessary because, since normal Chinese characters are so simple, a forger could easily change 三十 to 五千 with just three strokes. Some have other uses as well (for example,  貳''èrh'' can also mean &quot;to betray&quot;). See [[w:Chinese_numerals#Standard numbers|Standard numbers]] for more information.

===個十百千萬 Larger Numbers===
*十一 shí hi ''(eleven)''
*十二 shíh èrh ''(twelve)''
等(děng) etc.
*二十一 èrh shíh i ''(twenty-one)''
*二十二 èrh shíh èrh ''(twenty-two)''
等 etc.
*一百 ì bǎi ''(one hundred)''
*一百零一 ì bǎi líng i ''(one hundred one)''
*一百五十八 ì bǎi wǔ shí ba ''(one hundred fifty eight)''
*二百三十 èrh bǎi san shíh ''(two hundred thirty)''
等 etc.
*一千 ì chien ''(one thousand)''
*七千二百五十三 chi chien liǎng bǎi ǔ shíh san ''(seven thousand two hundred fifty-three)''
等 etc.
*一萬 i wàn ''(one myriad'' or ''ten thousand)''
*四萬三千 sìh wàn san chien ''(forty-three thousand)''
等 etc.

==更大的數字（億兆） Even Larger Numbers==
*一億五千萬 i ì wǔ chien wàn ''150,000,000  (one hundred fifty million) ''
*兩億零八十萬 liǎng ì líng ba shíh wàn ''200,800,000'' (two hundred million eight hundred thousand)
等 etc.

==中文中零的用法 The Use of Zero in Chinese==
If a number ends in zero, there is no need to include the Chinese character for zero. For example,
*350: 三百五十
*1350: 一千三百五十
*1600: 一千六百
However, if the zero character does not end the number (i.e., it is followed by a non-zero character), it is necessary to include the zero character, while the &quot;tens-place&quot; characters are dropped. For example,
*305: 三百零五 (''not'' 三百零&lt;s&gt;十&lt;/s&gt;五)
*1035: 一千零三十五 (''not'' 一千零&lt;s&gt;百&lt;/s&gt;三十五)
Note that the &quot;十&quot; in the first example and the &quot;百&quot; in the second example are dropped.

If a zero digit is followed by one or more zero digits, only one zero character is need. For example,
*1006: 一千零六 (''not'' 一千零零六)
*300,250: 三十萬零二百五十
*8,000,300: 八百萬零三百

'''Baking powder''' is a leavening agent composed of [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] and one or more acidic salts, such as tartaric acid ([[Cookbook:Cream of Tartar|cream of tartar]]) or dicalcium phosphate dihydrate.  As the baking powder dissolves, the baking soda reacts with the acids to produce carbon dioxide gas bubbles, which are trapped by the [[Cookbook:dough|dough]] around them.  Baking powder is used in recipes where the pH is 7, or neutral, and pure baking soda would fail to produce bubbles. 

Most baking powders are double-action, which means they have two or more acids in them, one to react and create the carbon dioxide at room temperature, and one that will not react to create the bubbles until the temperature is elevated, in the [[Cookbook:oven|oven]].

Baking powder is most often found in quick breads like pancakes, waffles, and muffins.

:Looks gray to me. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 16:54, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:Looks neary black on IE! No problems on Mozilla. I have fixed the color code &quot;#999&quot; into &quot;gray&quot;. &quot;grey&quot; (not &quot;grAy&quot; but &quot;grEy&quot;) is worse, that is green on IE. --[[User:HarpyHumming|HarpyHumming]] 10:36, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Does the word for black sound like the word for yellow? How well heard is the u in kuroi and well heard is the i in ki-iro.

:Hmm. To me, u in kuro sounds shorter than i in kiiro. [[User:Tomos|Tomos]] 01:45, 29 May 2004 (UTC)

Someone who knows a little more than I do should probably mention that みどり　(midori) can't be used as an adjective.  At least, that's how I learned it in class.  We can say, &quot;Aoi kuruma&quot; &quot;akai kuruma&quot; etc., but we have to say &quot;midori no kuruma.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Concept==
We will now proceed to develop a more axiomatic theory of probability, allowing for a simpler mathematical formalism. We shall proceed by developing the concept of a probability space, which will allow us to harness many theorems in mathematical analysis.

Recall that an experiment is any action or process with an outcome that is subject to uncertainty or randomness.  A probability space or a probability triple is a mathematical construct that models an experiment and its set of possible outcomes.

==Probability Space==
A '''probability space''' is a mathematical triplet &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, a set of events &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and a probability function &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; that presents a model for a particular class of real-world situations. A probability space is arbitrary, in that its author ultimately defines which elements &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; will contain.

===Sample Space===
The '''sample space''', &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, is the non-empty set whose elements are all possible outcomes of an experiment.  Without an assignment of a sample space and without knowing its size, no conclusions could be made about the probabilities of outcomes, or collections of outcomes.  It is common to refer to a sample space by the labels &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (for &quot;universal set&quot;).  An Outcome &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; may be a state of nature, a possibility, an experimental result and the like.  Any instance or execution of a real-world situation modeled by a probability space must produce exactly one outcome. If outcomes of different trials of an experiment differ in any way that matters, they are considered distinct outcomes. Which differences matter depends on the kind of analysis we wish to perform: This leads to different choices of a sample space.  A common example consists of a random experiment involving a single coin toss.  Here, it seems appropriate to define the sample space as the set &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\{\text{H},\text{T}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Events===
Since individual outcomes might be of little practical use, more complex events are used to characterize groups of outcomes. An '''event''' is any subset of zero or more outcomes contained in a given sample space. A '''simple event''' consists of exactly one outcome and a '''compound event''' consists of more than one outcome.  For example, when tossing a single coin &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\{\text{H},\text{T}\}&lt;/math&gt;, possible events are &lt;math&gt;\{\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{H\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{T\}&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;\{H,T\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The collection of all such events is a &amp;sigma;-algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.  Intuitively, the probability of each of these sets is the chance that one of the events in the set will happen; &lt;math&gt;P(\{\text{H}\})&lt;/math&gt; is the chance of tossing a head, &lt;math&gt;P(\{\text{H},\text{T}\})&lt;/math&gt; is the chance of the coin landing either heads or tails, and &lt;math&gt;P(\{\})&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of the coin landing neither heads nor tails, etc.  An event is said to have happened or occurred during an experiment when the outcome of the experiment is an element of the event. Since the same outcome may be a member of many events, it is possible for many events to have happened given a single outcome. For example, when the trial consists of throwing two dice, the set of all outcomes with a sum of 7 pips may constitute an event, whereas outcomes with an odd number of pips may constitute another event. If the outcome is the element of the elementary event of two pips on the first die and five on the second, then both of the events, &quot;7 pips&quot; and &quot;odd number of pips&quot;, are said to have occurred. Modeling events as sets of outcomes in a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; allows us to leverage all of the regular set operations:

Given two events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;:
* The '''null subset''' &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt; in a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''impossible event''.
* The '''union''' of two events &lt;math&gt;A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; consists of all outcomes that are in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; or in both,
* The '''intersection''' &lt;math&gt;A \cap B&lt;/math&gt; consists of all outcomes that are both in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
* The '''complement''' &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; of an event &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; consists of all outcomes not in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, but in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;A \cup A^c = \Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

===Probability Measure Function===
Finally, there is a need to specify each event's likelihood of happening. This is done using the probability measure function, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which maps events to probabilities. Recall that probability is expressed as a real number between zero (typically an impossible event, though zero-probability events are not necessarily impossible) and one (an event happens almost surely, with total certainty). Thus &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is a function &lt;math&gt;P:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

Once the probability space is established, it is assumed that “nature” makes its move and selects a single outcome (also called a sample point), &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, from the sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. All the events in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; that contain the selected outcome &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (recall that each event is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) will have &quot;happened&quot; or &quot;occurred&quot;. The selection performed by nature is done in such a way that if the experiment were to be repeated an infinite number of times, the relative frequencies of occurrence of each of the events would coincide with the probabilities prescribed by the function &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Probability Definition==
Having properly defined a probability space, we may now provide the following definitions for probability:

===Informal Definition of Probability===
The '''probability''' of an event is a measure of the chance with which we can expect the event to occur. We assign a number between 0 and 1 inclusive to the probability of an event. A probability of 1 means that we are certain the event will occur, and a probability of 0 means that we certain the event will not occur. The probability of any event A in a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Classical Definition of Probability===
If there are n equally likely outcomes for an experiment, of which one must occur, and m of these belong to an event of interest &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''probability''' of the event or a &quot;success&quot; is given by &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; = m/n.

====Computing Probability for Classical Approach====
# When all outcomes are equally likely
## Count the number of outcomes n in the sample space.
## Count the number of outcomes m in the event of interest, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
## &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; = m/n.
# When all outcomes are not equally likely
## Let &lt;math&gt;\omega_1, \omega_2, ..., \omega_n&lt;/math&gt; be the outcomes of a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;P(\omega_i) = p_i, i = 1, 2, ..., n&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the probability of each outcome, &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, is assumed to be known.
## List all the outcomes in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, say, &lt;math&gt;\omega_i, \omega_j, ..., \omega_m&lt;/math&gt;.
## &lt;math&gt;P(A) = P(\omega_i) + P(\omega_j) + \dotsb + P(\omega_m) = p_i + p_j + \dotsb + p_m&lt;/math&gt;, the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

The classical concept of probability works well when all the outcomes of an experiment can be regarded as equally likely, like when we roll a die or toss a coin, but it falls short in scenarios where outcomes are not equally likely and their probabilities are not known beforehand, like when we are interested in the probability of a sports team winning a championship game.  For these situations, the frequency interpretation of probability (developed as a result of the work by R. Von Mises in 1936) is fitting.

===Frequency Definition of Probability===
The '''probability''' of an event or outcome is the proportion of times the event or outcome would occur in a long run of trials of repeated experiments.

For example, in tossing a coin, if &lt;math&gt;n(H)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of times heads appears in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; trials, then the probability of getting heads is &lt;math&gt;P(H)=lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(n(H)/n)&lt;/math&gt;.  This is just a natural extension of the classical approach of probability, but which works for both a non-biased (equally likely outcomes) and a biased (not equally likely outcomes) coin.  This approach is quite useful, but requires that an experiment be able to be repeated many times under identical circumstances, which is not always possible.  For a more complete picture, we define probabilities axiomatically (from the 1933 studies of A. N. Kolmogorov).

===Axiomatic Definition of Probability===
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a sample space of an experiment. '''Probability''' P() is a real-valued function that assigns to each event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; a number &lt;math&gt;P(E)&lt;/math&gt;, called the probability of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, with the following conditions satisfied:
# For every event &lt;math&gt;E\in \mathcal{F}, P(E) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;
# It is unity for any event. That is, &lt;math&gt;P(\Omega) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
# It is additive over the union of an infinite number of pairwise disjoint events, that is, if &lt;math&gt;E_i \cap E_j = \empty, for i \ne j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P\left(\cup_{i=1}^\infty E_i\right) = \Sigma_{i=1}^\infty P(E_i)&lt;/math&gt;

==Other Definitions and Properties==
===Basic Properties of Probability===
* &lt;math&gt;P(\empty)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Collapse top|title=Proof}}
First consider the infinite collection of events &lt;math&gt;A_1=\empty, A_2=\empty, ...&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\empty\cap\empty=\empty&lt;/math&gt;, the events in this collection are disjoint and &lt;math&gt;\bigcup A_i=\empty&lt;/math&gt;. The third axiom then gives
:&lt;math&gt;P(\empty)=\sum P(\empty)&lt;/math&gt;
This can happen only if &lt;math&gt;P(\empty)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

* The property of probability in the third axiom of probability is valid for a finite collection of events.
{{Collapse top|title=Proof}}
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ... , A_k&lt;/math&gt; are disjoint events, and append to these the infinite collection &lt;math&gt;A_{k+1}=\empty, A_{k+2}=\empty, ...&lt;/math&gt;.  By invoking the third axiom,
:&lt;math&gt;P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^k A_i\right)=P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i\right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)=\sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;
as desired.

* For any event &lt;math&gt;A, P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)&lt;/math&gt;
{{Collapse top|title=Proof}}
Since by definition of &lt;math&gt;A^c, A \cup A^c = \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; are clearly disjoint, then &lt;math&gt;P(A) = P(A) + P(A^c) - P(A^c) = P(A \cup A^c) - P(A^c) = P(\Omega) - P(A^c) = 1 - P(A^c)&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Collapse bottom}}

* For any event &lt;math&gt;A, P(A) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;
{{Collapse top|title=Proof}}
Since by axiom 1 of probability &lt;math&gt;P(A^c) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(A) \leq P(A) + P(A^c) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Collapse bottom}}

* If &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(A) \le P(B)&lt;/math&gt;
{{Collapse top|title=Proof}}
Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary events in a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Without loss of generality, first note that &lt;math&gt;B = B \cap \Omega = B \cap (A \cup A^c) = (B \cap A) \cup (B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;.  But since &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(B \cap A) = A&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;B = A \cup (B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c&lt;/math&gt; are clearly disjoint, and since &lt;math&gt;P(B \cap A^c) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; by Axiom 2, then by Axioms 2 and 3 we have that &lt;math&gt;P(A) \leq P(A) + P(B \cap A^c) = P(B)&lt;/math&gt;, as desired. 
{{Collapse bottom}}

* For any events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;.
{{Collapse top|title=Proof}}
Before proceeding to the actual proof, realize that this proposition should be intuitive.  If the events were disjoint, then &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and by axiom 3 &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)&lt;/math&gt;. But since these are ''any'' two events, they may contain an intersection which, if we sum &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(B)&lt;/math&gt;, would be counted twice. This is illustrated in the figures below.

'''Proof'''

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary events in a sample space &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

Without loss of generality, first note that &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = A \cup (B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;, and because &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \cap A^c&lt;/math&gt; are clearly disjoint, then by Axiom 3 we have that &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;.

Likewise, also note that &lt;math&gt;B = B \cap \Omega = B \cap (A \cup A^c) = (B \cap A) \cup (B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;(B \cap A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt; are clearly disjoint, then by Axiom 3 we have that &lt;math&gt;P(B) = P(B \cap A) + P(B \cap A^c)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;P(B \cap A^c) = P(B) - P(B \cap A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining these two results we get &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(B \cap A)&lt;/math&gt;, as desired.

&lt;td&gt;[[File:VennDiagramAcupB.png|thumb|left|Union of A and B]]&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

===Mutually Exclusive Events===
Two events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/Math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are said to be '''mutually exclusive''' or '''disjoint''' if &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \empty&lt;/math&gt;. This means that mutually exclusive events cannot happen together.  A collection of n events are mutually exclusive when the occurrence of any one event implies that the remaining n-1 events will not occur. Any two mutually exclusive events &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; have the following probability properties:
# &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B)&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that this is just a special case of the general property where &lt;math&gt;P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)&lt;/math&gt;.

===(Collectively) Exhaustive===
A set of events is jointly or collectively '''exhaustive''' if at least one of the events must occur. For example, when rolling a six-sided die, the outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are collectively exhaustive, because they encompass the entire range of possible outcomes.

Another way to describe collectively exhaustive events is that their union must cover the entire sample space, or &lt;math&gt;A \cup B = \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the sample space.

===Test of Independence===
If for two events A and B, p(A ∩ B) is not equal to p(A)p(B), then A and B are said to be associated or dependent. If p(A ∩ B) &gt; p(A)p(B), so that p(A|B) &gt; p(A) and p(B|A) &gt; p(B), then the events are said to be positively associated (answer to question #2 above). If, however, p(A ∩ B) &lt; p(A)p(B), so that p(A|B) &lt;p(A) and p(B|A) &lt; p(B), one says that the events are negatively associated.

===Simple Random Sampling===
In a simple random sample, one person must take a random sample from a population, and not have any order in which one chooses the specific individual. In statistics, a simple random sample is a subset of individuals (a sample) chosen from a larger set (a population). Each individual is chosen randomly and entirely by chance, such that each individual has the same probability of being chosen at any stage during the sampling process, and each subset of k individuals has the same probability of being chosen for the sample as any other subset of k individuals. Simple random sampling can be done with or without replacement, though it is typically done without, i.e., one deliberately avoids choosing any member of the population more than once. When the sample is drawn with replacement, the same individual can be chosen more than once. When the sample is drawn without replacement, the same individual can be chosen no more than once in a given sample. Therefore, random sampling of one individual at a time means that every possible individual in the large group has an equal probability of being drawn.

===Independence of random variables===
If X is a real-valued random variable and a is a number then the event {X ≤ a} is the set of outcomes that correspond to X being less than or equal to a. Since these are sets of outcomes that have probabilities, it makes sense to refer to events of this sort being independent of other events of this sort.

Why are the p and q Bernoulli trial probabilities multiplied together in the binomial formula?
The probability of an event can be expressed as a binomial probability if its outcomes can be broken down into two probabilities p and q, where p and q are complementary (i.e. p + q = 1). Binomial probability typically deals with the probability of several successive decisions, each of which has two possible outcomes. The binomial distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent yes/no experiments, each of which yields success with probability p. Such a success/failure experiment is also called a Bernoulli experiment or Bernoulli trial. In fact, when n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. Bernoulli process is a discrete-time stochastic process consisting of a sequence of independent random variables taking values over two symbols. Prosaically, a Bernoulli process is coin flipping several times, possibly with an unfair coin. A variable in such a sequence may be called a Bernoulli variable. In other words, a Bernoulli process is a sequence of independent identically distributed Bernoulli trials. Independence of Bernoulli trials implies memorylessness property: past trials do not provide any information regarding future outcomes. From any given time, future trials is also a Bernoulli process independent of the past (fresh-start property). a sequence or other collection of random variables is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) if each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent. Two events A and B are independent if and only if Pr(A ∩ B) = Pr(A)Pr(B). Here A ∩ B is the intersection of A and B, that is, it is the event that both events A and B occur. This is called the multiplication rule for independent events. 

===Further Concepts in Set Theory===
Union and intersection: We can indicate the union and intersection of two sets with the symbols ∪ ∩, respectively. If two sets, then ∪ the set “”―the set that consists of all the elements that are either in set  in set . Similarly, ∩ read “”, which is the set of all elements that are in both .

Set difference. We can “subtract” one set from another using the symbol “－”. If sets, then － the set consisting of all the elements that are members of are not members of . This is a little different from the subtraction you may be used to in arithmetic.

Whole numbers: 
1.	Non-negative integers (aka real numbers) – {0, 1, 2, 3...}
2.	Positive integers – {1, 2, 3, 4....}
3.	All possible integers – {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...}

AND --&gt; 2 or more things/events happen. Therefore, we MULTIPLY (product) probabilities together -- INTERSECTION
OR --&gt; 1 of the 2 events/things occur. Therefore we ADD (sum) probabilities together -- UNION

Events that are NOT mutually exclusive means we could draw them both (for example, we want to draw a 2 OR an 'M'...these events are NOT mutually exclusive, because they cannot occcur together at the same time). 

Events that are NOT mutually exclusive, but rather are independent, we must subtract: 1-p(A∩B) from p(A) + p(B).
So that, p(A) + p(B) -1 p(A∩B).

Probabilities for independent events often involve exponents, and probabilities for dependent events (conditional probability) often involve factorials.

===Permutations and Combinations===
;Permutations
:arrangement of objects without repetition where order is important. Permutations using all the objects: n objects, arranged into group size of n without repetition, and order being important – P(n, n) = N!
:Example: Find all permutations of A, B, C.

Permutations of some of the objects: n objects, group size r, order is important. P(n, r) = N!/(n-r)!
Example: Find all 2-letter combinations using letters A, B, C.

;Distinguished permutations
:if a word has n letters, k of which are unique, let n (n1, n2, n3....nk) be the frequency of each of the k letters. N!/(n1!)(n2!)(n3!)

;Combinations
:arrangement of objects without repetition, where order is NOT important. A combination of n objects, arranged in groups of size r, without repetition, and order being important. C(n, r) = N!/r!(n-r)!

Another way to write a combination of n things, r at a time, is using the Binomial notation (Binomial Distribution), sometimes described as &quot;n choose r&quot;.

===Counting Rules===
;Rule 1
:If any one of K mutually exclusive and exhaustive events can occur on each of N trials, there are KN different sequences that may result from a set of such trials
:Example: Flip a coin three times, finding the number of possible sequences. N=3, K=2, therefore, KN =(2)(3)=6

;Rule 2
:If K1, K2, ....KN are the numbers of distinct events that can occur on trials 1,....N in a series, the number of different sequences of N events that can occur is (K1)(K2)...(KN)
:Example: Flip a coin and roll a die, finding the number of possible sequences. Therefore, (K1)(K2) = (2)(6) = 12
	
;Rule 3
:The number of different ways that N distinct things may be arranged in order is N! = (1)(2)(3)....(N-1)(N), where 0! = 1. An arrangement in order is called a permutation, so that the total number of permutations of N objects is N! (the symbol N! Is called N-factorial)
:Example: Arrange 10 items in order, finding the number of possible ways. Therefore, 10! = 10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1 = 3628800

;Rule 4
:The number of ways of selecting and arranging r objects from among N distinct obejects is: N!/(N-r)! [nPr]
:Example: pick 3 things from 10 items, and arrange them in order. Therefore N=10, r=3, so 10!/(10-3)! = 10!/7! = 720

;Rule 5
:The total number of ways of selecting r distinct combinations of N objects, irrespective of order (ie order NOT important), is: N!/r!(N-r)! [nCr]
:Example: Pick 3 items from 10 in any order, where N=10, r=3. Therefore, 10!/3!(7!) = 720/6 = 120

==Consequences==
We can now give some basic theorems using our axiomatic probability space. 
===Theorem 1===
Given a probability space (&amp;Omega;,S,P), for events &lt;math&gt;A,B\in S&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;!-- The &quot;normal&quot; form for this formula is: --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)&lt;/math&gt;


== '''Axioms of Probability''' ==
A probability function has to satisfy the following three basic axioms or constraints:
To each event a a measure (number) P(a) which is called the probability of event a is assigned. P(a) is subjected to the following three axioms:
# P(a) ≥ 0
# P(S) = 1
# If a ∩ b = 0 , then P(a ∪ b) = P(a) + P(b)

;Corollaries:
* P(0) = 0 
* P(a) = 1 － P(a') ≤ 1
* If a ∩ b ≠ 0 , then P(a ∪ b) = P(a) + P(b) － P(a ∩ b)
* If b ⊂ a , P(a) = P(b) + P(a ∩ b)≥ P(b)

'''Trout''' is a family of fresh water game fish related to [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]], found naturally in Europe, North America, and northern Asia, and as an introduced species around the world.  The North American Rainbow Trout is now farm raised to provide a large portion of the trout found on the market.

Trout is a bony fish with a mild flavor and a firm texture. It is fairly interchangeable with salmon. The most common ways to prepare trout are [[Cookbook:Sautéing|pan frying]], [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiling]], [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoking]], and [[Cookbook:Grilling|grilling]], but trout can be prepared by a variety of methods.  

When purchasing fish, freshness is important.  The fish should not have a ''fishy'' smell, which actually comes from bacteria decomposing the fish. If purchasing whole fish, the eyes should be clear.

Farm raised Rainbow Trout is listed as a &quot;Best Choice&quot; by the Monterey Bay Aquarium's [http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_factsheet.asp?gid=31 Seafood Watch Program].

'''Gentgeen's Campfire Trout''' is the recipe [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] uses to cook trout caught while camping.  This method can be used at home with trout purchased at the fish market, but somehow never tastes quite as good.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 whole cleaned [[Cookbook:Trout|trout]], between 10 and 14 inches
* 4 strips [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
* 2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], to taste

Serves 4, or 2 hungry fishermen.

== Procedure ==
# Make a pan out of [[Cookbook:Aluminium Foil|aluminium foil]] slightly larger than your two fish.  The pan should have a double layer of foil on the bottom and a lip around the edge of about 3/4 - 1 inch height. 
# Place the pan on a grill over the camp fire.  Put the butter into the pan and allow to begin melting.  Wrap each trout with 2 strips of bacon. Add the trout to the pan. Season to taste.
# After the trout has cooked for a few minutes (5-7 depending on the size of the fish), check the inside.  If the side close to the fire is white and flakes easily, the fish is ready to turn.  Flip the fish, and continue cooking the other side for 3-4 minutes until done.

Serve with lemon over a bed of white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

      <comment>/* Nominative */Grammatical error.  Changed &quot;is&quot; to &quot;are.&quot;</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Prepositions are small words that precede a phrase and connect it to the rest of the sentence. Example of prepositions in English include 'He went '''''in''''' the shop', 'She spoke '''''about''''' him, 'They went '''''by''''' the shops', etc. Russian prepositions work just like their English counterparts, with one important difference: they all place the next phrase in one of the [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|six grammatical cases]]. As such, a good understanding of the Russian case system is needed to use prepositions. Some cases are used primarily or even entirely with prepositions, while others are used more in their main function than with prepositions- this page assumes familiarity of Russian cases and pronunciation.


{{Russian}}
==Prepositions==
{| width=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| width=&quot;50%&quot; |
===Nominative===
&lt;small&gt;Usually, nominative has no prepositions, but there are several cases where some scholars [http://www.gramota.ru/forum/klass/19329 believe]{{ref-ru}} it has:&lt;/small&gt;
* (что) за - (what a) -
* в - into, as a (plural denoting new state)

===Accusative===
* в - to
* на - to
* с - approx
* за - for
* о - against (physical contact)
* под - under
* по - up to, as far as
* про - on the topic of
* сквозь - through, across
* через - in, after, by

===Genitive===
* без - without
* вне - outside of
* вместо - instead of
* вокруг - about, around
* около - around
* до - until
* для - for
* из(о) - of, outside of, from
* из-за - from behind
* из-под - from below
* кроме - except (for)
* мимо - past (movement)
* от(о) - off, (away) from
* после - after
* у - at, close to. Equivalent to the French &quot;chez&quot;
* (по)среди - among
* (на)против - against, across from
* близ - near, close
* вдоль - along
* возле - by, near
* с(о) - (down) from
* внутри - inside, within
* ради - for the sake of
* накануне - on the eve

много+Gpl
несколько+Gpl
мало+ Gpl
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |

===Dative===
* к(о) - to, towards
* по - many meanings in English; no direct translation
* благодаря - thanks to
* вопреки - contrary to, despite
* наперекор - in defiance of (more intense than вопреки)
* согласно - according to, in accordance with

===Instrumental===
* с(о) - with
* над - above, on top of
* под - under, beneath
* за - behind, before
* п'''е'''ред - in front of
* м'''е'''жду - in between

====Russian/Prepositions Instrumental quiz====
[[Russian/Prepositions Instrumental quiz]]

===Prepositional===
* в - in
* на - in
* при - in times of, in the presence of
* о(б) - about

In order to distinguish between в and на to mean in, a rule can be &quot;if one can inhabit or enter a space where something is happening, it is на&quot; and otherwise it is в. However, this rule is so general it is better to say this: one must learn the different nouns which take one or the other. 
|}

==Prepositions with 2 cases==
Like in German, some prepositions can have 2 cases. The accusative (again, like in German) and the genitive cases are used to express movement: accusative pertains to destination, while genitive indicates the source of movement. The instrumental and the Prepositional are used to express staticness.

===Accusative and Prepositional===
* в or во - in, inside of
* на - on, on top of

===Accusative and instrumental===
* за - behind, for
* под - under


==Prepositions with 3 cases==

===Accusative, Genitive, Instrumental===
* с - approximately (Acc.), from (Gen.), with (Inst.)

===Accusative, Prepositional, Dative===
*по - to &amp; including; apiece (Acc.), upon, directly after (Prep.), along, according to (Dat.)

==Examples==

'''Accusative''':
;Книга упала на пол. :The book fell on the floor.
;За Родину! :For the Motherland!

'''Genitive''':
;Четыре стула сто'''я'''т вокруг стола. :Four chairs are standing around the table.
;Диван стоит у стен'''ы'''. :The couch is standing against the wall.
;Он выходит из университéта. :He's coming out of the university.
;Bозвращáюсь с рабóты. :I'm coming back from work.

'''Dative''':
;Ваза пододв'''и'''нута к кр'''а'''ю стола.  :The vase is moved towards the edge of the table.
;Идý к роди́телям. :I'm going to my parents'.

'''Instrumental''':
;Лампа висит под потолк'''о'''м. :The lamp hangs under the ceiling.
;Игорь идёт с другом. :Igor walks with a friend.
;Он стоит за дверью. :He's standing behind the door.

'''Prepositional''':
;Стол и стулья стоят в центре комнаты. :The table and the chairs are in the middle of the room.
;Ваза стоит на столе. :The vase stands on the table.
;Книга и вещи лежат на столе. :The book and the things are lying on the table.
;Телевизор стоит на столике. :The television is on the small table.
;Картина висит на стене. :The painting hangs on the wall.

'''Note''': using the preposition &quot;в/во&quot; when saying you're in a place, or going to a place, works in the majority of cases; however, some places require you to use &quot;на&quot; instead of &quot;в/во&quot;. 

'''For example''':
;Pабóтаю '''в''' университéте. :I work at the university.
'''but''':
;Pабóтаю '''на''' факультéте (чего-нибудь). :I work at the faculty (of something).

'''Similarly''':
;Идý '''в''' бюро. :I'm going to the office.
'''but''':
;Идý '''на''' работу. :I'm going to work.

And more. There is a limited number of those, but the use of &quot;на&quot; over that of &quot;в/во&quot; is mandatory in these cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The personal pronouns in Russian are arguably the easiest to learn. As they don't modify nouns (unlike their [[Russian/Possessive_Pronouns|possessive counterparts]]), they conjugate only by case. They are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; width:800px&quot;
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|English !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|First person !! colspan=&quot;2&quot;|Second person !! colspan=&quot;4&quot;|Third person
|-
! I / me !! We / us !! You&lt;br&gt;''&lt;small&gt;(sing. informal)&lt;/small&gt;'' !! You&lt;br&gt;''&lt;small&gt;(pl. formal)&lt;/small&gt;'' !! He / his !! It !! She / her !! They / them
|-

|-
! Prepositional
| Мне|| Нас || Тебе || Вас || colspan=&quot;2&quot;| Нём || Ней || Них
|}

There are two important nuances to these pronouns. First, notice that the masculine and neuter third-person singular pronouns are the same in all cases but the nominative, and in the genitive and accusative are pronounce &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''ye-vo''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, not &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''ye-go''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Second, if the pronoun's case is called by a preposition, third-person pronouns gain the prefix '''н-''' (e.g., compare 'his' in 'It's his house', '''Это его дом''', and 'He has a house', '''У него есть дом''').
:Nominative: Where are you? - '''Где вы?'''
:Genitive: What do you have there? - '''Что у вас там есть?'''
:Dative: He's writing to you - '''Он тебе пишет'''
:Accusative: I love you - '''Я тебя люблю'''
:Instrumental: She's walking with them - '''Она с ними идёт''' - ''note the suffice '''н-''' after the preposition''
:Prepositional: We're talking about her - '''Мы о ней говорим '''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like all pronouns, the interrogative pronouns are words that replace nouns in a sentence. Interrogative pronouns are those that ask questions, or ''interrogate''. Compare &quot;Peter is doing it&quot; with &quot;Who is doing it&quot; - replacing the noun with an interrogative pronoun turns it into a question, though the rest of the sentence is left intact. Like the nouns they replace, interrogative pronouns must conjugate to suit the appropriate grammatical case. While some words discussed here are used more as adverbs than pronouns, they are still pronouns and are included here for the sake of completeness.

== The pronouns ==
The twelve interrogative pronouns are as follows:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

There are a few nuances to how you conjugate these pronouns, before we discuss how to use them.

=== Какой, который, чей ===
You may notice that '''какой''' ('what kind'), '''который''' ('what/which'), and '''чей''' ('whose'), are adjectives. They are therefore called ''adjectival'' pronouns. As such, when they are used in a sentence, they take on the ending appropriate for the gender and number of the noun it refers to, and the case appropriate for where it is in the sentence. This can mean that it takes on a different case to its noun.

'''Чей''' is an irregular adjective with unpredictable endings, and conjugates as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
|-
! Case
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Masculine
! Neuter || Feminine
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Plural
|-
! Nominative
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''чей'''
| '''чьё''' || '''чья'''
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''чьи'''
|- 
! Accusative
| '''чей''' || '''чьего''' || '''чьё''' || '''чью''' || '''чьи''' || '''чьих'''
|-
! Genitive
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''чьего'''
| '''чьей'''
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''чьих'''
|-
! Instrumental
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''чьим'''
| '''чьею'''
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''чьими'''
|-
! Dative
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''чьему'''
| '''чьей'''
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''чьим'''
|-
! Prepositional
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | '''чьём'''
| '''чьей'''
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | '''чьих'''
|}
:Which dog are you talking about? - '''Вы говорите о ''которой'' собаке?''' - ''prepositional feminine singular to match '''собака''', used when there is some definite set of possibly meaned dogs, otherwise better use'' '''о ''какой'''''
:What kind of cheese? - '''Какой сыр?'''
:The girl who works here is nice - '''Девушка, которая работает там, симпатичная'''.
:He talks about the girl who works here - '''Он говорит о девушке, которая работает там.'''
:Whose house is this? - '''Чей это дом?'''
:This is Boris' house - '''Это дом Бориса'''
:Whose money is this? - '''Чьи это деньги?''' (money is plural in Russian, however the indeclineable это is still used in this construction, just as it is with feminine and masculine nouns)
:Whose is this? - '''Это чьё?'''
:We know whose it is - '''Мы знаем, чьё это'''

=== Кто, что, сколько ===
In contrast to the three adjectival pronouns, there are three nominal pronouns, so called because they more closely resemble nouns. These pronouns do not conjugate by gender and number like their adjectival counterparts, but still change according to case:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! Кто !! Что !! Сколько
|-
! Nominative
| Кто || Что || Сколько
|-
! Genitive
| Кого || Чего || Скольких
|-
! Dative
| Кому || Чему || Скольким
|-
! Accusative
| Кого || Что || Сколько
|-
! Instrumental
| Кем || Чем || Сколькими
|-
! Prepositional
| Ком || Чём || Скольких
|}

If you are familiar with the case system, you may notice that these endings are roughly similar to the adjectival endings, with a few alterations. As ever, '''кого''' is pronounced 'ko-vo', not 'ko-go', and similarly for '''чего'''.

The remaining six pronouns are indeclinable and do not conjugate.

== Asking questions ==
=== Кто? Что? ===
To ask a question, use the pronoun as the subject of the verb. If you need to give it a gender, such as when forming the [[Russian/Grammar/Past tense|past tense]], treat '''кто''' as a masculine singular noun (e.g., &quot;Who was working? '''Кто работал?'''), '''что''' as a neuter singular noun (e.g., &lt;!--&quot;What was speaking?&quot; '''Что говорило?''' # WHAT cannot speak. &quot;Что говорило?&quot; would rather be short for &quot;Что оно говорило?&quot;--&gt;&quot;What was rolling?&quot; '''Что катилось?'''), and '''сколько''' as a plural noun (e.g., &quot;How many people are walking?&quot; '''Сколько человек идут? &lt;!--Though one would say &quot;идёт&quot; more likely in this case--&gt;''').
:What is this? - '''Что это?'''
&lt;!--:What's he walking into? - '''В чём он идёт?''' # It is &quot;What is he dressed in?&quot;--&gt;
&lt;!--:That would be &quot;В чём он одет?&quot; '''В чём он идёт?''' makes no sense whatsoever.--&gt;
:What're you writing with? - '''Чем ты пишешь?'''
:Who is this? - '''Кто это?'''
:Who are they? - '''Кто они?'''
:Who here speaks English? - '''Кто здесь говорит по-английски?'''
:Whom did you see? - '''Кого ты видел?'''
:To whom did you write? - '''Кому вы написали?'''
:He doesn't know what this means - '''Он не знает, что это значит'''
These can also be used as conjunctions (i.e., words that join sentences together), and are sometimes translated differently than when used as interrogative pronouns:
:I think that's his house - '''Я думаю, что это его дом''''

=== Как? Когда? Почему? ===
'''Как''' ('how'), '''когда''' ('when'), and '''почему''' ('why'), don't conjugate, and are used just like in English:
:How did he do it? - '''Как он это сделал?'''
:How do you get to the theatre? - '''Как пройти в театр?'''
:When will you arrive? - '''Когда вы придёте?'''
:Why doesn't he know? - '''Почему он не знает?'''
:I don't know how he did it - '''Я не знаю, как он это сделал'''
There are a number of common colloquialisms that are standard beginner's phrases:
:How do you do?/How're things? - '''Как дела?'''
:What's your name?/What do they call you? - '''Как вас/тебя завут?''' - ''literally, 'how you (they) call?&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''

=== Сколько? Какой? Чей? ===
This pronoun simply means 'how much' or 'how many':
:How much does it cost? - '''Сколько стоит?'''
:How much did you write? - '''Сколько вы написали?'''
Like other quantity words, it also commands the genitive case. It often calls the plural form of a noun:
:How many apples? - '''Сколько яблок?'''
:How much water? - '''Сколько воды?'''
:How many women? - '''Сколько женщин?'''
The two adjectival pronouns, '''какой''' and '''чей''', are also simple in use. '''Какой''' asks what category something belongs to, or which item of a set, while '''чей''' asks for the owner of something:
:Whose cat is that? - '''Чья это кошка?'''
:What kind of cat is that? - '''Какая это кошка?'''

[[/Сколько Какой Чей quiz/]]

=== Где? Куда? Откуда? ===
The penultimate set of pronouns relate to motion and location. The English 'Where?' can translate in two ways: 'Where are you?' and 'Where are you going?'. '''Где?''' asks the first, locative question, while '''куда''' asks the second, directional question. To ask specifically where someone has come ''from'', use '''откуда'''.
:Where do you live? - '''Где вы живёте?'''
:Where are you walking to? - '''Куда вы идёте?'''
:Where are you walking from? - '''Откуда вы идёте?'''

=== Который? ===
The primary meaning is simply 'which one?', though '''который''' is also used to ask about one particular thing in a sequence of similar things.
:Which apple is mine? - '''Которое яблоко моё?'''
:What time is it? - '''Который час?'''
:Which book do you want? - '''Которую книгу вы хотите?'''
It can also be used as an adjective meaning 'who' or 'whom':
:The woman (who) I'm friends with - '''Же́нщина, с кото́рой я дружу́'''
:The man who changed the world - '''Человек, который изменил мир'''

==Examples==

;к чему это? : What is it?

;Чт'''о''' это? :What is this?

;Кт'''о''' они? :Who are they?

;Куд'''а''' идёт Иван? :Where is Ivan going?

;Отк'''у'''да вы? :Where are you from?

;Когд'''а''' П'''а'''вел и Мар'''и'''на '''е'''здят к род'''и'''телям? :When are Pavel and Marina going to (their) parents?

;Гд'''е''' их род'''и'''тели ж'''и'''ли р'''а'''ньше? :Where did their parents live before?

;В как'''о'''м д'''о'''ме они ж'''и'''ли р'''а'''ньше? :In what kind of house did they live before?

I think this is all great work. But I do not see how it really differs from what we already have conceptually in the lesson layouts (Lessons 1-7). The &quot;topic&quot; (clothing/shopping for clothing) is really a theme, not the &quot;topic&quot;. I would suggest that one topic (really a concept) you have brought into this lesson is that of separable verbs, modal verbs, irregular verbs.  These are not in any way required or special to the theme, but are things you conciously or unconsciously see as points to bring up because there are good examples in the theme conversation.  It is more sensible from a learning perspective to decide where these types of verbs should first be discussed in the book, then develop that lesson. Maybe that IS what you have done here, but your comments seem to suggest that this is somehow a good theme for the lesson on complex verb forms. But any theme could be used for that purpose.  Since that is the case, it is better to lay out the grammar lessons in a sensible progression and then fit themes into the grammar lessons, not the other way around. When I read your suggestions I think you clearly understand the difference between themes and concepts; but you seem not to cover the fact that any concept has to have a certain amount of groundwork laid first (that is mostly what is happening in Lessons 1-5 now). For examplesd: In this lesson you introduce the accusative case, accusative case articles, and complex verb forms.  It seems to me we already have subjects like accusative case (introduced with pronouns) and articles in various cases in the early lessons, but certainly could not start right out with complex verb forms before Lesson 5.  Are you suggesting this as an early lesson or a lesson for beyond Lesson 6? 

Also, I've tried to set up certain structural constants in the textbook: Vokabeln, Grammatik, Gespräche.  These need to be followed as layout guides. They are pretty accommodating to any variety of things that can be fitted in, but you are suggesting just using a different structural element that may or may not offer improvement (just different). I'm reluctant to move too far away from the existing structure for the reason that a good deal of time and thought has gone into the layout.  In this lesson, you have the Gespräche (two different ones) and several Grammatik, so in that sense the lesson follows the basic structure.  The &quot;1 Clothing Vocabulary Introduction&quot; does not.  However, it is the sort of thing that could be handled as in Lesson 3 where words (numbers) form the ''Lernen''.  I do not think this eliminates the need for a Vokabeln somewhere in the lesson. In fact, although the title says &quot;Clothing Vokabulary&quot; it is really just a list of nouns, and you have a separate section for &quot;Clothing Vocabulary ~ Verbs&quot; further down, then 3-3 &quot;Clothing Vocabulary ~ Other Words&quot; at the very bottom.

Your 3-3 Prices just sits there without any structural reason (concept) other than being two words related to shopping (should be in 1 at the top).  Why not just make sure both words appear in the stories? Students should be clever enough to understand how &quot;cheap&quot; and &quot;expensive&quot; might fit into a shopping trip.     

I have no problem with improving the book however you suggest it can use improvements, but you need to be very specific about problems that you encounter.  Hansm also started out by stating everything was just too hard for a beginning student to comprehend, and then developed a nearly equally difficult lesson as an example of an improvement. The lesson was very good and I found places in the textbook to use it.  And he was right about the early lesson difficulty; we all have worked towards making the early lessons easier, mostly by making the German sentences simpler and reducing vocabulary. I think there is still room for improvement there.  But I disagree that any major structural change is called for.  I have several textbooks (highschool and college) that I use to gage where concepts should be introduced.  We are a bit ahead of the highschool level text at the moment, but just a little bit.  One book I have does rely heavily on themes (as you suggest).  It also has pages of naked German (that is no translations given in the text other than the vocabulary near the end of each chapter) in every lesson. In some cases, a German page is followed by an identical page in English. These are approaches I've not much used here. The college level text is strictly chapter by chapter on grammar topics: case, tense, verbs, prepositions, etc.  Way too difficult to serve as a beginning textbook but a very good reference (the Appendices here can be more like this approach).

My conclusions: Themes are good. We can use them.  We do not need to use them exclusively.  We do need to have more simple German material to introduce the student to German: simple poems and stories, perhaps from the public domain. The most difficult thing to do is outline how grammar concepts are going to be introduced. Themes are a way to keep the material interesting, but the grammar concepts have to follow a logical progression.  I may not have that progression down just right yet, but I think the book is close for the first 5 lessons.

Here are comments moved from off the page:

You are looking for shoes. You enter a shoe store and approach a sales clerk (do ''auf Deutsch''; student already knows how to speak English - Marsh).
I think this is an appropriate variation. Making it all German will only force us to add vocabulary and stall the lesson. Also, there is a need to keep the conversation basic and to the point. - SamE
:Opportunities to add vocabulary related to your theme is not stalling the lesson. Student needs as much exemplary German material as we can squeeze in. Any student in a hurry can skip over whatever; but not likely to learn in that case. And I prefer to keep the other themes going that have been developed earlier; those involving characters in earlier lessons. That is one of the overall themes here. You should write a brief intro to this conversation in German as to what Katrin is going shopping for. That way you can squeeze in many of your other clothing nouns! It is not enough to just give the words. They should appear elsewhere in the lesson for reinforcement - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:09, 2 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::This book is a German - English book, not the other way around. We need to teach from the standpoint that we are translating English words, phrases, etc. into German. Too often, mainly because of the vocabulary system of presentation, are we simply translating a German sentence into English. We should be answering the questions like &quot;How do you say...&quot;, not &quot;What does that mean?&quot;, because it would take less explanation and you can stay on the subject. For example, if you simply give someone a paragraph in German and a vocabulary list, they would eventually ask you why it works that way, why the words have the endings they have and/or how you say that. If you teach them how to say something, then have them translate an English paragraph into German, they will ask only, &quot;Is that right?&quot;. Then we can provide an answer key and the lesson will progress faster. Anyway, I think we should provide English in the text so they can know how you translate something into German, not try to figure out how you take something in German back into English, even though they may already know the English we give them. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 00:24, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::I agree with you up to a point. The fact is, that learning another language requires emersion in that language&amp;mdash;preferrably in a speaking environment;secondarily in a written environment. Your &quot;German - English&quot; explanation is wrong.  If it were English-German, the explanatory text would all be in German and the example sentences and stories would be in English with (in some cases) and without (in other cases) German translation. Pick up a texbook on this subject and you will see that the way I have set up the lessons is pretty standard. But of course we also need more English that the student must translate into German.  I have recently completed such an exercise at the bottom of [[German: Lesson 2|Lesson 2]]. I have also observed in textbooks that the more advanced the course, the more material presented in the learning language without translation provided (My graduate level course in German was all stories in German - no translations except for footnote help with idiomatic phrases and the like). So your thoughts are probably more valid for the beginning German lessons you want to produce. Those would have, I suspect, close to a 1:1 ratio of German:English. All sentences would be given in both German and English, with perhaps short pieces in only German - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:57, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::::My point is, we are teaching people familiar with English German. We should tell them what the familiar English phrases mean (&quot;How do you say...&quot;) rather than present them with German and set them at turning that into sensible English. The textbook I refer to and check back with often is a beginner's level one textbook from Holt Rinehart Winston. It is not really 1:1 with the English and German; one other thing they include is a lot of pictures instead of English words. Our biggest disadvantage that we have is that there is no teacher to explain things. I thought that we could have a Q&amp;A page for students that are confused. They would type their question and we could answer it as if we were the teachers. Even other students could respond. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 19:00, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::::Again, I think what you are describing is the approach you want to try with beginning German. Get that first lesson up a running and I will work out links from the cover/contents to it. If you want to include there a link to your email for Q&amp;A you can try it, but I'm not prepared to respond to stray questions. And I point out that the book(s) are not likely to be much used until they get much closer to completion - a future event too far off for me to really contemplate 8^). But you can try it and see if you get questions - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:16, 7 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::::::I started the first lesson; I see you've been to it. I also started a Q&amp;A at [[German:Beginner's Q&amp;A]]. It doesn't use my e-mail, rather, students can edit the page to ask questions. I agree with you that the book is not close to done, but it would be neat if people could ask questions about the development of the site, such as if there will be practice problems, as well. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 23:19, 7 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:::::Yes, having the editablwe page should work and it would be neat if &quot;students&quot; would ask questions. Remember, most others can ask or comment about developmental stuff on the Talk: pages.  I have been working on getting the books linked together in a logical way through their Level TOCs. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 00:55, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)</text>

=Introduction=
In the previous chapter, some new features of XML schemas, documents, and stylesheets were introduced as well as how to model a one-to-many relationship.  In this chapter, we will introduce the modeling of a one-to-one relationship in XML.  We will also introduce more features of an XML schema. 


=A one-to-one (1:1) relationship =

The following diagram shows a one-to-one and a one-to-many relationship. The one-to-one relationship records each country as a single top destination.


[[Image:xmldm1to1.png]]

'''Exhibit 4-1: Data model for a 1:1 relationship'''

=XML schema=
A one-to-one (1:1) relationship is represented in the data model in Exhibit 4-1.  The addition of country and destination to the data model allows the 1:1 relationship named topDestination.  A country has many different destinations, but only one top destination.  The XML schema in Exhibit 4-2 shows how to represent a 1:1 relationship in an XML schema.

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Exhibit 4-2:  XML Schema for a one-to-one relationship &lt;/small&gt;'''

==New elements in schema==
&lt;br&gt;
Let’s examine the new elements and attributes in the schema in Exhibit 4-2.
*Country is a complex type defined in City to represent the 1:M relationship between a country and its cities.
*Destination is a complex type defined in Country to represent the 1:M relationship between a country and its many destinations.
*topDestination is a complex type defined in Country to represent the 1:1 relationship between a country and its top destination.

==Restrictions in schema==
&lt;br&gt;
Placing restrictions on elements was introduced in the previous chapter; however, there are more potentially useful restrictions that can be placed on an element.  Restrictions can be placed on elements and attributes that affect how the processor handles whitespace characters:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;streetAddress&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsd:simpleType&gt;
  &lt;xsd:restriction base=&quot;xsd:string&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xsd:whiteSpace value=&quot;preserve&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:restriction&gt;
 &lt;/xsd:simpleType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===White space &amp; length constraints===
The whiteSpace constraint is set to &quot;preserve&quot;, which means that the XML processor '''will not''' remove any white space characters.  Other useful restrictions include the following:

*Replace – the XML processor will replace all whitespace characters with spaces.
::&lt;xsd:whiteSpace value=&quot;replace&quot;/&gt;
*Collapse – The processor will remove all whitespace characters.
::&lt;xsd:whiteSpace value=&quot;collapse&quot;/&gt;
*Length, maxLength, minLength—the length of the element can be fixed or can have a predefined range.
::&lt;xsd:length value=&quot;8&quot;/&gt;
::&lt;xsd:minLength value=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;
::&lt;xsd:maxLength value=&quot;8&quot;/&gt;

===Order indicators===
In addition to placing restrictions on elements, order indicators can be used to define in what order elements should occur.  

====All indicator====
The &lt;all&gt; indicator specifies by default that the child elements can appear in any order and that each child element must occur once and only once: 

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;person&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;xsd:all&gt;
   &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:all&gt;
 &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Choice indicator====
The &lt;choice&gt; indicator specifies that either one child element or another can occur:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;person&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;xsd:choice&gt;
   &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;employee&quot; type=&quot;employee&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;visitor&quot; type=&quot;visitor&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:choice&gt;
 &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Sequence indicator====
The &lt;sequence&gt; indicator specifies that the child elements must appear in a specific order:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;xsd:element name=&quot;person&quot;&gt;
 &lt;xsd:complexType&gt;
  &lt;xsd:sequence&gt;
   &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;firstname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;xsd:element name=&quot;lastname&quot; type=&quot;xsd:string&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/xsd:sequence&gt;
 &lt;/xsd:complexType&gt;
&lt;/xsd:element&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=XML document=
&lt;br&gt;

The XML document in Exhibit 4-3 shows how the new elements (country and destination) defined in the XML schema found in Exhibit 4-2 are used in an XML document.  Note that the child elements of &lt;topDestination&gt; can appear in any order because of the &lt;xsd:all&gt; order indicator used in the schema.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Newspapers are print media and/or the newsgathering organizations that produce them. Most conventional newspapers are published on a daily or weekly basis, and are meant to inform the general public about recent events, especially public affairs. Besides local, national or international news, papers often carry sports and entertainment features, opinion columns and advertising.

Newspapers may address a general audience, focus on a geographical area, or cover a specialized subject, such as newspapers for a specific profession, industry or interest. Newspapers traditionally are supported by selling advertising space as well as subscription or single-copy sales of the newspapers themselves. Through history, newspapers have sometimes been subsidized by organizations or interest groups, including political parties. Mass-circulation newspapers, such as those evolving in 19th century New York, attempt to appeal to a wider audience (and wider advertising market) than overtly partisan papers. 

As the Internet's World Wide Web spread in the 1990s, newspaper companies established Web editions carrying stories from the print edition and, increasing in the next decade, original material. By 2009 this had blurred the distinction between the printed newspaper and the online newspaper. By 2009, some newspapers were shifting from daily print production to daily Web production with weekly printed editions. Some new Web-only publications adopted reporting and writing styles commonly associated with printed newspapers.

Newspaper advertising categories include:
* &quot;display ads&quot; -- rectangular advertisements, often including images, usually for commercial products and services, or for delivery of issue-oriented or political messages.
* &quot;classified ads&quot; -- (brief advertisements, often text-only, presented in column form by topic: items for sale, help wanted, personal messages, etc. 
* coupons -- small promotional ads that may be cut or torn out to be redeemed for a discount on a product. 

Newspapers are the largest employers of print media.

About 40% of ad revenue for a newspaper comes from classifieds.

==International events==

==National events==
National papers include ''USA Today'' and the ''Christian Science Monitor.''

==Local events==
Newspapers are a populace's main source of local news.

==Editorials==

Editorial pages exist solely to display opinions, usually on political matters. They're kept separate from other areas of the newspaper because the opinions aren't meant to represent the newspaper so much as they are meant as a public forum. An editorial page may consist of political cartoons, letters sent by readers, or a persuasive article.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This e-book can help with the identification of unknown organisms or species. The method adopted uses mostly a ''dichotomous key'' based on two choices, which is either in written format or pictographic, or both. For convenience, there may be polytomous sections within the book.

A written dichotomous key presents the reader with two statements that describe certain characteristics. The statements should be mutually exclusive for the key to work efficiently. For example, 'it is either red or it isn't'. On selecting one, the reader is presented with the next couplet choice in the key and so on - to eventually arrive at an identification. This key uses ''hyperlinks'' to navigate.

==Classification with keys==
[[File:Animal diversity October 2007 for thumbnail.jpg|400px|right]]
Taxonomic systems are based on similar characteristics or increasingly on DNA analysis. The systems attempt to model the natural order, thus helping research by classifying different organisms. Taxonomic systems vary, but the following system has been found useful:
* Domain 
* Kingdom
* Phylum (called Division in plants)
* Class
* Order
* Family
* Genus
* Species

There are many sub units in use.

Keys usually start with a first selection from the following: 
*Plantae - Plants. Typically multicellular, sessile organisms. Their cells have walls composed of cellulose. They are autotrophs, and photosynthesize (with exceptions).
*Animalia- Animals. Typically multicellilar, motile organisms. They lack rigid cell walls and are heterotrophic (with exceptions).
*Protista - (A contested group of around 40 phyla of eukaryotic organisms) Typically simple, eukaryotic unicellular microorganisms or multicellular microorganisms without specialized tissues.
*Fungi - Include yeast and molds. Typically eukaryotic, multicellular organisms. Like plants, they are sessile, but unlike plants they lack chloroplasts and are heterotrophic (with exceptions).
*Bacteria - Ubiquitous, single-celled prokaryotes a few microns in size, with varying morphology.
*Archaea - Relatively small group of single-celled prokaryotes more closely related to the eukaryotes than to the bacteria.

==How the key works==
#Go to start
#Use choices given to arrive at the lowest possible level 
#Organism is identified as much as possible


If the description at each level does not appear accurate then back up to some earlier couplet and start over, questioning each decision more carefully. Finally, a verification step is important by comparing the specimen with any further details available including description,photographs and other reference. The habitat and location where the sample was collected is useful for plants. If the description and other information satisfactorily confer, then a correct identification is possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Slovene is a South Slavic language spoken by roughly 2 million people in Slovenia (long considered to be the northernmost province of Yugoslavia) and in the border regions with northeastern Italy and southern Austria. It is closely related to Serbian ,Croatian, Montenegrin  and Bulgarian, to which it is mutually intelligible to a wide extent in manner similar between Spanish, Catalan, and Galician and Portuguese in the Iberian Peninsula.

Slovene, like almost every Slavic language, is a very tricky language to learn for speakers of Germanic languages (like English and German). It is highly inflected, that is, nouns, numbers, and adjectives decline according to gender (masculine, feminine and neutral) and number. Unlike the closely-related Serbian, which is the only Slavic language that uses both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets and to which it's often compared to , Slovene only uses the Latin script (like a Croats)  with the same characters and diagraphs used by the aforementioned language. What makes Slovene stand out from others is that, not only it uses singular and plural, but it also uses the dual number system. In other words, there are verb conjugations, noun declinations and adjectives meant for two people or two groups, while the plural is meant for three and above. Of all the Balto-Slavic Languages, only Sorbian (found in what's popularly called East Germany, near the border with Poland) and Lithuanian retain the dual system inherited from old Slavonic.  Slovene is often described as the true ''Romantic'' language because in Slovene it is possible to distinguish between ''we'' (plural) meaning a group of people including yourself and ''we'' (dual) meaning one other person and yourself.

There are a total seven noun cases in Slovene, like most Slavic languages. Slovene uses both Latin and Slavic names for case, both correct and interchangeably used: nominative ('''imenovalnik'''), accusative ('''akuzativ-tožilnik'''), genitive ('''genitiv-rodilnik'''), dative (dative-dajalnik), locative ('''lokativ-mestnik'''), instrumental ('''instrumental-orodnik'''), and vocative ('''vokative-zvalnik'''). Like [[Russian]], [[Belorussian]] and [[Slovak]], the vocative is very rarely used, typically in texts of religious character. For that reason, the vocative will not be used in this textbook.

This textbook will made under the assumption that the reader has, at least, some basic knowledge of Russian, Polish, Serbo-Croatian or any other Slavic language. If you do have some familiarity with these languages, you'll be surprised how closely related they are how their grammar structures are almost identical. A knowledge of some Old Church Slavonic (old Bulgarian) will help understand the dual number system.

Welcome to the Wikibook course on [[w:Greek language|Greek]]. Please read the [[Greek:Introduction|Introduction]] before beginning.

==Table of Contents==

There will be two ways of using this wikibook. You may wish to learn in a '''lesson'''-style way, with knowledge organised from the easier- to the harder-to-learn material, or you may want to look for a specific topic using the '''table of contents''', which is organised by topics rather to difficulty. Either way, we recommend the reading of the '''introduction.'''

===Introduction / Εισαγωγή===
====About Greek / Για τα Ελληνικά====
The '''[[w:Greek language|Greek Language]]''' (Η [[w:el:Ελληνική γλώσσα|Ελληνική γλώσσα]]) is an [[w:Indo-European|Indo-European]] language with a documented history of some 3,000 years. ''Ancient Greek'' in its various forms was the language both of classical Greek civilisation and of the origins of Christianity, and was a first or second language over a large part of the Roman Empire. It has been studied in schools and universities in many countries from the Renaissance onwards. ''Modern Greek'', which differs in many ways from Ancient Greek but is still recognisably the same language, is spoken by approximately 12 million speakers worldwide, most of whom live in Greece and Cyprus. Greek is traditionally written in the [[Greek: Alphabet|Greek Alphabet]].

This wikibook pretends to discuss and expose '''Modern Greek'''. 

See also [[Ancient Greek]], [[Koine Greek]].

====Alphabet / Αλφάβητο====
The '''Greek Language''' was one of the first written languages in all world. The [[w:Script|script]] used had some peculiarities not observed today: for instance, the vowels were not written, and one needed to guess or to know their specific place inside the word. This alphabet has been evolving, through contact with other cultures and through the simple action of the time, until it became what it is today. Amongst the Greek alphabet, we can spot some (or even many) similarities with the [[w:Latin alphabet|Latin (or Roman) one]]. The alphabet used nowadays has 24 letters: 7 vowels and 17 consonants.

Besides the alphabet, there is also an accent ( ´ ) and a diaresis( ¨ ). The use of these two [[w:Diacritic|diacritics]] is discussed in the [[Greek: Phonology|next section]].

==Pronunciation of the Alphabet==
Greek sounds are, in general, soft. As a major rule, each letter carries a single sound (this is not universal, but almost, as we'll see later in this page). As in the [[Greek: Alphabet|previous chapter]], we see here a table with the various letters. This time, the columns represent not the name, but the ''approximate'' sound of the letters.

'''Note''': The letter Γγ is the most dificult to pronounce for an English speaker: it is like a stronger '''h''', simultaneous with the vibration of the vocal cords;  in other words, it is the voiced counterpart of the '''χ'''. Before '''e''' and '''i''' vowels, it is pronounced as a '''y''' like in the word '''y'''es.

==Diphthongs==
''[[w:Diphthongs|Diphthongs]]'' are combinations of two vowels that function as a unique sound. Note that in Modern Greek, the word ''Diphthong'' (δίφθογγος) is also used for combination of vowels that sound like a simple vowel ([[w:Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]). There are eight diphthongs in Modern Greek. There are also some similar combinations of consonants:

|}

==Accent and Dieresis==
Most Greek words have a ''stressed syllable'' which is the syllable said with more strength: for instance, in the english words ''comfort'' and ''peculiarity'', the stressed syllables are ''com'' and ''ar'', respectively.

In all other words (those with two or more syllables), an '''accent''' ( ΄ ) is used above the syllable to mark the stress. In most one-syllable words, the accent is omitted. When the stress falls on a syllable that has a diphthong, the accent is used above the last letter of this diphthong. Thus, the accents are as shown on these words: Παύλος (''Paul'') ou γυναίκα (''woman''). 

If the accent is put on the first vowel of a diphthong, it is pronounced as two separate vowels rather than as a diphthong, as in the word ρολόι (''watch'' or ''clock''), which has three syllables, not two. On the other hand, if the diphthong is pronounced as two vowels but the accent falls on second vowel, the '''dieresis''' ( ¨ ) is used, as in the word Εβραϊκός (''Hebrew'').

There are, however, some words that aren't stressed (usually monosyllabic gramatical words), and these don't have an accent. Words like these are read as affixes added to the main word. '''Examples''':
*'''ο (''the'' masc.)''' &quot;Ο πατέρας&quot; (''The father'') is read as if it were a single word - ''aw-pah-TE-ras'';
*'''μου (''my'')''', &quot;Ο πατέρας μου&quot; (''My father'') is also read as if it were a single word - ''aw-pa-TE-raz-mu''.

Every stressed word with more than one syllable carries an accent. However, there are monosyllabic words that also have accent, like ή (''or'') and πού (''where''). This accent has a double function:
*It distinguishes words that, otherwise, would be equal - η (''the'' fem.) and που (''that, which'');
*It marks words as strong, unlike their weak comparing counterparts.

'''Celery''' is a green vegetable. Usually the long crunchy stalks are eaten, but people also eat the leaves and [[Cookbook:Celery Root|main root]]. Celery is very low in [[Cookbook:Calorie|Calories]], high in water, and high in [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]].

Celery stalks have long 'strings' in them which many people find unpleasant. The strings can be wholly or partly removed before cooking - snap the bottom end of the celery and a small portion of the strings will be visible. Just grab them one at a time and pull firmly upwards and they'll come out. Thinly slicing celery crosswise is a less-wasteful way to deal with this annoyance.

Celery can be [[Cookbook:Braising|braised]], made into [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] or cooked as a vegetable in its own right.

The seeds are considered a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

[[Image:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|right|thumb|Apple sliced in half crosswise]]
'''Apples''' are a very important food in all cooler climates.  To a greater degree than other tree fruit, except possibly citrus, apples store for months while still retaining much of their nutritive value.  Winter apples, picked in late fall and stored just above freezing in a cellar or &quot;fruit room&quot; have been an important food in Europe and the USA since the 1800s.

==Apple Cultivars==
[[Image:Apples.jpg|right|thumb|Apples come in many varieties and flavors.]]
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Cultivars are available for subtropical and temperate climates. Apples do not flower in tropical climates because they have a chilling requirement.

Among the most common commercial apple cultivars (and the places where they are commonly grown) are 'Braeburn' (Australia, New Zealand), 'Cox's Orange Pippin' (Britain, New Zealand - old cultivar, but still very popular) 'Fuji' (Asia, Australia, North America), 'Gala' (Australia, New Zealand), 'Golden Delicious' (United States, Europe), 'Granny Smith' (Australia, California), 'Jonagold' (United States), 'Jonathan' (United States), 'McIntosh' (Canada, United States), 'Red Delicious' (Australia, United States), and 'Winesap' (United States).  All those apples except the last are sweet and colorful. 'Granny Smith' is tart; some people eat it fresh and it is popular for cooking. Its skin is a light speckled green. It requires a long growing season and a hot climate to mature fully, though inferior fruits are grown in unsuitable areas. (A 'Granny Smith' apple is portrayed on the logo of Apple Records, a record label that publishes music by The Beatles.)

===Flavors of apples===
[[Image:Red delicious, half.jpg|thumb|A Red Delicious apple, cut in half lengthwise.]]
Tastes in apples vary from one person to another and have changed over time. As an example, the state of Washington (United States) made its reputation for growing 'Red Delicious' apples. But in recent years other cultivars have steadily grown in popularity; many have come to regard 'Red Delicious' as an inferior apple of excessively bland flavor and soft texture. Such people have gravitated toward crisper apples such as 'Fuji' and 'Gala'.

Modern apples are rarely sweeter than older cultivars; most modern apple breeding has concentrated more on high yield and commercial presentability - uniformity of color, size and shape, and the ability to withstand transport with minimal bruising (tough-skinned), with little thought given to eating quality. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following. Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia. Many newly developed apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other traits desired in modern apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, typical Washington 'Red Delicious' apple shape, long stem (to allow pesticides to penetrate the top of the fruit), and acceptable flavor to the average person. Old cultivars are often richly flavored, but are commercially unviable due to low yield, poor transportability, and poor appearance, often being oddly shaped, and russeted and have a variety of textures and colors. Some old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been kept alive by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique flavor and appearance are out there to discover, such as 'Egremont Russet' with its richly nutty flavor; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local heirlooms from extinction.

There are cultivars of apples cultivated specifically for producing [[Cookbook:Cider|cider]]. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat out of hand, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that ordinary eating apples cannot.

==Uses==

Apples can be canned, juiced, and/or fermented to produce [[Cookbook:Apple juice|apple juice]], cider, [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|vinegar]], and [[Cookbook:Pectin|pectin]]. Distilled cider (&quot;hard cider&quot; in North America) produces the [[Cookbook:Spirit|spirits]] [[Cookbook:Applejack|applejack]] and [[Cookbook:Calvados|Calvados]]. 

Apples are an important ingredient in many winter [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]]s, for example apple pie, apple crumble and apple cake. They are often eaten [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] or [[Cookbook:Stewing|stewed]], and they can also be dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. [[Cookbook:Purée|Puréed]] apples are generally known as [[Cookbook:Applesauce|applesauce]]. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly, and are also used cooked in meat dishes.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Apples|1|1|1|1|1|1|3|3|3|3|1|1}}

In the northern hemisphere, the apple season starts in July with the early cultivars, which are harvested until August. Later cultivars are harvested until October. Since apples store exceptionally well under refrigeration they are available out of season without much effort or loss of flavor.

[[Image:Cauliflower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cauliflower]]                    

'''Cauliflower''' is a cruciform [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetable]] flower head. It is very similar to [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]], but with a different flavor. Cauliflower is naturally light green, but will be white if it is kept from the sun. Normally this is done by tying the leaves over the flower head (this operation can also be used to make broccoli light green instead of dark blue-green). A purple variety of cauliflower is sometimes available that turns blue when cooked. It's great for novelty value, but tastes slightly bitter. Cauliflower is useful as generic vegetable matter, because few people have a strong opinion for or against it. Cauliflower tends to have a bland flavor on its own, and can thus absorb a variety of other flavors.

Common ways to eat cauliflower include:
*overcooked and mushy, with a thick covering of [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]
*raw or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]], in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]] or with [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*cooked as part of a [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] or mixed vegetable dish
*roasted, with the head broken into florets, tossed with [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], salt, and pepper, and put in a roasting pan in a 475° oven for 35-40 minutes

Sometimes cauliflower is pickled, typically to be sold with [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] and [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickled cucumbers]].

[[Image:Cilantro-alsterdrache.jpg|thumb|right|Cilantro.]]

'''Cilantro''' is the fresh leafy part of the [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] plant. Particularly outside the USA, cilantro may go by other names including ''dhania'', ''coriander leaves'', ''Chinese parsley'' and ''Mexican parsley''.

Cilantro has a very different taste from coriander seeds (hence the different name). Cilantro tastes soapy to some people. This difference in perception of the flavor of the leaves may have a genetic cause.

Fresh cilantro is an important ingredient in [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian cuisine]] and in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] [[Cookbook:Salsa|Salsas]]. Chopped cilantro is also used as a garnish on cooked dishes such as [[Cookbook:Dal|dal]].

Cilantro should never itself be cooked as heat quickly destroys its delicate flavor.
Dried cilantro has very little taste.

{{spice}}

'''Coriander''' is a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] commonly used in Latin American, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]], and South-east Asian cooking.
It is a key ingredient in Indian curries and [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|garam masala]].  It is also used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] and Arabic cooking.

Coriander is related to [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] and [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]].
All parts of the plant are edible. The fresh leaves (which should be called [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] to avoid confusion) and the dried seedpods are the parts most commonly used in cooking.
This article refers to the &quot;seeds&quot; (botanically the fruit) of the coriander plant. See the [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] article if a recipe specifies ''coriander leaves'' or if it specifies ''fresh coriander'' but not ''fresh coriander seeds''. In such cases, please adjust the recipe to avoid confusion.

The seeds have a lemon citrus flavor when crushed.  It is also described as warm, nutty, spicy, and orange-flavoured.  The seeds are usually dried but can be eaten green. Ground coriander is a major ingredient in [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]] and other aromatic dishes. 

If the spice is bought whole in a non-dried form, it can be dried in the sun.  Most commonly, it is bought as whole dried seeds, or in ground form.  If whole, it can be roasted or heated on a dry pan briefly to enhance the aroma before grinding it in an electric grinder or with a [[Cookbook:Mortar and Pestle|mortar and pestle]].  Store coriander in a tightly sealed container away from sunlight and heat.  For maximum flavour use within 6 months and keep for no more than 1 year.

== Safety ==
Many meats can become infected with various bacteria, such as Staphylicoccus, Campylobacter Jejuni, and E. Coli O157:H7, when the animal is butchered. This can occur because the intestines can be accidentally cut into, releasing contaminated fecal matter, and butcher's knives can bacome contaminated. Infection chances are greatly reduced by thorough cooking.

{{Wikipedia|Italian cuisine}}

==Introduction==
'''Italian cuisine''' has a tradition of dishes based on wheat products (such as bread and pasta), vegetables, cheese, fish, and meat, usually prepared in such a manner as to preserve their ingredients' natural qualities, appearance, and taste.

This kind of cuisine puts a stress on lightness and healthy nutrition with natural not processed foods, and tends to vary greatly not only with the seasons but also between the various regions of the country: mountainous regions have dishes rich in proteins, and prefer meat, butter, and cheese, while seaside regions have dishes rich in vegetables and fish. 

In this way, the cuisine is born of the people, the territory and the seasons, and is not pulled out of nowhere for no rhyme or reason.

==Cooking techniques==
Owing to its peasant roots, classic Italian cooking is inherently simple, and the cooking techniques used therein are those that were accessible to people who worked long hours and had limited resources. This explains the absence of dishes that include elements such as fine pastry or delicate sauces—things which require long, close attention and precise temperatures.

The most common techniques in Italian cooking are:
*'''Boiling or simmering''': food is cooked in hot water. Examples of this include pastas, rice, vegetables, and tough but flavorful cuts of meat.

*'''Pan frying''': food is quickly cooked in a small amount of very hot fat—butter or vegetable oil. This is what we commonly think of as “sautéing.” Although some dishes are cooked in larger amounts of oil—say, an inch or two—deep-fat frying, which requires a large amount of (expensive) oil is rare.

*'''Braising''': food is browned in hot fat, then cooked in a moderate amount of flavored liquid (wine, broth or vegetable juice), most often with aromatic vegetables and other seasonings. A good example of braising is ''[[Cookbook:Ossobuco Alla Milanese|Osso Buco]]'', braised veal shanks. In some respects, risotto is a braised dish; though similar to braising, its method of preparation is entirely unique.

*'''Pan roasting''': similar to braising, the food is initially browned in hot fat; it is then cooked in a small amount of liquid—just enough to keep it moist. This is most often used for chicken, rabbit, and certain cuts of pork and veal—flavorful cuts of meat which are often spit-roasted or, in modern kitchens, oven-roasted.

*'''Grilling''': food is quickly cooked over the embers of a hardwood or charcoal fire. This is used for tender, well-marbled cuts of beef and pork, small game birds, and, on the coast, certain kinds of seafood. 

One may wonder “what about baked goods?” As Marcella Hazan notes in ''The Classic Italian Cookbook'', “Reliable ovens are only a recent addition to the Italian kitchen....” As such, breads and cakes were rarely made in the home but, rather, were purchased from the local bakery. Dishes which are oven-baked, like pizza or lasagne, usually require no more than 15-20 minutes baking time to finish. These were traditionally prepared at home, then taken to the local bakery for the final baking.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== This needs to be updated ==

Now that I'm going to actually publish a book from Wikibooks, I've discovered a whole bunch of problems relating to copyright status that need to be covered.  Essentially, I think we need to take most of the contents regarding hard copy printing and throw them out.

According to U.S. law (and perhaps others), every single author needs to be given attribution, not just the top 5 contributors.  Or perhaps we need to get a second opinion on this.  Is is the top 5 edits by edit count?  What other criteria are we going to use?  What about requirements for nationality and place of residence? (This is for formal copyright registration.)

I'm going to take this discussion to Wikipedia for some wider comment as well, but it needs to be updated and modified here, especially as it relates to Wikibooks. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:45, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

: It would be interesting to get an update to learn if there were any results from this. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 03:14, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

== Why GFDL instead of GPL? ==

The GFDL looks as though it tries to give the original authors control over derived works by allowing invariant sections.  I have seen mention of one document where the author has specified the whole of the document as an invariant section (I'll try to find a link).  This makes a nonsense of any supposed ability to create derived or improved works.  It seems that Wikibooks has made a deliberate attempt avoid this by stating that there will be no invariant sections, no front matter, etc.  This seems to reduce the GFDL to something approaching the GPL so why not use the GPL instead?

I can imagine circumstances where it would be desirable to include some of these books (if any of them ever attain the necessary quality) in Debian.  But the GFDL is incompatible with the Debian social contract (as interpreted by Debian) so it can't be done; see http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.html.

:It would have been nice for you to sign this statement with a &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; (four tildas) to let us know who you are and your opinion here.  See the editing help page on Meta for more details.  Going through the history log I can also find this information, but by omitting the sig, it seems as a random comment and hard to seperate out from other content.

:I for one agree that the GFDL does have problems that need to be resolved, and is in need of some major overhaul...much more than the GPL.  If you go to the [http://www.gnu.org/ Free Software Foundation website] you can find some discussion about this issue as well, and be able to help change the GFDL to overcome some of the objections you are talking about.  I will say also, however, that the GPL is missing some key components for textual literary works that are not needed for computer source code or binary distribution, so the GPL is also insufficient to cover everything that you need for a literary work.  Wikibooks, and indeed all Wikimedia Foundation projects actually use a specific subset of the GFDL that cover the GFDL with &quot;with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.&quot;  This is a key distinction that avoid many of the common objections, but there are others to worry about as well, as you've pointed out.&lt;p&gt;BTW, you might want to do a very careful read of version 1.2 of the GFDL to see that some of the objections have also been dealt with.  It appears as though the Debian position statement was for the GFDL version 1.0, which is different from the 1.2 version (although not apparent from the discussion).  Of particular note is that the transparent vs. opaque discussion IMHO is totally wrong.  Opaque copies  are the literary version of binary distribution.  PDF files are a good example, although this is primarily concerned with printed copies that don't even require computer technology to be able to &quot;read&quot; them.  The attempt in this section is to encourage people recieving printed works that they don't have to go through a Distributed Proofreaders type of OCR conversion (with editing rounds) just to have the ability to reprint the book they are reading.  If you have ever read a manual that was a 6th or 10th generation photocopy of some other document, I hope you appreciate what having the original &quot;source material&quot; as a machine readable text can mean.  The GPL has similar requirement for binary distribution together with the source, and as a matter of policy myself when distributing software (I am a software engineer who has also used the GPL for some projects) I include a copy of the source as well... especially at the download site (which is critical).  Unfortuately when you buy a book in a bookstore, the &quot;download site&quot; into your hands to read the book usually does not have a computer network terminal or other convinent means to get the source material.  The same could be said if you bought a CD-ROM with GPL software (I've done that too), but if you abide with the spirt of the GPL, the source would also be included.  Some of this is also derived from the fights over items like Tivo that are reluctant to release source code for GPL'd software modification that consumers are indirectly using.  This makes it clear that you as an end-user should be able to get raw machine readable source material somehow.  I've also been involved with an unscrupilous supervisor who &quot;GPL'd&quot; some software for one day only, and &quot;copyied&quot; the software for his own personal use when he left the company.  A similar issue happened with the Gnutella network software when it was released by Netscape just before the AOL buyout (or was that right afterward?)&lt;p&gt;There are other legal issues that pertain only to literary works that the GFDL attempts to deal with that are not really covered with any other licese, although Creative Commons does try to do a good job.  The GPL/GFDL incompatability issues are a huge deal, and that is something that IMHO the Free Software Foundation can and should deal with (particularly since they wrote both licenses).  In short, if you want to make a copyleft literary work available, what license would you suggest?  Also keep in mind that this issue has been throughally vetted in other forums, including when [[w:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]], [[w:Nupedia|Nupedia]], and [[w:Gnupedia|Gnupedia]] all were started.  These are essentially the same thing...or at least have similar roots and the projects all merged together at some point.  As far as how this affects Wikibooks, on the other hand, is another issue.  We do, however, have to maintain compatability with other Wikimedia projects, and keep in mind that all existing content on all Wikimedia Foundation servers (slightly over 1 TB of data, from what I've seen, and growing at a rate of about 4-7% per ''month'') is already GFDL'd, so changing licenses is going to be a huge deal, not something done as a casual unsigned comment on an obscure page is going to change.  We treat this issue seriously, however, and invite discussion of what changes can be done to help encourage a copyleft distribution of literary content.  At this point, however, the GFDL may have to be changed than for us to change to something other than the GFDL.... and it may be easier to accomplish as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:13, 22 August 2005 (UTC)

Sorry about the lack of signature, I'm afraid I'm not very competent at editing yet.  [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 18:57:43, 2005-08-22 (UTC)

I'm afraid I really don't know what license would be best and I'm not really qualified to pronounce on it anyway. What I want is that any content that I provide be available to anyone to use for whatever purpose they wish and for those who distribute derived works to be required to give the same freedoms to everyone else. Additionally I do not want to burden those who might want to create a derived work from a small part of a document with requirements to attach verbose licences (WikiTravel has a discussion on exactly this point explaining why they rejected the GFDL). Any incompatibility between GPL and GFDL would be especially important to me and to many programmers because we write both code and manuals for that code. A substantial program might also have a textbook associated with it. The point is to encourage the free flow of information. I do understand that there are a lot of documents in these Wiki's now that are covered by GFDL but I can't agree that that is a reasonable argument against change, only against careless change. Circumstances change all the time. Anyway how could you change the licence of existing text? Wouldn't you have to contact all the contributors? I'm aware of the clause in both GPL and GFDL that state that the creator of a derived work can follow the rules in 'any later version' but I wonder how that would stand up to a legal challenge if the terms were to change significantly.  Sorry about the mutiple edits, finger trouble on the refresh button. [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 09:17:47, 2005-08-23 (UTC)

:If you want to get a glimpse at the magnitude of your request, see [[Special:Listusers|User list]], which is a list of all of the registered users here on Wikibooks.  And keep in mind that a substantial number of people also contribute &quot;anonymously&quot;, so technically you would have to dump the entire database and restart the entire project if you decided to switch licenses.  This is currently under discussion at Wikitree (a genealogical website that wants to become a part of Wikimedia sometime in the future... if possible).  The problem there is that the person who started the site made the license CC-by-SA-NC, which made it incompatable with the GFDL and the GPL in a major way (the non-commercial use only clause).  A debate there over what license should be used is occuring, and they are facing the very real possibility of throwing away their entire database and restarting the project.  It is only a couple of months old, so that may be a real possibility, and they do consider that the project proposal is still in beta.  License issues at the beginning of a project are critical.  This debate is also ongoing at Wikinews, and their &quot;solution&quot; to the problem is to simply make all content put into the public domain (no license at all).  That way it is compabatable with all copyleft licenses until they can come to a decision as to what specific copyleft license that they want to use, even if they have to draft that license themselves.  That also misses the legal protections that a copyright license affords to keep people abusing the &quot;commons&quot;, but in the case of Wikinews it was not perceived to be as big of a deal.  The #1 complaint there is the license republishing requirement of the GFDL made it absurd to use GFDL (as would the GPL under similar circumstances) for any short 5-10 paragraph news articles by commercial news outlets (like a small-town newspaper that decided to trash their annual AP wire fee and use Wikinews instead... or even as a suppliment).&lt;p&gt;Particularly so visible of a project like Wikimedia Foundation projects do indeed get notice from the Free Software Foundation, and it is having a major impact in the future of the GFDL.  There are discussions going on right now (on some mailing lists that I don't know the URL for at the moment) about future changes to the GFDL that has included comments from Wikipedia and other Wikimedia users, and taken very seriously.  Particularly when you note that Wikipedia alone is perhaps close to 50% of current content written using the GFDL (or more...but stats like that would be hard to come by).  Both the GPL and the GFDL are due for an update soon and both have been announced by Richard Stallman.  The GPL update is a bigger concern because Linus Torvald got rid of the &quot;or later update&quot; clause in the GPL for the Linux kernel, which &quot;freezes&quot; the GPL at it current version.  Linus did that for a specific legal reason, and debate over that decision can be found elsewhere on the web. Slashdot has done a particularly good job of covering that specific issue (especially within the user comment areas), but you do have to dig real hard.&lt;p&gt;If you do want to get involved with this issue and bring it up to a larger audience that includes people who can make a change (at least within the Wikimedia Foundation) I would suggest that you look at [http://mail.wikipedia.org/mailman/listinfo/foundation-l The Wikimedia Foundation mailing list] (also refered to commonly as Foundation-l on Wikimedia projects).  There are a couple of hot-button ideas at the moment, but I'm sure you would get a solid reply as to why the GFDL is being used.  You might want to dig through the archives as well if you might be interested.  There are a couple of computer programming Wikibooks where issues of GPL/GFDL compatability are of importance, so there is some reason to try and hit this issue as well.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 12:24, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

== Compatible licences ==

Is there a list of licences that are compatible with the GFDL? 

What I mean is: is there an easy way to discover whether a document or an excerpt from a document can be incorporated in a WikiBook without having to read carefully through all the complicated clauses.  For instance, is the OpenOffice Public License compatible (http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/PDL.html). 

A concrete example: I would like to take some information from ''Programming OpenOffice.org with Visual Basic'' (http://www.kalitech.fr/clients/doc/VB_APIOOo_en.html) but it is under the OO public license which looks to me as though it isn't compatible, but I'm not sure. [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 09:03, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

:I would recommend that you take a look at the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html GNU License List] that compares several licenses to licenses authored by the Free Software Foundation.  Look toward the bottom of the page for the GFDL compatable licenses as opposed to the GPL.  There are a couple licenses listed there that are compatable, and this list should be expanded.  If you are interested in researching this topic, it would be a good discussion to add to the [[m:|Wikimedia Meta Server]] and adding a list of compatable licenses to the GFDL.  In addition, writing to Richard Stallman or somebody else at the Free Software Foundations with some document licenses that may be compatable with the GFDL would be useful as well.  This is something that Mr. Stallman in particular is interested in and will give you some sort of reply on the matter... especially if the website in incomplete from what you have found out.  I've had contact with Mr. Stallman in the past, and he has been very gracious and reasonable in his replies if you are also reasonable with your request.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:15, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

== Orphan works ==

I have found a number of web pages that would make worthwhile
additions to [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic]] but have failed to
make contact with the copyright holders.  It isn't just that the email
isn't answered, sometimes it bounces and even Google fails to turn up
a plausible alternative address.

I wonder if anyone has any suggestions about how to track down the
copyright holders of such orphan works.  It seems to me that there is
a lot of material on the web that is effectively unuseable because it
has neither an explicit license granting free use nor a live contact
who can be asked for permission.  Sadly academic sites seem to be
frequent offenders in this regard, even where they have an email
address specifically noted as the one to use regarding copyright the
mail often goes unanswered. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 21:25, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

:This is an ugly can of worms that you have just opened up.  Prior to the &quot;internationalization&quot; of U.S. copyright (at least in the USA) that occured in the mid 1970's, all copyrighted works in the USA were required to file a formal registration with the U.S. Copyright Office, which is a part of the Library of Congress.  As a part of the registration process, you needed to list the address of the publisher and other contact information, as well as the complete names and nationalities of all authors for the copyrighted work.  This registration still occurs, but now it is voluntary and is seldom done except for items that are widely published or for people that don't mind paying the registration fee to do the formal paperwork.  By registering the copyrighted work now, you gain statutory damages of $175,000 or more for a single copyright violation... that is above and beyond actual damages which can also be included.  That copyright damage award can even be assessed against copyleft documents like Wikipedia (if somebody copies Wikipedia content, for example, without including the GFDL fine print or if they in turn claim copyright on the content).  If the stuff you are trying to locate has been registered, you can contact the Library of Congress and get the publisher contact information.  You may even be able to get that information on-line without having to actually talk to somebody.

:For internet web pages, you can also try to find the domain registration information.  For example, you can go to:

http://www.internic.org/whois.html

:and look up the '''''whois''''' information about the domain.  Try to type in wikipedia.org in the domain area as an example to find who &quot;owns&quot; wikipedia.org.  Back in the &quot;good old days&quot; this information was rather accurate, but the U.S. Dept. of Commerce has totally screwed up the internet and this registration is now close to meaningless.  Still, you might get a clue as to who might have set up the internet domain, and sometimes people are honest when filling out these domain registrations.  These addresses are usually Snail-Mail but also include sometimes e-mail addresses as well.  I have seen addresses on Mars or Alpha Centari, so you can take those sort of addresses with a grain of salt.  Better than having no contact information, however.  By going through internic, you may have to do a domain search on a ''registrar's'' server, but internic has the names of the secondary registrars that you have to look up the information with, and generally where to go.  The Whois information is supposed to be free to the public, but sometimes a bit of a pain to get to and some registrars don't exactly make it easy to find the &quot;Whois&quot; button on their web page.

:The Library of Congress just had a symposium on what to do with orphaned works, and I believe is still seeking written comments about changes to copyright law.  This issue is also likely to come before some future session of the U.S. Congress in the near future, so make sure you write to your local congressman if you are an American (or even if you aren't but want to weigh in on the issue.)  Orphan works in particular would not be an issue with the old copyright laws, as a copyright which expires in just 20 years would normally be no big deal.  With the current life+75 years, and no legal way to even know when a given author died unless they are incredibly famous, you can consider the current copyright term to be about 200 years.... basically the works of Thomas Jefferson would still be under copyright if the powers that be had their way.

:In general, unless you have explicit permission in the form of something like the GFDL or something written by the author in your possession, consider most written works to be under copyright and untouchable for the purposes of Wikibooks.  If you havn't guessed, I do have some strong political opinions on this subject.--[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:33, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

::Quote: 'consider most written works to be under copyright and untouchable for the purposes of Wikibooks'.  That's pretty much what I concluded.  The contact problem is generally not that I can't find out who is likely to be the copyright holder but that I can't get them to answer email even when I can be certain that they have received it.  In one instance I even got an autoreply which said that the recipient was off work sick and I still didn't get a real reply.  I just can't believe that most people get so much email that they can't afford the time to write one line saying yes or no.  I think that I'll just have to admit that large chunks of the Visual Basic Classic book just won't ever get written because I'm too lazy to write the introductory stuff and have failed to get permission to copy anything else and haven't been able to persuade anyone else to contribute either.  (Insert your favourite swear word here!) :-( --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 17:06, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

== Permission Statements ==

What is the correct procedure when one has obtained permission to incorporate a copyrighted work?  Where should that permission be stored?  Is there any way of ensuring that the permission is not accidentally or deliberately overwritten or changed?  See [[Programming:Visual Basic Classic/Coding Standards]] for an example.  I placed the permission on the page where the work will eventually be written simply as a placeholder, I want to move it to a more logical place so that it is not in the middle of the actual text, but where?  The talk page for that module doesn't seem right to me because modules can be radically changed so that the talk page no longer applies.  Neither does the talk page for the main page of the book seem the right place as there is so much else there.  Perhaps there should be a specific repository for such things?  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 07:10, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

:Update: I've added a separate page in the book for such things. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 10:30, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== Non-commercial only distribution of Wikibooks content ==

There is a part of the [[LD]] wikibook (the CAT method in Appendixes) which may only be distributed freely if it is in its entirety and used non-commercially. Do I put the document (which has no official website) in its own page, so that it will be protected from editing? Do I remove the method? Do I replace it with a link to a forum post where he posted it? Do I contact the copyright holder to ask for a more liberal (yes, POV of me) license? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 16:54, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I'll try to contact you directly on your use page about this issue, but yes, we need to make sure all content added to Wikibooks follows the terms of the GFDL, including the capability of commercial entities redistributing the content.  If there is a non-commercial use only clause, such as the CC-by-SA-NC license, or even explicit non-commercial entities only, it is a copyright violation to have that content on Wikibooks.  There are already several commercial mirrors of Wikibooks, and that is legal to do as long as they abide by the terms of the GFDL.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:47, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

== Books under alternative licenses ==

Currently the project page states:
:''All content is considered to be released under the following terms unless otherwise indicated (for example; a clearly-marked quotation);''
I find this a little ambiguous. How prominent does the licensing statement have to be? Is a it enough to put it on the main page or does every page need to have it as well? What about talk pages?

== Some additions ==

I would like to add text to this policy that indicates the following:
#Once a license has been granted to Wikibooks for material, an author may not remove or alter that license (follows from [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:GNU_Free_Documentation_License#9._TERMINATION Section 9 of the GFDL]).
#That the page histories count as a [[w:byline]], and serve as legal attribution under the GFDL. Additional lists of authors are completely optional, are not considered &quot;Invariant sections&quot;, and are not binding.
These two points both follow directly from the GFDL, although many people have not completely read the text of that license and there is some confusion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:09, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

: '''Support'''. I didn't see this before but I do not object to either of these changes. I'm not sure what you mean by a ''byline'', I think we can just call it a &quot;history&quot; since the GFDL counts that as a legitimate attribution as well in the &quot;combinations&quot; section. [[User:Mattb112885|Mattb112885]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Mattb112885|talk]]) &lt;/small&gt; 18:01, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
: '''Mixed view''' - while certainly something that can give credit to contributors, the page histories of MediaWiki does not really give enough information to effectively credit authors.  I think it is something that can be worked with and derived from most page histories, but we shouldn't be establishing any legally binding opinions here.  Certainly we shouldn't claim that this is legal attribution.  It is a form of attribution that can be used to help determine who the authors really are, and with some work (quite a bit of work, actually) you can obtain the necessary information for proper legal attribution.  I should note that the &quot;invariant sections&quot; of the GFDL is one of those things that causes huge complications when doing legal interpretations of the GFDL, and is one of the more controversial parts of this license.  I could give some suggestions on how to meet the requirements of section 2(b) of the GFDL (author lists), but randomly grabbing five people from the page history is certainly not sufficient.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:19, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

=== Update needed: book donations ===

The &quot;[[Wikibooks: book donations]]&quot; page currently implies that &quot;All books on Wikibooks must be released under the GFDL.&quot; and that using &quot;CC-BY-SA... can be problematic.&quot;.

It sounds to me like the &quot;book donations&quot; page was written sometime before Wikibooks switched from GFDL to CC-BY-SA in 2009, and no longer reflects the current situation.

Should I simply delete all the stuff on that page about copyrights and replace it with a link to [[Wikibooks:Copyrights]], or would something else be more useful to our readers?

== Recipes ==

Greetings, I would like to update [[Cookbook:Berbere]] based upon a recipe published in an actual cookbook ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Berbere#Ingredients some background], if you're interested). My understanding is that a list of ingredients is not protected by copyright (at least, not in the US), although the preparation steps are protected.  I don't think it would be too useful to have one without the other, and I'm not sure it's really possible to reword the preparation and still come up with an original work.  I've looked at [[Cookbook_talk:Table_of_Contents/Archive_6#Copyright_issues]] but it seems inconclusive (while [[Cookbook_talk:Table_of_Contents/Archive_1#Recipes_from_copyright-protected_cookbooks]] suggests an [external site http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=US%20Copyright%20for%20Recipes] for guidance).  Another possible issue, unrelated to copyright, is that the source cookbook is in Amharic, not English (on the other hand I've yet to find an English source that is authoritative).  Any general tips on importing (or not importing) cookbook recipes into Wikibooks?  Thank you, -- [[User:Gyrofrog|Gyrofrog]] ([[User talk:Gyrofrog|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gyrofrog|contribs]]) 18:29, 27 January 2011 (UTC)

== Copyright infringement ==

As far as I can tell, [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_Networks/UDP&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=632328 this edit] (from 2006) infringes copyright of Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 5th Edition, by James F. Kurose and Keith W. Ross, ISBN 0-13-607967-9, pp214-215. (Probably an earlier edition was used, as the 5th edition is copyright 2010.) The book is mentioned as a source but the text, in my opinion, infringes and is in any case not properly attributed. Can anyone advise how to proceed? I know what to do on en.wiki, but not here. Thanks! (PS: courtesy note of any reply on en.wiki, my home wiki, appreciated.)

[[Image:Shimonitanegi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Japanese leek]]
[[Image:Prei_winter_Farinto_geoogst.jpg|thumb|right|200px|winter leek]]

The '''leek''' is a vegetable related to [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]], and [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]. Also in this species are two very different vegetables: The [[Cookbook:Elephant garlic|elephant garlic]] (''A. ampeloprasum var. ampeloprasum'') grown for its bulbs, and [[Cookbook:Kurrat|kurrat]] which is grown for its leaves in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East.

Rather than forming a tight bulb such as the onion, the leek produces a long cylinder of bundled leaf sheaths which are generally blanched by pushing soil around them (trenching). They are generally considered to have a finer flavor than the common onion.

      <comment>Addition of word often, natural selection is only one of the mechanisms postulated to change allele frequency, adding often indicates this</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Key Terms ==

'''Evolution''': Any change in allele frequency in a population, often the result of natural selection. 

'''Natural selection''': differential reproduction of genotypes within a population; one genotype reproduces more successfully than another and donates more copies of itself to the next generation. This means that allele frequencies change within a population. Natural selection is the only mechanism known to produce complex adaptations in nature.

Natural selection can occur in any population that has heritable fitness differences.

'''Fitness''': the ability of an individual to contribute its genes to the next generation. Differences in fitness are central to natural selection. Relative fitness: fitness of an individual compared to others in its species.

'''Hardy–Weinberg principle''' states that both allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant or are in equilibrium from generation to generation unless specific disturbing influences are introduced.

== Natural Selection ==
[[Image:Darwin divergence.jpg|thumb|The tree diagram used to show the divergence of species. It also is the only illustration in the Origin of Species.]]

Both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace proposed natural selection. Wallace went to Darwin for help getting published and the result was that the two presented their papers together.

Natural selection is the result of violation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a state of stability in a population where allele frequencies do not change. A population stays in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium when five assumptions (or prerequisites) are maintained:
* Large population size 
* No differential immigration or emigration of alleles (no gene flow in or out of the population) 
* No mutation
* No natural selection
* Random mating (with respect to genotype), that is, individuals in species do not choose mating partners based on their genotype

Results of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium:
* allele frequencies remain unchanged
* genotype frequencies are in equilibrium
* equilibrium reached in one generation of random mating

Q: What happens when we violate one of the five assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
A: Allele frequencies change.

The Hardy-Weinberg principle is named after English mathematician G. H. Hardy and German physician G. Weinberg, who independently came to similar conclusions in 1908.

Note: In our lab computer simulation lab experiment, we relax the H-W restriction against natural selection, resulting in simulated evolution. When not all phenotype fitnesses are equal, selection occurs, allele frequencies change, and evolution results.

Q: Will a dominant allele take over a recessive allele in frequency?
A: No. The Hardy-Weinberg principal shows that any allele that confers greater fitness will become more frequent in the population than an allele that confers lesser fitness, and disproves the easy assumption that a dominant allele would overtake a population over time. Allele frequency is based on fitness, not whether it is dominant or recessive.

Hardy-Weinberg equation:

&lt;math&gt;(p + q)^2	= p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1.0&lt;/math&gt;


{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! AA
! Aa
! aa
! Total
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;2pq&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q^2&lt;/math&gt; || 1.0
|-
| 1.0 || 1.0 || &lt;math&gt;1.0-s&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;2pq&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q^2(1.0-s)&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;1.0-sq2&lt;/math&gt;
|}
* Allele one: &lt;math&gt;f(A) = p&lt;/math&gt;
* Allele two: &lt;math&gt;f(a) = q&lt;/math&gt;
* Sum of the alleles: &lt;math&gt;p + q = 1.0&lt;/math&gt;
* Reduced fitness: &lt;math&gt;1 - s&lt;/math&gt;

Examples of adaptation due to natural selection
Skin color of the Australian Death adder: brilliant orange skin very unusual in an animal but quite similar to the local soil color. Likely that the snake moved towards this color over time as snakes with brownish and then orange coloring experienced higher survivorship than other-colored snakes. 

Pesticide resistance in insects: Pesticide DDT (developed in ‘30s to combat malaria by knocking out its vector, malaria-carrying mosquitoes) had an initially high kill rate that diminished over time until it became essentially ineffective against insects. Hundreds of similar pesticide resistances have been developed in other insect species.

Antibiotic resistance in bacteria: disease-causing bacteria have followed a similar adaptive path to the insects. This is caused by incorrect use of antibiot-ics for disease treatment. An incomplete application of antibiotics kills most of the disease-carrying microbes in a patient’s body. The most antibiotic-resistant germs have then been selected. These multiply and can become increasingly uncontrollable by further antibiotic treatment. Public health officials fear that this process when repeated over time will create super-germs that will be re-sistant to all drugs. Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease currently following this path of increasing antibiotic resistance. 

There are various mechanisms of acquired chemical resistance:
* Behavioral change
* Increased detection of chemical
* Decreased sensitivity to chemical at target site
* Degradation of the target

Industrial melanism in English pepper moth (Biston betularia). The moth has two naturally occurring morphs, or varieties: typical (light-colored) and carbonized (dark-colored). The more common morph has historically been the typical, but a change in its habitat led to an increase in frequency of the carbonized. (Air pollution killed off light-colored lichen on tree trunks, leaving moths exposed on dark bark instead of lighter lichen. Predatory birds acted as an agent against the more visible morph of the moth, which responded to the natural selection by increasing the frequency of the less visible morph.

Monkeys who kill others’ young: Observed by Sarah Hrdy. Langur monkeys live in social troops with one male presiding over several females and their young. Female young stay within the troop but male young are kicked out to roam the fringes of the troop and try to take over other troops. Incoming male leaders kill suckling young, as well as the babies of females with whom he hasn’t mated.

Q: Why?
A: Because lactating females are in irregular estrus cycle and unavailable to become pregnant. Killing their young frees them up to become pregnant sooner with his babies. The counter adaptation in females: they mate with the new male even if already pregnant, as the new leader will not then not later kill their baby. (Similar situations have since been observed in other species, such as mice).

Selfless turkey problem: 1st generation male descendants of one female turkey set up a brotherhood, a tiny social hierarchy headed by the alpha male. The brotherhood courts females as a group. A female selects one brotherhood for mating, usually a larger one, then mates with the alpha male only.

Q: Did natural selection shape the behavior of these brother turkeys? 
A: No answer given, but an implied “yes”.

Q: Has natural selection tuned all characteristics of every organism? 
A: No. Example: The Indian rhino has 1 horn, and the African rhino has 2 horns. This difference is likely a historical accident, not an adaptation, as two horns don’t seem to give an advantage over one. 

Five constraints on evolution:
* Historical constraints
* Formal constraints
* You-can’t-get-there-from-here constraints
* Time/variation constraints
* Pleiotropic constraints

Historical constraints: “present variation biases future possibilities”. Variation comes on top of past history. 

Formal constraints: Variation can’t defy laws of physics. Ex: pigs don’t fly, and insects are limited in size by their exoskeletons.

You-can’t-get-there-from-here constraints: An advantageous end result must follow many tiny advantageous steps. Ex: There are no live-bearing birds, possibly because the thin eggshell necessary for gas transfer if incubated inside the bird is so disadvantageous for a egg development outside the bird. However, flight feathers evolved from reptilian scales because each tiny change to the scales over time was advantageous, and afterwards allowed the evolution of flight.

Time/variation constraints: new alleles formed thru random mutation, which needs time and is ultimately pushed by mathematic probabilities rather than pulled to a specific end. In limited time, limited results. Ex: Human heart disease the possible result of recent changes in human diet (last 100s of years as opposed to last 100,000s of years of human evolution).

Pleiotropic constraints: (pleiotropy: when one gene has multiple phenotypic expressions) one allele may have several effects, some good &amp; some bad. If the sum of parts is positive, the allele is favored (even if it carries along some unfavorable baggage). Ex: Cystic fibrosis allele may have been advantageous against cholera in pre-industrial Europe.

Mutation: a random process that is the “ultimate” source for natural selection. Little mutation results in advantageous change, and so is very inefficient.

Q: Why does it work at all?
A: Because:
* It has lots of time to work 
* Each individual divides burden as a source of potential mutation; lots of chances for something to go well

Sampling error: the difference between a sample and the actual population. Greater for smaller sample sizes. Unrelated to population size, based on abso-lute size of sample.

Q: What happens when the population size is limited, restricting Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?
A: In small populations, chance events can dramatically change allele frequencies.

Example: “A” and “a” alleles are in equal frequencies in a population:

&lt;math&gt;p=f(A)=.50&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q=f(A)=.50&lt;/math&gt;

In a sample size of four organisms from this population we would expect to find:


{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! AA
! Aa
! aa
|-
| &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;2pq&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;q^2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| .25 || .50 || .25
|-
| 1 || 2 || 1
|}

&lt;math&gt;p\prime=f(A)=.50&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q\prime=f(A)=.50&lt;/math&gt;

However, 30% of the time we would have the following result, with a shift favoring one allele:

&lt;math&gt;p\prime=f(A)=.75&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q\prime=f(A)=.25&lt;/math&gt;

And about 8/1000 of the time (1%):

&lt;math&gt;p\prime=f(A)=.00&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;q\prime=f(A)=1.0&lt;/math&gt;

One allele is completely eliminated! (If the population size is 40, the chances of this are 1/500,000).

In this way, alleles can be eliminated from a real population.

Q: How can small sample sizes occur in real populations?
* Genetic bottleneck: population experiences a crash in numbers (this likely occurred recently in cheetahs, who have very little genetic variation)
* Founder effect: small group of “colonists” forms a new population
* Genetic drift: population lingers in low numbers, as in an endangered species. 

Virtual small population size: a small proportion of individuals in population cover reproductive resposibilites. Usually occurs with males, sometimes females. Ex: Mammals such as seals, where one giant male guards over and mates with harem of many females. This is because the females go to an isolated spot to birth to avoid predators, then go into heat just days after giving birth. A large male fights other males for the privilege of guarding these females and their offspring as “beach master”. The females intermittently go off to feed, coming back to feed their calves. Result in males is that they are much larger than the females; they store lots of body fat so they can stay on the beach a long time (as soon as they leave another male will come take their spot). Effective breeding population for one generation is therefore much smaller than actual number of living members. 

Another example: in wolves, only the alpha male and alpha female breed, and the others just help raise their young. So a wolf population of sixty may have a breeding population of just six.

Immigration / emigration: “gene flow” – individual moves in from a different area &amp; brings new allele frequencies. “A little bit can do a lot”. Ex: interracial marriage. 

Mutation: produces variation in gene pool. Rates are low and work very slowly: just 1/100,000 to 1/1,000,000 mutations occur per locus per gamete per generation. Mutation alone is not enough to drive an allele to a higher frequency. A general rule: any allele with a frequency of 1% or more of the total population was not driven there by mutation. 

Non-random mating: individuals choose mates based on genotype. 
(Positive) assortative mating: choosing a mate with a genotype similar to your own, leading to homozygotic offspring. 
Dissortative mating: choosing for dissimilar genotype, leading to heterozygotes.

Inbreeding: mating with close relatives: a way to mate with your own genotype (and produce homozygotic offspring)

Note: the average human has about thirty lethal recessive allele loci in his total chromatin. Mating with close kin increases the possibility of an offspring with double recessive lethal alleles. Many species have outbreeding behaviors to discourage inbreeding. Ex: langur society: females born in a troop remain in their troop but males are booted out, discouraging brothers mating with sisters. 

Non-random mating can change genotype frequencies but NOT allele frequencies by itself, therefore not responsible for evolution. But it can expose certain alleles to selection by making them homo or heterozygous in the genotype. 

Aging senescence: decline in performance in the general body of an organism with increasing age. This is a selectable trait and is not present in all organisms. Tissue does not “need” to be senescent. Some protists basically “live forever”; fruit flies can be bred for longevity.

Q: Why is this?
A: Gibson does not say why, but suggests that it is a selectively favored trait. After class the professors seem to say that senescence is not necessarily an evolutionarily favored trait as much as a byproduct of the processes that led to higher development. In order to achieve delayed reproduction, more resources were put towards early survivorship at the expense of later survivorship. A related example is the difference between salmon in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Atlantic salmon live through multiple spawning seasons but Pacific salmon have been selected to put all their energy into one, difficult spawning cycle, where they die right after.  

Types of selection:
* Stabilizing selection
* Directional selection
* Disruptive selection

Stabilizing selection: Selection that moves organisms toward the center of their range of possible traits. Ex: human birth weight; especially large and small babies suffer greater infant mortality, favoring babies of intermediate weight. A stabilizing environment results in fossil records that are unchanged for millions of years, such as for the body plans of sharks and horseshoe crabs.

Directional selection: Selection that acts to eliminate an extreme from an array of phenotypes. Ex: Metals such as copper are usually almost lethal to some plants. A strain of copper-resistant grass has developed over many generations of growing in contaminated high-Cu soil.

Disruptive selection: Selection that tends to eliminate intermediate type. Ex: African seedcracker: has two bill sizes, one large and one small, each one best suited for a different kind of locally-abundant seed. Intermediate bill types are unfavored by selection because they are poorly suited for either kind of seed. Here, the homozygote that results in one bill type or the other is favored over the heterozygote, which produces the intermediate bill type.

Consider a population that has the following genotypic frequencies for a given locus having two alleles, “A” and “a”:


{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Genotype
| AA || Aa || aa
|-
! Phenotype frequency
| 77 || 14 || 49
|}

Q: What is the allele frequency for “A”? (i.e., what is p?)
Q: Does the population appear to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium?

Steps to solve: 
# Add everything together to find total
#: 77 + 14 + 49 = 140
# Divide each number by the total
#: 
{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Genotype
| AA || Aa || aa
|-
! &lt;math&gt;n / 140&lt;/math&gt;
| 77 / 140 || 14 / 140 || 49 / 140
|-
! Answer
| .55 || .10 || .35
|}
#: ( Note that: .55 + .10 + .35 = 1.0 )
# Find allele frequencies for “A” and “a”.
#* A: .55 + (.10/2) = .60
#* a: .35 + (.10/2) = .40
#: ( Note again that .60 + .40 = 1.0 )
# Plug these derived genotype frequencies into the equation: 
#* &lt;math&gt;p^2 + 2pq + q^2&lt;/math&gt;
#* &lt;math&gt;(.6)^2 + 2(.4)(.6) + (.4)^2&lt;/math&gt;
#* .36 + .48 + .16
#: ( Again, all total to 1.0 )


{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| AA = .55 || Aa = .10 || aa = .35 ||
|-
AA' = .36
| Aa' = .48 || aa' = .16
|}

We see that the genotype frequencies change from their initial values to their final vales. Therefore the population was not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Q: If the numbers are only somewhat dissimilar how do we tell if they should be considered similar or dissimilar?
A: This is determined with statistical and mathematical analyses beyond the scope of this class.

Tests have been done on breeding many organisms for a certain trait by divid-ing successive generations into groups based on phenotype. Ex: Fruit flies (Drosophila) artificially selected into two groups: one with many abdominal bristles, one with few bristles. We find that neither of the two resulting groups even overlaps the bristle range found in the starting generation. This mimics the results of natural selection on a wild population under certain circumstances. This is similar to the process used for thousands of years by plant and animal breeders. 

Heterozygote advantage: when heterozygote genotype confers greater fitness than a homozygote. A classic example of this is sickle-cell anemia. This human disease occurs when a person is homozygotic for the recessive allele. The recessive allele increases survivorship against malaria in the herozygotic carrier. Natural selection works in high malaria areas to increase the frequency of this allele in humans. The allele frequency is highest in central Africa, where malaria has been a big killer.

| HbN HbS || Single sickle, malaria-resistant

Speciation: 

Q: How do we get a new species? 

Q: What is a species?
A: There are different definitions, but only one that we will go over in depth. 
Biological species concept (BSC): of Ernst Mayer. A species defined as a reproductively isolated population. If two organisms can interbreed, they are one species; if they cannot, they are not of the same species. Not a perfect definition as lions and tigers can interbreed in captivity, and this works only with sexually reproducing organisms (dandelions reproduce asexually). 
Phenotypic definition: species defined by phenotypic gaps in a population.
Cladistic definition: populations or population groups which are members a single clade

Clade: a branch of the evolutionary tree.

Two ways to name a new species:
* Anagenesis: an arbitrary / convenient way to name a new species after it has undergone enough change through a single evolutionary line
* Cladogenesis: the creation of clades

Cladogenesis has three splitting models / hypotheses based on patra, “homeland”
* Allopatric speciation (allos: “other”; aka geographic isolation model, common) Allopatric species: don’t occur together. 
* Sympatric speciation (sym: “together with”; common in plants)
* Parapatric speciation (para: “beside”; uncommon)

Parapatric speciation: perhaps the only example we have of this is found in the copper-resistant mine grass previously discussed. Selection strongly favors the genotype homozygous for the Cu-resistant allele. This has resulted in an adaptation in the pollination time to make it different than the pollination time for the surrounding grasses, avoiding cross-fertilization. Here is speciation without geographic isolation caused by the intense selection.

Sympatric speciation: (is this info right? Book seems to conflict with lecture) a common source of new species in plants but uncommon in animals, this occurs when gametes from two different species cross and create a viable new species. This believed to be the source of ½ of the flowering plants. 
Polyploidization: the most important model of sympatric speciation. Or, the doubling of chromosomes that can lead to sympatric speciation. 
Allopolyploid: polyploidization triggered by an interspecific hybridization event.


{| border=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! Species A
! Species B
! Species AB
|-
| n=3 || n=2 || n=5
|}

The resulting zygote may be unviable or infertile. If viable, it may later develop fertility. This is due to the differences between cell divisions in mitosis and meiosis (and we thought that we had escaped).
In mitosis, chromatids self-replicate. In meiosis, each chromatid has to “find” its homologue. If no homologue is present, the result is viable but infertile. However, with an abnormal mitotic event, cytokinesis (division of the cytoplasm after nuclear division) does not occur, resulting in a cell with double the normal number of chromosomes. If this cell enters meiosis, it can be fertile. (Many examples of this). Ex: Bread wheat is the result of two successive grass hybridization events. Grass went from having 14 &gt; 28 &gt; 42 chromosomes. 

Geographic speciation

Geographic variation: Differences in a species based on geographic location, usually genetically based. Found in humans, where genotypes from one place are different than those from another. More common in less mobile populations as it is opposed by gene flow. Ex: yarrow, a plant which is found to be shorter at higher altitudes. Q: Is this variation due to genes or to environment? A: a “common garden experiment” finds the answer. Seeds of different origins are grown in the same environment. Result is that seeds from higher altitudes grow into shorter yarrow plants, revealing an underlying genetic factor. Ex: common garter snake, Thamnophis surtalis, common throughout the US and Canada, is divided into various local sub species with local colorations. As garter snakes are not highly mobile, the populations can become locally adapted. In mallard ducks this geographic variation does not occur as each generation a male hooks up with a female in the southern “win-tering grounds”, then follows her up to her northern home, which may be very distant from his other home. This results in a genetic shuffle each generation independent of location.

One population can be broken into different, isolated populations for a time, al-lowing two distinct evolutionary pathways. Ex: a glacier advances over North America and splits a population into SW and SE groups. When the barrier is removed (the glacier retreats) the populations can come into contact again, called secondary contact. 
Q: Then what happens?
A: If inbreeding results in fertile offspring, they are still of the same species. If not, they are now new species.
	
Isolating mechanisms: anything that acts to prevent the production of viable zygotes between two organisms. Classified into two groups:
* prezygotic
* post zygotic
The prezygotic mechanisms prevent the fertilization of an egg by the sperm, and hence the production of a zygote, commonly when male courtship is unrecognized by the female. 
Postzygotic isolating mechanisms result in a zygote which 
* isn’t viable (dies), or 
* cannot reproduce.
Ex: A cross between a donkey and a horse produces a mule, which is sterile. 

Geographic separation can result in two quite morphologically different popula-tions that interbreed on secondary contact and are therefore one biological species. Like, they can look all different and stuff but still breed with each other. And sometimes, a seemingly slight difference prevents interbreeding. The point: the “amount” of differences that arise during the isolation of two populations doesn’t necessarily determine whether they will successfully interbreed upon secondary contact and therefore be considered one or two species.

Ex: Eastern and western meadow larks are almost identical in appearance (morphologically similar) but are distinct biological species. This is possibly the result changes which occurred during isolation caused by glacial separation. On secondary contact these two populations apparently did not respond to each other for mating, becoming two biological (reproductive) species. (There are various examples like this one).

Peripheral isolates: a relatively common version of geographic isolation. At the edge of a species range an organism lives at the limit of its survivability. When these areas become separated from each other, allopatric speciation can occur, high rates of selection can push allele frequencies. 

Habitat islands: areas where a habitat favorable to a species is surrounded by an area where the species does not survive. Ex: a volcanic island in an ocean. In this case, founder populations arrive and find ecological vacuums, or different conditions, that influence adaptation. Adaptive radiation, a series of adaptation events, occurs as various species interact and adjust through evolution. Ex: the variation found in Darwin’s finches was caused when a founder population of finches adapted to the unique conditions of each island). Note: even greater variation is found amongst the finches of the Hawaiian Islands. Hawaii is also the home to countless species of Drosophila (fruit flies).

Binomial nomenclature: “two-named naming” (bi: two, nomin: name) originated by Carolus Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) of Sweden. Each species of organism has its own unique two-part name, made up of 
* Genus name, which is capitalized, and denotes a group of species
* Species epithet, not capitalized, describes one species within the genus. (Epithet: “descriptor”, or according to www.m-w.com “a characterizing word or phrase accompanying or occurring in place of the name of a person or thing”.) Note that not all species epithets by themselves are unique to a species; in fact some are reused frequently, such as vulgaris, used in Pinguicula vulgaris and in Sturnus vulgaris, the scientific names for the common butterwort and the European starling (vulgaris: “common”). Species epithets commonly refer to such things as color.

Homo sapiens is the binomial name for the modern human. Homo is a genus of related primates (all but mankind are now extinct) and sapiens is a descrip-tor, “wise”. When typed, this two-part name is customarily italicized, and when handwritten, underlined. 

The naming system is hierarchical, with succeeding levels dividing organisms into more specific taxonomic groups. The broadest division is that of kingdom (or domain, a more basic designation now accepted by many biologists. Here is the full list from most general to most specific. 
(Domain) &gt;&gt; Kingdom &gt;&gt; Phylum &gt;&gt; Class &gt;&gt; Order &gt;&gt; Family &gt;&gt; Genus &gt;&gt; Species. 

There are subdivisions that are sometimes used between these levels (for example, subphylum) but we are not responsible for knowing them.

The higher the level, the greater the difference between groups, reflecting pro-gressively earlier speciation events. 

Q: Why does Linnaus’ naming system neatly fit the evolutionary tree, as he invented it outside an evolutionary context?
A: The organisms are related in a genealogical way with inherently hierarchical relationships. 

Taxon: a given group of organisms at some given rank. Ex: the taxon “Canis”, a group of dogs at level genus, vs. the taxon “canidae”, at level family. (Taxonomy: orderly classification of plants and animals according to their presumed natural relationships.)

Monophyletic taxon: a species set, or grouping of species, made up of
* a common ancestor 
* all its descended species. 
Ex: great apes

Paraphyletic taxon: a grouping of species just like the monophyletic taxon except that it excludes species that have diverged farthest from the common ancestor. Ex: Great apes, minus humans. 

Polyophyletic taxon: grouping of species that excludes the most recent common ancestor. Ex: A grouping of whales and sharks, without their common primitive ancestor (whatever that might be). 

There are two taxonomic schools of thought:
* Traditional (also poorly called “evolutionary”, poorly because the alternate is evolutionarily based as well)
* Cladistic (or phylogenetic, or Hennigian, after founder Wm Hennig)

Both schools agree on how to draw the evolutionary tree, as well as that:
* the best way to group is in monophyletic groups, and
* the worst way to group is in polyphyletic groups.
However they disagree in the treatment of the middle ground, paraphyletic taxonomic groups. 
The traditionalists say: These groups are OK, as they reflect important evolutionary change. The cladists say, paraphyletic groups are NOT OK, as the identification of “important” changes is based on people’s opinions. Cladism prefers greater objectivity. 

Q: How do we estimate evolutionary sequences?
A: Derived homology, or transition from [ a -&gt; a’ ], ex: a species’ loss of a digit thru time. 
Synapomorphy:  
* a “shared derived similarity” 
* derived character state, shared under two or more taxa under consideration
* used to infer common ancestry
Gibson says that synapomorphy gives the only real idea of branching sequence 

symplesiomorphy: 
* a “shared, ancestral similarity” 
* an ancestral character state
* inherited from the common ancestor of the taxa

Evolutionary branching
Q: How can we generate hypotheses about evolutionary branching? (How can we figure out which branching sequence is most likely the historical one?)
A: There are various ways to do this. Generally, we start by considering certain characters, then arrange them into possible trees. 
Characters are found in either a more ancestral or more derived state, and sometimes  the trait can disappear completely or even reappear. When a species goes from having one version of a trait to another version, it is called a trait change.

One way to determine the most likely branching sequences is by creating examples of all the possible sequences. Although this is a simple process, it is not feasible in many cases because the number of possible branching sequences is so great. For example, a group of just 10 species has over 34 million possible evolutionary trees. (Certain methods are used to eliminate many of these options and make the process simpler). The simplest sequence is the one that has the smallest number of trait changes, and is preferred. They are then used as a basis for further refinement that comes with more data. 

Punctuated equilibrium: a hypothesis about the tempo and mode of evolution, presented by Stephen Gould and Niles Eldridge as a challenge to the traditional view known as phyletic gradualism. 


{| border=&quot;2&quot;

|}

Current thought sees evolutionary change as neither of these two extremes but rather somewhere in between, or sometimes more like the one and other times more like the other. 

Evolutionary “novelties”
Q: How can we explain macroevolution? Can the incremental changes of microevolution lead to the big changes of macroevolution, such as flight in birds? What other processes can lead to major changes in species? 

Preaptation (co-opting)
* A structure that serves one function and then is co-opted to serve another function
* Ex: flight feathers from reptilian scales
* Ex: Mammals’ mammary glands from… modified sweat glands?  

Allometric growth
* A change in proportions which comes with increasing size, or different parts grow at different rates
* Selection for one body part may lead to development in another
* Ex: antler size in Irish elk, where huge antlers came as a result of oversize elk (antlers were still in proportion to normal deer antlers)

Paedomorhosis (paidos: child)
* retention of juvenile characteristics in adult, or in extreme, reproduction in larval state
* Ex: gills retained from juvenile aquatic salamanders to normally land-habiting adult, and reproduction at aquatic, juvenile stage
* Adult chimps have greater change in skull shape from infancy than humans experience: chimp and human babies have similar skull shape, which the human more closely maintains to adulthood than the chimp

Isometric growth: all parts grow at the same rate and stay in proportion, as in a growing salamander and in most organisms

Algometric growth: different parts grow at different rates, resulting in changing proportions thru growth cycle, as in human, and in the godwit, a bird whose beak grows exponentially faster than its head does

Analogous structures: two structures that serve a similar function but have different origins. Examples: wings of a butterfly and a bird, leglessness in snakes and in certain lizards, white eggs in various diverse bird species

Antennapedia: mutant fruitfly has small legs on head in place of normal antennae, caused by inappropriate development of cells into homologous part

Bithorax: ancestors to modern insects had two full pairs of wings but today some of these have evolved the second pair into small balancing structures called halteres. (Some extant insects, such as the dragonfly, retain all four wings, one pair on the second and third segments of the thorax). Insects with only two wings are called dipthera, meaning “two wings”. In the bithorax mutant, halteres develop into a second full set of wings.

Homeodomain: series of 60 amino acids (180 nucleotides) which encodes development and has remained similar throughout the evolution of very different organisms, spanning the animals and apparently extending into parts of the plant kingdom as well. Reveals the strong conservation of genes thru evolution.

{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|Basic foodstuffs]] | [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|Meat and poultry]] | '''Bison'''

'''Bison''' is the name of the North American buffalo, ''Bison bison''.  The name is used to differentiate the American buffalo from the Asian Water buffalo and African Cape buffalo. The American buffalo is not a true buffalo, it belongs to the bovine family along with domestic cattle.

Bison differs from [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] by having a deeper red color before cooking because there is no marbling (white flecks of fat within the meat muscle). Bison is said to have a sweeter, richer flavor than beef.  The retail cuts of bison are similar to those of beef.  Bison is much leaner that beef, having a total fat content of about 2 percent, compaired to 15 - 20 percent for beef.

==Handling==

Handle bison meat the same as any other type of meat. Make your selection just before checking out at the register. Put packages of raw bison in disposable plastic bags (if available) to contain any leakage which could cross contaminate cooked foods or produce. Take packaged bison home immediately and refrigerate it at 40 °F; use within 3 to 5 days, or freeze (0 °F). If kept frozen continuously, it will be safe indefinitely.

There are three ways to defrost meat: in the refrigerator, in cold water, and in the microwave. Never defrost on the counter or in other locations. It's best to plan ahead for slow, safe thawing in the refrigerator. To defrost in cold water, do not remove packaging. Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leakproof bag. Submerge the package in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so it continues to thaw.

When microwave defrosting meat, plan to cook it immediately after thawing because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during microwaving. Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed.

Foods defrosted in the microwave or by the cold water method should be cooked before refreezing because they may potentially have been held at temperatures above 40 °F allowing harmful bacteria to grow.

==Preparing Bison==

Since it is very lean and lacks fat marbling, bison can cook faster than other red meats.

* Care should be taken to not overcook bison.
* In general, bison should be cooked using low heat (325 °F) and longer cooking times.
* Braising or other moist cooking methods are recommended for bison roasts and steaks.
* For thin-sliced bison, use quick cooking methods such as broiling and pan frying.
* For safety, cook ground bison meat to 160 °F.
* Roasts, steaks, and chops should be loosely covered with foil and braised for 1 hour; internal temperatures should read 145 °F (medium rare), 160 °F (medium), or 170 °F (well done).
* Less tender cuts should be braised (roasted or simmered with a small amount of liquid in a tightly covered pan) or stewed.

==Bison recipes==
*[[Cookbook:Bison Loaf|Bison Loaf]]
*[[Cookbook:Bison Meatballs Baked in Hoisin Sauce (Marvin)|Marvin (Bison Meatballs Baked in Hoisin Sauce)]]
*[[Cookbook:Bison à la grecque| Bison à la grecque]]
*In addition, cuts of bison can be substituted for the same cut of beef in most recipes, although the cooking temperatures, but not the times, should be reduced.

[[Image:Raw lamb cutlets with shredded ginger and rosemary.jpg|thumb|Lamb cutlets marinated with ginger and rosemary (uncooked)]]
'''Lamb''' is meat from sheep less than 1 year old. Most are brought to market at about 6 to 8 months old.

Lamb is usually tender because it is from animals less than 1 year old. However, look for good marbling (white flecks of fat within the meat muscle), and meat that is fine textured and firm. In color, the meat should be pink and the fat should be firm, white, and not too thick.

==Cuts==

There are five basic major (primal) cuts into which lamb is separated: shoulder, rack, shank/breast, loin, and leg.

The &quot;rack&quot; is the unsplit primal rib (sometimes called the hotel rack) of the carcass which includes ribs 6 through 12. The rack is split to make two primal lamb rib roasts. A &quot;lamb crown roast&quot; is made by sewing two rib roasts together to form a circle or crown.

Chops can come from various primal cuts. &quot;Loin&quot; chops and &quot;rib&quot; chops are the most tender. Less expensive &quot;blade&quot; and &quot;arm&quot; chops (from the shoulder) and &quot;sirloin&quot; chops (from the leg) can be just as tender, but they are not as visually attractive because the meat is separated by bands of connective tissue.

==Fell==

The fell is the thin, paper-like covering on the outer fat. It should not be removed from roasts and legs because it helps these cuts retain their shape and juiciness during cooking. The fell has usually been removed at the market from smaller cuts, such as chops.

==Lamb as red meat==

Oxygen is delivered to muscles by the red cells in the blood. One of the proteins in meat, myoglobin, holds the oxygen in the muscle. The amount of myoglobin in animal muscles determines the color of meat. Lamb is called a &quot;red&quot; meat because it contains more myoglobin than chicken or fish. Other &quot;red&quot; meats are beef, veal, and pork.

==How to Handle Lamb Safely==

===Raw Lamb===

Select lamb just before checking out at the register. Put packages of raw lamb in disposable plastic bags (if available) to contain any leakage which could cross-contaminate cooked foods or produce. Lamb is kept cold during store distribution to retard the growth of bacteria.

Take lamb home immediately and refrigerate it at 40°F for use within 3 to 5 days, or freeze (0 °F). If kept frozen continuously, it will be safe indefinitely.

It is safe to freeze lamb in its original packaging or repackage it. However, for long-term freezing, overwrap the porous store plastic with storage wraps or bags to prevent &quot;freezer burn,&quot; which appears as grayish-brown leathery spots and is caused by air reaching the surface of food. Cut freezer-burned portions away either before or after cooking the lamb. Heavily freezer-burned products may have to be discarded for quality reasons. For best quality, use lamb within 6 to 9 months.

===Ready-Prepared Lamb===

For fully-cooked, take-out lamb dishes such as Kabobs, Gyros, or Chinese food, be sure they are hot at pickup. Use cooked lamb within 2 hours (1 hour if the air temperature is above 90 °F) or refrigerate it at 40 °F or below in shallow, covered containers. Eat within 3 to 4 days, either cold or reheated to 165 °F (hot and steaming). It is safe to freeze ready-prepared lamb dishes. For best quality, use within 2 to 3 months.

===Safe Defrosting===

There are three safe ways to defrost lamb: in the refrigerator, in cold water, and in the microwave. Never defrost on the counter or in other locations. It's best to plan ahead for slow, safe thawing in the refrigerator. Ground lamb, stew meat, and steaks may defrost within a day. Bone-in parts and whole roasts may take 2 days or longer.

Once the raw product defrosts, it will be safe in the refrigerator 3 to 5 days (for roasts and chops) and 1 to 2 days for ground lamb before cooking. During this time, if you decide not to use the lamb, you can safely refreeze it without cooking it first.

To defrost lamb in cold water, do not remove packaging. Be sure the package is airtight or put it into a leakproof bag. Submerge the lamb in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes so that it continues to thaw. Small packages of lamb may defrost in an hour or less; a 3- to 4-pound roast may take 2 to 3 hours.

When microwave defrosting lamb, plan to cook it immediately after thawing because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during microwaving. Holding partially-cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed.

Foods defrosted in the microwave or by the cold water method should be cooked before refreezing because they may potentially have been held at temperatures above 40 °F.

It is safe to cook frozen lamb in the oven, on the stove, or grill without defrosting it first; the cooking time may be about 50% longer. Do not cook frozen lamb in a slow cooker.

Probability is a way of expressing an expectation about the likelihood of an &quot;event&quot; occurring in an &quot;experiment&quot;, based on whatever information is available either about the mechanism which lies behind the experiment (theoretical probability) or knowledge of previous events (experimental probability).

An example of a random experiment and often used in Maths puzzles is the birth of a child, in which the gender of the child cannot be known beforehand and is usually deemed to be 50/50 boy versus girl. In this case, the experiment is the birth, the possible &quot;outcomes&quot; are &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;boy&quot;.  The word &quot;event&quot; usually refers to the particular outcome we consider a &quot;success&quot; (which simply means the type of outcome whose probability we wish to calculate). Often, the &quot;outcomes&quot; are expressed as the result of a SERIES of experiments (&quot;What are the chances of throwing heads twice in two tosses of the same coin&quot;).

== The Measure of Probability ==

The normal measure of probability is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means &quot;impossible&quot; (not quite true, see below), .5 means &quot;as likely as not&quot; and 1 means &quot;certain to happen&quot;.  For example, the probability of tossing a head&quot; is usually taken to be 0.5.  In everyday language, the number is more likely to be expressed as a fraction (1/2 or &quot;one in two&quot;) or a percentage (&quot;50% chance&quot;).  When throwing a die, the probability of getting a 1 is 1/6 (i.e. we expect that in a large number of throws, the frequency of &quot;1s&quot; will be close to 1/6 of the number of throws).

== Two kinds of Probability ==

*Theoretical Probability - Based on a knowledge of the mechanism behind the event.  It is simplest to calculate when there are a finite number of possible outcomes, all believed to be equally likely.  The probability of an event is simply the number of outcomes which would match our &quot;event&quot;, divided by the total number of possible outcomes. On a die, there are 6 possible (and equally-likely) outcomes for each roll, but only one of these outcomes results in a 1.  Therefore we calculate the probability of rolling a 1 as 1/6.  This is the most common type of probability used in math classes.  The usual mistake made in calculating probability this way is not checking carefully whether you are counting &quot;equally likely&quot; outcomes.  (To be silly, one might say &quot;there are two possible outcomes ; 1 or not 1, therefore the chance of rolling a 1 is 1/2&quot;).  The more common reason for falsely believing asset of outcomes to be equally likely is either that the dice or coin is &quot;loaded&quot; or that you have missed a possible outcome, or confused two separate outcomes as a single one.  For instance, if the coin is thick enough, the possibility  that the coin can land stably on its edge should not be ignored.  When tossing TWO coins, many people think there are three equally likely outcomes (two heads, two tails, one of each) and that therefore the chance of getting &quot;one of each&quot; is 1/3: but actually there are two different ways of getting a head and a tail, so the chance of getting &quot;one of each&quot; is actually 2/4 = 50%.    If you are sure that you have calculated the probability correctly then you can ascribe a single number to the probability of the event, but the only way to be sure that you have not missed a possibility, or done the sums wrong, is to go ahead and try it lots of time and see what happens.  But you are then into &quot;Experimental Probability&quot;.

*Experimental Probability - Based on experience.  This is less prone to mistakes (provided the experimental conditions are fair) and easy to calculate the result (number of successful trials divided by total number of trials). The larger the number of times that you perform the test, the closer you will come to the theoretical probability (provided that you calculated the theoretical probability correctly!), but the greater the chance that the result will not be EXACTLY the same.

In Maths classes, the first type of probability is more common, in science, the second.

== Meaning of Probability ==

===Repeated Events===
Where an event can be repeated in the same way as often as desired, then not only is it clear what the calculated probability means (&quot;I expect that if I toss this coin 500 times, I will see about 250 heads&quot;), but also it will be possible to check whether the estimate was correct (toss the coin and see how many times you get a head).

==One-offs==
Where a trial (or event) is a one-off (neither this trial, nor a very similar one can be done again) then not only must the calculation be a theoretical one, but also it is less clear what the calculated figure MEANS.  &quot;There is a 50% chance of the Earth being destroyed by collision with a comet during this year&quot;.  Either the Earth will or will not be destroyed, neither outcome will show you whether your calculated probability was correct.  Actually, you CAN run the trial as many times as you like (treat each year as one trial), but there will be a maximum of ONE &quot;successful&quot; outcome, so it is not easy to see what light 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 destruction-free years sheds on your calculation.  If, however, you have the opportunity to gamble on many different one-off events, and experience gives you good reason to trust your probability estimates, then probability does have some meaning: you would be wise in future wagers to bet on events to which you ascribe high probability and better to avoid improbable ones (except at very favorable odds).  This is actually similar to horse-racing - you are encouraged to believe you can calculate the odds of a horse winning, but most races are really one-offs run in very different circumstances to all the other races. If you only bet on one race in your life, then you are unlikely to back a real outsider at whatever odds - but if you spend a lot of time at racecourses, you may probably back quite a lot of outsiders, but only in the cases where you believe that the high odds against them are more generous then necessary - expecting (perhaps unwisely, since it is the bookies, not you, who set the odds) that the few that win will pay enough to outweigh your many small losses on the ones that did not. 

== Outcomes and sample spaces==

When doing experiments, the answer is not known prior to the actual experiment. However, we should know what we ''can'' get. The possible results of an experiment are called outcomes. A certain group of outcomes is called a sample space.

When you throw a die, you can get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 eyes. These are the possible outcomes in a throw. the sample space is U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
When we're looking at whether a birth results in boy(B) or girl(G), the sample space is U = {B, G}

== Model of probability ==

A model of probability gives the probability of every outcome a number between 1 and 0. The sum of the probability of all possible outcomes is 1 (if you cannot make them add up to 1, then you have missed or double-counted some possibilities).

Let's for instance take a die-throw as an example. The model of probability for that would be:

P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = P(4) = P(5) = P(6) = 1/6

However, when we're looking at whether a birth results in a boy or a girl, the model of probability results in:

P(B) = 0.514 and P(G) = 0.486

In the first example, all the outcomes have the same probability - the model is uniform.
In the second example, the outcomes have different probabilities - the model is ''not'' uniform.

'''Turkey''' is a large, widely domesticated North American bird with white plumage and a bare, wattled head and neck. The name turkey was originally applied to an African bird now known as the guinea fowl, which was believed to have originated in Turkey. When the Europeans came upon the American turkey, they thought it was the same bird as the African guinea fowl, and so gave it the name turkey, although the two species are quite distinct. Turkeys are traditionally eaten at Christmas in Britain, and Thanksgiving in the United States.

Raw turkey skin color is off white to cream-colored. Under the skin the color ranges from a pink to a lavender blue depending on the amount of fat just under the skin.

When the turkey has reached an internal temperature of 165 °F (82 °C) as measured in the thigh away from any bone by an appropriate meat thermometer (any juices should be clear), it should be safe to eat. When there is a pink color in safely cooked turkey, it is due to the myoglobin in tissues which can form a heat-stable color. This can also happen when [[Cookbook:Smoking|smoking]], grilling or oven cooking a turkey. 
{{wikipedia|Turkey meat}}
==How to buy a turkey==
Fresh turkeys are considered the best but are very expensive compared with frozen. Often, during holiday seasons, a fresh turkey needs to be ordered in advance from a butcher or meat counter at a supermarket. Frozen turkeys can be bought well ahead of time from a supermarket. If a turkey is frozen it '''must''' be properly defrosted inside a refrigerator or cooler before cooking.

===What size bird?===
There are a number of factors that are generally taken into account when choosing a size. The most important being the number of guests, with about 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] per person normally being plenty. Other things worth considering are:
*The bigger the bird, the greater the meat to bone ratio. Small birds tend to be very bony, with little meat. If there are only a few guests consider using a large [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] instead.
*For frozen turkeys, the bigger the bird the longer it takes to defrost. As defrosting takes several days, there is little point in buying a huge frozen turkey the day before preparation.
*Some domestic ovens can be too small for a large bird.

===Defrosting safely===
Even though a frozen turkey is a veritable meat glacier, it is still quite possible it may be warm enough for bacteria to grow on its surface and meat yet still have a frozen center. A turkey with a frozen center will not cook properly thereby increasing the risk of food poisoning. For this reason, it is essential to thoroughly defrost the turkey correctly.

====The best method====
The bird should be placed in a tray in the bottom of a refrigerator, and left for at least 5 hours per pound. A typical turkey will take around three days to defrost. Some home cooks report that 5 hours per pound is far too optimistic for a large turkey. (this is because the surface area, through which heat is gained, increases with the square of the length while the volume of meat increases with the cube of the length)

====A quick method====
In the event that a turkey is purchased at the last minute and needs to be defrosted relatively quickly, as this will still take several hours, the bird can be unwrapped, and placed in a bowl of cool, lightly running water. On no account should warm water be used. It is dangerous and will encourage bacteria to grow on the skin of the turkey.

==Safe cooking==
When cooking a whole turkey, use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature in the innermost part of the thigh without touching bone. The internal temperature should reach a minimum of 165 °F. For optimum safety and uniform doneness, it is recommended to cook stuffing outside the bird. If stuffing the bird, the center of the stuffing must reach 165 °F (74 °C). Turkey breast should reach 165 °F (77 °C). Drumsticks, thighs and wings should be cooked until they reach an internal temperature of 165 °F . However, uniform temperature is difficult to obtain due to location and thickness of the meat.  There are many techniques, good and bad, which will create a safe, moist, and delicious bird throughout.

Consult the following information for safe turkey cooking directions.

===Roasting a turkey===
There are many of recipes for stuffing: [[Cookbook:Chestnut|chestnut]], [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]] and [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (flavored bread), and [[Cookbook:Sausage|sausage]] are the most traditional. It is the conventional &quot;wisdom&quot; of the modern day that the body cavity should not be stuffed, as it will prolong cooking time a great deal and &quot;dry out the bird&quot;. 

Contrary to this opinion, it is possible to stuff a turkey without prolonging cooking time or drying out the bird. The stuffing must be fully cooked, piping hot (In addition to increasing cooking time, uncooked stuffing--especially sausage--presents a health risk.), and quite moist. Likewise, one must not pack the bird's cavity tight with stuffing.  Instead, it should be loosely spooned in. One can stuff both the &quot;main cavity&quot; of the bird and the volume between the skin and the breast to some extent, although the latter will impart stuffing flavor to the breast meat, and some diners may object.

Making a separate dish of the stuffing is of course easier, both for cooking and at the table, and avoids getting turkey innards mixed into the stuffing.

Another preparation method is to [[Cookbook:Brining|brine]] or [[Cookbook:Marinating|marinate]] the turkey overnight.  Brining with a low to moderate amount of salt in enough water can result in just the right amount of water entering the meat.  Too little salt can result in the meat being too watery while too much salt can actually dehydrate the meat.

Some people like to place herbs with or without an onion or an [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] in the body cavity to provide flavor.

Turkeys have a large breast which can become dry if overcooked.  There are several ways to prevent this, though consider that some guests may enjoy the chewiness.

One method is to make a 'tent' out of aluminum foil. The breast should be covered in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or a cooking [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] ([[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] will work) and the bird should be completely wrapped in the foil that is sealed loosely at the top to include an air space. This allows the bird to very mildly brown while steaming in its own juices. Alternatively, one can cook the bird at a high temperature for a short time (30 minutes) and then only cover the breast and body with foil, leaving the dark meat uncovered, reduce heat, and continue roasting.  It is 'strongly' recommended that the cook pre-fit the foil &quot;breastplate&quot; and have it set aside for use 'before' starting the roasting, as this is far less likely to result in singed fingers.  Some people like to lay streaky [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] over the breast--a practice known as ''larding''--to keep it moist and add flavor.

For single-temperature roasting, the oven should be set to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|medium (gas mark 4 180°C/350°F)]]. The cooking time depends on the size of the bird. Approximate times are given in the table below.
{| align=&quot;right&quot; border=1
!Weight of Turkey
!Approximate cooking time
|-
|10-12 lb (4.5-5.5 kg)
|3 hours
|-
|12-14 lb (5.5-6.5 kg)
|3 hours and 30 mins
|-
|14-16 lb (6.5-7.5 kg)
|4 hours
|-
|16-18 lb (7.5-8 kg)
|4 hours and 15 mins
|-
|18-20 lb (8-9 kg)
|4 hours and 30 mins
|-
|20-22 lb (9-10 kg)
|4 hours and 45 mins
|-
|22-24 lb (10-11 kg)
|5 hours
|}

The times given are only approximate. The best way to tell if a turkey is cooked is to test it. 

*'''To test with a skewer''': Insert a skewer or a long thin knife into the part of the turkey where the thigh joins the body. If the turkey is cooked, the juices will run clear. If there is any blood in the juices, the turkey is not yet thoroughly cooked.

*'''To test with a thermometer''': Insert a turkey thermometer into the thigh. The turkey is not cooked until the thigh has reached a temperature of 185°F.  Alternatively, a remote probe thermometer can be inserted into the bird before it goes into the oven, permitting constant monitoring of temperature without opening the oven door.

Double-temperature cooking (pre-browning) starts at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400 °F]] for 30 minutes, followed by putting on the foil &quot;breastplate&quot; and finishing roasting at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|300 °F]].  This method requires thermometer testing for doneness.

*&quot;&quot;The Brown bag (grocery bag) Roasting&quot;&quot; (noted below) has been a popular method of cooking meats in the past but due to the changes in the current methods of making grocery bags, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, the glue and ink on brown bags are not intended for use as cooking materials and may give off harmful fumes. In addition, brown bags are usually made from recycled materials nowadays and are not sanitary. Thankfully there are alternate cooking materials that give comparative results sold at your local grocery, such as aluminum cooking foil, and turkey sized oven-cooking bags at a reasonable cost. Do remember when using the aluminum foil and oven-cooking bag methods there is no need to grease the areas not coming in direct contact to the turkey.

&quot;Brown Bag (grocery bag) Roasting&quot; is a fool-proof method for perfectly roasting a moist, golden-brown turkey (any size; stuffed or unstuffed) in about 3 to 3.5 hours.  Simply place the completely thawed and rinsed bird (you may season and/or stuff the bird as you desire, or leave unseasoned and unstuffed) into a thoroughly greased paper bag, like those from the grocery.  To prepare the bag, rub grease, or [[Crisco]], to completely coat the inside of a heavy brown paper bag evenly, but not heavily, until it saturates through to the outside of the bag.  Then, touch up the outside of the bag where the grease had not made its way.  This prevents the bag from burning and creates a sealed, steamy environment.  ''NOTE: Leave no part of the paper bag ungreased as it may catch fire''.  Seal the opening of the bag by folding it over and staple it shut along the entire length of the fold.  Place the bagged turkey into the bottom half of a roasting pan and into a pre-heated oven.  Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|500 °F]] for the first hour, then reduce the oven's temperature to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|400 °F]] for the second hour, then down to [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|300 °F]] for the final hour.  Thermometer test the bird after the third hour for doneness.

(If appropriate to add a personal note here, I have used the paper bag method for decades and, no matter to whom it has been served, has been deemed &quot;the best&quot; or &quot;the most moist&quot; oven-roasted turkey the consumer ever had.  Thanksgiving 2005's 23 lb. turkey was baked in a gas oven (unseasoned and unstuffed) in 3 hours to a moist, golden-brown perfection.  Final temperature 190ºF.)

===Deep-frying a turkey===

[[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|Deep-fried]] turkey originated in the [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|American South]] as an alternative to the traditional method of preparing a Thanksgiving turkey. The bird is submerged into [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|375°F]] oil (often [[Cookbook:Peanut Oil|peanut oil]]) for 30 to 45 minutes (depending on the weight of the bird). Some fans of this method claim it results in a juicier turkey and leftovers are juicier than those from a roasted turkey.

==How to carve a turkey==
A turkey, like all meat, should not be carved as soon as it is cooked, but should be left for about 1/2 an hour to an hour to rest. Covering the bird while resting will keep it warmer and will result in less drying out. This improves the texture, and allows the turkey to be handled without burning the fingers.

There are two methods of carving the breast.
*Slide a ''sharp'' knife down one side of the breastbone and remove half the breast in one swoop. Carve this boneless slab of meat crosswise in thick slices.
*To carve the breast at the table, hold the turkey with a carving fork and slice parallel to the breast bone. This method is easier if you remove the wishbone before cooking the bird. That way the knife can cut through the meat and the stuffing giving a very large slice of turkey and stuffing.

==Serving suggestions==
For Christmas in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]], turkey is traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Cranberry Jelly|cranberry jelly]], [[Cookbook:Bread Sauce|bread sauce]] and winter vegetables including roast [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|brussels sprouts]], and [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnips]]. Sometimes sausagemeat that has been wrapped in [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]] is also served. A bread-based stuffing flavoured with herbs and onion is a common accompaniment. Gravy made from a stock of enriched stewed giblets or turkey offal and seasoned juices released by the carcass during cooking, thickened with flour, forms a side serving.  

For Thanksgiving in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], turkey is traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|cranberry sauce]] and [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]]. Other items vary, but common complimentary dishes include [[Cookbook:Mashed Potatoes|mashed potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuits]], dinner rolls, [[Cookbook:Black Olive|black olives]], various vegetables such as [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]], [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]], [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potatoes]], and various types of [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]] for [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] (such as [[Cookbook:Pumpkin Pie|pumpkin]], [[Cookbook:Apple Pie|apple]] and [[Cookbook:Pecan Pie|pecan]]).

How many lbs turkey per head approx?
are there different varieties? giblets in or out? organic/ fed on different things?

I dunno - i'm just thinking what we need to add to make a fabulous xmas article ;) [[User:Secretlondon|Secretlondon]]

I'm working on it. I'll dig out some mrs beaton when i get home from work. we could also do with some good stuffing recipes if anyone knows any. [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 16:27, 19 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:I agree that we need some stuffing recipes, though I think they should go in the woefully short [[stuffing]] article instead of here. - [[User:Jredmond|Jim Redmond]] 16:56, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)
----
The prep section is a bit awkward, and it doesn't include my favorite method ([[brining]]).  I plan to work on it a bit tonight, after I submerge my turkey in a tub of cold salt water.  :) - [[User:Jredmond|Jim Redmond]] 16:56, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Whilst researching this article I came across brining, but didn't include it as I had no personal experience. I look forwards to your edit, as I am thinking of brining my turkey this christmas. BTW does the bird taste salty ? [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 22:56, 26 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Actually, if you make the brine correctly, the bird will be juicier and its own flavors will be enhanced.  If you overdo the amount of salt in the brine, though, then the turkey will be salty.  I can post a recipe in the [[brining]] article if it'll help. - [[User:Jredmond|Jim Redmond]] 20:57, 1 Dec 2003 (UTC)
::Please do [[User:Theresa knott|theresa knott]] 09:10, 2 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:::I have come across the brining section of the article and think that it is not scientifically correct.  A salt solution is usually hypertonic to the cells of an animal and will *dehydrate* them readily.  However a salt solution can be made that is less concentrated than the cytoplasm and in that case water *will* enter cells.  This offers a way for the cook to control the *amount* of water entering the meat by controlling the concentration of salt in the brine.  Soaking a turkey in pure water will result in too much water in the meat and soaking a turkey in a brine too salty will actually dehydrate the meat.  Soaking a turkey in a brine with just the right concentration of salt will cause the optimal amount of water to enter the meat.  10 Oct 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book will cover the major components of all the courses.  It should not be based around any specific board and it is hoped that it will become a resource for  those studying ICT at any level.  It looks at visible applications of computers in the world around us and covers the topics in context.  Anyone of these case studies should be looked at as a resource to help you produce coursework.  

You might like to:
*pick up on a case study which hasn't been started yet;
*add something to an existing one;
*add a new one.

If you found something difficult to understand please alter it to help those who follow you or contact some one who can!

This resource will also need a content mapping / index - so that it is possible for teachers and pupils to find example of particular usage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Schools use ICT for:

==Administration==
Schools have to keep information about all the pupils and staff.  The [http://www.schooltool.org/spec.html Schooltool] project is developing an open source solution for this problem and has a detailed analysis of what is needed in all sorts of schools.
Proprietary solutions include CCM's product [http://www.ccmsoftware.com/schools.htm CMIS] and Capita's [http://sims.capitaes.co.uk/products/s_net_p.asp SIMS].
Schools need to store information on:
*Individual Pupils:
**Name 
**Name and Addresses of parent(s) and/or guardian(s)
**Subjects that a pupil is doing
**Past Examination Results
**Photographs
**Attendance records
*Groups of Pupils:
**Teaching Groups
**Pastoral Groups
**Clubs, Societies, Teams, etc.
**Previous pupils of the school
*Teachers
**Names and addresses
**Groups they teach
**Salary information

==A subject and a teaching tool==

Schools also teach ICT and/or computing as a subject and often have [[en:w:networks|networks]] for pupils to store their work on and to access eductional resources.  The types of applications that the pupils will use will include:
*Standard Office Tools
**Word Processors
**Spreadsheets
**Presentation Graphics
**Database Management Systems
*Specific Teaching Tools
**Circuit Simulators
**Mathematical models of specific systems (e.g. prey/predator relationships)
**Drill programs
*Information Resources
These would include both specific and general resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Banks have been heavy users of ICT for a long time.  From the introduction of MICR [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MICR] in the 1950's through to the current push for 'Chip and PIN'.

The reason for this enthusiasm for new technology is to keep costs down.  A simple estimate of the number of transactions that occur daily in the UK will explain why automation is essential!

How many people have bank accounts? - estimate 1/3 of the population...
some 20 million people.

How often do they use their accounts? 
this is a for bill payments, holes in the wall transactions, debit cards, etc.
- estimate every other day...
so 10 million transactions per day.

How long does it take to handle a transaction? guess 30 seconds of human work...
so 5 million minutes of work per day.

How many transactions could a worker handle in a day? based on an 8 hour day...
8 hours = 480 minutes (roughly 500 minutes...)

So how many workers would be needed to keep up with these transactions?

&lt;math&gt;Workers \ Needed = \frac {Minutes \ work \ needed} {Minutes \ in \ a \ working \ day}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Workers \ Needed = \frac {5,000,000} {500} = \frac {50,000} {5} = 10,000 &lt;/math&gt;

So around an additional 10,000 workers would be required - and these figures are underestimates.

: Information and Communication Technology. Currently, Edexcel requires students to do one databases coursework and one spreadsheets coursework, and two more from a bunch of other choices (word document, free choice (can be picked twice), data logging and control...). As you can see, it has no Computer Science and, I hate to say this, the qualification is almost useless.

'''Measurement''' is the determination of the size or magnitude of something. Measurement is not limited to physical quantities, but can extend to quantifying almost any imaginable thing such as degree of uncertainty, Index of Consumer Confidence|consumer confidence, or the rate of increase in the fall in the price of beanie baby|beanie babies.

* &quot;A measurement is a comparison to a standard.&quot; -- William Shockley 

In physics and engineering, '''measurement''' is the process of comparing physical quantity|physical quantities of real-world object (philosophy)|objects and event|events.  Established standard objects and events are used as unit|units, and the measurement results in at least two numbers for the relationship between the item under study and the referenced unit of measurement, where at least one number estimates the ''statistics|statistical uncertainty'' in the measurement, also referred to as ''measurement error'' (in a philosophical distinction). Measuring instruments are the means by which this translation is made.

'''Metrology''' is the study of measurement.

A metric is a standard for measurement. The quantification of phenomena through the process of measurement relies on the existence of an explicit or implicit metric, which is the standard to which the measure is referenced. If I say I am '5', I am indicating a measurement without conveying an applicable standard. I may mean I am 5 years old, 5 feet high, or 5-time world raquetball champion.

Measuring physical quantities accurately is important in science, engineering and commerce. 

For example, the unit for length might be a well-known person's foot, and the length of a boat can be given as the number of times that person's foot would fit the length of the boat.

Laws to regulate measurement were originally developed to prevent fraud. However, units of measurement are now generally defined on a scientific basis, and are established by international treaties. 

The history of measurements is a topic within the History of Science and Technology. The meter was standardized as the unit for length after the French revolution, and has since been adopted throughout most of the world. The United States and the UK are in the process of converting to the SI system.  This process is known as metrication.

Systems of measurement:
* Imperial units
* SI system, also known as the metric system
* Chinese units

Measuring the ratios between physical quantities is an important sub-field of physics. 

Some important physical quantities include:
* the speed of light
* the fine-structure constant
* the charge of an electron

this was followed by the English chemist John Alexander Reina Newlands, who in 1865 noticed that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octave|octaves of music, though his ''law of octaves'' was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869, the German Lothar Meyer and the Russian chemist Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleev  almost simultaneously developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbours in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence bob the bulderproperties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th century|19th and early 20th century.

Lists of the elements List of elements by name|by name, List of elements by symbol|by symbol, and List of elements by number|by atomic number are available. 
The following figure shows the currently known periodic table of the elements. 
Each element is listed by its atomic number and chemical symbol. 
Elements in the same column (&quot;periodic table group|group&quot;) are chemically similar.

The number of electron shell|electron shells an atom has determines what period it belongs to.  Each shell is divided into different subshells, 
which as atomic number increases are filled in roughly this order:

 1s
 2s           2p
 3s           3p
 4s        3d 4p
 5s        4d 5p
 6s     4f 5d 6p
 7s     5f 6d 7p
 8s  5g 6f 7d 8p
 ...

Hence the structure of the table.  Since the outermost electrons determine chemical properties, those tend to be similar within groups. Elements adjacent to one another within a group have similar physical properties, despite their significant differences in mass. Elements adjacent to one another within a period have similar mass but different properties.

For example, very near to nitrogen (N) in the second period of the chart are carbon (C) and oxygen (O).  
Despite their similarities in mass (they differ by only a few atomic mass units), they have extremely different properties, as can be seen by looking at their allotrope|allotropes:  diatomic oxygen is a gas that supports burning, diatomic nitrogen is a gas that does not support burning, and carbon is a solid which can be burnt (yes, diamond|diamonds can be burnt!).

In contrast, very near to chlorine (Cl) in the next-to-last group in the chart (the halogen|halogens) are fluorine (F) and bromine (Br).
Despite their dramatic differences in mass within the group, their allotropes have very similar properties:  
They are all highly corrosion|corrosive (meaning they combine readily with metal|metals to form metal halide salt|salts); chlorine and fluorine are gases, while bromine is a very low-boiling liquid; chlorine and bromine at least are highly colored.

A '''chemical formul

'''''''''''
'' is a concise way of expressing information about the atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound.  It identifies each type of chemical element|element by its chemical symbol and identifies the number of atoms of such element to be found in each discrete molecule of that compound. The number of atoms (if greater than one) is indicated as a subscript.  

For example methane, a simple molecule consisting of one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms has the chemical formula:

: CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; 
and glucose with six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms has the chemical formula:
: C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. 

A chemical formula may also supply information about the types and spatial arrangement of bonds in the chemical, though it does not necessarily specify the exact isomer.  For example ethane consists of two carbon atoms single-bonded to each other, each having three hydrogen atoms bonded to it. Its chemical formula can be rendered as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. If there were a double bond between the carbon atoms (and thus each carbon only had two hydrogens), the chemical formula may be written: CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the fact that there is a double bond between the carbons is assumed. However, a more explicit and correct method is to write H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C:CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The two dots or lines indicate that a double bond connects the atoms on either side of them.  

A triple bond may be expressed with three dots or lines, and if there may be ambiguity, a single dot or line may be used to indicate a single bond.

Molecules with multiple functional groups that are the same may be expressed in the following way: (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH. However. this implies a different structure from other molecules that can be formed using the same atoms (isomers). The formula (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH implies a chain of three carbon atoms, with the middle carbon atom bonded to another carbon:&lt;br&gt;
C-C-C&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;C&lt;br&gt;
and the remaining bonds on the carbons all leading to hydrogen atoms. However, the same number of atoms (10 hydrogens and 4 carbons, or C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) may be used to make a straight chain: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

The alkene 2-butene has two isomers which the chemical formula  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; does not identify.  The relative position of the two methyl groups must be indicated by additional notation denoting whether the methyl groups are on the same side of the double bond (''cis'' or ''Z'') or on the opposite size from each other (''trans'' or ''E'').

==Polymers==

For polymers, parentheses are placed around the repeating unit. For example, a hydrocarbon molecule that is described as: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a molecule with 50 repeating units. If the number of repeating units is unknown or variable, the letter ''n'' may be used to indicate this: CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For ions, the charge on a particular atom may be denoted with a right-hand superscript. For example Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, or Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The total charge on a molecule may also be shown in this way. For example H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Isotopes==

Although isotopes are more relevant to nuclear chemistry than to conventional chemistry, different isotopes may also be indicated as a left-hand superscript in a chemical formula. For example, the radioactive phosphate ion is &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

----
In the [[w:physical science|physical science]]s, a '''phase''' is a [[w:set|set]] of states of a macroscopic physical system that have relatively uniform chemical composition and physical properties (i.e. [[w:density|density]], [[w:crystal structure|crystal structure]], [[w:index of refraction|index of refraction]], and so forth.) The most familiar examples of phases are [[w:solid|solid]]s, [[w:liquid|liquid]]s, and [[w:gas|gas]]es. Less familiar phases include [[w:plasma|plasma]]s, [[w:Bose-Einstein condensate|Bose-Einstein condensate]]s and [[w:fermionic condensate|fermionic condensate]]s and the [[w:paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] and [[w:ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] phases of [[w:magnet|magnet]]ic materials.

Phases are sometimes called '''states of matter''', but this term can lead to confusion with [[w:thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] states. For example, two gases maintained at different pressures are in different thermodynamic states, but the same &quot;state of matter&quot;.

== Definitions ==

Although phases are conceptually simple, they are hard to define precisely. A good definition of a phase of a system is a region in the [[w:parameter space|parameter space]] of the system's thermodynamic variables in which the [[w:free energy|free energy]] is [[w:analytic function|analytic]]. Equivalently, two states of a system are in the same phase if they can be transformed into each other without abrupt changes in any of their thermodynamic properties.

All the thermodynamic properties of a system -- the [[w:entropy|entropy]], [[w:heat capacity|heat capacity]], [[w:magnetization|magnetization]], [[w:compressibility|compressibility]], and so forth -- may be expressed in terms of the free energy and its [[w:derivative|derivative]]s. For example, the [[w:entropy|entropy]] is simply the first derivative of the free energy with [[w:temperature|temperature]]. As long as the free energy remains analytic, all the thermodynamic properties will be well-behaved.

When a system goes from one phase to another, there will generally be a stage where the free energy is non-analytic. This is known as a '''[[w:phase transition|phase transition]]'''. Familiar examples of phase transitions are melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), boiling (liquid to gas), and condensation (gas to liquid). Due to this non-analyticity, the free energies on either side of the transition are two different functions, so one or more thermodynamic properties will behave very differently after the transition. The property most commonly examined in this context is the [[w:heat capacity|heat capacity]]. During a transition, the heat capacity may become infinite, jump abruptly to a different value, or exhibit a &quot;kink&quot; or discontinuity in its derivative.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Heat-capacity-transition.png]]&lt;br&gt;
''Possible graphs of heat capacity (C) against temperature (T) at a phase transition.''
&lt;/center&gt;

In practice, each type of phase is distinguished by a handful of relevant thermodynamic properties. For example, the distinguishing feature of a solid is its rigidity; unlike a liquid or a gas, a solid does not easily change its shape. Liquids are distinct from gases because they have much lower [[w:compressibility|compressibility]]: a gas placed in a large container expands to fill the container, whereas a liquid forms a puddle in the bottom of the container. Not all the properties of solids, liquids, and gases are distinct; for example, it is not useful to compare their magnetic properties. On the other hand, the ferromagnetic phase of a magnetic material is distinguished from the paramagnetic phase by the presence of bulk magnetization without an applied magnetic field.

== Emergence and universality ==

Phases are [[w:emergence|emergent]] phenomena produced by the self-organization of a macroscopic number of particles. Typical samples of matter, for example, contain around 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles ([[w:Avogadro's number|Avogadro's number]]). In systems that are too small -- even, say, a thousand atoms -- the distinction between phases disappears, since the appearance of non-analyticity in the free energy requires a huge, formally infinite, number of particles to be present.

One might ask why real systems exhibit phases, since they are not actually infinite. The reason is that real systems contain thermodynamic fluctuations. When a system is far from a phase transition, these fluctuations are unimportant, but as it approaches a phase transition, the fluctuations begin to grow in size (i.e. spatial extent). At the ideal transition point, their size would be infinite, but before that can happen the fluctuations will have become as large as the system itself. In this regime, &quot;finite-size&quot; effects come into play, and we are unable to accurately predict the behavior of the system. Thus, phases in a real system are only well-defined away from phase transitions, and how far away it needs to be is dependent on the size of the system.

There is a corollary to the emergent nature of phase phenomena, known as the principle of '''universality'''. The properties of phases are largely independent of the underlying microscopic physics, so that the same types of phases arise in a wide variety of systems. This is a familiar fact of life. We know, for example, that the property that defines a solid -- resistance to deformation -- is exhibited by materials as diverse as [[w:iron|iron]], [[w:ice|ice]], and [[w:Silly Putty|Silly Putty]]. The only differences are matters of scale. Iron may resist deformation more strongly than Silly Putty, but both maintain their shape if the applied forces are not too strong.

== Phase diagrams ==

The different phases of a system may be represented using a '''phase diagram'''. The axes of the diagrams are the relevant thermodynamic variables. For simple mechanical systems, we generally use the [[w:pressure|pressure]] and [[w:temperature|temperature]]. The following figure shows a phase diagram for a typical material exhibiting solid, liquid and gaseous phases.

&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:phase-diag.png|A typical phase diagram]]&lt;br&gt;
''A typical phase diagram.''
&lt;/center&gt;

The markings on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy is non-analytic. The open spaces, where the free energy is analytic, correspond to the phases. The phases are separated by lines of non-analyticity, where phase transitions occur, which are called '''phase boundaries'''.

In the above diagram, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the [[w:critical point|critical point]]. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable. In water, the critical point occurs at around 647&amp;nbsp;[[w:Kelvin|K]] (374&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C or 705&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F) and 22.064&amp;nbsp;[[w:Pascal|MPa]].

The existence of the liquid-gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in our above definitions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, phases can sometimes blend continuously into each other. We should note, however, that this does not always happen. For example, it is impossible for the solid-liquid phase boundary to end in a critical point in the same way as the liquid-gas boundary, because the solid and liquid phases have different [[w:symmetry (physics)|symmetry]].

An interesting thing to note is that the solid-liquid phase boundary in the phase diagram of most substances, such as the one shown above, has a positive slope. This is due to the solid phase having a higher density than the liquid, so that increasing the pressure increases the melting temperature. However, in the phase diagram for [[w:water|water]] the solid-liquid phase boundary has a negative slope. This reflects the fact that ice has a lower density than water, which is an unusual property for a material.

== Polymorphism ==

Many substances can exist in a variety of solid phases each corresponding to a unique crystal structure. These varying crystal phases of the same substance are called [[w:polymorphism|polymorphs]]. [[w:Diamond|Diamond]] and [[w:graphite|graphite]] are examples of polymorphs of [[w:carbon|carbon]]. Graphite is composed of layers of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms, in which each carbon atom is strongly bound to three neighboring atoms in the same layer and is weakly bound to atoms in the neighboring layers. By contrast in diamond each carbon atom is strongly bound to four neighboring carbon atoms in a cubic array. The unique crystal structures of graphite and diamond are responsible for the vastly different properties of these two materials.

Each polymorph of a given substance is usually only stable over a specific range of conditions. For example, diamond is only stable at extremely high pressures. Graphite is the stable form of carbon at normal atmospheric pressures. Although diamond is not stable at atmospheric pressures and should transform to graphite, we know that diamonds exist at these pressures. This is because at normal temperatures the transformation from diamond to graphite is extremely slow. If we were to heat the diamond, the rate of transformation would increase and the diamond would become graphite. However, at normal temperatures the diamond can persist for a very long time. Non-equilibrium phases like diamond that exist for long periods of time are said to be [[w:Metastability|metastable]].

Another important example of metastable polymorphs occurs during the processing of [[w:steel|steel]]. Steels are often subjected to a variety of thermal treatments designed to produce various combinations of stable and metastable iron phases. In this way the steel properties, such as hardness and strength can be adjusted by controlling the relative amounts and crystal sizes of the various phases that form.

== Phase separation ==

Different parts of a system may exist in different phases, in which case the phases are usually separated by boundary surfaces.

[[w:Gibbs' phase rule|Gibbs' phase rule]] describes the number of phases that can be present at [[w:equilibrium|equilibrium]] for a given system at various conditions. The phase rule indicates that for a single component system at most three phases (usually gas, liquid and solid) can co-exist in equilibrium. The three phases can all co-exist only at a single specific temperature and pressure, characteristic of the material, called the [[w:triple point|triple point]]. The conditions where two phases become indistinguishable is called a [[w:critical point|critical point]]. The phase rule also indicates that two phases can only co-exist at equilibrium for specific combinations of temperature and pressure. For example for a liquid-gas system if the [[w:vapor pressure|vapor pressure]] is lower than that corresponding to the temperature, the system will not be at equilibrium, rather the liquid will tend to evaporate until the vapor pressure reaches the appropriate level or all of the liquid is consumed. Likewise, if the vapor pressure is too great for the given temperature condensation will occur.

For the case of multi-component systems the phase rule indicates that additional phases are possible. A common example of this occurs in mixtures of mutually insoluble substances such as [[w:water|water]] and [[w:oil|oil]].  If a few drops of oil are poured into pure water, there will be a small amount of intermixing, but there will be two distinct phases: one primarily oil and the other primarily water. The exact composition of the phases will be a function of the temperature and pressure but not a function of the amount of oil. It may be possible to change the temperature such that one of the phases disappears: for example, if the mixture is heated, it is possible that at some temperature, all of the oil is dissolved in the water. Above this temperature there is only one phase, and the composition of the phase ''does'' depend on how much oil was put in.

Phase separation can also exist in two dimensions. The boundaries between phases, the surfaces of materials, and the grain boundaries between different crystallographic orientations of a single material can also show distinct phases. For example, surface reconstructions on [[w:metal|metal]] and [[w:semiconductor|semiconductor]] surfaces are two dimensional phases.

== Gas ==
A '''gas''' is one of the phases of matter.  Gases are, like liquids, fluids: they have the ability to flow and do not resist deformation.  Unlike liquids, however, unconstrained gases do not occupy a fixed volume, but instead expand to fill whatever space they occupy.  The kinetic energy in a gas is the greatest of the states of matter. Because of this increased kinetic energy, gas atoms and molecules tend to bounce off of one another, more so as the kinetic energy is increased.

== Liquid ==
One of the four phases of matter, a '''liquid''' is a fluid whose volume is fixed under conditions of constant temperature and pressure; and, whose shape is usually determined by the container it fills.


Liquids tend to pull themselves together into droplets due to surface tension.  The kinetic energy in a liquid is greater than that of a solid, but less than that of a gas. A liquids atoms/molecules are &quot;slippery&quot;; that is, they slide over one another, allowing the liquid to flow.

If a liquid is at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; at any point is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho gz
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the liquid (assumed constant) and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the point below the surface.   Note that this formula assumes that the pressure '''at''' the free surface is zero.


It should be noted that glass at normal temperatures is ''not'' a &quot;supercooled liquid&quot;, but a solid. See the article on glass for more details.

== Solid ==
A '''solid''' is a state of matter, characterized by a definite volume and a definite shape (i.e. it resists deformation). Within a solid, atoms/molecules are relatively close together, or &quot;rigid&quot;; however, this does not prevent the solid from becoming deformed or compressed. In the solid [[w:phases of matter|phase of matter]], atoms have a spatial ordering; because all matter has some kinetic energy, the atoms in even the most rigid solid move slightly, but this movement is &quot;invisible&quot;.  

Physicists call the study of solids '''solid state physics'''. This includes semiconductors and superconductivity. Solid state physics is a type of condensed matter physics.

Materials science is primarily concerned with properties of solids such as strength and [[w:Phases of matter|phase transformations]]. It overlaps strongly with solid state physics.

Solid state chemistry overlaps both of these fields, but is especially concerned with the synthesis of novel materials.

Data can be classified as either '''primary''' or '''secondary'''. 

== Primary Data ==
Primary data means original data that has been '''collected''' specially for the purpose in mind.  It means someone collected the data from the original source first hand.  Data collected this way is called primary data.

The people who gather primary data may be an authorized organization, investigator, enumerator or they may be just someone with a clipboard.  Those who gather primary data may have knowledge of the study and may be motivated to make the study a success.  These people are acting as a witness so primary data is only considered as reliable as the people who gathered it.

''Research where one gathers this kind of data is referred to as '''field research'''''.

'''For example:''' your own questionnaire.

== Secondary Data ==
Secondary data is data that has been '''collected''' for another purpose. When we use Statistical Method with Primary Data from another purpose for our purpose we refer to it as Secondary Data.  It means that one purpose's Primary Data is another purpose's Secondary Data.  Secondary data is data that is being reused.  Usually in a different context.

''Research where one gathers this kind of data is referred to as '''desk research'''''.

'''For example:''' data from a book.

== Why Classify Data This Way? ==
Knowing how the data was collected allows critics of a study to search for bias in how it was conducted.  A good study will welcome such scrutiny.  Each type has its own weaknesses and strengths.  Primary Data is gathered by people who can focus directly on the purpose in mind.  This helps ensure that questions are meaningful to the purpose but can introduce bias in those same questions.  Secondary Data doesn't have the privilege of this focus but is only susceptible to bias introduced in the choice of what data to reuse.  Stated another way, those who gather Secondary Data get to pick the questions.  Those who gather Primary Data get to write the questions.

== Statistics ==

Are you a principle contributor to the Statistics text book? I saw that you had posted the note requesting assistance, and I'd be willing to help out. I'm taking an Advanced Placement statistics course right now and I could add notes as we go. For example, we just finished probability and I could fill out that section with some help.

'''Game''' are wild animals and birds. Farm-raised game are originally wild species of animals and birds that have been raised for sale. Large native game animals living in North America include antelope, buffalo, bear, caribou, deer, elk, moose, reindeer, and wild boar. Elsewhere in the world, even rarer varieties eaten by humans are camel, elephant, kangaroo, wild goats, wild sheep, zebra, and other species.

Small game animals include alligator, rabbit, squirrel, beaver, muskrat, opossum, raccoon, armadillo, porcupine, and other species.

Game birds include grouse, guineafowl, partridge, squab (young pigeon), quail, pheasant, wild ducks, wild geese, wild turkey, and other species. Rock Cornish hens -- thought by many consumers to be game birds -- are actually young domesticated chickens.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
==Game animals==
[[Image:Elk_Fawn_in_Grand_Teton_NP_-NPS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|elk (fawn)]]

In culinary terms, ''[[Cookbook:Venison|venison]]'' can be meat from deer, elk, moose, caribou, antelope, and pronghorn. However, when this meat is offered for sale, the name of the specific animal normally is specified on the package label.

[[Cookbook:Bison|Bison]] (buffalo) is native to North America. Once about 60 million in number, bison were hunted almost to extinction by the 1890’s. Currently there are more than 150,000 animals being raised across North America.

Musk-ox is a heavy-set, shaggy-coated wild ox that lives in northern North America, the Arctic islands, and Greenland. The meat tastes similar to buffalo.

Collared Peccary (javelina) is a hoofed animal native to parts of Mexico, South America, and the southwest U.S. A substitute is fresh pork.

[[Cookbook:Rabbit|Rabbit]]s sold for consumption are usually either crosses between New Zealand and Belgian varieties, Chinese rabbits, or Scottish hares.

[[Cookbook:Wild boar|Wild boar]], along with feral (wild) hogs, are found in 23 states in the U.S. and are estimated to number over 2 million. Like our domestic swine, these animals are not native to North America, but were originally brought over from other continents. Originally domesticated and then released into the wild, these animals are now hybrids.

&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;
==Game Birds==
[[Image:Trumpeter Swans in Grand Teton NP-NPS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|swans]]

[[Cookbook:Duck|Wild Ducks]] – The Chinese were the first to raise wild ducks domestically for food. Today’s domestic wild ducks are descendants of either the Muscovy or Mallard species. America’s Long Island ducks are offspring of Peking ducks (a variety of Mallard) brought from China in the late 1800’s. A young duck or duckling (usually under 8 weeks of age) has dark, tender meat and weighs about 3 1/2 to 5 pounds. A mature duck is usually over 6 months of age and has tougher meat.

[[Cookbook:Goose|Goose]] – Geese were farm-raised in ancient Egypt, China, and India. Today’s goose weighs between 5 and 18 pounds. A young bird of either sex (&quot;goose&quot; is the female of the species; &quot;gander,&quot; the male) has tender meat, while a mature goose of either sex has tougher meat.

Guineafowl – This relative of the chicken and partridge, sometimes called a guinea hen or African pheasant, was thought to originate in Guinea, West Africa. A young guineafowl, about 11 weeks old, has tender meat, while a mature bird has tougher meat. Female guinea fowl are more tender than males. The meat is light red and slightly dry with a mild gamey flavor. Due to their small size – about 2 to 3 pounds, including giblets – guinea fowl are usually sold whole.

[[Cookbook:Partridge|Partridge]] – There are no native partridge species in the United States. Most partridge in the market are from European or African varieties. The Grey partridge, a European species, was imported from Hungary and raised in England. Found as far away as the Middle East, this variety is sometimes called Hungarian partridge. Chukar is a partridge species from India.

[[Cookbook:Pheasant|Pheasant]] - Originally from Asia, the female of this medium-size game bird (weighing about 3 pounds) has more tender, plump, and juicy meat than the male, which weighs about 5 pounds. Young birds can be roasted, but older birds need moist heat because their flesh is drier and leaner.

[[Cookbook:Quail|Quail]] – American quail are known regionally by various names: Bobwhite, partridge, and quail (blue, California, mountain and Montezuma). American quail nest on the ground and are not related to the European quail of the partridge family. A ready-to-cook quail weighs about 3 to 7 ounces, including the giblets. Due to their small size, they are usually roasted and served whole. The meat is dark, but mild flavored.

[[Cookbook:Squab|Squab]], [[Cookbook:Pigeon|Pigeon]] or [[Cookbook:Dove|Dove]] – This species originated in the Middle East and Asia, and is one of the oldest birds known to man. A squab is a young, immature pigeon about 4 weeks old. Because it is too young to fly, the meat is very tender. Squab usually weigh about 12 to 16 ounces, including giblets, and have dark, delicately flavored meat. They are usually stuffed whole and roasted. A pigeon that has been allowed to mature and has tougher meat than a squab.

[[Cookbook:Turkey|Wild Turkeys]] -- Turkey is one of North America’s native birds. The name &quot;turkey&quot; was originally applied to an African bird, now known as the guineafowl, which was believed to have originated in Turkey. When the Europeans came upon the American turkey, they thought it was the same bird as the African guinea fowl, and so gave it the name turkey, although the two species are quite distinct. Compared to their domestic counterparts, wild turkeys are leaner, less meaty, not as tender, and have a stronger flavor.

==Taste==

Because their diets and activity levels are not the same as that of domestic animals and poultry, the meat of farm-raised game animals has a different flavor – stronger than domesticated species and milder than wild game. The factors that determine the meat's quality include the age of the animal (younger animals are more tender), the animal's diet, and the time of year the animal was harvested. (The best is in the fall, after a plentiful spring and summer feeding.)

Equally important is how the animal was handled in the field. The animal should be eviscerated within an hour of harvest, and the meat refrigerated within a few hours. Meat is damaged (and sometimes ruined) if it is not dressed, transported, and chilled properly.

In general, wild game is less tender than meat from domestic animals because the wild animals get more exercise and have less fat. Any fat is generally bad tasting and should be removed. For maximum tenderness, most game meat should be cooked slowly and not overdone. It can be cooked with moist heat by braising or with dry heat by roasting. Ways to keep game moist include basting, larding, or barding.

==Are game &quot;red&quot; or &quot;white&quot; meat?==

Game birds are poultry and considered &quot;white&quot; meat. Because they are birds of flight, however, the breast meat is darker than domestic chicken and turkey (which stand a lot, but do little, if any, flying). This is because more oxygen is needed by muscles doing work, and the oxygen is delivered to those muscles by the red cells in the blood.

All game animals are &quot;red&quot; meat. One of the proteins in meat, myoglobin, holds the oxygen in the muscle, and gives the meat a darker color.

==General cooking guidlines==

The tenderness of a particular cut of game is similar to the corresponding cut of domestically-raised meat or poultry. All game tends to be leaner than that of domesticated animals, which have been bred for tenderness and fat marbling. Overcooking can toughen game. You can use moist heat, basting, and larding or barding (inserting slivers of fat or wrapping in bacon) to help keep the meat tender during cooking. Fast searing over high heat can also work for smaller cuts, such as tenderloin medallions or rib chops.

== Featured ingredient ==

This module was the featured ingredient on the main [[Cookbook]] page from May 23, 2004 - June 1, 2004. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 12:31, 23 May 2004 (UTC)

==Elk vs. Moose==

This article confuses the names of large members of the deer family. This is forgivable, since the animals have different names in different places.
* ''Alces alces'' is called a '''[[w:Moose|Moose]]''' in N. America and an '''Elk''' in Europe.
* ''Cervus elaphus'' is called an '''Elk''' or '''Wapiti''' in N. America and a '''[[w:Red deer|Red deer]]''' in Europe.

::As this module was taken pretty much verbatum from a USDA article, I'm not supprised that the american usage is predominant.  That does not make it confused. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:05, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Picture==
Is there someone out there with a better picture than an elk calf?  (proper name, not fawn)  The majority (99.99%) of hunters don't kill immature animals (calves, fawns, etc) , except in extremely rare cases.  This gives a very inaccurate impression and seems to cater more to the anti-hunting crowd than to an honest, NPOV encyclopedic treatment.

[[Image:NCI_clove_ham.jpg|right|thumb|Traditional cooked ham with cloves]]
The word '''ham''' means [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] which comes from the hind leg of a hog. Ham made from the front leg of a hog will be labeled &quot;pork shoulder picnic.&quot; &quot;Turkey&quot; ham must be made from the thigh meat of [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]].

Hams may be fresh, cured, or cured-and-smoked. The usual color for cured ham is deep rose or pink; fresh ham (which is not cured) has the pale pink or beige color of a fresh pork roast; country hams and prosciutto (which are dry cured) range from pink to mahogany color.

Hams are either ready-to-eat or not. Ready-to-eat hams include prosciutto and fully cooked hams; they can be eaten right out of the package. Fresh hams and hams that are only trichina treated must be cooked by the consumer before eating; in most countries, these hams will bear a safe handling label.

==Curing==
Curing is the addition of salt, sodium nitrate (or saltpeter), nitrites and sometimes sugars, seasonings, phosphates and ascorbates to pork for preservation, color development and flavor enhancement.

Nitrate and nitrites contribute to the characteristic cured flavor and reddish-pink color of cured pork. Nitrite and salt inhibit the outgrowth of ''Clostridium botulinum'', a deadly microorganism which can occur in foods. The nitrates and nitrites create cancer-causing chemicals when overcooked, so avoid eating ham that has been browned or blackened.

The two most-used methods of adding solutions to pork are: injection into muscle by needle; and tumbling or massaging into muscle to produce a more tender product.

===Dry curing===
In dry curing, the process used to make country hams and prosciutto, fresh meat is rubbed with a dry-cure mixture of salt and other ingredients. Dry curing produces a salty product. In 1992, FSIS approved a trichina treatment method that permits substituting up to half of the sodium chloride with potassium chloride to result in lower sodium levels. Since dry curing draws out moisture, it reduces ham weight by at least 18% -- usually 20 to 25%; this results in a more concentrated ham flavor.

Dry-cured hams may be aged from a few weeks to more than a year. Six months is the traditional process but may be shortened according to aging temperature.

These uncooked hams are safe stored at room temperature because they contain so little water, bacteria can't multiply in them. Country hams may not be injected with curing solutions or placed in curing solutions but they may be smoked.

===Wet curing or brine cure===
Brine curing is the most popular way of producing hams. Contrary to popular misconception, not all brine-cured hams are &quot;injected&quot;. Many traditional ham styles (such as the English Wiltshire ham) are wet-cured hams.  Brining ingredients can be salt, sugar, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, sodium erythorbate, sodium phosphate, potassium chloride, water and flavorings. Smoke flavoring (liquid smoke) may also be injected with brine solution. Cooking may occur during this process.

===Smoking and smoke flavoring===
After curing, some hams are smoked. Smoking is a process by which ham is hung in a smokehouse and allowed to absorb smoke from smoldering fires. This gives added flavor and color to meat and slows the development of rancidity.

==How much to buy==
When buying a ham, estimate the size needed according to the number of servings the type of ham should yield:

* 1/4 - 1/3 lb. per serving of boneless ham
* 1/3 - 1/2 lb. of meat per serving of ham with little bone
* 3/4 - 1 lb. of meat per serving of ham with large bone.

==Ham glossary==
Labeling regulations referenced in this glossary are those of the United States.
*''Bayonne Ham,'' Air dried ham from the Adour valley in S W France 'the Basque country'.  Salted, then air cured for a mimimum of seven months.  
*''Butt (sirloin) end, half,'' or ''portion'' - the upper, meatier part of the whole leg; a butt portion has had some center slices removed for separate sale as ham steaks or center cut ham slices. The half includes this meat.
*''Canned ham'' -- Canned hams come in two forms:
**''Shelf stable'' - store on shelf up to 2 years at room temperature. Generally not over 3 pounds in size. Processed to kill all spoilage bacteria and pathogenic organisms such as Clostridium botulinum, Salmonella and Trichinella spiralis. The product is free of microorganisms capable of growing at ordinary room temperature. However, high temperature storage -- above 122° F (50° C) -- may result in harmless thermophylic bacteria multiplying and swelling or souring the product.
**''Refrigerated'' - may be stored in refrigerator up to 6 to 9 months. Its weight can be up to 8% more than original uncured weight due to uptake of water during curing. It need not be labeled &quot;Added water&quot; except for &quot;In Natural Juices.&quot; Net Weight is the weight of the actual ham excluding the container. Processed at a time/temperature sufficient to kill infectious organisms (including Trichinae) but the ham is not sterilized so spoilage bacteria may grow eventually.
*''Capacolla'' - Boneless pork shoulder butts which are dry cured; not necessarily cooked., ''Ham capacolla'' is made with ham instead of pork shoulder butts.
*''Cook before eating'' - needs further cooking. Is not completely cooked in the plant and should be cooked to 135° F.
*''Cottage ham'' - a ham made from the shoulder butt end.
*''Country ham'' - uncooked, cured, dried, smoked-or-unsmoked meat products made from a single piece of meat from the hind leg of a hog or from a single piece of meat from a pork shoulder. Smithfield and country hams are not fully cooked but are dry cured to be safe stored at room temperature. They should be cooked before eating according to manufacturer's instructions. A ham labeled &quot;Smithfield Ham&quot; must be processed in the city of Smithfield, Virginia.
*''Fresh ham'' - the uncured leg of pork. Since the meat is not cured or smoked, it has the flavor of a fresh pork loin roast or pork chops. Its raw color is pinkish red and after cooking, greyish white.
*''Fully cooked'' - needs no further cooking. Fully cooked in plant. Can be eaten directly as it comes from its packaging or reheated.
*''Gelatin'' - about one-fourth ounce of dry gelatin is often added before a canned ham is sealed to cushion the ham during shipment. During processing, natural juices cook out of the ham and combine with the gelatin. When the ham cools, a jell forms. Gelatin is included in the net weight statement on the label.
*''Ham'' - the product is at least 20.5% protein in lean portion and contains no added water.
*''Ham with natural juices'' - the product is at least 18.5% protein. Can weigh 8% more than uncured weight. Example: canned hams.
*''Ham -- Water added'' - the product is at least 17.0% protein with 10% added solution; it can weigh 8% more after curing than uncured.
*''Ham and water products'' - Product may contain any amount of water but label must indicate percent of &quot;added ingredients.&quot; For example, &quot;X % of weight is added ingredients&quot; for any canned ham with less than 17.0% protein.
*''Ham steak'' - another name for center cut ham slices.
*''Hickory-smoked ham'' - a cured ham which has been smoked by hanging over burning hickory wood chips in a smokehouse. May not be labeled &quot;hickory smoked&quot; unless hickory wood has been used.
*''Honey-cured'' - may be shown on the labeling of a cured product if honey is the only sweetening ingredient or is at least half the sweetening ingredients used, and if the honey is used in an amount sufficient to flavor and/or affect the appearance of the finished product.
*''&quot;Lean&quot; ham'' - The term &quot;lean&quot; may be used on a ham's label provided the product contains less than 10 grams fat, 4.5 grams or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams cholesterol per 100 grams and Reference Amount Customarily Consumed (RACC).
*''&quot;Extra lean&quot; ham'' - A ham labeled &quot;extra lean&quot; must contain less than 5 grams fat, less than 2 grams saturated fat and the same cholesterol as allowed per the amount of &quot;lean&quot; ham.
*''Picnic, pork shoulder picnic'' - a front shoulder cut of pork which has been cured in the same manner as ham.
*''Prosciutto ham'' - An Italian-style dry cured raw ham; not smoked; often coated with pepper. Proscuitti can be eaten raw because of the way they are processed. ''Parma ham'' is prosciutto from the Parma locale in Italy. These hams tend to be larger than the U.S. produced product, as Italian hogs are larger at slaughter.
*''Sectioned and formed'' or ''Chunked and formed'' - a boneless ham that is made from different cuts, tumbled or massaged and reassembled into a casing or mold and fully cooked. During this process it is usually thoroughly defatted.
*''Shank end, half,'' or ''portion'' - the lower, slightly pointed part of the leg. A &quot;portion&quot; has the center slices removed for separate sale as &quot;ham steaks&quot; or center cut ham slices. The half includes this meat.
*''Skinless, shankless'' - A ham with all of the skin and the shank removed. The leg bone and aitch (hip) bone remain.
*''Sugar cured'' - a term that may appear on ham labels if cane or beet sugar is at least half the sweetening ingredients used and if the sugar is used in an amount sufficient to flavor and/or affect the appearance of the finished product. Most hams contain sugar in the curing mixture.
*''Westphalian ham'' - A German-style dry cured ham that is similar to Prosciutto; smoked, sometimes with juniper berries. Also called ''Westfalischer Schinken''.

==Qualitative data==
Qualitative data is a categorical measurement expressed not in terms of numbers, but rather by means of a natural language description. In statistics, it is often used interchangeably with &quot;categorical&quot; data.

   For example: favorite color = &quot;blue&quot;
                height = &quot;tall&quot;

Although we may have categories, the categories may have a structure to them.  When there is not a natural ordering of the categories, we call these '''nominal''' categories. Examples might be gender, race, religion, or sport.  

When the categories may be ordered, these are called '''ordinal''' variables.  '''Categorical variables''' that judge size (small, medium, large, etc.) are ordinal variables.  Attitudes (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree) are also ordinal variables, however we may not know which value is the best or worst of these issues.  Note that the distance between these categories is not something we can measure.

==Quantitative data==
Quantitative data is a numerical measurement expressed not by means of a natural language description, but rather in terms of numbers. However, not all numbers are continuous and measurable. For example, the social security number is a number, but not something that one can add or subtract.

   For example: molecule length = &quot;450 nm&quot; 
                height = &quot;1.8 m&quot;

Quantitative data always are associated with a scale measure.

Probably the most common scale type is the ratio-scale.  Observations of this type are on a scale that has a meaningful zero value but also have an equidistant measure (i.e., the difference between 10 and 20 is the same as the difference between 100 and 110).  For example, a 10 year-old girl is twice as old as a 5 year-old girl.  Since you can measure zero years, time is a ratio-scale variable.  Money is another common ratio-scale quantitative measure. Observations that you count are usually ratio-scale (e.g., number of widgets).

{{meat}} | [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|Basic foodstuffs]]

Summer sausage, kielbasa, bologna, bratwurst: The list goes on and on. There are so many varieties of '''sausage'''. How long can you store them -- and where? Are they fully cooked or not? The following background information will answer these questions and others. 

==Types of Sausages==
Sausages are either ready to eat or not. They can be made from red meat, poultry or a combination. Uncooked sausages include fresh (bulk, patties or links) and smoked sausages. Uncooked smoked sausages containing [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] must be treated for trichinae.

Ready-to-eat sausages are dry, semi-dry and/or cooked. Dry sausages may be smoked, unsmoked or cooked. Semi-dry sausages are usually heated in the smokehouse to fully cook the product and partially dry it.

Let the label be your guide to sausage selection and handling. It will tell you if the product must be kept refrigerated, the nutrient content and the ingredients. All ingredients in the product must be listed by weight in descending order in the ingredient statement.

In the United States, safe handling instructions are mandatory for all raw or partially cooked [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat and poultry]] products.

===Fresh Sausages===
[[Image:Bar-b-que-sausages.jpg|thumb|Grilling sausages]]
Fresh sausages are a coarse or finely comminuted meat food product prepared from one or more kinds of meat, or meat and meat byproducts. They may contain water not exceeding 3% of the total ingredients in the product. They are usually seasoned, frequently cured, and may contain binders and extenders. They must be kept refrigerated and thoroughly cooked before eating.

* Fresh Pork Sausages - May not contain pork byproducts and no more than 50% fat by weight.
* Fresh [[Cookbook:Beef|Beef]] Sausages - May not include beef byproducts and no more than 30% fat by weight.
* Breakfast Sausages - May contain meat and meat byproducts and no more than 50% fat by weight.
* Whole Hog Sausage - Meat from swine in such proportions as are normal to a single animal and no more than 50% fat by weight.
* Italian Sausage Products - Cured or uncured sausages containing at least 85% meat, or a combination of meat and fat, with the total fat content constituting not more than 35% of the finished product. It contains [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and/or [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] and no more than 3% water. Optional ingredients permitted in Italian Sausages are [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spices]] (including [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]]) and flavorings, red or green peppers, [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] and [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], dextrose and [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]].

===Cooked and/ or Smoked Sausages===

These products are made of one or more different kinds of chopped or ground meats which have been seasoned, cooked and/or smoked. Water can be no more than 10% by weight. Meat byproducts may be used. Included in this category are:

* salami
* liverwurst
* hot dogs
* bologna
* knockwurst
* bratwurst
* braunschweiger
* blood sausage
* jellied beef loaf
* thuringer-style.

Cooked Salami (not dry) is made from fresh meats which are cured, stuffed into casings and cooked in a smokehouse at high temperature. It may be air dried for a short time. It has a softer texture than dry and semi-dry sausages and must be refrigerated.

===Meat Specialties===

A ready-to-eat sausage product. It is made from comminuted meats that are seasoned and usually cooked or baked rather than smoked. They are usually sliced and served cold. Included in this category are:

* chopped ham loaf
* luncheon meat
* peppered loaf
* head cheese
* jellied corned beef
* ham and cheese loaf
* honey loaf
* old fashioned loaf
* olive loaf
* pickle and pimento loaf
* scrapple
* souse
* veal loaf.

===Dry and Semi-Dry Sausages===
[[Image:Chorizo1.jpg|thumb|Chorizo]]
Dry sausages may or may not be characterized by a bacterial fermentation. When fermented, the intentional encouragement of a lactic acid bacteria growth is useful as a meat preservative as well as producing the typical tangy flavor. The ingredients are mixed with spices and curing materials, stuffed into casings, and put through a carefully controlled, long, continuous air-drying process.

Dry sausages require more production time than other types of sausages and results in a concentrated form of meat. Medium-dry sausage is about 70% of its &quot;green&quot; weight when sold. Green weight is the weight of the raw article before addition of added substances or before cooking. Less-dry and fully-dried sausages range from 80% to 60% of original weight at completion.

Dry sausages include:

* chorizo (Spanish, smoked, highly spiced)
* Frizzes (similar to pepperoni but not smoked)
* pepperoni (not cooked, air dried)
* Landjäger
* Lola or Lolita and Lyons sausage (mildly seasoned pork with garlic)
* Genoa Salami (Italian, usually made from pork but may have a small amount of [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]]; it is moistened with [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] or [[Cookbook:Grape|grape]] juice and seasoned with garlic)

Semi-dry sausages are usually heated in the smokehouse to fully cook the product and partially dry it. Semi-dry sausages are semi-soft sausages with good keeping qualities due to their lactic acid fermentation. &quot;Summer Sausage&quot; (another word for cervelat) is the general classification for mildly seasoned, smoked, semi-dry sausages like Mortadella and Lebanon bologna.

== Casings ==

If you've ever wondered what &quot;Lamb casing&quot; or &quot;Beef casing&quot; meant, that means what animal the casing comes from. If you really want to know what a casing is, then I'll tell you: Natural casings mean, well something very unappetizing: The connective tissue lining on the intestines. You still want to eat sausages now? Nowadays, many companies use a synthetic casing, collagen actually, that is shaped to look like a natural casing.

== Preparation ==

Sausages can be boiled, fried, or browned (usually in preparation for inclusion in another dish). It can be prepared with the casing on, or with it removed. The method of preparation fundamentally affects the taste and texture of the resulting dish.

&lt;gallery mode=&quot;packed&quot;&gt;

Browned italian sausage.jpg|Italian style sausage browned and crumbled in a skillet.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Safety precautions==

Because dry sausages are not cooked, people &quot;at risk&quot; (the elderly, very young children, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems) might want to avoid eating them. The bacterium E. coli O157:H7 can survive the process of dry fermenting, and recently some children became ill after eating dry cured salami containing the bacteria. Also, the casing poses a sanitation problem because, in the first place, it is what makes raw meat infected with bacteria.

*[[Cookbook:Boerewors|Boerewors]] - a very popular South African sausage
*[[Cookbook:Seitan Bratwurst|Seitan Bratwurst]] - a very easy and tasty vegetarian Bratwurst.

-----

This article could really benefit from more breadth.  From the British point of view, there are two particularly glaring omissions:

* Blood Sausages (Boudin Noir/Black Pudding; half cooked?)
* Haggis

Unfortunately I don't have the specific knowledge of how these are made to make the changes myself.

Two points: 
1) very US-centric
2)&quot;Fresh Pork Sausages - May not contain pork byproducts&quot; BUT THAT'S THE POINT OF SAUSAGE!
I may add a family recipe for pork sausage made of Boston Butt later. [[Special:Contributions/66.215.20.28|66.215.20.28]] ([[User talk:66.215.20.28|talk]]) 06:23, 22 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

'''Beef and Barley Stew''' - This hearty stew can be prepared from freezer to table in under 2 hours.  It's easy to prepare ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze for later use.

==Ingredients==
*3 pounds (1.25 kg) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], cubed
*1 white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], diced
*4 cubed [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 cup (240 g) [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]]
*¼ cup (60 g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 can [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
*1 small can [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]] [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
*1 slug [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*1 bunch [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], [[Cookbook:Paprika|paprika]] to taste
*1 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]]
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]]
*2 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|vegetable oil]]
*2 cartons [[Cookbook:Broth|beef broth]]
*1 lb (450 g) [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]
*1 pkg [[Cookbook:Green Bean|frozen green beans]]
*3 cloves halved [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
*3 stalks [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
*4 large [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]]
*water, enough to cover all ingredients in pot

Dust beef cubes with flour lightly. Brown in vegetable oil. Move to separate pot and clean pan with beef broth and add to pot. Sauté celery, garlic and onion briefly and add to pot. Simmer for 1.5 hours. Add barley and simmer additional ½ hour. Add potatoes, sliced mushrooms, frozen green beans, diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add slug of Worcestershire sauce. Simmer additional hour. Chop parsley and stir into stew before serving.

Serves 12.

==Procedure==
#Combine the flour, salt, pepper, and paprika on a plate, and dredge the cubed beef in the flour mixture.
#Add the oil to a [[Cookbook:Dutch Oven|Dutch oven]] or large [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] on medium high heat.  [[Cookbook:Browning|Brown]] the beef in the oil.
#When the beef is evenly browned on all sides, add the water, beef broth, bay leaf, onion, carrots and barley.  Allow to come to a simmer and reduce heat.
#Allow to simmer for 1 to 1½ hours, until the meat is tender.  Remove the bay leaf and serve with noodles or rice.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*Don't overcrowd the beef when browning.  If there is not enough room to brown all the meat at the same time, do it in batches, and then add the reserved beef with the other ingredients.

==Warnings==
*Always follow safe handling guidelines when using raw meat.

=== Introduction to the Arthropods ===

Arthropods ('''Phylum Arthropoda''') constitute the largest phylum of animals, and  include the insects, arachnids (e.g., mites, spiders), crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, shrimp), and other similar creatures. Between 75 and 80% of all organisms on planet Earth are arthropods&amp;mdash;over a million modern species are known, and the fossil record reaches back to the early [[Wikipedia:en:Cambrian|Cambrian]]. However, species in the world's tropical forests remain largely undiscovered; Thomas (1990) estimated that perhaps 6 to 9 million species are yet to be discovered in this environment alone.  Arthropods are common in all environments, and include symbiotic and parasitic forms. They range in size from microscopic plankton (~0.25 mm) up to forms several metres long.its class insecta bear almost 1.4-1.5 million species.

Because this group is so large, we will devote the next several chapters to the various subgroups: the subphyla and classes of arthropods. 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Arthropod|Arthropods]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be persued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)

=== The Trilobites ===

Because of the hard exoskeleton, arthropods tend to make excellent fossils.  A particularly large group of arthropods known as trilobites are known only from the fossil record: florishing in Cambrian seas and into the lower Palaeozoic. The last of the triliobites disappeared at the end of the Permian.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Active Approach ==
I think this book gives some great background on philosophy, it has good information but lacks any diagrams or pictures and is relativly dull other than that good job [[User:Wikilife|Wikilife]] ([[User talk:Wikilife|talk]])

----------
Honestly, I am working on this book as I push through my own side-studies of philosophy. Ever more I am finding it harder to put philosophy in a context of a text book. More and more I am seeing that it is something that you have to do and experience. So, while making this I had the wrong premises in mind, and I apologize for this action. I plan on working on the Wikiversity level of Philosophy. I fear that a text book will only fall short on giving a description of philosophy unless to be given set of readings of what philosophy is and reflections on them. I wish to all the best of luck with this book. 
--[[User:Destrogal|Destrogal]] 18:54, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

I am taking a new approach on this. The old version of this text was completely incomprehensible and strayed far from what I would consider an introduction. Although this is the first step and there is much to be edited, I would like to continue working in this manner until the end of each part. Afterwards, it would be easier for me to edit. That is, when I have more time to take in each idea and pay more attention to its own attention to the subject. Also, I will be trying to transform these discussion pages into a comprehensive discussion on Philosophy.

In addition, I would like to keep many articles and work from them, but there shouldn't have been a simple posed questions: What is philosophy? Why study philosophy? -- These are junk. We should explain the nature of philosophy to begin with. Where it came from, how it is interpreted, who started it, etc. If anyone has an objection, please email me at destrogal@gmail.com

== Old comments ==

I agree with the other comments.
Also, I think the structure of this book needs to be re-worked. There should be a number of subsections, as each current section is quite large in scope. The arrangement itself could use a little re-arrangement, which I'll gladly get to when I have a chance. The links are fucked, they'll all have to be changed from basic pages (why would there be a wikibooks/philosophy_of_religion ??) to links &quot;within&quot; this book, e.g. wikibooks:introduction_to_philosophy:philosophy_of_religion. Ugh.

Why is there no mention to aesthetics? [[User:KIZU|KIZU]] 09:14, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

The introduction mentions a commitment to logic but there doesn't appear to be a logic section


----
In the various philosophy courses I've taken, philosophy is typically decomposed into '''logic''', '''epistemology''', '''metaphysics''', '''ethics''', '''aesthetics''', and sometimes '''political philosophy'''.

== I enjoyed it ==

Is there a way to get a word printout of it?

Alex


:Glad you enjoyed &quot;Introduction to Philosophy&quot;.
:I am the author of 'Existentialism', 'Ulitiarnism' (ugh), and 'Philosophy of Mind'. (Also 'Pragmatism' but it isn't piped as yet).
:You can get individual bits and make a Word printout yourself.
:(Working from MS Word to the Wiki format and vice versa is covered with hidden pitfalls).
:All you need do is cut and paste the content as well as the editing history.
:Thank you, [[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 02:20, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)



'Ulitiarnism'  - do you mean 'utilitarianism'?
----
Well, I've added logic, and also aesthetics, as people seem to be asking for this.  I might get round to putting some material under 'logic', but I don't really know much about aesthetics.  Perhaps 'logic' should go at the top?  But I'm not a pushy person, so won't put it there myself unless given much prompting to do so.

I see that 'Introduction to Philosophy' is listed as 'struggling'.  I sometimes feel like I'm the only person struggling with it.  Please tell me that this isn't true or I'll go and find something else to do.  When I start trying to write about things, I begin to realise just how patchy my knowledge is.
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 17:02, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== References section ==

Do we really need a references section? Personally, I feel that it confuses things, since we can cite direcly into the article using endnotes.  Besides, the page doesn't seem to be getting filled at all, and serves as more of an embarassment than a section.  IMO, it will confuse people, since they'll have to go back and forth between two different pages...I say we scrap it and do everything in the article itself, with a separate &lt;nowiki&gt;==References==&lt;/nowiki&gt; section. -[[User:Frazzydee|[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]]]] 03:57, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: well, as the link doesn't go anywhere, I'll remove it.  Refs can go in individual chapters I think.  Maybe there is a need for general refs to general works, like the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.  But as the link doesn't go anywhere, I'll remove it or comment it out for now.
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 16:53, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Classification? ==

Should Existentialism, Buddhism, and Transcendentalism be placed under ethics? They all have ethical components and implications, but they are not all about ethics. I don't know where they belong, but they don't belong under ethics.



:Perhaps a &quot;Philosophical Positions&quot; section or something similar should be added to capture things like this, as well as things like postmodernism, nihilism, etc.. Not sure what the best way to go about this would be. Should it be it's own section? Does it fit under an &quot;Introduction to Philosophy&quot;?
--[[User:Moonty|moonty]] 21:46, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Suggestion ==

Hello! I found your book really interesting but you could simplify your Wikibook. I'm not saying that it isn't OK but you can classify and edit the text a little bit so that it looks easy to understand for you as well as for the user. And one more thing, you can edit the complexity also, so easy naming, classification is available and understanding is easy. 
--Mastermind 007 13:39, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

== Page cleanup ==

There are two pages in particular that I would strongly recommend that interested individuals help out with to try and fix up.  I've been going through the orphaned page bin, and I discovered some modules that IMHO are better written than the content that is associated with this Wikibook.  At least give it a chance and perhaps merge all of the content together to see what might become of it. See these two pages:

*[[Introduction to Philosophy:What is Epistemology]]
*[[Introduction to Philosophy:What is Ethics]]

make sure you mark the source pages for speedy delete when you are done with them.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== A section about divine command theory ==

I think that it would not be such a bad idea to include sections about divine command theory and cultural ethical relativism. These are both well-known and respected moral theories. Perhaps a divine command theory section could describe morality from the viewpoints of various religions.

(posted by Daniel Love of Lucidity Institute forum fame):

Many of the techniques and &quot;facts&quot; presented on this page are NOT backed up by research. I would recommend further research into any of the techniques suggested here. This is not to say that SOME of the techniques are genuine only that some are not. Do not take anything you read as a fact without further research. No point filling your mind with misleading details when it is expanding yourmind that you are interested in now is there?

Please would the person who complained about innaccuracies in the &quot;[[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]]&quot; page detail these inaccuracies? I will make the changes if I cannot back myself up. Alternatively, you can edit the page itself, but note that if I ''can'' back myself up the relevant edits will be reverted (i.e. reversed). [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 13:01, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: The person was Daniel Love (he's registered at the Lucidity Institute), I have contacted him and he gave kind permission to put the CAT method into the wikibook! [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 13:29, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:There are in fact several incorrections on the text. Recent changes even emphasized it a bit more, for instance the reality check procedures as described are only necessary for someone with a deep mental problem of disassociation, if the issues becomes so severe as described the person should consult a mental specialist. Reality checks have a place and a function but they do not need to become a mania and I contest any benefit in systematically performing reality check while fully consciously awaken and a risk when in lucid dreaming as they promote awakening.
:The induction section is also extremely convoluted and mixes a lot of information, from autosuggestion, to self-hypnosis (not the same) completely outside of context. I can auto-suggest having a lucid dream but I can't initiate a lucid dream with autosuggestion, this is more or less the same with self-hypnosis I can promote having lucid dreams but not initiate a lucid dream under hypnosis (if at all achieved it is then an hypnotic experience and it is significantly different than a lucid dream)...
:I was going to tag the page as having incorrections but since this discussion is already taking place I decided the attention of the editors to these facts...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:02, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

== start reality checking etc right away ==

The first sentence of the section is stupid: &quot;You should have your dream recall up to about one dream a night before trying to induce lucid dreams&quot;. Why? You can just as well start pracitice the habit of reality checking etc right away, at the same time working on dream recall. This should be changed to something like &quot;You should not ''expect'' the lucid dream induction techniques to work until your dream recall is good (and even then you might have to wait for months)&quot;.

: This is such a minor change I'm surprised you didn't do it yourself. I'm not trying to be totalitarian with this wikibook ;-). I'll change it myself, in case you never return. But &quot;and even then you might have to wait for months&quot; sounds passive and rather pessimistic. I'm pessimistic myself but try not to spread it. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:51, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::Don't worry :) I'll return with more criticism as soon as I've got time :) And you shouldn't be pessimistic about practicing taking months. I think it's wonderful! It's such an interesting oppurtunity to practice discipline and will power. --[[User:DanielJanzon|DanielJanzon]] 18:28, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

It takes a couple of weeks to get the habit of making reality tests and understand the other lucid dream induction techniques. It also takes a couple of weeks to enhance dream recall. Why not prepare the induction skill so it is there when the dream recall rate is high enough?

: It didn't take me so long to start doing reality checks (I believe that's the more common name nowadays). Dream recall certainly is a slow thing. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:51, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Tibetan dream yogic methods ==

Nothing is written about the Tibetan dream yogic methods. Although not scientific, they should be mentioned for those who want to try it out. The technique is basically to understand that everything we see, here, smell and sense is produced by our brains. ''Everything is a dream.'' Keeping this high level of awareness during the day-time will eventually make it possible to keep this awareness if not 24 hours a day, at least under large portions of the sleep-time.

: Criticism isn't so useful when ''you'' could do something about it. But I can see you already gave me a starter to find the other name for this: Lucid Living. I'll research it. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 14:51, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Template for RC pages ==

&lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{msg:LDRCTOC}}

With the (name) reality check, you check if ...

As well as doing this regularly, you could also do it every time... (optional)

This reality check works because... (optional)

Examples of this reality check working:

: A simple example (optional)

: An example where somebody had trouble understanding their results, but managed anyway (optional)

: An example where somebody did not intend to do the RC when they became lucid (optional)

: Another miscellanous one (optional)

Examples of this reality check failing:

: One where the reality check gives real-life results

: Another one where you try to ask a dream character to &quot;rationalise&quot; the true outcome, or when the reality check worked but was not recognised.

: Same sort of thing again (optional)
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== On reality check examples ==

A quick note on the reality check examples: They don't really need to be real, but they do need to be ''realistic'', i.e. like a dream would be. Also, there isn't much point making them all to a template, is there? Add a little background information, or make the example somehow interesting. Otherwise, leave it out.

== Current reliability boxes ==

&lt;div style=&quot;background-color: #fff; padding: 10px; border: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;
Possible boxes for &quot;reliability&quot;; within them will be a description of reliability but not actual content (which would follow).

{| width=100%

{| width=100%
|style=&quot;background-color: #ffefef; border: 1px solid #fababa&quot;|Rated red. There have been no anecdotes found of this technique working.

Response to the colored box idea:

Nice. However, the Rated Yellow category should be a redder yellow while Yellow/Green should be a greener yellow, like this:

{| width=100%

: Sorry, but... ew! Those colours are pretty bright and lurid. I think I'll just put in the gentle ones now (I want to rush this wikibook to perfection quickly ;) ) and worry about the exact colours later.

Okay. By the way, we could do this on the realitychecks where those with more anecdotes have a higher rating.

: Tough one there. There are loads more anecdotes than just the ones given (the success ones tend to be all the same) and it's a pain keeping count. Also there's the subject &quot;Reliable - Fast - Discreet&quot; rating on the [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]] page, which could make it pretty useless. Well, I'm off to bed now.

== Reorganization of the techniques page ==

I'm thinking we should reorganize the [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]] page, rewrite the MILD section, add an autosuggestion section, add a dream incubation section, make a new section for &quot;unverified&quot; techniques (if anyone wants to think of a better name, feel free to share it :-) ) and give each method of inducing WILDs it's own subcategory in the &quot;WILDs&quot; section, so it would look something like this:

'&quot;Unverified&quot; techniques' is where LILD would go along with any other techniques that would be rated red (and possibly ones that would be rated yellow). --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 20:06, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)


: Everything in &quot;Other techniques&quot; at the moment ''is'' rated red. That's why not much can be written about them - nobody seems to have tried them out. Have you read VILD? VILD is dream incubation. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:46, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

:: I think every technique should be color-coded, including everything in &quot;Other techniques&quot;... if everything in that section is rated red, then I guess everything there could just stay in a list (instead of going in subsections), but I think LILD should be moved there, and a reliability box added to the top of the (&quot;Other techniques&quot;) section. I think we need a dream incubation section, and VILD could be a subsection of that or something... VILD's pretty much just a variation of the dream incubation concept - it just uses dream incubation to try to make it obvious to the dreamer that they're dreaming. I've put up a new list above so VILD's a subsection under &quot;Incubating dreams&quot; (though I think VILD might not show up on the table of contents thing, since it would be a sub-subsection), and &quot;Other techniques&quot; is at the bottom (and has no subsections). --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 15:51, 1 May 2004 (UTC)


By the way, does everyone agree with me about the organization of the &quot;WILDs&quot; section? It'll have a short introduction to Wake-Initiated Lucid Dreams (as opposed to Dream-Initiated Lucid Dreams) that'll also explain the common usage of &quot;WILD&quot; to refer to any technique that induces a WILD, and the basic idea behind all WILD techniques (let your body fall asleep, but keep your brain awake). Under that will be subsections for each different technique of inducing WILDs (the ones currently in the &quot;WILD&quot; section are counting and focusing-on-hypnagogic-imagery, but there are others). Each separate WILD-inducing technique will have it's own reliability box. --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 18:06, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

=== MILD rewrite ===

I noticed that the MILD on this wikibook, the MILD on ld4all.com, just about every other MILD, and the [http://www.lucidity.com/LucidDreamingFAQ2.html#mild MILD in TLI's lucid dreaming FAQ]/EWLD all seem to differ, so I figured we should probably switch to EWLD/Stephen LaBerge's version of MILD seeing as Stephen LaBerge created it. :-) (the MILD on ld4all.com is a lot like the &quot;Autosuggestion technique&quot; in EWLD, which I made another subsection for below this)

This is my draft of a rewritten MILD section (current version on the right for comparison):

{|
| MILD stands for &quot;Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams&quot;, or sometimes, &quot;Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream&quot;. The MILD technique was developed by Stephen LaBerge, and is described fully in his book ''Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming''.

With the MILD technique, as you're falling asleep, you concentrate on your intention to ''remember'' to recognize that you're dreaming. Repeat a short mantra in your head, such as &quot;Next time I'm dreaming, I will remember I'm dreaming.&quot; Think about what this means (that is, that you want to remember that you're dreaming), and imagine that you're back in a dream you've had recently, but this time you recognize that you're dreaming. For example, imagine yourself flying, and realizing that it's a dream because you're flying. Keep repeating and visualizing the mantra until you're sure that your intention's set or you fall asleep. If you stop repeating and visualizing the mantra, then still try to make sure the last thing in your mind before falling asleep is your intention to remember to recognize that you're dreaming.
| MILD stands for &quot;Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams&quot; or sometimes &quot;Mnemonic Induced Lucid Dream&quot;. To avoid confusion, it will be referred to as simply &quot;the MILD technique&quot;. The MILD technique was created by Stephen LaBerge and is described fully in his book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.

In the MILD technique, you simply repeat to yourself a short mantra over and over in your head as you fall asleep, concentrating on its meaning. You also visualise this working. For example, if you want to use the MILD technique to improve dream recall, you might repeat &quot;I will remember what I dream&quot; thinking about what this means, and visualise yourself getting up and going to write something in your dream journal. If you want to use the MILD technique to make you become lucid, you might repeat &quot;I will remember to recognize that I'm dreaming&quot;, think about what this means, and visualise yourself coming to the point in your dream where you become lucid. For example, imagine yourself flying and realizing that it is a dream because you're flying.

Stephen LaBerge recommends a mantra with both &quot;when&quot; and &quot;what&quot; clauses; for example, &quot;when I wake up I will remember what I dreamt.&quot;

'''I kept thinking my mantra and visualising it but it was keeping me awake. What went wrong?'''

You might have not been sleepy enough when you started. It is best for most techniques to start when you are quite sleepy. If you think practising the MILD technique will keep you awake, you can stop after 10-20 minutes and it should still be partly successful.

:: See my response below in the &quot;New autosuggestion section&quot; section.

=== New autosuggestion section ===

The &quot;Autosuggestion technique&quot; in EWLD says to relax completely, and then to &quot;suggest to yourself that you are going to have a lucid dream, either later the same night or on some other night in the near future. Avoid putting intentional effort into your suggestion. [...] Instead, attempt to put yourself in the frame of mind of genuinely expecting that you will have a lucid dream tonight or sometime soon. Let yourself think expectantly about the lucid dream you are about to have. Look forward to it, but be willing to let it happen all in good time.&quot; I think it might also help to add a mantra as long as you don't put intentional effort into it (with the mantra, it would be like [http://www.xs4all.nl/~pasquale/TTM/4/index.html LD4all's adapted MILD (click &quot;Inducing&quot;)]). We could probably just use a modified version of the current MILD section for the autosuggestion section, but I'm not sure if we should include the mantra or not ([[en:autosuggestion|autosuggestion]] doesn't necessarily include a mantra as far as I know). --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 20:06, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: I wouldn't like the site to merely be a &quot;free mini-EWLD&quot; so what we are doing generally (or at least, what I want to do) is taking the intersection of all the common versions of the technique (i.e. finding what is common to many descriptions of the technique) and then explaining varietes &quot;on the side&quot;. Autosuggestion does not sound very different from MILD - in fact, I would say both of them are forms of autosuggestion. Feel free to add this straight to the LD Induction Techniques, either as a variation of MILD or as its own section. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:58, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

:: I think that as far as MILD is concerned, we should use the version created by it's creator. For autosuggestion, I think we should describe how to use [[en:autosuggestion|autosuggestion]] to realize that you're dreaming, whether it's similar to EWLD's &quot;Autosuggestion technique&quot; or not (though it is, as far as I can tell).
:: So, here's the difference between MILD and autosuggestion: With MILD, you set your intention to remember that you're dreaming, and visualize yourself remembering to recognize that you're dreaming. With autosuggestion, you convince yourself that you're about to have a lucid dream. You expect to realize that you're dreaming, and look forward to the dream you're about to have, but you don't put any effortful intention into getting a lucid dream. There ''is'' a pretty major difference between the &quot;effortful intention&quot; of MILD and the &quot;noneffortful suggestion&quot; of autosuggestion. [http://www.lucidity.com/LucidDreamingFAQ2.html#mild MILD (as described by The Lucidity Institute and EWLD/Stephen LaBerge)] doesn't necessarily use a mantra (well it does in TLI's FAQ, but not in EWLD, and a mantra's definately not necessary to remember that you're dreaming (which is the purpose of MILD)), but whether the mantra that's usually included is autosuggestion or not is debatable, I think (you're not really trying to make yourself believe something, just remember something)... Anyway, MILD pretty much has to have something to do with memory, or it wouldn't have &quot;mnemonic&quot; in it's name (I've got you there :-P ). --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 17:10, 1 May 2004 (UTC)

== LILD discussion ==

Hi, I am tapir from LD4all. ''(he added LILD [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]])''

I´d like to say that IMHO kicking everything out that isn´t proven is the wrong way. You´ll end up with a (quite) correct FAQ, but it will be only useful for beginners. Probably it will be basically the same as EWLD, since besides LaBerge there isn´t a lot of scientific studies on lucid dreaming, which means that you can only use techniques for the WIKI that he tested.

Also I think that the way the WIKI is developing right now is a bit &quot;too organized&quot;, since the idea behind WIKIs is rather slow natural grow due to users correcting each other.

What I am trying to say is that any kind of contribution to the WIKI should be kept (if they are on topic ). If they are inaccurate other users will correct them sometime. If they don´t work at all they can perhaps still serve as inspiration for developing other methods. This way the WIKI will also be interesting for advanced lucid dreamers.

The colour system with &quot;useful&quot; and &quot;useless&quot; will ensure that newbies get some orientation and don´t end up confused after reading about thousands of different ways.

just my thoughts,
tapir

: I'm not planning to &quot;kick everything out that isn't proven&quot;. LILD has been around for ages, and nobody seems to have reported it as working. There is also little inherent reason that it should work. Why keep a technique which doesn't work? I don't know exactly what EWLD is like, but the only techniques I know which aren't reported to be in it are VILD, the new CAT technique, and [http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl3503874218d&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=dreams-faq/lucid-dreaming-faq_1080908747%40rtfm.mit.edu&amp;rnum=243 these], although I would not consider most of them techniques.
: &quot;[[en:Wiki#Key characteristics|wiki]]&quot; actually means fast. I understand what you mean about it being &quot;too organised&quot; (although of course I don't think so) so I'll explain all the organisation which appears on this page. The conventions are to make my (and other people's) lives easier, but I don't really mind much if people add stuff which doesn't conform to the style, because somebody else will bring it &quot;in line&quot;. The todo list is for my own use at least; I could never remember so many things. I wouldn't want to remove LILD unless there's a majority that says it should be removed, as it's a pretty major change. The colours below are really the only way we could ever agree on it.
: We don't label things &quot;useless&quot; - if it's useless, why is it there? For all I know, there may be a thousand anecdotes on alt.dreams.lucid of LILD working, but they would be hard to find, because in alt.dreams.lucid LILD means &quot;Letter Induced Lucid Dream&quot;. So it's teetering on the phrase &quot;no anecdotes found&quot;.
: I hope I answered you well. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:15, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

tapir:

Well, naming new techniques really is a problem, I don´t like the &quot;flood of *ILDS&quot; myself. Perhaps it would be easier if all the techniques got a more individual name (like &quot;the chaining technique&quot;).
Anyway, back on the LILD topic. EWLD is &quot;exploring the world of lucid dreaming&quot; by Stephen LaBerge. Actually I think either in this book or in one from Tholey there is an anecdote about LILD that works, and one of the LD4all users was very close to success (He managed to tell a dream character to meet up with him again. The DC walked up to him the next night and told him that it´s a dream, yet the dreamer just didn´t believe his DC)
Anyways, even if that doesn´t count and we assume that noone reports LILD to be working, there are IMHO three reasons to keep it anyway (or any other technique like it, I think this is more general problem than just wether we want to keep LILD or not):

# There aren´t that many reports of LILD not working either. Perhaps it just hasn´t been tested a lot so far but will prove useful in the future?
# Uncommon, yet unreliable techniques can inspire new ideas. Perhaps someone can come up with a variation on LILD that works better after he read about it?
# If LILD is removed, perhaps in some weeks someone else is going to write about it again since he thinks he has got a new idea. If he can read about it here this won´t happen.

Well, these are the reasons not to remove it. But, what are the reasons to remove it? Server space surely isn´t the problem. This leaves &quot;it gets more difficult to find the reliable techniques&quot; as far as I can see. This problem can easily be solved by making two (or more) sections, one for tested and useful techniques and one for those which are either unreliable or rather ideas.
tapir

: I also hate the &quot;flood of -ILDs&quot; but to rename techniques would mean to deviate from the norm and making the book harder to read for people who already know something about these techniques. Some people might ask questions like &quot;What's the difference between conciously entering the dream state and WILD?&quot;.
: I would appreciate it if you tried to find that forum anecdote you mentioned.

# Have you seen [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]]? There is not much reason for this technique to work.
# Again, I don't see any possible variations of LILD (OK, maybe other people will)
# I hadn't thought of that.

: No, [[m:Wiki is not paper|not server space]], but if a scientist sees this and realises the basis of the technique (again, see [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]]) they would consider the whole wikibook to be of less value.

tapir:

here is what &quot;Imagine&quot; wrote some time ago:

I've done that before. I asked this little kid with purple hair if she could tell me I was dreaming next time. She said she would. So a couple of nights later, she walked up to me and said &quot;You're dreaming you know.&quot;

I don't think I remembered her, so for some reason I said &quot;Yeah, right. Why would I trust a kid with purple hair?&quot; And then she stuck her tongue out at me and ran away. I was SO mad at myself when I woke up. She did come back later though, and I can't exactly remember, it was really blurry, but I did get lucid from her. I guess that would be a LILD. I never knew there was such a thing.
(from [http://www.ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3121&amp;start=0&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;highlight=lild])

Well, of course Daniel Love is right when he says that techniques shouldn´t be presented as working without being tested, that would discredit whe WIKI. Yet with a short note like &quot;yet untested&quot; or in section for unconfirmed techniques it´s a totally different thing. Mentioning unconfirmed techniques contributes to the WIKIs amount of information if they are labeled as such.

Another thing:

Of course LILD is a placebo, that´s the very nature of the technique. It´s some sort of controlled placebo though. Saying that LILD is a placebo is correct (unless you believe in dream characters being independant beings), but similiar to saying auto-suggestion is a placebo.

: [[en:Autosuggestion|Autosuggestion]] is not a placebo - it's a mild and easy form of hypnosis. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 17:51, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

I totally and completely disagree.
I want to make this book as easy to read as possible for people that don't know anything about lucid dreaming.

== lucid dreaming -- an illusion? ==

Someone one
http://www.diyplanner.com/node/302
makes the claim that people never really have lucid dreams.
They only have perfectly ordinary dreams,
with no conscious control.
Then later, in the half-awake state while waking up,
they re-assemble fragments of the dream in ways that
give the illusion of having had a lucid dream.

If even a small minority of psychologists really believe this &quot;lucid dreaming is an illusion&quot; theory, then (under [[w:NPOV]]) I think it's worth mentioning somewhere in this book.

I find it odd that this person seems to be simultaneously claiming &quot;lucid dreams don't really exist. They are unimportant.&quot; and also &quot;Ignore those people who claim dreams are unimportant. Dreams are so critically important that you should try to remember every one in a journal&quot;.

I vaguely remember a television show trying to scientifically test this theory.
As you know, REM sleep stands for &quot;rapid eye movement&quot;.
The researchers asked the volunteer to look up-down-up-down-up-down-up-down-up-down (5 times) and clap as soon as the dream became lucid.

I wish I could remember what the clapping thing was about, and the outcome of the experiment.
Do any of you remember that, or have pointers to even better experiments?

== LILD Update ==

I added this section in the discussion because everything else seems to be at least a year old.  Anyhow, I added a few paragraphs to LILD.  It's my favorite and easiest method of inducing lucid dreaming.  It's rather difficult to set up, but you only need to do it once.  Not sure why everyone here says it's useless.  I use it all the time.  Well, I'm a big fan of feedback, so comments are welcome... --[[User:Cleos|Cleo]] 09:57, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

hmmm... double post...  Actually, I've reread my section and some parts are a little confusing.  The main idea I'm trying to convey is that using associative technique while lucid dreaming is key to making it undeniable, next time you're dreaming (normally), to your subconscious that you are in fact dreaming.  The thing that you associated while in lucid dreaming only exists in lucid dreams.  Therefore, the ideas or thoughts that will come to mind are literally &quot;dreams&quot; and then it should &quot;click&quot;.  However, even here I cannot quite express this idea clearly.  Anyone know how to reword it to make it clearer or convey this key concept?  --[[User:Cleos|Cleo]] 11:50, 18 October 2005 (UTC)

== Tattoos and other dedicated objects ==

One technique that I discovered inadvertently was to constantly check my tattoos (in this case, on my wrists). Apparently they are simple enough that my dream often interprets them as random symbols. I usually find this appropriately odd enough to realize that I am dreaming.

Along those lines, often holding an object during sleep on a very regular basis can cause my dream self to appear with it (or can be summoned by thinking about it, presumably from the fact that my hand is, in reality, clutching it). For those wanting to enter the dreamworld properly armed, a knife works very well in this respect, though one must be careful that it isn't very sharp. The presence of a real object in a dream acts as a very effective anchor, especially in nightmares, where they seem to resist the opposing force. It can be a very good feeling to &quot;win&quot; a nightmare. [[User:128.223.209.123|128.223.209.123]] 03:28, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

== Reality checks: technology ==

I've noticed that technology does not behave well in dreams, especially &quot;black box&quot; technology, where the inner workings are hidden (as in a watch) or are electronic.  This encompasses several of the listed techniques: Light Switch and Time.  I think that the complex and/or hidden workings of modern technology are too much for the primitive &quot;physics simulator&quot; used in dreams.  I would propose adding either a note or another reality check module. -- [[User:Phyzome|Phyzome]] 00:17, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

:IMO, Time is more similar to Reading - each time you look at the symbols on a digital clock or in piece of text, you see something different. [[User:Sourcejedi|Sourcejedi]] 17:53, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

== My experiences ==
My method of lucid dreaming has always been by attempting to keep my concious mind active as my body sinks into sleep. If I'm not tired at all, I will usually only end up in a deep state of relaxation, or if TOO tired, will lose my the active state of conciousness and fall deep asleep. But if everything is just right, I will start to feel that threshold of crossing over into sleep on a slightly concious level.. I do a reality check by moving my arms while I am sleeping and aware they are next to me... (my slightly concsious mind can feel the extreme heaviness of them) when I am can freely move my arms (and yet know they are next to me) I sort of &quot;jump&quot; into dreamland. so peculiar of a method, but the only way that it really works for me. When I realize I'm dreaming without inducing it THIS way, I typically forget really quickly and go back into normal dreamworld. Sometimes I can do the spinning thing too while at this point and it will send me into lucidity.. helps keep me from jumping awake too somehow if I feel like I'm about to.

*note: I was just reading through the page again and noted the Tibetan method.. This is how I induce lucidity I believe. I can sleep while aware, but no visuals etc. my body is heavy and extremely relaxed. at some point I can suddenly *move* though while I know my body is heavy and sleeping and I jump into lucid dreaming*

== RCs: Extremely important? ==

The section on reality checks seems to present them as though they are absolutely necessary to have lucid dreams. However, people have had lucid dreams long before Stephen LaBerge developed the reality testing technique. Also, WILDs are examples of lucid dreams induced without reality checking. While reality testing is a good way fir people who have never had lucid dreams before to get started, it is not necessary to induce lucid dreaming. I think this section could be improved by making this clear. '''[[User:Exabyte|Exabyte]]''' ([[User_talk:Exabyte|talk]]) 01:49, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

== Possible Semantics and Contradiction Errors ==

(Orthography and Syntax left out on purpose...those need no discussion, you just fix them, right? :)

=== about the water-drinking-or-not section ===

I did not get the idea of the sentences, or there is a contradiction to be fixed there:
&quot;If you have trouble getting to sleep in the first place, don't drink water for about an hour before you think you'll turn your lights off. In fact, do drink water an hour before, to stop you from getting thirsty later on.&quot;. The most confusing part is the &quot;In fact&quot; part, wich one usually interprets as preceding a reason that validates the prior sentence.

Maybe you just wanted to propose two solutions to two different problems. In that case, things could be fixed by changing the second sentence to something like &quot;If you think you will be thirsty later on, drink some water before going to bed.&quot;. But that wouldn't solve this weird thought that would come to mind to many: What if i do have trouble getting to sleep, therefore i don't drink water, therefore i will be thirsty, therefore i should drink water :)

Another idea: how about simply naming possible problems, and letting the reader solve them for himself. &quot;Be sure to minimize the possibility of ocurrence of anything that would wake you up, like need to go to the bathroom, thirst, hunger, telephone calls, bad body position, etc&quot;
-Francisco.

Mabye it is ment as in &quot;[...] don't drink water an hour before you go to bed. but you should drink something an hour before *that* (i.e. two hours before you go to bed) to prevent you from getting thirsty later (when you aren't supposed to drink anymore)&quot; ... ?

== About tinnitus ==

I'm under the impression that, indeed, everyone has a measure of tinnitus and other stray signals in their hearing. The brain blocks them out in normal life. Changes in the organs (ear infection) or other damage (excess sound pressure) can cause change that the brain can't interpret as permanent, leading to tinnitus or a constant &quot;ringing&quot; in the ears.

One of the things that my doctor stressed is that you should ignore any sound in case new ringing seems to persist and absolutely not learn to listen to it. It will become an actively recognized and audible effect. I would very much caution against trying to find the sounds that the brain is supposed to ignore. This may have unwanted lasting effects.

^fucking retarded statement. Blades is right. Tinnitus is not to be trifled with. Strongly advise against this stupid method. [[Special:Contributions/213.107.5.93|213.107.5.93]] ([[User talk:213.107.5.93|discuss]]) 11:31, 17 September 2012 (UTC)

My personal experience with Tinnitus:  When I am in total silence for some time I begin to hear Tinnitus.  The first time this happened was many years ago and I didn't know what it was I was hearing, so I tried to listen to it.  It grew extremely loud.  Then, I turned on a TV, and as soon as the silence was broken the Tinnitus stopped.  Since then I have been able to hear it in total silence, but there do not seem to be any adverse effects on my hearing.  [[User:Fountain Pen|Fountain Pen]] ([[User talk:Fountain Pen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Fountain Pen|contribs]]) 18:17, 2 January 2013 (UTC)

I tried to use this method a few times. And a couple days ago I began to hear it without trying to, and now I'm hearing it when I go to sleep, and I can't get rid of it. I very much caution people not to use this method. It's even beginning to invade my time awake, in fact I'm hearing it right now. And there's nothing I can really do about it... :(    (The best I've managed is to try to just accept the fact that I may have Tinnitus for some time now, if not for the rest of my life. I'm still a bit distressed that I even attempted this, but once you accept something as a part of your life, it's not quite as bad.) --[[Special:Contributions/75.165.7.88|75.165.7.88]] ([[User talk:75.165.7.88|discuss]]) 21:11, 22 February 2013 (UTC)

== Never explains how to actually DO it ==

This page provides a lot of info, but it's a real baggy monster to be honest. It's not brought together very well in a way that explains anything to a newcomer. For instance, if reality checks are the &quot;key&quot; to lucid dreaming, why is that? How are they used? What's the purpose?

How do you actually induce a lucid dream!? --[[User:86.5.99.130|86.5.99.130]] 01:11, 1 August 2007 (UTC)

: I believe it does explain it: One way or another (!) you end up in a moment in a dream where you realise you are dreaming. This could be a failed reality check or you could recognize a scene you've been in (in a dream!) before or some surreal feature like a person of the wrong age etc. That is lucidity. From there, you may or may not succeed in manipulating the dream actively. [[User:Blades|Blades]] 09:44, 26 October 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I can see my nose with one eye closed, right now.
Currently *some* of these reality check questions have a &quot;yes&quot; answer if you are dreaming (&quot;When you jump, do you float back down?&quot;), while others have a &quot;yes&quot; answer if you are awake (&quot;Can you see your nose with one eye closed?&quot;, &quot;Does a light switch work?&quot;).
Would it be better if we re-write those questions so they all have a consistent &quot;yes&quot; answer if you are dreaming?

== Drugs section = pointless ==

I am a frequent drug user, especially psychedelics and dissacociatives, so I know what I am talking about when I say this:
None of those drugs produce results similar to a lucid dream, except DMT and Salvia, but that is still very slight. Second, &quot;Ayahuasca&quot; and &quot;DMT&quot; is essentially redundant: Ayahuasca is a mixture of drugs, primarily relying on DMT, not a drug in itself. Also, you list just the drugs themselves, when you could list the chemicals. Further more, these are not induction techniques- they may produce a similar state (actually, like I said earlier, far from it) but they do not actually HELP you lucid dream, in any way, not even close, which is why they should be removed from here. -[[User:PoisonedV|PoisonedV]] ([[User talk:PoisonedV|talk]])

:I agree with your remarks and your proposal, nevertheless it should be said that dissociative experiences seem to be cumulative, that is the more you experience disassociation the easier it becomes to experience it again, there seems to be a link or effect similar to a memory or learning process. I have no experience in drugs but have researched the subject as well as hypnosis and psychology. The frame of mind and expectations will ultimately be a major point to how any mind-state evolves or is transformed.

== Most Potential for Improvement ==

From what I've seen so far, the most important thing to improve this book is trying to consolidate all these contradicting statements into something coherent.  I just, as some may notice, finished editing parts of it heavily, creating something much more readable, yet I did not make any actual changes to the information content, only its presentation.  The way it is currently written, it is excessively clear that there are several authors who disagree widely; it needs to morph into an authoritative guide which shows no preference to either view of these various methods.  Make clear what is a potential positive and what is a potential negative, and hopefully understand that people are different and different approaches will work for different people.

Here's a problem: it's one thing to write encyclopedia articles collaboratively.  They are usually on specific, narrowly-focused topics, and it is clear what they require.  Books, and even textbooks, by contrast, are very personal.  There are thousands of ways to write an English composition textbook, or a textbook on C programming, or on physics.  (That's why there ''are'' thousands of such textbooks.)  What reason is there to think that any sufficiently knowledgeable person will want to put in the many, many hours required to write a textbook when he or she has to collaborate with others who do not share his or her understanding of what the book should look like?  What would motivate anyone capable of developing a good textbook to do so with random strangers instead of either by him- or herself, or with trusted colleagues?

An answer: A Wikibook probably shouldn't expect to follow the traditional model of motivating a single author or two to write an entire book.  It seems more practical for multiple authors to supply various modules while one or two editors massage the overall book into a consistent style.  That way there's not too much load on any one person's shoulders.

:That works ''[[w:de jure|de jure]]''. ''[[w:De facto|De facto]]'', there are not nearly enough editors to do this. Currently we have only about 1 to 2 editors per book average, and they do all the work. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 02:29, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)




''3 October 2005:''

A missing concept:  I've been perusing the various Wikimedia projects looking for a suitable forum to collaborate on the creation of new knowledge.  The Wikipedia clearly is inappropriate - it addresses that which is history or known to be true.  Wikisource explicitly excludes original works of authorship.  Wikibooks seems to confine itself to the narrow concept of a textbook, and the answer to the objection raised above implies the persona of the creator of a body of knowledge or work of authorship, or at least the explication of a body of knowledge, is unimportant.  Wikisource, in contrast acknowledges this importance, and embraces the concept of &quot;completion&quot; by locking pages once typography and formatting are correct.

''Creation of new knowledge is happening at [[Wikipedia:Wikicities|Wikicities]], [http://metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml the Metaweb], [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki the original wiki], and many [http://wikiindex.org/ other wiki].''

I submit that the concept of a book embraces more than the greater depth and breadth of content when compared to an encyclopedia.  A book is an expression of a personal perception of truth or the union of a limited number of such personal perceptions, and the persona(e) of the author(s) is part and parcel of that expression.  You can not anonymize Shakespeare, or Einstein, or Hemingway, or Dylan Thomas, or Buckminster Fuller, or any of the other well known and seminal historical contributors to human knowledge and culture.  Why then should future contributors be clothed in gray uniforms and anonymous faces?  Is such anonymity even possible in an original work?  With books, there is such a thing as saying &quot;there, now it is done, complete&quot;.  Some single individual must have the authority to say it.

''I was under the impression that some very significant contributions were made anonymously -- such as the [[Wikipedia:Federalist Papers|Federalist Papers]]. I think that wiki allows people to contribute anonymously, if they should so choose, and also allows people to put their name on the book as one of its editors.''

''I would like to point out that the books of the Bible, the Iliad and the Odyssey, Gilgamesh, the Vedas, and many other works far superior to Shakespeare or Hemingway are anonymous.''  

Wikibooks clearly does not provide such a tool, so I will suggest here what might be done to improve Wikibooks, or perhaps establish a new wiki project to address the needs.  To begin with I give a simple list of requirements for me to participate:

1) Copy left is essential - I have no interest in conventional publishers, or proprietary exclusion of readers.

''Wikibooks has this -- check.''

2) A project format, where the initiator of a book is the principal Author/Editor/Administrator of that book.

''I think there are already several Wikibooks that each have one person who declares himself the principle editor of that book.''

3) A tiered editing environment:

a) the first tier is a traditional wiki - this facilitates contributions by geographically scattered authors - a meeting place.

b) the second tier is by invitation of the principal author - this allows the principal author to &quot;edit&quot; the contributors - excluding cranks and people with an incompatible approach.  No harm is done - they can become principal author of another book derived from the first tier as a starting point.  Tier 2 is not locked, but is protected by the principal author and his or her selected cadre of collaborators.

c) the third tier is a complete book - locked against modification, but subject to peer review, which may include those who had been excluded from contributing by the principal author.  Peer review provides a markup mechanism for the benefit of the principal author.  The principal author may incorporate or disregard markups at his or her discretion.

d) the fourth tier is release of the complete book combined with a wikireview mechanism, permitting readers to evaluate and rank what they read, so future readers may easily cull their selections.  The released book, like Wikisource, is locked.

''While we all agree that this intellectually sounds like it should work, Wikipedia already tried a tiered editing environment ([[Wikipedia:Nupedia|Nupedia]]) -- and it didn't work. While I certainly am in favor of improving Wikibooks, &quot;it sounds like it would work better&quot; is irrelevant in the face of experimental evidence that it actually works worse. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 20:28, 25 October 2005 (UTC)''

4) I like to read in comfortable quiet places.  To facilitate this, I download PDFs and read offline.  A true wiki book would have considerable length, and would be available for download for the convenience of the reader.  This, together with the originality of the works, makes the medium akin to a bookstore - an amalgam of a copy left publisher and a bookseller, where the price is always zero.

''Wikibooks already support this point 4. For example, all the various modules of &lt;s&gt;the &quot;Computer_Science:Algorithms&quot; book: moved to&lt;/s&gt; the &quot;[[Algorithms]]&quot; book are all gathered together (using transclusion) into one long book at &lt;s&gt;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_Science:Algorithms:Full_Text : moved to&lt;/s&gt; &quot;[[Algorithms/Print version]]&quot; .'' &lt;s&gt;(That page is broken.)&lt;/s&gt;

What I am proposing is not radical - it is the essential environment of an academic collaboration.  It differs in that it is unencumbered by the necessity of signing away ones ownership rights, and, more significantly, in that it provides a means for people with common interests, who have never met, and who might never be able to meet, to productively collaborate, while excluding unwanted interference.



''4 October 2005:''

In addition to making some minor clarifications and correcting some typographical errors in the above text, I wish to address a few additional issues which occurred to me overnight (the URL of this contribution is different, because I am on a different machine - I am, however, the author of the 3 October text).


Wikiversity:

While I am aware that the formation of Wikiversity is nascent, and necessarily incompletely formed, it is interesting to me to note that the defining characteristics of Wikiversity are at present a caricature of the essential purpose of a university, namely the pursuit of truth.  This necessarily begins with the study of what is already known, which may be accomplished in a rudimentary fashion merely by reading in an encyclopedia, for example the Wikipedia.  It does not take long for this approach to become inadequate, and so we have textbooks, which serve as more focussed guides to those seeking understanding.  Wikibooks was apparently created to address this need.  But anyone serious about learning soon discovers textbooks are at best so much more wastepaper - glib, incomplete, and often misleading if not downright wrong.

So it is that the scholar inevitably takes his mission to a library, seeking a diversity of perspectives from a diversity of authors, in order to form his or her own perception of the truth.  Wikisource does not qualify as a library because it excludes new works, and has no mechanism for including access to copyrighted material.

An eventuality that happens sooner for some than others, is that even the library is inadequate, and so the scholar strikes out on his or her own, expressing new ideas in scholarly journals (all of which are encumbered by onerous copyright restrictions), or book length original works of authorship.

Much of the current activity in developing Wikiversity seems to be concerned with testing, grading, and certification.  All of these activities are irrelevant to the pursuit of truth, designed primarily to serve as barriers to encumber those who merely seek power.  History has show us that these barriers have mixed effectiveness.  To emulate such nonsense in the comparatively level playing field of the web strikes me as misguided at best.


Neutral POV:

While neutral POV is admirable for an encyclopedia entry, it is inappropriate for a book.  A book is a focussed and elaborate expression of a point of view.  In areas such as mathematics or science, that point of view is not necessarily an opinion.  More often, it is a logical edifice, founded upon a small set of axioms or empirical data, which may be arbitrarily chosen.  It is an elaboration of an abstraction of the author's experience and understanding.  Requiring such an expression to be neutral undermines the purpose of pedagogy (the apparent purpose of a textbook), and utterly defeats the purpose of original authorship.


Free Access:

The historical case of [[w:Oliver Heaviside|Oliver Heaviside]] serves as a good example of how an improved wikibooks might shine.  Heaviside was an uneducated outsider, whose original works were only able to find publication in serial form in a commercial magazine called &quot;The Electrician&quot;.  Heaviside's contributions to electrical engineering and mathematics were seminal and are now universally accepted.  Is it not one of the fundamental purposes of Wikimedia to provide every human being with access to information, without exclusion?  Isn't part of the philosophy of the wiki to enable every human to participate, without undue barriers, and to allow the readership to determine what endures?  How many Oliver Heavisides have been crushed into obscurity by exclusionary policies?  Do not the uniform policies of Wikimedia excluding original works in all of its venues constitute an exclusionary policy?       


Vanity, Personal Autonomy, and Personal Responsibility:

An immediate objection to the ideas I am proposing will no doubt be the policy against vanity.  It is agreed that vanity is an offensive human quality, but the issue of authorship is deeper than that.  At the root of it are the founding concepts of a wiki: personal autonomy and personal responsibility.

It is personal autonomy that gives the wiki its power - everyone is equally accepted without undue suppression of contributions.  But it is personal responsibility that holds autonomy in check - the perpetration of vandalism for example is limited to those few individuals who do not yet understand they are responsible for what they do.  Were it not so, the problem of vandalism would be intractable.

Authorship, and its formal acknowledgment is nothing more than an abstraction of responsibility.  If you write a book length tract of text, you are, for better or worse, responsible for it.  It is authorship which holds you accountable, and such accountability is not vanity, for it is a sword which can cut both ways.

'''Baking''' is cooking food in an [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] with dry heat applied evenly throughout the oven and is synonymous with [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]]. Although it is common in some cultures to use the term baking for the so-called baked-goods, such as [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]s, [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]]s and [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastries]], and 'roasting' for other foods, such as meats and vegetables, the terms can also be used interchangeably.

The dry heat of baking causes the outside of the food to brown or char, giving it an attractive appearance and pleasing taste. The browning is caused by caramelization of sugars and is the result of the Maillard reaction. Despite common misconceptions about the browning process, moisture is never entirely sealed into the food. Over time an item being baked will continue to lose moisture. This can be an advantage, especially in situations where drying is the desired outcome, for example in drying [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|herbs]] or in roasting certain types of [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]]s. Where drying is not desired, a protective layer of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], or, in the case of breads and pastries, [[Cookbook:Egg Wash|egg wash]], can slow the loss of moisture as well as providing flavor and additional browning. Alternatively, some foods are replenished with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid (such as water or [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]]) in the bottom of the pan and letting it steam up into or around the food.

# 'Dharma' is that invincible power of nature which upholds existence. It maintains evolution and forms the very basis of cosmic life. It supports all that is helpful for evolution and discourages all that is opposed to it.
# Dharma is that which promotes worldly prosperity and spiritual free-dom. In order to understand the role of dharma in life, we have to consider the mechanics of evolution.
# When life evolves from one state to another, the first state is dissolved and the second brought into existence. In other words, the process of evolution is carried out under the influence of two opposing forceone to destroy the first state and the other to give rise to a second state. These creative and destructive forces working in harmony with one another maintain life and spin the wheel of evolution. Dharma maintains equilibrium between them. By maintaining equilibrium between opposing cosmic forces, dharma safe-guards existence and upholds the path of evolution, the path of righteousness.
# Mas life is so highly evolved that he enjoys freedom of action in nature. This enables him to live in any way he of pain and suffering. desires, either for good or for evil. As he behaves, so he receives. When the good increases in life and the positive forces tend to overbalance the normal state of existence, then the process of dharma, restoring equilibrium, results in feelings of happiness in the heart and satisfaction in the mind. In the same way, when evil increases in life and the negative forces predominate, the power of dharma, restoring the balance, produces sensations.
# Life is as we want ieither suffering or joy. When we allow the positive and negative forces to remain in their normal state of equilibrium, we live through normal periods of life. Assisting the growth of negative forces results in suffering; when we help the positive forces to increase we share the joy of lifeAs you sow, so shall you rea, expresses the role of dharma in practical life.
# Calamities, crises and catastrophes in a community or country are caused by the increase of negative forces resulting from the evil deeds of a majority of their people. A high degree of concentration of negative forces, without positive forces to balance them, ends in suffering and destruction of life. Similarly, a high degree of concentration of positive forces fails to maintain life in its normal state. The life of an individual under the influence of increasing positive forces enters into a field of increasing happiness and is eventually transformed into bliss-consciousness, in which state it gains the status of cosmic existence, eternal life.
# In this way, we find that the increase of negative forces ends in passivity or extinction of life, whereas the increase of positive forces results in life eternal. Our individual life moves backwards and forwards automatically as we direct it under the influence of dharma. Positive and negative forces, as we develop them, play their role on the field of dharma and shape the destiny of life.
# The two armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas on the battlefield of Kurukshetra represent the negative and positive forces on the field of dharma. This is what made Dhritarashtra say: 'Assembled on the field of Dharma, on the field of the Kuru.'
# Dhritarashtra, as an old experienced head of the royal family, knows that the battlefield of Kurukshetra lying within the Dharmakshetra, the land between the rivers Yamuna and Saraswati, always maintains its sanctity and brings victory tothe righteous.
# He is anxious to hear details of the happenings and curious to find out whether the good influence of the land has had any effect on the destructive tendencies of his evil-minded sons; or whether it stimulated the righteousness of the Pandavas and encouraged them to forgive the evildoers.
# This is the only time that Dhritarashtra speaks in the text of the Bhagavad-Gita. He only appears in order to ask this question. The 'Kuru' are the members of the Kuru family, a leading clan of the timeThe field of the Kuru is a vast plain near Hastinapur in the neighborhood of Delhi. As it belonged to the Kurus at the time of this battle it is called Kurukshetra.
# 'My people and the Pandavas': Dhritarashtra was the blind king of the Kuru family. His younger brother Pandu was managing the affairs of the kingdom for him. When Pandu died, Dhritarashtra wanted to give the reins of the kingdom to Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu, who was called Dharmaraj, the embodiment of righteousness, for his noble qualities; but Duryodhana, the eldest of the hundred evil-minded sons of Dhritarashtra, by trick and treachery secured the throne for himself and began attempting to destroy Yudhishthira and his four brothers.
# Lord Krishna, as head of the Yadava clan, tried to bring about a reconciliation between the cousins; but when all his attempts failed and the treachery of Duryodhana continued and increased, war between the Kauravas and Pandavas became inevitable. It brought kings and warriors from all over the globe to take sides, according to the level of their consciousness, with the righteous Pandavas or the evil-minded Kauravas. The good and evil of the whole world formed the two armies. Lord Krishns main mission, which was to destroy evil and give protection to righteousness, had been simplified.
# 'Sanjaya' is the charioteer of the blind king Dhritarashtra. The word, however, means one who has conquered the senses and the mind. Sanjaya was asked to narrate the details of the battle because he was clairvoyant and clairaudient and at the same time impartial. The whole of the Bhagavad-Gita is Sanjaya's answer to Dhritarashtra.&lt;/td&gt;

This should get a mention, no?  A problem with the rejection of the axiomic approach on the basis of the axioms being seemingly arbritrary is that it doesn't take into account that they are selected by being the simplest that offer the fullest explanation of observations.

&quot;principle of falsificationism&quot;? &quot;principle of falsification&quot;, surely? [[User:MrJones|MrJones]] 09:22, 1 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Removed text ==
&quot;Widely discredited is the thoery stating that there is no reason to think of science as a better source of knowledge about the universe compared with any other vision of the world. This has the disadvantage of putting theories such as Wiccanism, which although no doubt spiritually satisfying has little to offer on genetics.&quot;

Not that I'm an exceptionally big fan of Wiccanism (which, incidentally, isn't a theory but a religion), but it isn't supposed to offer any information on genetics, physics, neurobiology, or any other branch of natural science.  It describes the universe in different terms, comes to different conclusions, etc.  Anyhow, I don't know of anyone who has suggested that, say, a particular branch of science and a particular religion are on par with one-another in terms of their ability to describe the same sorts of things.  What most philosophers who go on and on about how no one method is privileged over another are talking about is how, given systems of thought that describe different sorts of things, we can't say for sure which gives us knowledge of the universe *as it is*.  What we can say for sure is how each helps and hinders us.  Thus science, which is not spiritually satisfying, which gives us no answers about how we may have come to be, which makes no moral or ethical claims, is not necessarily priviliged over, say, Pentecostalism, which does cover all these topics.  This has not been &quot;widely discredited&quot;.

Also, &quot;This has the disadvantage of putting theories such as Wiccanism, which although no doubt spiritually satisfying has little to offer on genetics.&quot; is not a sentence.  I'd edit it, but I'm not quite sure what is being said.

&quot;Other problems that continue to persist include fashions and politics that can both advance and detract from science, Lysenko and the theory (that environmental factors can affect genes) that replaced genetics for many years in the Soviet Union being the foremost of these.&quot;

Are these problems for science or problems for the philosophy of science?

:The above parts about Wiccanism, fasion, and politics were removed because they were unclear. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 15:19, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)


==Too much included under Karl Popper==
Though many others are often mentioned in the same breath as Popper in discussion, is it a good idea to completely include all mention of them under the Popper section?
Kuhn and the rest should receive their own section, as their thoughts aren't solely dependent on those of Popper. [[User:Smegs|Smegs]] 22:31, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

The '''Guardians''' is another name for [[../Sensing/]] [[../Judging|Judgers]]. There are four personality types that fall into this category: [[../ESTJ/]], [[../ESFJ/]], [[../ISTJ/]], and [[../ISFJ/]].

==Personality==
This type is conservative and hardworking, values responsibility and service to others, is serious, trustworthy, and diligent, focused on duty and getting the job done, adheres to traditional values and dress, and is slow to accept new ideas. The SJ has a strict idea of how things should be done and frowns on deviation from it.

==Profession==
SJs make up the greatest part of the management of business organizations. Their attention to detail and preference to make decisions quickly lend well to the structure of larger organizations.

==Communication==
Guardians are polite and straightforward, respectful and more formal than the other temperaments. They talk in an unadorned way and include facts and precise details rather than generalizations.

==Appearance==
SJs dress neatly and conservatively but don't focus on current trends. They tend to have good posture and walk briskly.

==Hobbies==
Handcrafts, collecting things (especially antiques), volunteerism, sports, jogging, and participation in service organizations.

The &quot;Artisan&quot; is another name for the '''[[../Sensing/]] [[../Perceiving/|Perceiver]]'''. This includes the four types [[../ESTP/]], [[../ESFP/]], [[../ISTP/]], [[../ISFP/]]. About 30% of people are classified as Artisans. Barbra Streisand, Elvis Presley, Franklin Roosevelt, and Clint Eastwood are all examples of Artisans.

==Personality==
The '''Artisan''' is typically quite playful, tends to live in the moment, have fun, get along easily with people, and be carefree and easy-going. He/She is impulsive and seeks the next experience or adventure. This person does not spend much time planning or philosophizing, preferring to take spontaneous action. He/She can gravitate toward risky activities. They love keeping their friends happy and will often challenge them to contests of skill such as video games or physical challenges, &quot;Race you to the playground!&quot;.

==Profession==
They are the artists of the society, the performers. Artisans tend to dislike too many rules and gravitate towards hands-on professions and hobbies involving tools or crafts.

==Communication==
Their speaking style is simple and concrete. They don't use many methaphors and like to gesticulate. Body language expresses more.

==Appearance==
SPs tend to dress casually and in sporty apparel. As sensors, SPs are aware of the colors and textures of their clothes but sometimes may appear messy.  Some SPs love to feel good-looking and stylish, but still comfortable.

==Hobbies==
Working on cars, extreme sports, woodworking and gardening are common SP hobbies.
SPs may also like painting, music and the fine arts if they have an artistic streak.

The '''Idealist''' is the same as the [[../Intuitive]] [[../Feeling|Feeler]] and includes the following four personality types: [[../ENFJ/]], [[../ENFP/]], [[../INFJ/]], and [[../INFP/]]. Idealists are one of the rarest types of personality, the other being the Rationals. Famous Idealists include Princess Diana, Eleanor Roosevelt, Mohandas Gandhi, and Mikhael Gorbachev.

==Personality==
Idealists are the Diplomats. They spend their whole lives searching for their unique identity. The idealist prefers to think abstractly about the future and how issues will affect the people around him. S/he is more focused on the intangibles than the nitty-gritty of daily life, so s/he may appear detached or in another world. Unfortunately for the idealist, gracefulness and body awareness are not his/her natural gift and s/he is more likely than not to be less adept at sports or other activities that require high body awareness. If an idealist is skilled at sports it is most likely to be from training rather than natural ability.

==Profession==
NFs flee from corporate management and gravitate towards helping professions where they can contribute to society and humanity, such as teaching, counseling, politics, and the clergy. Their individualism could lead to careers that focus on personal growth and development, and journalistic work appeals to their idealism and truth-seeking.

==Communication==
NFs are generally good communicators. Idealists can be indirect in speech and use metaphors or analogies to make points. Rather than talking about things in an objective way, they key in more to the reactions that people have to what they are saying and how the topics relate to their own feelings and values. They talk about relationships, values, and intangibles.

==Appearance==
The iNtuitive in the idealist makes him less fixed on personal appearance. NFs are unconventional and at times even artsy, and wear clothing that communicates their values, which may lead them to appear more like hippies than court-ready lawyers. If a [[../Judging|Judger]], the NF will take more care of his appearance than if a [[../Perceiving|Perceiver]].

==Hobbies==
 
Travel, reading, music, cinema, poetry, History, Philosophy, Literature, Art History, art appreciation, photography, television and Internet surfing.

The Rational is another name for the [[../Intuitive/]] [[../Thinking/]]. This includes four personality types: the [[../ENTJ/]], [[../ENTP/]], [[../INTJ/]], and [[../INTP/]]. About 15% of the population are Rationals. Some of the most famous Rationals were Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Personality==
The Rational is more comfortable thinking in the abstract, doing so in an analytical, objective way. As an iNtuitive, the NT is not particularly given to sports.

==Profession==
This temperament is the quintessential professor, living in academia and in his or her own deep thoughts about something or other.

==Communication==
The Rational tends to be roundabout in explanations and may not be very aware of how others feel.

==Appearance==
This temperament often ignores rules of fashion, having more important things to concern themselves with, preferring function over all else.  It is not uncommon for a [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator/Perceiving|Perceiving]] NT to neglect personal hygiene.  Many Perceivers will not hesitate to walk around naked.  If a [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator/Judging|Judger]], the NT will take more care of his or her appearance.  A number of Judgers tend to have an asexual look.

==Hobbies==
Studying self-improvement, learning about new things or languages....

[[Image:Bakken.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wok]]

A '''wok''' is a versatile Chinese cooking utensil.

It is a round-bottomed pan that ranges from 1 foot to 4 feet (300&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;1200&amp;nbsp;mm) in diameter.
Almost every Chinese family owns one. It is most often used for [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-frying]], but can also be used many other ways, such as in [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]] and [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep frying]] or to make [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]. One advantage of woks is that the shape produces a small, hot area at the bottom while using relatively little fuel.

Woks are also sold in western countries, where they tend to be given flat bottoms and non-stick coatings. This makes them more similar to a deep [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] than a true wok. However, the flat bottoms mean that they can be used on an electric range.

===Seasoning===
Carbon steel woks need to be seasoned before use. This is somewhat different from seasoning [[Cookbook:Cast iron|cast iron]], but it is for the same purpose -- to provide a non-stick coating and prevent rust from forming on the cooking surface. The exact procedure for this is something of an art, but in a nutshell:

* You will need a gas stove or some source of intense heat. An electric burner is probably not sufficient, but you might have some success. Sturdy leather gloves also might be handy: You will be dealing with very hot metal. 
* Don't do this to anything other than a carbon steel wok, or you will likely ruin your wok. If your wok doesn't have a black non-stick coating, is somewhat bluish in color except for some rust spots, is completely unlabelled, and you got it for a low price at an Asian market, it's probably a carbon steel wok. 
* You will need a well ventilated area, as you will be generating lots of smoke.
* Remove any protective oil coating from the cooking surface with steel wool or a scouring pad. Make sure you have it perfectly clean. Dry it off, or rust will form almost immediately.
* Wipe the inner surface of the wok with a cooking oil that smokes at high temperatures, such as peanut oil. Keep the surface coated at all times while seasoning the wok, but '''do not''' allow puddles of oil to form. If you do, you will end up with a gummy substance and you will have to clean it off and start over. Keep a cellulose sponge or folded paper towel handy to wipe the oil around. 
* Starting with the edges, keep a hot flame beneath one point of the wok at a time. When the oil starts to smoke and changes color to a shiny dark yellow, turn the pan a little and work on a new spot. You can keep building up layers this way, but make sure you've coated the whole wok before you do more layers. It is probably unnecessary to do more than three.
* You should end up with an even, shiny, dark yellowish-brown coating all over the inside of your wok. Let it cool and rinse it off, and it is ready to cook on. If you get streaks in the coating, your oil may have been too thick or you didn't remove all the original oil coating. Scrub that area clean with steel wool and season it again.

===Care===
Rinse your wok clean after every use, pat it dry and reheat it, empty, for few minutes to evaporate any remaining dampness, and put it away with a light coat of oily aerosol. Use soap sparingly to avoid removing the seasoning. Over time, as you use your wok, you may build up a black, burned area at the bottom. This is considered desirable. Supposedly, it adds flavor to food you cook in the wok.</text>

== Carbon steel?  Cast iron! ==

Carbon steel oxidizes really strange and makes a flakey white powder doesn't it?  Cast iron woks come with a little machine oil on them but need to be burned in, i.e. by cleaning and then drying (over fire) and then applying a THIN coat of vegetable (not olive!) oil and then baking at 350F in an oven for an hour.

People may choose to become '''vegetarian''' for a [[w:Vegetarianism#Motivations for Vegetarianism|variety of reasons]], and meat-eaters may eat vegetarian meals.

In North America, one is considered a vegetarian if one does not eat [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|animal meat]].  In some parts of the world, people who call themselves vegetarians do eat fish and/or seafood; in North America these people would be referred to as semi-vegetarians or pescetarians. If you are traveling abroad, or if you are entertaining foreign vegetarians, be sure to verify that you are communicating the correct meaning of 'vegetarian'.

Some vegetarians do eat eggs and/or dairy products, although it is important for vegetarians to note that many soft cheeses, especially French cheeses, may contain animal rennet which is obtained from calf stomachs (and is therefore not considered vegetarian). Those who do not eat any animal products are called vegans; see [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan cuisine]]. Vegan recipes are always vegetarian.

Non-vegetarians often eat vegetarian meals without labelling them as such (many pasta dishes, dahls, veggie burritos, and virtually all desserts).

==Vegetarian nutrition==
{{merge from|Vegetarian Complete Nutrition}}
According to the [http://www.eatright.org/Public/GovernmentAffairs/92_17084.cfm American Dietetic Association], &quot;appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.&quot;  The main requirement for vegetarian nutrition is to ensure your diet contains a wide variety of grains, vegetables, and legumes, and to a lesser degree fruits, nuts, and seeds.  It is a common misconception that vegetarian diets provide inadequate protein.  While one person's protein requirements may be very different from another's, the ADA has found that a typical varied vegetarian diet that meets one's energy needs, also meets one's protein requirements.  Even athletes, whose protein requirements are typically greater than non-athletes, can fare well on a vegetarian diet.  The ADA found that &quot;vegetarian diets (except possibly fruitarian and strict macrobiotic diets) can easily meet the nutritional requirements of all types of athletes provided they contain a variety of plant-foods.&quot;  ([http://www.vegetariannutrition.net/vn_articles/vn_athletes.htm see ADA article])

As a general rule, two or more different vegetarian protein sources should be eaten in a day to ensure that the body gets all the essential amino acids it needs. The only complete (containing all essential amino acids) plant protein is soy, found in products like tofu. Animal products, like eggs and cheese, are also complete proteins, but vegetable protein sources (e.g. beans, chickpeas, lentils, nuts) other than soy are all incomplete proteins and must be eaten in combination.

The Vegetarian Society has a [http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=760 page on vegetarian nutrition].

==Vegetarian recipes==
Below are recipes that are vegetarian, ie, they don't have any [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat, poultry]] or [[Cookbook:Seafood|seafood]], but may include animal products such as [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy]], [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">During the war in 1812 section its said that the British burnt the whitehouse:

:&quot;The British burnt the American ships in DC, as well as the White House and the Capitol.&quot;

During that time wasn't the whitehouse called the 'Presidential Palace'?. I thought I've read that somewhere, but not being sure I haven't changed anything.

''As a note, since the War of 1812, the US and the UK were mostly on good terms, even becoming allies on various occasions.*''
Is this neeed? In style, if not content, it reads like an ironic statement [[User:Dainamo|Dainamo]] 12:52, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)
 this makes no sense and is completely useless</text>

== Portuguese Wikibook ==
Welcome to the Portuguese language Wikibook. Here you can learn the different parts to the Portuguese language through our grammar references and our course. Why not start with the feature word? Previous knowledge on a closely-related languages ([[w:Romance languages|Romance languages]]—occasionally called the Latin languages or, less often, the Romanic or Neo-Latin languages) like [[Catalan]], [[French]], [[Italian]] and [[Spanish]] might make studying Portuguese much easier.

There are several differences among the three main dialects of Portuguese: as it is spoken in Portugal (European Portuguese), as it is spoken in Brazil (Brazilian Portuguese),  and as it is spoken in Africa (African Portuguese). While their written forms are very similar, there are some differences in the spoken language (both in phonology and syntax) that are specific to each of them. Galician, which is a language spoken in Galicia, is not a Portuguese dialect, as sometimes it is stated, but Galician and Portuguese can be seen as two dialects of the same language - Galician-Portuguese). 

Brazilian and African Portuguese show a great influence in their vocabulary from aboriginal languages and Bantu languages which are not present in European Portuguese. Their phonology is more similar to older European Portuguese variants. Brazilian Portuguese also has several unique Americanisms.

{{TODO|This course still focuses mainly on the European variety of Portuguese. If you'd like, there is also a course on [[Brazilian Portuguese]].&lt;br&gt;Since the several variants of Portuguese have been unified, some effort should be made as to merge the works.}}

      <comment>/* The pronouns */</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''[[portuguese/Contents|&lt;&lt; Portuguese:Contents]]'''

The Portuguese language contains pronouns for I, you (formerly thou), he, she, we, you and they. There is no &quot;it&quot; because Portuguese has no neuter gender, and instead an ungendered thing will be considered either masculine or feminine, depending on the gender of the word.

==The pronouns==
'''Official forms:'''
*'''''[[wiktionary:eu|eu]]''''' - I
*'''''[[wiktionary:tu|tu]]''''' - you (singular, very informal) This is used only in Portugal; Thou was once used as the informal you in English (found in Medieval and Renaissance English and earlier translations of the Bible)
*'''''[[wiktionary:você|você]]''''' = you (singular, informal) This form is used in Brazil.
*'''''[[wiktionary:ele|ele]]''''' - he or it (For people and objects of the male gender)
*'''''[[wiktionary:ela|ela]]''''' - she or it (For people and objects of the female gender)
*'''''[[wiktionary:nós|nós]]''''' - we
*'''''[[wiktionary:Vós|Vós]]''''' - you (singular and plural, very formal) *
*'''''[[wiktionary:eles|eles]]''''' - they (For male people and objects or both genders)
*'''''[[wiktionary:elas|elas]]''''' - they (For female people and objects)

&lt;nowiki&gt;* - Nowadays, This form is only used in northern Portugal and by intellectuals. When used, it can also be intended as a 3rd person of singular formal form.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

'''Colloquial forms:'''
*'''''[[wiktionary:Você|Você]]''''' - you (singular, formal), it was Vossa Mercê (Your 
Grace)*&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''''[[A gente]]''''' - we (singular, informal) (Just in Brazil) &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''''[[wiktionary:Vocês|Vocês]]''''' - you (plural) *&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''''O senhor''''' - he/sir (male, singular, formal) *&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''''A senhora''''' - she/madam (female, singular, formal) *&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*'''''Os senhores''''' - they (males, formal)
*'''''As senhoras''''' - they (females, formal)


&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - In colloquial language, most Portuguese speakers use the forms '''você''' and '''vocês''' instead of '''tu''' and '''vós'''.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - These expressions can also be honorific forms for important or unfamiliar people. Example: O senhor João (...) -&gt; Mr John (...)

As you can see, there is sometimes more than one pronoun in Portuguese for the equivalent English word. The reason for this is to show both the ''gender'' and the ''level of formality'' that you wish to use to address the other person.

==I &amp; we==
To say &quot;I&quot;, you simply say ''eu''. To say &quot;we&quot;, you say ''n&amp;oacute;s''. There is no gender or formality that needs to be assigned to these terms.

==You==
When you say &quot;you&quot; in Portuguese to an individual, you must show the level of formality that is appropriate to that person. By saying ''tu'', you are addressing that person informally, in the way you'd talk with a friend. When you use ''voc&amp;ecirc;'', you are speaking in a formal way. While this is done in formal situations, it is also used when addressing someone who is deserving of respect, such as an enterprise director. When ''você'' is the subject of a verb, the verb always takes a third-person form, as with ''Ele'' / ''Ela''.

When talking to a group of people, ''voc&amp;ecirc;s'' is commonly used. At one point, ''v&amp;oacute;s'' was used as a formal plural &quot;you&quot;, but it is now outdated and not commonly used, although still commonly heard in the north of Portugal. As the conjugation sounds a bit strange with this pronoun, only people who use a more erudite way of speaking use this pronoun.

In Brazil, ''tu'' is considered too odd for general use (although it can be found in the northeast regions of Brazil) and ''você'' is almost always used instead for informal situations (when speaking to peers or when an elder speaks to much younger people).

==He, she, &amp; they==
As in the English language, Portuguese has individual words for &quot;he&quot; (''ele'') and &quot;she&quot; (''ela''). But unlike in English, Portuguese also has male and female words for &quot;they&quot;. ''Eles'' is used for males, but can also be used when dealing with both a male and a female (or a large group involving both genders). However, ''elas'' is used only for female groups.

==Other forms of he, she, &amp; they==
When dealing with a formal situation, &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;, and &quot;they&quot; can take on formal states. ''O senhor'' would replace ''ele'', and ''a senhora'' would replace ''ela''. For &quot;they&quot;, ''os senhores'' replaces ''eles'' and ''as senhoras'' replaces ''elas''. These forms would usually be used with older people.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lesson I.1: Wie heißt du? (1. Teil)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
----

This lesson deals with basic conversation topics such as saying hello and  goodbye and asking people how they are feeling. This lesson features audio recordings by native speakers to help you with the pronunciation.

==Dialogue==
Read and listen to the following dialogue between two students: Franz and Greta. You don't have to understand anything! You should rather try to find out how each word is pronounced.

==Hellos and Goodbyes==
There are many ways of saying hello and goodbye in German; some of them are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Greetings|Grüße|144|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Hello!||Hallo!*
|-
||Servus! (used in southern Germany and eastern Austria, informal)
|-
||Moin! (used in northern Germany)
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Good morning!||Moin Moin! (used in northern Germany)
|-
||Guten Morgen!*
|-
||Morgen! (shorter)
|-
|rowspan=2 valign=top|Good day!||Guten Tag!*
|-
||Tag! (used in Germany, shorter)
|-
||Good evening!||Guten Abend!*
|-
||Hello!||Grüß Gott! (used in southern Germany, Austria and South Tyrol)     
|-             
|rowspan=2 valign=top|Goodbye!||Auf Wiedersehen!*
|-             
||Wiedersehen! (shorter)
|-
|rowspan=3 valign=top|Bye!||Tschüss!*
|-
||Tschau! (also spelled &quot;ciao&quot; as in Italian)
|-
||Servus! (used in southern Germany and eastern Austria, informal)
|-
||See you later!||Bis später!*
|-
|rowspan=2 valign=top|See you!||Bis dann!*
|-
||Bis bald!*
|-
||See you soon!||Bis gleich!
|-
||Good night!||Gute Nacht!*
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;You will need to know each expression with an asterisk (*) after it. The others, of course, would be useful to know if you are traveling to regions where they are used. (As you can see, the different German-speaking regions often have their own ways of saying hello and goodbye. However, you will not be required to know any of these less common phrases for any problems or tests.)

The more formal phrases are ''guten Morgen'', ''guten Tag'', and ''auf Wiedersehen''. The less formal ones are ''tschüss'', ''Tag'', ''servus'', and ''ciao''. The others are somewhat neutral on the formal-informal scale. 


{{German/Exercise|Hellos and goodbyes
|How would you say hello and goodbye in these situations:
# You meet a friend in the morning.
# You meet a teacher in the classroom in the afternoon.
# You meet a classmate in the evening.
# You talk to a shop assistant in the morning.
| Avoiding local variants, these are some options:
# Hello: Hallo!/(Guten) Morgen!/(Guten) Tag! Goodbye: Tschüss!/Bis später!/Bis dann!/Bis bald!
# Hello: Guten Tag! Goodbye: Auf Wiedersehen.
# Hello: Hallo!/Guten Abend! Goodbye: Tschüss!/Bis dann!/Bis bald! 
# Hello: Guten Morgen!/Guten Tag! Goodbye: (Auf) Wiedersehen! 
}}

==Mr. and Mrs.==
In German, ''Herr'' and ''Frau'' are used instead of ''Mr.'' and ''Mrs.'' before a last name; e.g., ''Mr. Schwarz'' – ''Herr Schwarz''.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Mr. &amp; Ms.|Herr und Frau|28|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|Mr.||Herr
|-
|Mrs.||Frau
|}

''Frau'' is used for married and unmarried women. Some people still use ''Miss'' – ''Fräulein'' in spoken German but it is no longer used in written German since it is considered an inappropriate discrimination of unmarried women.

Literally, ''der Herr'' means ''the gentleman'' and ''die Frau'' means ''the woman''.  If you use these words without a last name after them, you have to use an article before them; e.g., ''der Herr'' or ''die Frau''. This is actually just like in English.  For example: 
* '''The''' woman's name is Mrs. Weiß – '''Die''' Frau heißt Frau Weiß. 

Note also that the German translation of ''the man'' is ''der Mann'' and ''the lady'' should be translated to ''die Dame''. Thus, without last names you would rather use these pairs:
* man and woman – Mann und Frau
* men and women – Männer und Frauen
* lady and gentleman – Dame und Herr
* ladies and gentlemen – Damen und Herren


{{German/Exercise|Mr. &amp; Mrs.
|Translate the following words and phrases to German:
# Mr. Schwarz
# the man
# The man's name is Mr. Schwarz.
# the woman
# The woman's name is Mrs. Schwarz.
# ladies and gentlemen
|
# Herr Schwarz
# der Mann
# Der Mann heißt Herr Schwarz.
# die Frau
# Die Frau heißt Frau Schwarz.
# Damen und Herren
}}

==Replies to ''Wie geht's?''==
There are many ways to reply to the question ''Wie geht's?'' Here are some of them:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|How are you?|Wie geht's?|245|2}}
|-
!English||German
|-
|How are you?||Wie geht's? (longer: Wie geht es dir?)*
|-
|great||prima
|-
|good||gut
|-
|very good||sehr gut
|-
|miserable||miserabel
|-
|bad||schlecht
|-
|not (so) good||nicht (so) gut
|-
|O.K.||ganz gut
|-
|all right||Es geht so. (Or shorter: Geht so.) 
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The more formal form is ''Wie geht es Ihnen?''

After replying to the question, you could continue with:
* And how are you? — Und wie geht es dir? (formal: Und wie geht es Ihnen?)
Or shorter:
* And you? — Und dir? (or: Und selbst?; or formal: Und Ihnen?)


{{German/Exercise|Wie geht's?
|Fill in the blanks:
# _______ geht's? 
# Prima. _______ dir? 
# Es _______ so.
# Wie geht _______ Ihnen?
# Sehr _______. _______ selbst?
# Ganz _______, danke.
|
# ''Wie'' geht's? 
# Prima. ''Und'' dir? 
# Es ''geht'' so.
# Wie geht ''es'' Ihnen?
# Sehr ''gut''. ''Und'' selbst?
# Ganz ''gut'', danke.
}}


==Test==

The test consists of three parts: pronunciation, vocabulary, and translation. As always, you should write down your answers before you check them. (Writing the German words is in fact a great way to practice the spelling of German words.) The vocabulary and translation problems are all from English to German because this is what you have to learn if you want to communicate in German. Once you are able to translate an English word to the corresponding German word, it won't be any problem to translate the German word back to English.


{{German/Exercise|Pronunciation
|
# How do you pronounce &quot;Ich heiße ...&quot;?
# How do you pronounce &quot;Franz&quot;?
# How do you pronounce &quot;Wiedersehen&quot;?
|
# &quot;i&quot; as in &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;ch&quot; as in &quot;Loch&quot;, &quot;h&quot; as in &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;ei&quot; as the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;times&quot;, &quot;ß&quot; is pronounced just like a &quot;s&quot;, last &quot;e&quot; as in &quot;pet&quot;
# &quot;f&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;n&quot; similar to the English pronunciation of these letters, &quot;a&quot; as in &quot;hard&quot;, &quot;z&quot; like &quot;ts&quot;.
# &quot;w&quot; as the &quot;v&quot; in &quot;vat&quot;, &quot;ie&quot; as the &quot;ee&quot; in &quot;meet&quot;, &quot;eh&quot; is the long German &quot;e&quot; (between &quot;i&quot; in &quot;hit&quot; and a &quot;e&quot; in &quot;pet&quot;), the other letters are pronounced similarly in English.

There are many ways to cook food. The outcome of a dish varies nearly as much through cooking methods as it does through the ingredients. Different cultures tend to have their own unique ways of cooking. These differences often come from historical necessities.  Cooking techniques can generally be divided into dry and wet methods of cooking.

==Dry methods==

== Outdoor cooking==

Some specialized techniques for cooking outdoors have been developed.

==Other Techniques==

Are you always sick of your wild game steaks or fresh fish sticking to your BBQ Grill? If so here is a tip

Slice a potato in half, then, when the grill is hot, rub the cut side back and forth length wise along the grate. You'll hear a hissing sound as starch from the potato coats the metal with a natural non-stick compound.

Some activities in the preparation of food are not technically &quot;cooking&quot; (applying heat to food), however they are important to understand

      <text xml:space="preserve">Make soap from lard.

==Equipment==
*[[w:Lard|Lard]] or some sort of fat or vegetable oil (as sunflower, olive oil). 
*[[w:Sodium Hydroxide|Sodium Hydroxide]] (NaOH)  
*Glass beaker and stirring rod. 
*[[w:Bunsen burner|Bunsen burner]] or other means of heating solution. 
*[[wikt:Mold|Mold]] for making soap bars (any flexible plastic container).

==Safety==

Gloves, labcoat and appropriate eyeware should be worn when handling the 6[[w:M|M]] NaOH. It should be used in a well-ventilated area, preferably in a [[w:fume hood|fume hood]]. DO NOT BREATHE THE FUMES. Wash with vinegar should you get some on your skin (have some vinegar handy before starting the experiment) -DO NOT wash with water!.  Mixing [[w:lye|lye]] with water results in a chemical reaction that creates extreme heat - hence, washing lye off your hands (for example) with water will only initiate that reaction on your hand, resulting in chemical burn.

==How to do==
# Place 16 oz. (450 g) of lard (or any other fat, such as vegoil or butter) in a beaker. 
# In another container add 2.1 oz. (60 g) of NaOH to 6 oz. (170g) of water (do not add water to NaOH it will splatter) stir to dissolve and let cool to 40ºC (110 F). 
# Melt fat under low heat to {{#invoke:temperature|f|110}} and add NaOH solution with stirring until the base has completely reacted with the lard (about 20 to 30 minutes) 
# Pour the mixture of base and lard into molds. 
# Let this cool and sit for a day or two. Let the soap cakes cure for three weeks before using.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a &quot;chemistry-set&quot; description of how to make soap; would a more user-friendly (and less intimidating) set of directions be useful?  (That is, a process that might be followed by a home soapmaker, who wouldn't understand what 6N sodium hydroxide is?)  I also wonder what purpose the ethanol serves?  Ethanol is used in making clear soaps, but most home soapmakers never use it, and it makes the process significantly more dangerous.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Vanis. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Vanis~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

A way to quickly narrow down the possibilities of what a person's personality type is the method of '''Introverting / Extraverting Feeling''' analysis.

Some types tend to Extravert emotion and the others tend to Introvert emotion. All of the types that end in '''FJ''' or '''TP''' tend to Extravert Feeling, while all of the types that end in '''FP''' or '''TJ''' tend to Introvert Feeling.

The 3rd person possessive pronouns (его́ his, её her, его́ its, их their) take the gender and the quantity of the possessing person/object:

:&quot;фильм&quot; (movie) is of masculine gender, yet:
::Бо́ря рассказа́л о его́ люби́мом фи́льме.  (Borya told about his favorite movie.)
::А́нна рассказа́ла о её люби́мом фи́льме. (Anna told about her favorite movie.)

:&quot;кни́га&quot; (book) is of feminine gender, yet:
::Его́ кни́га ста́ла бестсе́ллером.  (His book became a bestseller.)
::Её кни́га ста́ла бестсе́ллером.  (Her book became a bestseller.)

:&quot;джи́нсы&quot; (jeans) is a plural only noun, yet:
::Его́ джи́нсы вы́глядели вызыва́юще.  (His jeans looked outrageous.)
::Её джи́нсы вы́глядели вызыва́юще.  (Her jeans looked outrageous.)

The above rule is common to both English and Russian languages and is opposite to the one in French.

The reflexive(?) pronouns (свой his/her/its own m., своя his/her/its own f., своё his/her/its own n., свои his/her/its own pl.), as well as all possessive nouns except the 3rd person ones take the gender and the quantity of the object in possession:

:&quot;фильм&quot; (movie) is of masculine gender, and:
::Бо́ря рассказа́л о своём люби́мом фи́льме.  (Borya told about his favorite movie.)
::А́нна рассказа́ла о своём люби́мом фи́льме.  (Anna told about her favorite movie.)

::&quot;Я не ви́дел твоего́ люби́мого фи́льма, Бо́ря.&quot;  (I didn't see your favorite movie, Borya).
::&quot;Я не ви́дел твоего́ люби́мого фи́льма, А́нна.&quot; (I didn't see your favorite movie, Anna.)

:&quot;кни́га&quot; (book) is of feminine gender, and:
::Свое́й кни́ги он никогда́ не написа́л.  (He never wrote his own book.)
::Свое́й кни́ги она́ никогда́ не написа́ла.  (She never wrote her own book.)

::&quot;Мо́жно, возьму́ твою́ кни́гу, Бо́ря?&quot;  (Can I take your book, Borya?)
::&quot;Мо́жно, возьму́ твою́ кни́гу, А́нна?&quot;  (Can I take your book, Anna?)

:&quot;джи́нсы&quot; (jeans) is a plural-only noun, and:
::Бо́ря наде́л свои́ джи́нсы.  (Borya put on his own jeans.)
::А́нна наде́ла свои́ джи́нсы.  (Anna put on her own jeans.)

::Тебе́ иду́т твои́ джи́нсы, Бо́ря.  (Your jeans fit you, Borya.)
::Тебе́ иду́т твои́ джи́нсы, А́нна.  (Your jeans fit you, Anna.)

This rule doesn't apply to English, but agrees with the use of 1st and 2nd person possessive pronouns in French.

Monterey Jack is a creamy-white cheese with a smooth, open texture. With its mild-to-mellow flavor, it is perfect for snacking, slicing, or melting on [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] dishes. The cheese was first created in the city of Monterey, in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]. Most commonly eaten fresh, aged Monterey Jack can be used as a substitute for [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan]] on [[Cookbook:pasta|pasta]].

By now you should know the rudiments of using &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;. However,  to really make &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt; work for you, it may be helpful to know the following to make your work easier for you.

== More on commands ==
Say you are editing a document, and you wish to delete ten lines - as of now, the only way to do this is to enter &lt;tt&gt;dd&lt;/tt&gt; ten times. Or if you want to delete seven characters exactly - you would have to enter &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; seven times. There must be a better way!

=== Repetition ===
Fortunately, vi lets you augment most of the commands in case you want to repeat that command a certain number of times. This is done by typing in the number of times you want that command repeated, followed by the command.

So, if you want to delete ten lines, you would type &lt;tt&gt;10dd&lt;/tt&gt;. Or if you want to delete seven characters, you would type &lt;tt&gt;7x&lt;/tt&gt;.

You can also repeat the last action done by typing &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; (this is a single period keystroke), the single-repeat operation over the location you want to repeat the previous operation. 

So if you wanted to repeat the deletion of ten lines as in the previous example, you could repeatedly press &lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt; to perform this operation over and over again.

==== Exercise ====
1. Type the sentence &lt;tt&gt;Good morning Doctor, how are you today?&lt;/tt&gt;. Delete &quot;Good morning&quot;.

2. Now using the single-repeat operation, delete &quot;how are&quot;.

=== Motion ===
vi allows you greater flexibility over motion as well. There are a few commands to allow you to quickly jump around your document, such as :
* &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; moves to the immediate beginning of the line
* &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; moves to the immediate end of the line
* &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt; moves to the first non-whitespace character of the line

&lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt; acts in the following way, if the line was
             hello how are yo&lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;
and your cursor is on the u, if you would enter &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt;, the cursor would be upon the h.

Furthermore, the &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; command allows you to jump directly to some pattern in the file. For example, if you're looking for the next occurrence of the word &quot;pomegranate&quot; in your text, if you hit &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt;, then type in pomegranate (you need not enter insert mode) and hit enter, the cursor will jump to the next occurrence of the word, if it exists. If you want to search backwards, you would perform the same procedure, but use the &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; command. To repeat either search, enter &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;??&lt;/tt&gt;, or alternatively, type &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; and hit Enter. You can also press &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; to jump to the next occurrence, and &lt;tt&gt;N&lt;/tt&gt; to jump to the previous occurrence.

==== Commands and motion ====
We know now that vi lets you enter a number to specify how many times to do something. Consider this example now: you want to delete everything after a certain point on a line - you could enter &lt;tt&gt;dw&lt;/tt&gt; for each word from the cursor position to the end of the line, or hold down &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, but these are cumbersome examples. vi thankfully lets you do something much faster.

With certain commands, vi allows you to specify a position, using the methods in the previous sections. The position is specified after the command. For example, to delete up to the end of the line, you would enter &lt;tt&gt;d$&lt;/tt&gt;.

Other examples:
* &lt;tt&gt;dt;&lt;/tt&gt; will delete until the next semicolon (This is helpful in languages like C and perl that use semicolons to finish statements).
* &lt;tt&gt;d2}&lt;/tt&gt; to delete the next two paragraphs.
* &lt;tt&gt;d4b&lt;/tt&gt; to delete the previous four words (alternatively, you could enter &lt;tt&gt;4b4dw&lt;/tt&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Telnet''' is a protocol designed to remotely access computers in a client-server fashion.  Telnet is inherently insecure, as the data passed from the client to the server or vice-versa is not encrypted.  For connections through insecure networks (such as the Internet), [[Internet Technologies/SSH|SSH]] (Secured SHell), should be used so all communications between the client and server are encrypted.

#The sauce should cook until it thickens and bubbles.  When that happens, beat in nutritional yeast flakes (if the sauce is too thick, add more water).  For a variation, add mustard.
#When the macaroni is cooked, drain and add the sauce.  Serve immediately.

Chili originated in [[wikipedia:Texas|Texas]] in the 1800s. There are many variations of chili.

==Ingredients==

A very simple chili recipe consists of the following ingredients:
* 30 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz.]] medium or dark [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|red kidney beans]]
* 30 oz. crushed [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1/2 - 1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] cooked ground [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]], [[Cookbook:Turkey|turkey]], or equivalent portion of vegetarian ground beef substitute
* 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Chili Powder|chili powder]], or use chili-flavored kidney beans above

==Procedure==
# Cook on medium heat for 15 minutes.  
# Taste kidney beans for flavor to determine when done.  
# Serve with [[Cookbook:Cracker|crackers]], shredded [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]], and your favorite spices.

It is important to soak (for 12 hours) and pre-cook dried beans. Dried kidney beans will cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea unless they have been boiled briskly (a slow cooker will not do - it can even make things worse) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the very indigestible [[W:Phytohaemagglutinin|phytohaemagglutinin]] that they contain - they will then need another 60-90 minutes slow simmer to be tender. Tinned kidney beans are quite safe and do not need pre-cooking as their preparation involves sufficient heat to destroy the toxin.)

= Ein Treffen in Hannover (WIP)=
(Don't be too afraid, it's a lot of text but simple grammar!)

Katja hat sich mit einem Freund, Markus, verabredet, den sie im Chat kennengelernt hat. Sie hat ein Foto von ihm gesehen, und vielleicht gefällt er ihr ja. Am &quot;Kröpcke&quot;, der größten U-Bahnstation in Hannover, steigt sie aus der U-Bahn. Täglich betreten Hunderte von Menschen diese Station, Schüler, Studenten, Angestellte und Rentner. Sie ist 22, studiert seit 2 Jahren Tiermedizin in Hannover, und ist im Moment ledig. &lt;br/&gt;
Sie geht auf die Rolltreppe, betritt die Stufen, und fährt zwei Stockwerke nach oben. Währenddessen schaut sie nach unten. Ihre U-Bahn hat die Station verlassen. Eine andere U-Bahn hat bereits gehalten, und die Fahrgäste sind aufgestanden und ausgestiegen. Sie kommt auf der zweiten Ebene an und geht weiter, Richtung Sonnenlicht, in die Pasarelle. Die Pasarelle führt Richtung Hauptbahnhof, und links und rechts locken die Schaufenster der Geschäfte.
Nach einer Weile hat sie die Rolltreppe erreicht, die zum Hauptbahnhof führt. Nun sieht sie in voller Breite den Hauptbahnhof von Hannover, und davor einen Sockel mit einer Statue von einem Pferd mit Reiter. Dort hat Markus schon fünf Minuten gewartet und begrüßt sie, bevor sie sich ins Eiscafe nebenan setzen.

==Word Order==
Inverted word order occurs under several circumstances, among which are:

*Interrogatives
*Time Expressions
*Subordinating Conjunctions

For interrogatives, a simple statement, &quot;Du hast das Buch.&quot; becomes &quot;Hast du das Buch?&quot; when converting it to a question.  The method is simply switching the verb and subject of the sentence.  

Time expressions, such as &quot;Nach der Schule&quot; prefacing a sentence cause inverted word order.  The formula is &quot;Time Expression&quot;, &quot;Verb&quot;, &quot;Subject&quot; and &quot;Rest of sentence.&quot;  Practically applied, &quot;Every day, I go to school&quot; becomes &quot;Jeden Tag gehe ich zur Schule.&quot;

Subordinating conjunctions connect a dependent clause to an independent clause.  Some subordinating conjunctions are: ''dass'' (that), ''obwohl'' (although), ''seit'' (since), ''weil'' (because), and ''wenn'' (if, when).  The formula for a dependent clause is &quot;subordinating conjunction&quot; &quot;subject&quot; &quot;rest of clause&quot; &quot;verb&quot; and is offset from the independent clause by a comma.  Here are some examples (the dependent clause is underlined):
  Ich kann das Buch nicht kaufen&lt;u&gt;, weil ich kein Geld habe&lt;/u&gt;.       
  Ich kaufe das Buch für dich&lt;u&gt;, da du kein Geld hast&lt;/u&gt;.            
  &lt;u&gt;Wenn unsere Eltern uns besuchen&lt;/u&gt;, schenken sie uns Geschenke.   
    
  ''I can't buy the book &lt;u&gt;because I have no money&lt;/u&gt;.''
  ''I am buying the book for you, &lt;u&gt;as you have no money&lt;/u&gt;.''
  ''&lt;u&gt;When our parents visit us&lt;/u&gt;, they give us presents.''

__NOTOC__
It's hard to believe that [[Cookbook:Pizza|pizza]] originally did not contain tomatoes! Tomatoes originated from the Americas, and didn't reach Italy until the mid-1500s. They didn't get popular until the late 1800s though, because people thought they were poisonous. Now, however, tomato sauce is considered an essential part of most types of pizza. Want to make it at home? Here's the way to get that great &quot;pizzeria&quot; taste in your sauce, with all the &quot;what&quot;s and &quot;how&quot;s.

==Variations on a Theme==
There are two recipes featured here, depending on what you have and how much work you would like to put in.

*The '''Store Bought Plus''' recipe is for those who want a quick yet improved pizza sauce, using tomato sauce and sugar.

*The '''Sauce from Scratch''' recipe is for those who have the time (preparation only - no cooking required!) to mix the ingredients for a purer and more customized taste.

==Store Bought Plus==
===Ingredients===

Note: the amounts of ingredients must be calculated proportionately with the pizza. As such, measurements cannot be determined without a &quot;hands-on&quot; calculation made during procedure.

*1 can smooth spaghetti sauce or pasta sauce
*1 handful [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*extra virgin olive oil (optional)

===Procedure===
After rolling out dough, ladle on sauce as directed by the pizza recipe, then grab a handful of sugar and drizzle it on, until the surface of the sauce becomes white - however, it should remain possible to see the crystals dissolving.

The sugar covers the taste of the acidity and vegetal character of the sauce.  Sugar is the secret to a pizza that tastes like one from many American fast-food franchise pizza outlets like Domino's and Pizza Hut.

A common modification is to drizzle high-quality [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|extra virgin olive oil]] onto sauce on pizza, or to pre-brush the dough with oil before adding the sauce.

==Sauce from Scratch==
===Ingredients===
* 6-[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (170g) can of [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]] (with no additives is best)
* 1 to 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (250ml - 375ml) of water (depending on desired consistency)
* ~ 1/3 cup (80ml) extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] (more or less depending on taste)
* 1 to 3 cloves minced [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* a pinch of [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] (or substitute [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]])
* around 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] dried [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] (according to preference)
* around 1/2 tablespoon dried [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] (according to preference)
* kosher [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and ground [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] to taste

===Procedure===
#Combine tomato paste, water, and oil. 
#Add garlic, basil, and oregano, mixing thoroughly. 
#Add salt and pepper to taste. A quart mason jar works perfectly; ingredients can be added and shaken to mix. 
#For best results place in refrigerator overnight or allow the mixture to rest before using. Makes ~1/2 quart (475ml).

[[Image:CDC_cuke1.jpg|right|cucumber]]
[[Image:CDC_cuke2.jpg|right|cucumber]]
The '''cucumber''', also known as the '''cuke''', is a green vegetable related to the [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] and [[Cookbook:Melon|melon]]. Cucumbers are popular in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]] and as [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]].

==Varieties==
*'''Persian cucumbers''' are also known as regular cucumbers with soft, edible seeds. The skin is often waxed to seal in moisture.
*'''English cucumbers''' are sometimes known as '''gourmet cucumbers''', '''burpless cucumbers''', or '''seedless cucumbers'''. This variety has seeds that are very small but do not need to be removed. Longer and thinner than regular cucumbers, this variety is usually shrink-wrapped to seal in moisture because they are not waxed.
*'''Pickling cucumbers''' are stubby and warty.
*'''Lemon cucumbers''' are yellow and oval, like [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]].

==Selection and Storage==
It’s important to look for firm cucumbers with rich green color (except lemon cucumbers!) and no soft spots. Cucumbers that bulge in the middle tend to be filled with large watery seeds and tasteless flesh.

Whole cucumbers should be refrigerated in a crisper for up to a week. Unwaxed cucumbers will easily lose moisture, so keep them wrapped tightly in plastic.

'''Chard''', also '''acelga''', is a leaf vegetable closely related to the [[Cookbook:Beet|beets]]. There are several varieties of chard available for growing, but the commonest is '''Swiss chard''', also known as '''silverbeet'''. Other varieties are ''Ruby chard'', ''Rainbow chard'', and ''Rhubarb chard''.

Chard has shiny green ribbed leaves, with stems that range from white to yellow and red depending on the variety. It has a slightly bitter taste. The leaves are generally treated in the same way as [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] and the stems like [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]]. Fresh young chard can also be used raw in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]].

In Australia, Swiss chard is often sold as &quot;spinach&quot; by vegetable markets; because of this, real spinach is generally called &quot;English spinach&quot;.

Yams are similar in flavour and appearance to the [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]] but they are not actually related to them in any way. A true yam is the tuber of a tropical vine ''Dioscorea batatas''. Yams are sweeter and moister than sweet potatoes, and can grow to up to seven feet in length, weighing anywhere up to 150 pounds.  In the US, a variety of sweet potato is sold under the name &quot;yam&quot;, but true yams are very rare and generally only sold in ethnic shops.

They are common in the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. True yams are toxic in their raw state, but cooking of any form removes the toxins and makes them harmless. They're generally sold in chunks sealed in plastic, and have a light-coloured interior and dark skin. They can be used in any sweet potato recipe.

[[Image:5aday_sweet_potato.jpg|thumb|right|Sweet Potato]]
[[Image:Kumara.jpg|right|thumb|A kumara]]

The '''sweet potato''' ('''kumara''' in NZ) is tuber-producing plant related to the morning glory. The flesh of the tuber can be white, yellow, orange, or purple.  Sweet potatoes are often confused with [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Yam|yams]], which are not the same at all.

Sweet potatoes are rich in dietary fiber, vitamin C and vitamin B6. Orange-colored varieties are also rich in beta carotene. In tropical areas they are a staple food crop. The tubers are most frequently boiled, fried or baked.  Tubers can also be processed to make starch and a partial [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] substitute.

The tubers, leaves and shoots are all edible. Some variants are sold as house plants for their beautiful flowers; these plants will produce sweet potatoes. The plants tend to be large vines.

Farmers in the Southern United States started using the term &quot;yam&quot; to distinguish between the softer orange variety and the drier white variety.  The [[Cookbook:Yam|true yam]] is rarely found in the United States except as an import. Sweet potatos sold in the USA must be labeled &quot;yam sweet potato&quot; or simply &quot;sweet potato&quot;, not &quot;yam&quot;; they may be incorrectly labeled in stores though.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Sweet Potato|2|2|2|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|2}}
Sweet potatoes are harvested at the end of summer or the start of autumn. Roots that aren't sold directly are cured by keeping them in a humid place at 30°C (85°F) for five to six days. Uncured sweet potatoes have a starchier texture and less sweet flavor than cured specimens. Uncured sweet potatoes are sold in the first few months after harvest. Cured ones are sold throughout the year, up until the next harvest

[[Image:taro_root_CDC.jpg|right|taro root]]

The '''taro root''', as with other tubers, is recognized by other names. This tuber is also known as the '''dasheen''', '''eddo''' and '''kalo''' in many areas of the world including West Africa, Asia, Central America, South America and the Caribbean and Polynesian islands. This root is most well-known as the ingredient of the Hawaiian dish poi, which is mashed taro root.

The hairy outer coating on a taro root is similar to a [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]]. The hairy outer layer is always removed with caution since skin irritation can arise caused by the juices secreted by the taro root. Skin irritations arising from Taro juices can be cured by applying a a mixture of table vinegar and water(1:2) on the sore part. It is recommended to use protective rubber gloves when handling this tuber. Raw '''taro root is toxic''', so always cook it before eating.

The roots are starchy and generally treated like [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]. These tubers take on a [[Cookbook:Nut|nut]]-like flavor when cooked. [[Cookbook:Frying|Frying]], [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasting]], [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]], or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]] them as an accompaniment to [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] dishes are all common uses. [[Cookbook:Soup|Soups]] and [[Cookbook:Stew|stews]] are other dishes that taro root suits well. Taro may be pounded into a thick grey paste and used to thicken other dishes in Asian cooking. Taro roots provide a good source of [[Cookbook:Fiber|fiber]] and supply approximately 110 [[Cookbook:Calorie|Calories]] per adult serving.

Select tubers that are firm and hairy, with no wrinkling. Store the roots for up to one week in a cool and dry location, making sure that the roots do not dry out.

The leaves and flowers are also sometimes eaten. Taro leaves can be treated like [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] and [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] or [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]].</text>

==Presentation==

With the hands reality check, you check if your hands are normal. Look at your hand or both hands and focus on them. Count the fingers in your head or out loud. They may have the wrong number of fingers, the number may change while you try to count them, the fingers can be deformed and keep on changing when you look at them. Your hands can be the wrong colour, or have other abnormalities.

As well as doing this regularly, you could also do it every time you notice somebody using their hands. You could also mark your own hands to remind you to do this reality check (or another), for example by writing something in your palm, the back of your hand, or wrist (see also Reading).

{{NOTE|Over time the hand trick appears to stop working. (Read the 'breathing' section). Try to expect your hand to do something out of the ordinary and if you are in a dream, it will.}}

==Examples of this reality check working==
*I counted my fingers and realized I had the right amount, but knew I was dreaming so I asked to see this other persons hand next to me. He had 6 fingers then I knew for sure I was dreaming

* I counted my fingers. It looked as though I had the right amount, but as I actually counted them, I discovered that I had seven the first count, and six the next.

* I noticed something strange so I counted my fingers. I counted them several times because the number I counted kept changing between five and six. Eventually I was certain that I saw six fingers, and I realized I was dreaming.

* I remembered to do a reality check. So I looked at my hands and realized that they're actually claws!

* My fingers appeared jumbled up as if I had no bones

* Spiders and ants were crawling across my hand in a continuous line.

* My fingers appear floating off the palm of my hand

* I looked at my hand, and it looked like I had two or three extra fingers. When I counted them, each one disappeared when I pointed to it.

* My hand seemed fuzzy, gray, and partially translucent. Something seemed to be wrong with them. When I pressed my fingers into my left palm, I could feel them pushing through like my hand was clay.

* When I looked at my hands, one was normal but the other hand had several fingers growing off my other fingers making it appear mutated. Immediately I knew I was dreaming.

* I looked at my hands and they moved too slowly when I curled them.

* I looked at my hands and each hand had six fingers and when I went to fold my fingers into my palm the sixth fingers hurt like hell and I realized I was dreaming.


* I checked my hand for a reality check, when it suddenly burst into flames and I woke up as planned - I was using the check to wake up.

* I checked my hand for extra fingers when I suddenly fell through the world into a Minecraft-ish void and also woke up.

==Examples of this reality check failing==

* I tried counting my fingers, but my vision was all fuzzy. Everything kept on jumping. It was like trying to count things that kept on moving. I gave up and continued nonlucidly.

* When I looked at my hand I noticed I appeared to have six fingers, but I assumed it was because the extra finger was surgically added.

* I once had four fingers, but was so amused by it that I forgot it while laughing about it.

* I failed to notice the positions of my right hand's fingers had been flipped (I.e. pinky where thumb should be), and even though I did see a new finger next to my pinky I failed to become lucid.

* When I was looking at my hands, some bombs exploded behind me, I got the Minecraft You died! screen. When I touched Respawn I was flying about a blown-up building staring at my extremely long fingered right hand, and they were mangled in all sorts of disturbing positions. After about 15 seconds of this I woke up.

* The fingers flickering in and out of existence scared me so much that I had to quit reality checking and look away.

Irregular verbs are verbs that don't follow the normal pattern used in giving tense to verbs (as is the case with [[portuguese/Contents/Regular verbs|regular verbs]]). Instead, they have their own individual ways of adding tense.

For instance, in English we would end most past tense verb usages with the letters ED (&quot;work&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;, and &quot;thank&quot; become &quot;worked&quot;, &quot;cleaned&quot;, and &quot;thanked&quot;). But with irregular verbs, we make much different changes to them (&quot;see&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, and &quot;do&quot;, become &quot;saw&quot;, &quot;thought&quot;, and &quot;did&quot;). The Portuguese language has instances such as these, and we will explore them in this section.

There are several levels of irregularity in Portuguese verbs.  Most irregular of all are the so-called ''anomalous'' verbs, which are only two: '''ser''' and '''ir'''.  These two verbs present ''stem change'' within the Present Indicative tense, which means that not all persons begin the same way:

           '''''ser'''''   '''''ir'''''
 eu        '''s'''ou   '''v'''ou
 tu        '''é'''s    '''vai'''s
 você      '''é'''     '''vai'''
 ele/ela   '''é'''     '''vai'''
 nós       '''so'''mos '''va'''mos
 vós*      '''so'''is  '''i'''des
 vocês     '''s'''ão   '''v'''ão
 eles/elas '''s'''ão   '''v'''ão

* Vós is considered archaic, and is hardly heard today in Brazil, Portugual or elsewhere


Furthermore, curiously, in several tenses (the Perfect and Plus-quam-perfect Preterites Indicative, the Imperfect and Future Subjunctive) the conjugation is ''exactly the same'' for these two verbs:

           '''indicative              subjunctive'''
           '''perfect plusquamperfect imperfect future'''
 eu        fui     fora            fosse     for
 tu        foste   foras           fosses    fores
 ele/ela   foi     fora            fosse     for
 nós       fomos   fôramos         fôssemos  formos
 vós       fostes  fôreis          fôsseis   fordes
 eles/elas foram   foram           fossem    forem

There is also stem change in the Present Subjunctive, but the stems remain the same for all persons and numbers and they differ in each verb: 

           '''ser     ir'''
 eu        '''sej'''a    '''v'''á
 tu        '''sej'''as   '''v'''ás
 ele/ela   '''sej'''a    '''v'''á
 nós       '''sej'''amos '''v'''amos
 vós       '''sej'''ais  '''v'''ades
 eles/elas '''sej'''am   '''v'''ão

Regular verbs are verbs that have a normal pattern used in giving tense to the verbs. This is as apposed to [[portuguese/Contents/Irregular verbs|irregular verbs]], which have their own individual ways of adding tense.

== Verb endings ==
Verbs in Portuguese end in 3 different suffixes. These suffixes are -ar, -er, and -ir. These suffixes determine how the verb's tenses are handled.

== Tenses ==
The following are sections dedicated to the different tenses used for regular verbs:
* [[Portuguese/Contents/Present tense regular verbs|Present tense regular verbs]]
* [[Portuguese/Contents/Future tense regular verbs|Future tense regular verbs]]
* [[Portuguese/Contents/Imperfect tense regular verbs|Imperfect tense regular verbs]]
* [[Portuguese/Contents/Preterite tense regular verbs|Preterite tense regular verbs]]

== Regular verbs ==
Here is a list of some common regular verbs, along with their meanings:

* '''''[[wikt:amar|amar]]''''' - to love
* '''''[[wikt:beber|beber]]''''' - to drink
* '''''[[wikt:cantar|cantar]]''''' - to sing
* '''''[[wikt:chegar|chegar]]''''' - to arrive
* '''''[[wikt:comer|comer]]''''' - to eat
* '''''[[wikt:comprar|comprar]]''''' - to buy
* '''''[[wikt:conhecer|conhecer]]''''' - to know (as in being acquainted with)
* '''''[[wikt:correr|correr]]''''' - to run
* '''''[[wikt:dormir|dormir]]''''' - to sleep

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;I did the jumping reality check and floated back down. I asked a dream character about this. He said that gravity was decreasing due to global warming. I accepted this wierd explanation and continued in my dream.&quot;

I just thought I would add that I completely fabricated this example, however it is typical that ludicrous explanations can be accepted once you ask dream characters for them. So remember kids, [http://www.ld4all.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5636 Today's Lucid Tip: Dream Characters Suck]!

#Put your oysters with all their liquor into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]]; add the butter, salt, black pepper, mace, and bay leaves 
#Bring to a simmer for five minutes. Add the cream and shake all well together while heating through.

You can use the tools of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to quickly determine a person's personality type though a method called '''Speedreading'''. This process, developed by Paul D. Tieger and Barbara Barron-Tieger in '''The Art of Speedreading People''', lets you use three basic tools to decipher clues in anyone's demeanor, whether your contact is in person, over the phone, or even on a chat line.

The three tools are as follows:
* Clues to individual [[../Dimensions|dimensions]]
* Clues to [[../Temperaments|temperament]]
* The [[../Introverting-Extroverting Feeling pattern|Introverting/Extroverting Feeling pattern]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">JaF893, welcome to Wikibooks and thanks for your edits on [[Organic Chemistry]]! I need to get around to finishing up some more work on that thing .. any contribs you make are quite welcome! Let me know if you think I can be of help to you in any way. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== Automated Table of Contents ==
There is this cool new feature that makes an automated table of contents for any book you are working on. I made a preliminary TOC for [[Inorganic Chemistry]] at the page [[Template:InorganicChemTOC]]. To utilize this feature, put the code:

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{msg:InorganicChemTOC}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;

in at the top of any new page in the book, and the table of contents will appear at the top of that page, linking the page to the other main pages in the book. (Right now the only page linked from the TOC is the main page, but you or anyone can add to it by editing the MediaWiki page linked above, and all of the pages in the book will have updated table of contents.)

Also, for consistancy, when you create new pages in the Inorganic Chemistry book, please use (Inorganic Chemistry) instead of (Inorganic chemistry), so the capitalization is consistant throughout the [[Chemistry]] books. Thanks man! --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Daveb. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Daveb~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

----
In the extended form of periodic table, the elements have been grouped into four blocks, the s, p, d, and f-blocks. The elements in groups 3-12 are called d-block or transition elements. The properties of these elements are unlike those of s-block and p-block elements. D-block elements represent a change or transition between the s- and p-block elements, hence why they are called transition elements.                         
Previously transition elements were regarded as those which possessed partially filled penultimate d-subshell in their ground state or in one of their commonly occurring oxidation states. However the above definition doesn't cover the elements of group 12 i.e. Zinc metals(Zn,Cd and Hg) as these elements do not have partially filled (n-1)d-subshells in their ground state and neither too in their ionic state.
However Zinc metals showing similarity with other transition metals were included in the transition metals. So forty elements belong to the transition metals family, 10 each in 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th period.
The transition elements include the most common elements used. These include iron, aluminium, titanium , which form the base of the construction and manufacturing industry, metals that are valued for their beauty i.e. gold, silver, and platinum and metals such as palladium, ruthenium and osmium which have catalytic properties. 
These contain the densest metals like osmium(d=22.49 gm cm-3), the metals with the highest and lowest melting points, tungsten(mpt. 3683K) and mercury(mpt. 234K). 
Certain transition metals are also important in living organisms. Iron, Fe, is present in the protein hemoglobin which is responsible for the transport of the oxygen in the living organisms. Cobalt, Co, present in vitamin B12 help in the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats in the human body. Copper and Zinc are important in biological catalysis. Cobalt, nickel, manganese, and molybednum are essential components of certain enzymes. 

Transition metals all share some general characteristics, they:

*form complexes&lt;br&gt;
*form ions which result in a coloured solution&lt;br&gt;
*have variable oxidation states&lt;br&gt;
*show catalytic activity

==Complexes==

When ligands form co-ordinate bonds with transition metals ions a complex is formed. Common ligands are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The transition metal ion acts as a Lewis Acid and the ligand acts as a Lewis base. The number of co-ordinate bonds in the complex is the co-ordination number of that complex. Example of complexes are the tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion, [CoCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; and the hexaqaua-iron(III) ion, [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;

===Ligands===

Ligands can be divided into three categories: unidentate, bidentate and multidentate. Unidentate ligands can form one co-ordinate bond with a central metal ion. Bidentate ligands can form two co-ordinate bonds with a central metal ion and so on. Another type of ligand is an ambidentate ligand. An ambidentate ligand contains two sites which can form a co-ordinate bond with a central metal ion, though they cannot both form a bond with the same metal ion at the same time. They can however simultaneously bond to seperate ions creating a bridge between two complexes.

==Uses of Complexes &amp; Ligands==
===EDTA===
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antidote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
EDTA reacts with metal ions to produce stable EDTA complexes. It can therefore be used to remove poisonous metal ions such as lead and mercury from the bloodstream. The complexes are then excreted.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surgery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
EDTA can remove calcium ions from bloodstream. The removal of these ions prevents the blood from clotting which is necessary during surgical procedures.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water softener&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
EDTA can remove calcium ions from hard water, thereby softening it. This helps to prevent the formation of limescale.
&lt;br&gt;
===Cisplatin===
&lt;br&gt;
Cisplatin [Pt(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is a cytotoxic complex used during [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer cancer] treatment. It is usually used to treat ovarian, testicular, lung, bladder, gullet and stomach cancers.
&lt;br&gt;
===Silver===
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tollen's reagent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When silver nitrate is dissolved in aqueous ammonia [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is formed. More commonly known as Tollen's reagent this complex is used in the test to distinguish ketones from aldehydes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Electroplating&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When a silver salt is dissolved in aqueous Potassium (or sodium) cyanide the [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] &lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is formed. The complex is used as the electrolyte in the silver plating process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Q3Map2 has now been integrated with the [http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/ GtkRadiant Project]. Windows, Mac and Linux binaries for both 32-bit and 64-bit systems can be download from the project page. The Q3Map2 source code is now available through the [https://github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant/tree/master/tools/quake3/q3map2 GtkRadiant GitHub Repository].

Official Support Forum [http://www.splashdamage.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=7 @Splashdamage]&lt;br /&gt;
Current stable version is 2.5.17

[http://shaderlab.com/q3map2/ Q3Map2] is a BSP compiler for games based on the id Tech 3 engine. It compiles .map files, which are editable with an [[GtkRadiant|editor]], into .bsp files, which are binary files for the game and are not editable. It currently supports the following platforms:

* Nexuiz
* Open Arena
* Quake 3 Arena/Team Arena
* Quake Live
* Return to Castle Wolfenstien
* Soldier of Fortune II
* Star Trek Elite Force
* Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy
* Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast
* Tenebrae (Quake1 Engine Modification Project)
* Tremulous
* Urban Terror
* War§ow
* Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
* World of Padman
* Xonotic

Q3Map2 was designed to replace the Q3Map.exe that comes with QERadiant, GtkRadiant
and GMAX Tempest. However, there are significant enhancements that require
a little twiddling to use, such as faster lighting and enhanced surface
production.

Fun Facts: 
* Q3Map2 started out as a bugfix for Q3Map, the original Quake 3 map compiler.

* The bicycle-riding, AIDS LifeCycle participant, wonder-coding superhero, ydnar is the man behind Q3Map2.

== Usage ==

Q3Map2 is a command-line utility.  In general, users make use of Q3Map2 in one of three ways:
*Using the bsp menu from within [http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/ GtkRadiant] ([[GtkRadiant|Wikibook]])
*Writing their own [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS batch file] (or comparable shell script if on [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux Linux])
*Downloading a Q3Map2 [http://wikipedia.org/wiki/gui front end], such as [http://www.bobdev.com/q3map2build.php Q3Map2Build], [http://hro.planetquake.gamespy.com/quake_3/?page_id=8 Q3Map2Toolz] or [http://www.darth-arth.de/forum/viewforum.php?f=32 Q3map2GUI]

It should be noted that the default command lines given in the GtkRadiant bsp menu are by no means a complete showcase of the available Q3Map2 options and switches.  You may edit the bsp menu command lines from the GtkRadiant preferences, but for total control of your Q3Map2 compile writing a batch file or using one of the front ends is probably a better idea.

Q3Map2 command lines generally follow the format:

 &quot;C:\path\to\Q3Map2.exe&quot; [&lt;general option&gt;] [&lt;major switch&gt; [&lt;minor switch&gt; &lt;minor switch&gt;...]] &quot;C:\path\to\maps\mapname.map&quot;
----

== Switches ==

===General options===

 -connect &lt;hostname/ip address&gt;
*Enables output of Q3Map2 logging to a remote host.  This switch allows all other (non-solitary) switches.

 -info
*Analyzes a compiled bsp and outputs information to the screen or log.  This switch is solitary, and allows for only the path to a compiled bsp (''not'' .map, it should be noted) afterward.

 -game &lt;quake3|wolf|et|etut|ef|jk2|ja|sof2|tenebrae|qfusion&gt;
*Enables support for games other than Quake III: Arena.  This switch allows all other (non-solitary) switches.

 -fs_game &lt;mod name&gt;
*Enables support for game mods other than the basic game defined in your -game switch.  This switch allows all other (non-solitary) switches.

 -fs_basepath &lt;&quot;C:\path\to\game\directory&quot;&gt;
*Required in order for Q3Map2 to read assets directories of games other than Quake III: Arena.  This switch allows all other (non-solitary) switches.

 -convert [-format &lt;ase|map|quake3|wolf|et|etut|ef|jk2|ja|sof2|tenebrae|qfusion&gt;]
*Converts a compiled .bsp to another format.  This switch is solitary, and allows for only the path to a compiled bsp (''not'' .map, it should be noted) afterward.
*With no -format sub-switch, -convert converts a compiled .bsp to an .ase model.  Q3Map2 -convert outputs ''mapname.ase'' to the &quot;maps&quot; directory.
*Other formats are available via the -format sub-switch:
**map &quot;decompiles&quot; a .bsp back to a .map (most entities are lost, as is texture alignment information).  Q3Map2 -convert -format map outputs ''mapname_c.map'' in the &quot;maps&quot; directory.
**quake3 &quot;cross-compiles&quot; a .bsp from some other game's .bsp format (this &quot;other&quot; game is specified in the -game switch) to Quake III: Arena.  For example, to cross-compile from Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory to Quake III: Arena, &quot;-game et -convert -format quake3&quot; would be used.  This feature is still a work in progress, and should be treated as experimental for the time being; differences in surfaceparm bitflags can cause weirdness in cross-compiled .bsps.  Q3Map2 -convert -format quake3 outputs ''mapname_c.bsp'' in the &quot;maps&quot; directory.
**the other game shortnames work similarly to quake3, but for their respective games instead.

 -scale &lt;N.N&gt;
*Scales a compiled .bsp by the prescribed factor.  For example, Q3Map2 -scale 0.25 will output a new .bsp that is 25% of the original .bsp's size, while Q3Map2 -scale 2.0 will output a new .bsp that is twice as large.  Q3Map2 -scale outputs ''mapname_s.bsp'' in the &quot;maps&quot; directory.  This switch is solitary, and allows for only the path to a compiled bsp (''not'' .map, it should be noted) afterward.

 -export
*Exports internal lightmaps from a compiled .bsp to external .tga images.  This switch is solitary, and allows for only the path to a compiled bsp (''not'' .map, it should be noted) afterward.

 -import
*Imports external .tga lightmaps back into a compiled .bsp.  Imported lightmaps will only work on the unmodified BSP they were exported from.  This switch is solitary, and allows for only the path to a compiled bsp (''not'' .map, it should be noted) afterward.

 -exportents
*Exports entities from an existing BSP to a .ent file. Example usage: q3map2 -game quakelive -exportents -v mymap.bsp

 -threads &lt;number of threads Q3Map2 should use&gt;
*Specifies a number of threads to use during compiling.  On Windows, Q3Map2 automatically detects the number of CPUs present, and sets the threadcount accordingly.  The -threads switch can be used to override this behavior.
*Linux users will need to manually set -threads in order to activate SMP support in Q3Map2.

 -v
*Enables verbose mode.  This is generally a good idea.



 -rename
*Used to fix an issue with misc_model entities in SOF2.  If your misc_models show up unlit and completely black, use the -rename switch.

===Major switches===

 -bsp
*Compiles a .map file into a binary space partition (BSP) file for use with the Quake III: Arena engine.  Also writes a .prt (portal information) file and a .srf (surface) file.  It is not necessary to add -bsp to your command line; it is the default switch.

 -vis
*Creates visibility sets based on the portal file.

 -light
*Calculates lighting data.  With no -light sub-switches enabled, less than desirable output will be achieved.

===Minor switches===

The three major switches (-bsp, -vis, and -light) all have many options that can be accessed via their respective minor switches.  There are quite a few minor switches, so in the interest of readability the lists of minor switches have been organized on separate pages of the Q3Map2 wiki.

====[[Q3Map2/BSP|BSP phase minor switches]]====

Q3Map2 BSP phase minor switches have their own page at [[Q3Map2/BSP]]

====[[Q3Map2/VIS|VIS phase minor switches]]====

Q3Map2 VIS phase minor switches have their own page at [[Q3Map2/VIS]]

====[[Q3Map2/Light|Light phase minor switches]]====

Q3Map2 Light phase minor switches have their own page at [[Q3Map2/Light]]

==Q3Map2-specific entities==

===_decal===
*Specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain one or more patch meshes and target an info_null entity. The targetting line drawn between the center of the _decal entity and the targetted info_null is the axis and distance of projection.  It helps to think of the _decal mesh as if it were a light gel, the info_null were the target of a spotlight, and that you were &quot;shining&quot; this decal onto map geometry.

===_skybox===
*The _skybox entity is a true miracle: It specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, seperate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.  Please see the [[Q3Map2#skybox_tutorial|_skybox tutorial]] for usage info.

===A Good &quot;Final&quot; Compile===

This command line is a good compile to start building off of when you want to produce a &quot;final&quot; compile of your map.  It is by no means perfect for every map, but a good place to start tweaking based on your own maps particulars.

 &quot;C:\path\to\q3map2.exe&quot; -meta -v &quot;C:\path\to\mapname.map&quot;
 &quot;C:\path\to\q3map2.exe&quot; -vis -v &quot;C:\path\to\mapname.map&quot;
 &quot;C:\path\to\q3map2.exe&quot; -light -fast -patchshadows -samples 3 -bounce 8 -gamma 2 -compensate 4 -dirty -v &quot;C:\path\to\mapname.map&quot;

Games with the r_overbrightbits value enabled by default (i.e. Quake III Arena) may want to use the &lt;tt&gt;-gamma&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-compensate&lt;/tt&gt; switches. Otherwise, remove from the compile settings above.

===Creating an .ase model out of brushwork===

#First, create the geometry for your model.
#Save this file as model.map (or whatever). 
#Compile model.map with -v -meta -patchmeta in the bsp phase (if your curves look too &amp;quot;low-fi&amp;quot; add &quot;-subdivisions 0&quot; to the compile line. if you want it even more complex, increment the '-subdivisions' value). There is no need to run -vis or -light. You should now have model.bsp in your &amp;quot;maps&amp;quot; directory.  
#Compile model.bsp ('''not''' ''model.map'', it should be noted) with -convert. You should now have model.ase in your &amp;quot;maps&amp;quot; directory. 
#Create a new .map and place a misc_model entity. Give this misc_model entity the key/value pair &amp;quot;model&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;maps/model.ase&amp;quot; 

Here is an example of a batchfile that does both, bsp and convert compile:
 &amp;quot;C:\path\to\q3map2.exe&amp;quot; -bsp -meta -patchmeta -game [game abbreviation] &amp;quot;C:\path\to\model.map&amp;quot;
 &amp;quot;C:\path\to\q3map2.exe&amp;quot; -convert ase -game [game abbreviation] &amp;quot;C:\path\to\model.bsp&amp;quot;     
Et voila! You've now got a misc_model created out of brushwork. Play with the &amp;quot;modelscale&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;angles&amp;quot; entity keys, and see why Q3Map2 .ase conversion is completely and totally great.

[[Image:SubdivisionsQ3MAP2.jpg|thumb| -subdivisions ]]
 -subdivisions #
*Specifies the number of sub divisions to make in your geometry. Larger values increase triangulation and as such, can decrease performance.


For extra moxie, import model.map as a prefab to your new map. Select the &amp;quot;model&amp;quot; brushwork, and texture it with clip. Rotate these new clip brushes into place over your misc_model; the brush vertexes of these clip brushes will get screwed up a bit, but since the player can't see clip, you really can't tell in-game. It's lovely, and doesn't have any of the ill effects of Q3Map2 autoclipping.

===_skybox tutorial===

The _skybox entity &quot;grabs&quot; all the map geometry it can &quot;see&quot; via the normal entity flooding algorithm and assimilates it into the portal sky heap.  This is an important concept to understand; if there is any leak between your &quot;main&quot; map and the separate area designated for the _skybox, your compile will take forever, only to produce a very borked .bsp.  With that out of the way...

#Construct your map as normal, texturing your sky brushes with whatever sky shader you fancy.
#Seal your map off from the void (of course).
#Create a small box of sky brushes somewhere slightly removed from your &quot;main&quot; map.  You could probably get away with drawing a 128x128x128 cube of your sky shader, then using the CSG &quot;hollow&quot; button.
#Place more geometry within this tiny skybox, but take care not to make it too complicated.  Also: unless you compile with -patchmeta, patch meshes shouldn't go inside the _skybox area... you'll end up with MAX_PATCH_PLANES every time.
#Place a _skybox entity somewhere inside your tiny sky box.  The location of the _skybox entity relative to the rest of the sky box geometry determines where the origin of the portal sky will be relative to the rest of your map... a little experimentation will show you how this works.
#Compile, and that's that.  You've got a portal sky in Quake III: Arena!

Notes:
*The &quot;_scale&quot; key defines the _skybox scaling factor.  Depending on what kind of portal sky you are going for, values between 64-256 seem to be pretty good.  Picking a power of 2 to keep the _skybox geometry vertexes on the grid might be a good idea.
*The &quot;angles&quot; key can be used to put your _skybox geometry off-kilter and make players sea-sick.
*Deformvertexes shaders can be used on _skybox geometry, but the values you use must be scaled up by the same value you assigned to _scale, or else it won't look right.
*You must also scale down the texture coordinates on _skybox geometry, or else the textures you use will appear extremely stretched out.

Authors: see [http://wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Q3Map2&amp;action=history page history]

===Decompiling into a .map===

Q3Map2 can decompile a .bsp into a .map. This procedure is by no means perfect, and you should never take anything from others maps, but decompiling is map is good to &quot;see how it's done&quot;.

#Put the .bsp that you want to decompile into the same directory as q3map2.exe
#Open the command prompt and browse to the folder which contains the .bsp and q3map2.exe
#Type 
 q3map2 -game [game abbreviation] -convert -format map [name of the bsp file].bsp
So if the .bsp is called testmap.bsp and you use Jedi Academy, you use this:
 q3map2 -game ja -convert -format map testmap.bsp
You should then find a .map in the same folder as q3map2.exe and the .bsp.

This is a fairly simple recipe for this sweet, chewy Mediterranean salad. Everyone who makes it has a different variation.

== Ingredients ==

* 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Bulgur|bulgur]] 
* 1 bunch fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] (preferably flat leaf), finely chopped
* 1/2 bunch fresh [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] leaves, finely chopped
* 1 large diced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]
* 1 small chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* Juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
* 1/4 cup [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], or to taste
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], or to taste

== Procedure ==

# Place the bulgur in the lemon juice and set aside for 15 minutes.  
# When the bulgur is soft, mix all the ingredients: bulgur, parsley, mint, tomato, onion. lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Add olive oil last, and toss well. You may need to add lemon juice if needed.

== Notes, tips, and variations ==

Tabouli is delicious when fresh. The flavor deteriorates if you allow it to sit for some time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===BSP phase minor switches:===

==== &lt;TT&gt;-custinfoparms&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables custom surfaceparms for game mods without the need to recompile Q3Map2 itself.  Custom surfaceparms are stored in ''custinfoparms.txt'', in the &quot;scripts&quot; directory.  Custom surfaceparms follow the format:
// Contentflags
 {
 surfaceparmName 0x0000 //whatever bitflag is used by your mod for said surfaceparm
 }
// Surfaceflags
 {
 surfaceparmName 0x0000 //whatever bitflag is used by your mod for said surfaceparm
 }

==== &lt;tt&gt;-debuginset&lt;/tt&gt;==== 
*Enables debugging of surface triangle insetting.  //I'm totally not sure what this is?

==== &lt;tt&gt;-debugportals&lt;/tt&gt;==== 
*Draws the portals into the bsp as translucent polygons.  Omit -vis and -light for best -debugportals results.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-debugsurfaces&lt;/tt&gt;==== 
*Colors every surface a different color (very trippy).  Omit -vis and -light for best -debugsurfaces results.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-fakemap&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Creates a new .map file with a blank worldspawn entity and all the world brushes from your original .map file.  //Don't know much about this one.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-flares&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enable support for flares. They are used to generate a glare effect over bright light sources. Only supported by certain versions of the Quake3 Engine like those used in Raven's titles or [http://www.ioquake3.org ioQuake3].

==== &lt;tt&gt;-flat&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Forces all texture coordinates for a given surface to the pixel that best fits the average color of the assigned texture.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-fulldetail&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will cause all detail brushes to be handled as if they were structural.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-leaktest&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will cause Q3Map2 to abort compile if a leak is encountered.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-meta&lt;/tt&gt;====
*At one time, there was a clear definition as to what, exactly, the -meta switch did.  Now, it has become the &quot;magic&quot; switch that is required for most of Q3Map2's advanced features.  Always -meta, and always -v.

====&lt;tt&gt; -mi &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Sets the maximum per-surface index count to N.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-mv &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Sets the maximum per-surface vertex count to N.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nocurves&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will not compile patch meshes into the .bsp.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nodetail&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will not compile detail brushes into the .bsp.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nofog&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will not compile fog brushes into the .bsp.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nohint&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will not compile hint brushes into the .bsp.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nosubdivide&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Visible surfaces will not be split.  TessSize is ignored.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-notjunc&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will not fix T-Junctions (can cause sparklies and LOD cracks).

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nowater&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will not compile liquid brushes into .bsp.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-np &lt;shadeangle (1 through 179)&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Forces all planar shaders to become nonplanar with the shadeangle specified.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-onlyents&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Only changes the entities in the compiled .bsp.  Needs a compiled .bsp and a new entity file (.ent)

==== &lt;tt&gt;-patchmeta&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Creates meta surfaces from patch meshes.  This &quot;bakes&quot; a set LOD into patches in your .bsp.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-skyfix&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables fix for buggy ATI GL_CLAMP behavior.  Always use this.

Sidenote: ATI's behavior is correct. The bug was with *NVIDIA* drivers not distinguishing between GL_CLAMP and GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE, and Q3 using the wrong one: since Q3 development was done predominantly on nVidia hardware, nobody noticed it until too late.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-snap&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables axial bevel plane snapping to reduce clipped model plane count (use with care).  //I totally don't know a thing about this.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-texrange &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Limits per-surface texel count to N.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables verbose mode for the bsp phase.  Always use this.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-verboseentities&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Outputs more information about compiling entity sub-models into the .bsp.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===VIS phase minor switches:===

==== &lt;tt&gt;-fast&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Only calculates rough visibility data.  Quick and dirty, not actually useful for VIS purposes.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-hint&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will merge the bsp leaves (except for hint portals) before calculating the visiblity list.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-merge&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will merge the bsp leaves before calculating the visibility list.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nopassage&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables the passage visiblity algorithm.  Passage VIS is a bit faster and tighter than the old algorithm.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-nosort&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables the sorting of portals by complexity.  Sorting speeds up visiblity calculations.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-passageOnly&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Will use the passage visibility algorithm only.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-saveprt&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables the automatic deletion of the .prt portal file after VIS finishes.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-v&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables verbose mode.  Always use this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Light phase minor switches:===

====&lt;tt&gt; -areascale &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Scales up area (shader) lights by the prescribed factor.  Q3Map2 -light -areaScale 0.25 will result in area lights that are only 25% as bright as those in a .bsp compiled with -light -areaScale 1.0.

====&lt;tt&gt; -approx &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Approximates lightmaps within a byte tolerance of N. Q3Map2 -light -approx forces simple surfaces without much shadow detail to be vertex lit, thus saving lightmaps. The range is from 0-255, 0 being default (no approximation).

====&lt;tt&gt; -border&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Creates a debugging border around each lightmap.

====&lt;tt&gt; -bounce &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables Q3Map2 radiosity, calculating radiosity light through N bounces.

====&lt;tt&gt; -bouncegrid&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Allows bounced light to affect the lightgrid.

====&lt;tt&gt; -bouncescale &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Scales up radiosity lights by the prescribed factor.

====&lt;tt&gt; -cheap&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Stops Q3Map2 from calculating light on a sample after it exceeds (255, 255, 255). This may produce odd artifacts on maps with lots of saturated colored lighting. Also, do not use cheap with radiosity if you want to preserve all the emitted light.

====&lt;tt&gt; -cheapgrid&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Stops Q3Map2 from calculating light on a sample after it exceeds (255, 255, 255), but only for the lightgrid.

====&lt;tt&gt; -compensate &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Scales back lightmap values to adjust for overbrighting when -gamma is used.  For Quake III: Arena, a good compensate value is 4, though some experimentation may be needed to find an aesthetic that suits your particular map.

====&lt;tt&gt; -cpma&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables full vertex lighting including occlusion on all surfaces, including lightmapped. Causes incorrect handling of -approx in Q3A even with special shaders.

====&lt;tt&gt; -dark&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables darkening of lightmaps at brush/lightmap seams.  Sort of like a half-assed occlusion pass, ends up looking a bit Unreal 1-ish.  Very subtle.

====&lt;tt&gt; -debug&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables lightmap debugging.

====&lt;tt&gt; -debugaxis&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Colors lightmaps based on their projection axis.

====&lt;tt&gt; -debugcluster&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Colors lightmaps based on the PVS cluster the luxel falls into.

====&lt;tt&gt; -debugorigin&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Colors lightmaps based on the luxel origin relative to the raw lightmap's bounding box.

====&lt;tt&gt; -debugunused&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Colors unused luxels hot pink.

====&lt;tt&gt; -deluxe&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Generates deluxemaps for directional light attenuation. These are only used by engines that have the capability, such as Darkplaces(Nexuiz), QFusion(Warsow) and XreaL.

====&lt;tt&gt; -dirty&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables ambient occlusion or &quot;dirtmapping&quot;. Ambient occlusion approximates light attenuation due to occlusion. Basically, less-visible areas (such as nooks and crannies, cracks and crevices) will become darker. Check the [http://www.splashdamage.com/forums/showthread.php?t=6934 2.5.14 release thread] for further details.

====&lt;tt&gt; -dirtdepth &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Use with -dirty. Sets maximum depth of occlusion checking in game units (default 128).

====&lt;tt&gt; -dirtmode &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Use with -dirty. Controls the mode in which the dirtmap is calculated. According to RaP7oR: &quot;The Uniform Mode tries to create a very smooth looking dirtmap, while the Noise Mode is, uh, noisy.&quot;
*0 = Uniform Mode (default)
*1 = Noise Mode

====&lt;tt&gt; -dirtscale &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Use with -dirty. Scales up the &quot;darkness&quot; of the dirtmapping effect by the prescribed factor.

====&lt;tt&gt; -dump&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Dumps radiosity lights into numbered prefabs.

====&lt;tt&gt; -fast&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables light envelopes for area (shader) lights.  This includes radiosity lights.  Results in a much quicker -light compiles, but darkens all enveloped light sources considerably&amp;mdash;this can be compensated for easily by raising your surfacelight values.
*Do not be confused by the &quot;fast&quot; nomenclature... -fast is perfectly suitable for &quot;final&quot; compiles.

====&lt;tt&gt; -fastbounce&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables -fast style calculations, but only for radiosity lights.

====&lt;tt&gt; -faster&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables -faster light calculation.  Faster is a debug test mode only, and produces really crappy results (but quickly). Use only when your compiles are taking forever for testing. Fast is the mode you should be using for normal/final compiles.

====&lt;tt&gt; -fastgrid&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables -fast style calculations, but only for the lightgrid.

====&lt;tt&gt; -filter&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Applies a gaussian blur to lightmaps, smoothing out shadows.  Sounds good in theory, but -filter doesn't play nice with a lot of the more interesting effects... don't use it.  Use -samples instead.

====&lt;tt&gt; -gamma &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Creates a more realistic color ramp between &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark.&quot;  Good values are in the 1.4-2.2 range.  Games that use r_overBrightBits and r_mapOverBrightBits (Quake III: Arena, most notably) will need those cvars disabled unless -compensate is used accordingly.

====&lt;tt&gt; -lightmapsize &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Limits the lightmap size. Default is 128.

====&lt;tt&gt; -lomem&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Trades increased compile time for decreased memory usage.  If you are getting safe_malloc errors (or just running out of RAM), try this switch.

====&lt;tt&gt; -nocollapse&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables collapsing of identical lightmaps.  This switch is required for Q3Map2 lightstyles.

====&lt;tt&gt; -nogrid&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables calculation of the lightgrid.

====&lt;tt&gt; -normalmap&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Colors lightmaps based on the facings of their vertex normals.

====&lt;tt&gt; -nosurf&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables the surface tracing of detail brushes and patch meshes for shadow casting.

====&lt;tt&gt; -notrace&lt;/tt&gt;====
*No light tracing is performed. As a result, no shadows will be cast.

====&lt;tt&gt; -novertex&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Disables the calculation of vertex lighting.

====&lt;tt&gt; -patchshadows&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables the casting of shadows by patch meshes.

====&lt;tt&gt; -pointscale &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Scales up point (entity) lights by the prescribed factor.

====&lt;tt&gt; -samples &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables intelligent antialiasing of shadow edges in lightmaps.  A value of 2 both looks good and compiles quickly, while a value of 3 looks great but compiles somewhat more slowly.

==== &lt;tt&gt;-samplesize &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Writes the prescribed samplesize argument to the .srf surface file.  The .srf file (and thus -samplesize) affects the -light phase of compile.  A lower -samplesize value produces more sharply defined lightmaps.  The default samplesize is 16; a samplesize value of 8 produces a blurry, but good quality compile, suitable to call &quot;final&quot; if you aren't looking for extreme detail. A value of 4 produces a more detailed one, but small artifacts may start appearing occasionally.  A samplesize value of 1 produces the most possible detailed lightmap, but also creates &quot;stadium lights&quot; artifacts, a much larger BSP file size and lower game performance.

*Note that the .srf surface file is generated by the -bsp phase of the compile, so -samplesize must be added to the -bsp phase aswell as to the -light phase to make any effect.

====&lt;tt&gt; -scale &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Scales up all light sources by the prescribed factor.

==== &lt;tt&gt; -shade&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables phong shading.

====&lt;tt&gt; -sky &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Scales up all sun/sky light sources by the prescribed factor.  In this new era of -gamma -compensate, -sky 3 can allow &quot;old style&quot; sky shaders to be used without manually rewriting them.

====&lt;tt&gt; -sunonly&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Computes sun/sky light only, no other light sources.

====&lt;tt&gt; -super &lt;N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables arbitrarily ordered grid supersampling of lightmaps.  This is much, much, much slower than -samples, by the way.

====&lt;tt&gt; -thresh &lt;N.N&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Sets the recursive triangle subdivision threshold.  The range is 0.0-1.0.

*In order to determine the luxel normal for phong shading and bumpmapping, Q3Map2 recursively subdivides the map's triangles until no side is longer than the distance specified in -thresh (T) times samplesize (S).

*The reason lower values of -thresh are used are for when you want more accurate phong and bumpmapping. Lower values = smaller triangles = more samples per luxel (lightmap pixel) = more accurate normal = smoother shading.

====&lt;tt&gt; -v&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Enables verbose mode.  Always use this.

'''Bulgur''' (also &quot;bulghur&quot;, or occasionally &quot;burghul&quot;) is wheat that has been prepared so that it can be used just by soaking. The wheat is steamed, then dried, and very coarsely ground. It is frequently referred to as cracked wheat. However, &quot;cracked wheat&quot; in most American grocery stores is likely not to have been processed in this way. It should be a medium tan color and light in weight.

Bulgur is commonly used in many Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian dishes, including [[Cookbook:Falafel|falafel]], [[Cookbook:Tabouli|tabouli]], and pilaf, and is often mixed with ground meat. It can be used similarly to rice.

'''Tahini''' is ground [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]], generally without the hulls. '''Sesame butter''' is also ground sesame seeds, but generally includes the hulls. It has a nutty, slightly sour taste. It is a common ingredient in many Middle Eastern, Indian, and Mediterranean foods, such as [[Cookbook:Hummus|hummus]], [[Cookbook:Baba ganoush|baba ganoush]], [[Cookbook:Halvah|halvah]], and many sauces and dressings.

In Hebrew and Arabic, tahini is known as ''t'xina'' (pronounced &quot;t'ch'ina&quot;). 

There are two different kinds of tahini generally available - 'hulled' and 'unhulled'. The hulled version is made from seeds which have had their outer husks removed. This makes it less bitter and lighter in colour, but also less nutritious because a lot of the vitamins and protein are contained in the outer hull. In some places you can also get tahini sweetened with [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] - needless to say, this version is not suitable for use in savoury dishes.

{{see also|Cookbook:Mejadra}}

'''Mjeddrah''' is a stout lentil and rice stew, a Lebanese staple. 

==Ingredients==
* ½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] brown [[Cookbook:Lentil|lentils]], soaked an hour or more
* ½ cup long grain [[Cookbook:Rice|brown rice]], rinsed
* 3 cups water
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], sliced
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] whole or ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

===Optional===
* [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* dried [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]]
* half a [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] stick
* a few [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] pods
* chopped [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]], etc. Not too much of this, I think, but a little is good.

==Procedure==
# Pick over the lentils to remove any stones. 
# [[Cookbook:Sautéing|Sauté]] the onion and any other vegetables in the olive oil for a minute or two. Optionally, sauté the rice for a short time but do not let it burn.
# Add the water and other ingredients, bring to a boil, and simmer, covered, for  40 minutes to an hour. You will have to check it occasionally and add water - the final product should  have some liquid but should not be very soupy. It is finished when the rice and lentils are both no longer crunchy.

==Variations==
* A little [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]] is tasty sprinkled on as a garnish.
* Sauté some chopped onion and garlic quickly in oil until it browns (a slight burning is good), then stir it into some natural [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] and use as a garnish.

==Purpose and mission==
This book should become the gold standard of inorganic chemistry texts in the areas of accuracy, usability, flexibility, and connection with its audience. As this text is developed it will always be available online, be printable, and freely distributable. This text should eliminate all or much of the cost for owning an up-to-the-minute, top-quality college-level inorganic chemistry text, as it and all its derivative works will remain free: free as in speech as well as free as in beer. Although you could pay for a printed version if you wanted to. 

==Content and Contributions==
This is, to the best of our knowlege, the world's first and only [http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content open content] '''inorganic chemistry textbook'''. Its users will tweak and refine this book until there is no better book. We are confident that this will happen because the process has already been seen to work many times on the [http://www.wikipedia.org Wikipedia] site. 

All content contained herein is available under licences that allow free distribution. You can copy it, print it, sell it, and create derivative works from it. 

Our restriction: if you create derivative works, make them available to others in a way that they can easily copy and distribute them, as we have done for you.

We link to some pages outside our server. Any of this content not found under the Wikipedia site and subsites is not ensured to be under the same license, it in fact is most likely not.

The initiator of this project is JaF893. At the time of writing (3/9/03) I have been the sole contributor but as time goes on it will become a group project &quot;of the people&quot; as many contribute and improve it by bits and pieces.
EDIT (3/10/03) - [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] has edited some of the pages and created an automatic table of contents.

==Licensing==
All work in this book is released at the moment only under the GNU FDL license. However this is only one of many similar open content licenses, and may not be the license of choice for everyone.

[[Image:Rice-cooker.jpg|right|thumb|Rice cooker]]

A '''rice cooker''' or '''rice steamer''' is a kitchen appliance used to automate and simplify the process of cooking [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. Traditionally, rice is cooked by measuring a specific amount of rice and water and applying heat for a specific amount of time. The process is deceptively simple. Rice cookers provide a simple alternative. Although rice cookers do not necessarily speed the cooking process, the consumer's involvement in cooking rice with a rice cooker is significantly reduced and simplified. 

With a rice cooker, the cook combines a predetermined amount of rice and water inside the rice cooker and turns the device on. The rice cooker heats the water-rice mixture until all the water has either evaporated or is absorbed by the rice. This works on the principle that the boiling water maintains a constant temperature (212 °F or 100 °C at sea-level). Once the temperature changes, the device shuts off or switches to warm to keep the rice ready to serve for up to several hours. A rice cooker makes it virtually impossible to end up with scorched rice on the bottom of the pan.

Basic &quot;on&amp;mdash;off&quot; or &quot;on&amp;mdash;keep warm&quot; rice cookers can double as electric steamers for other foods. Many include a steamer tray. They can be used just for steaming, or to steam food while preparing rice. Creative cooks prepare grains other than rice by adjusting the amount of water added prior to cooking.

Newer, &quot;fuzzy logic&quot; rice cookers have several settings for different types of cooking. Most commonly, these include a basic rice setting, a brown rice setting, a quick cooking setting, and a porridge setting, although different brands may include more or fewer options. These cookers can also be used to prepare risottos, pilafs, and rice puddings. However, most fuzzy logic rice cookers can not be used as steamers.

Rice cookers commonly come with a special cup to measure 180&amp;nbsp;ml, or about 6&amp;nbsp;oz of rice. It is important to note that a rice cooker that has water level markings on the side of the bowl will be for rice measured in this cup, not a standard measuring cup.

The rice cooker is considered an important part of modern [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cooking]].

There's lots of ways to cook rice an' peas, but this one is easy and hassle free.  This is a traditional [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]] dish, done easy in a [[Cookbook:Rice Cooker|rice cooker]], great for your ital-eating Rastafarian or vegan friends. 

==Ingredients==
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Bean|bean]]s ([[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney beans]], [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black beans]], [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto beans]]) (also known as &quot;peas&quot;), dried or canned
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Rice|brown rice]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut milk]]
*1 cup water

==Procedure==
#The beans should either be pre-soaked for at least 8 hours, and, if kidney beans, boiled briskly for 20 minutes or from a can. It is important to soak and pre-cook dried kidney beans. Dried kidney beans will cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea unless they have been boiled briskly (the slow cooker will not do - it can even make things worse) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the very indigestible phytohaemagglutinin that they contain - they will then need another 60-90 minutes slow simmer to be tender. Tinned kidney beans are quite safe and do not need pre-cooking as their preparation involves sufficient heat to destroy the toxin.
#Drain and rinse the beans (even canned beans) prior to use.
#Add rice, beans, water, and coconut milk to the rice cooker.  If using a fuzzy logic cooker, set to cook for brown rice.  For an on/off cooker, turn it on.

In about 30 minutes your rice cooker will &quot;pop&quot;.  Open, stir, and serve.  This serves one for each cup of rice.

'''Pandora's Feast''' is a complete vegan meal that can be served several times a week due to the ease with which it can be modified.  The meal is easy to prepare in a [[Cookbook:Rice Cooker|rice cooker]].

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Rice|brown rice]]
*2 cups water

also some or all of the following

*1 cup [[Cookbook:Black Bean|black]], [[Cookbook:Pinto Bean|pinto]], [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney]] or other [[Cookbook:Bean|beans]]
*[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thai]] sweet black [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] 
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]], cubed
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]], cubed
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]], cubed
*1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], chopped
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Beet|beet]], cubed
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Kale|kale]], chopped

and for finishing touches

*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], hemp oil, flaxseed oil, or other nutritious [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]
*[[Cookbook:Nutritional Yeast|nutritional yeast]]
*[[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
*black [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]]

==Procedure==

#Add the brown rice and water to the [[Cookbook:Rice Cooker|rice cooker]].  If you have &quot;Thai sweet black rice&quot; or &quot;[[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] forbidden black rice&quot;, replace about 10% of your brown rice with this and your finished product will be a lovely purple and will have a different taste.
#The beans should either be pre-soaked for at least 8 hours and boiled briskly for 20 minutes (preferred) or from a can.  Drain, rinse, and add these to the rice cooker. (It is important to soak and pre-cook dried beans. Dried kidney beans will cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea unless they have been boiled briskly (the slow cooker will not do - it can even make things worse) for at least twenty minutes to destroy the very indigestible phytohaemagglutinin that they contain - they will then need another 60-90 minutes slow simmer to be tender. Tinned kidney beans are quite safe and do not need pre-cooking as their preparation involves sufficient heat to destroy the toxin.)
#If using, add the garlic to the cooker.
#If using, add the sweet potato, squash, beet or potato, chop into cubes 1[[Cookbook:cm|cm]] x 1cm for optimal cooking.
#On a fuzzy logic cooker, set the cooker to the brown rice setting and turn it on.  For an on/off cooker, turn it on.
#If using, [[Cookbook:Chop|chop]] the kale.
#In about 20&amp;ndash;40 minutes, your cooker will complete cooking the rice. When the cooker is finished, open the lid, add the kale, and wait about another minute or two.
#Open and serve.  Top with oil, yeast, soy sauce and/or sesame seeds, to taste.

Total prep time is about 3 minutes, cooking time 20&amp;ndash;40 minutes.  Serves 1

== Introduction ==

Catalysis is the ability of some species to rapidly speed up the rate at which a chemical reaction proceeds.  For historical reasons, the discipline is normally split into two sub-catagories; homogeneous (homo = same, geneous = phase) and heterogeneous (hetero = different).  
Homogeneous catalysis is concerned with catalysts that are in the same phase as the chemical reactions they are speeding up.  These reactions are normally in the liquid phase and include all of biology's enzymes.  While the majority of homogeneous catalysis is in the liquid phase there are gas phase and solid phase homogeneous catalytic reactions.  
Heterogeneous catalysts have a catalyst that is in a different phase.  This type of catalysis is responsible for the vast majority of 'bulk' chemicals that are produced each year that go into making all the things we take for granted around us such as plastics, and are also extensively used for refining oil in gasoline.  This chapter focuses on heterogeneous catalysis and specifically how and why they work at all. 

The key concept in catalysis, and indeed all of chemistry, is the tension between the thermodynamics of a particular reaction which tells you whether something ''should'' happen, and the kinetics which tells you ''how fast'' something will happen.  This tension in the world around you is everywhere i.e. thermodynamics says the diamond on an engagement ring should turn into graphite, a more stable allotrope of carbon but the kinetics is such that you would be waiting a very, very long time before it happened!  Catalysis works by giving chemical reactions that ''should'' happen a way to ''actually'' happen. 


== Conceptual Analogy ==

The standard way to think of a chemical reaction happening is to imagine the energy of a molecule as being represented by a z co-ordinate while the reaction 'proceeds' in the x-y plane.  If this sounds confusing, just think of the energy as being like the height of land features like mountains relative to their position.  A molecule in this landscape would be a place where you can't go downhill without having to go uphill first, like a crater lake.  Even though on a global scale, a crater lake should flow down to the sea, the local conditions around it mean that it would have to first flow uphill, which we could postulate doesn't happen on a regular basis.  This analogy helps to visualise what is going on in a chemical reaction: the atoms involved when they're joined in one fashion are in an energy 'lake' and aren't able to change, but given the right conditions, such as temperature or photons, they are able to get over the energy barrier and flow down to another energy 'lake' which has the atoms joined in another fashion.  This energy barrier is called the activation energy.  In our analogy, imagine drilling a hole from one lake to another lake, since the water doesn't have to go 'up and over', it can flow easily to another position.  This is exactly what a catalyst does, it doesn't change the total energy of the system or where the system will eventually end up (the thermodynamics dictate this), it just provides an easier way for the system to get there and hence speeds it up (it increases the rate).
This analogy paints a picture that helps you remember the text-book definition of a catalyst: a substance which increases the rate at which a thermodynamic equilibrium is obtained by lowering the activation energy of the reaction pathway. 

That is what a catalyst does but it doesn't give us any idea of how.  It is only useful in deciding whether you are observing catalysis in action, the mechanism of how heterogeneous catalysts work is far more subtle.

==Heterogeneous catalysis==
== Mechanism ==

According to Surface adsoprtion theory heterogeneous catalysis has five stages:


{| WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;b&gt;Stage 1:Diffusion of Reactant(s) to the Surface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The rate at which reactants will diffuse to the surface will be influenced by their bulk concentration and by the thickness of the boundary layer.
|}
&lt;br&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;b&gt;Stage 2:Adsorption of reactants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bonds are formed as the reactant(s) are adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst.
|}
The ability for an atom or molecule to stick to the surface is known, brilliantly, as the Sticking Co-efficient.  This is just the ratio or percentage of molecules that end up sticking on the surface.
&lt;br&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;

| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;b&gt;Stage 3:Reaction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bonds form between the atoms and molecules on the surface
|}
&lt;br&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;b&gt;Stage 4:Desorption of products&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bonds are broken as the product(s) desorb from the surface.
|}
&lt;br&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | &lt;b&gt;Stage 5:Diffusion of Product(s) away from the Surface &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The products are then desorbed from the surface of the catalyst.
|}&lt;br&gt;

== Kinetics ==



== Examples ==

In the contact process vanadium [V] oxide (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is solid whereas the reactants SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are gaseous.


{|
|-
|
 || Fe (s) ||
|-
| N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)
| &lt;b&gt;&amp;hArr;&lt;/b&gt; || 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g)
|-
|
 ||  ||
|-
|
 ||  ||
|-
|
 ||  ||
|-
|
 || V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (s) ||
|-
| 2SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)
| &lt;b&gt;&amp;hArr;&lt;/b&gt; || 2SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g)
|}

More detailed method:

2V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + 2SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)⇔ 2SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + 2V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s)

2V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) ⇔ 2V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (s) 


Therefore:
2SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)⇔ 2SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(g)

# The Bhagavad-Gita is the Light of Life, lit by God at the altar of man, to save humanity from the darkness of ignorance and suffering. It is a scripture which outlives time, and can be acknowledged as indispensable to the life of any man in any age. It is the encyclopaedia of life and this commentary provides an index to it.
# There will always be confusion and chaos in the relative fields of life and man's mind will always fall into error and indecision. The Bhagavad-Gita is a complete guide to practical life. It will always be there to rescue man in any situation. It is like an anchor for the ship of life sailing on the turbulent waves of time.
# It brings fulfilment to the life of the individual. When society accepts it, social well-being and security will result, and when the world hears it, world peace will be permanent.
# The Bhagavad-Gita presents the science of life and the art of living. it teaches how to be, how to think and how to do. Its technique of glorifying every aspect of life through contact with inner Being is like watering the root and making the whole tree green. It surpasses any practical wisdom of life ever cherished by human society.
# The Bhagavad-Gita has a greater number of commentaries than any other known scripture. The reason for adding one more is that there does not seem to be any commentary which really brings to light the essential point of the whole teaching.
# Wise commentators, in their attempt to fulfil the need of their times, have revealed the truth of the teaching as they found it. By so doing they have secured a place in the history of human thought. They stand out as torch-bearers on the long corridor of time. They have fathomed great depths of the ocean of wisdom. Yet with all their glorious achievements they have not brought out the central point of the Bhagavad-Gita. It is unfortunate that the very essence of this ancient wisdom should have been missed.
# The Bhagavad-Gita needs a commentary which restates in simple words the essential teaching and technique given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield. There are commentaries to extol the wisdom of the paths of knowledge, devotion and action in the Bhagavad-Gita, but none to show that it provides a master-key to open the gates of all these different highways of human evolution simultaneously. No commentary has yet shown that through one simple technique proclaimed in the Bhagavad-Gita, any man, without having to renounce his way of life, can enjoy the blessings of all these paths.
# This commentary has been written to present that key to mankind and preserve it for generations to come.
# The Bhagavad-Gita is the Scripture of Yoga, the Scripture of Divine Union. Its purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level. The marvel of its language and style is that every expression brings a teaching suitable to every level of human evolution.
# Fundamentally there are four levels of consciousness on each of which the nature of the practice changes: the waking state, transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God- consciousness. Every teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita has its application on each of these planes of development. Every expression must therefore be interpreted in four different ways to explain, both in theory and practice, the ascending progression of the discourse on each of these four different levels. Thus it is obvious that the Bhagavad-Gita as a whole must also be interpreted in four different ways so that the whole path to God-realization may be explained clearly.
# As the Bhagavad-Gita has not yet been interpreted in this manner, the true message of the scripture has remained dormant. It is highly important that these four commentaries should be written, not only to do justice to the scripture but also to present a straight path to the seeker and bring him the profound wisdom of this practical philosophy.
# Thorough knowledge of any subject requires that its validity be substantiated by the criteria provided by the six systems of Indian philosophy : Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Sankhya, Yoga, Karma Mimansa and Vedanta.
# In order to be complete, every aspect of the theory and practice at any stage of development must be verifiable by all these six systems simultaneously. It follows therefore that six interpretations of each of the four commentaries mentioned above are necessary to bring to light the complete significance of the Bhagavad-Gita.
# The present commentary should be regarded as a general basis for these twenty-four commentaries. If time allows, these commentaries will be written. But because the world is in such urgent need of the basic principle of spiritual development, it has been thought necessary to bring out the present commentary without further loss of time.
# It will be of interest to the reader to know that this commentary is being brought out only after the technique has been verified in the lives of thousands of people of different nationalities throughout the world, under the auspices of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement founded with the sole purpose of spiritually regenerating the lives of all men in every part of the world. It presents a truth that is timeless and universal, a truth of life equally suited to all men, irrespective of differences of faith, culture or nationality.
# The overall conception of this commentary is supplementary to the unique vision and profound wisdom of the great Shankara, as set forth in his Gita-Bhashya. The wisdom is a gift from Guru Deva All glory to Him! It presents the Light of Life and sets the stream of life to find its fulfilment in the ocean of eternal Being, in devotion to God and in the bliss of God-consciousness.
# May every man make use of the practical wisdom given in the 45th verse of the second chapter and thereby glorify all aspects of his life and gain eternal freedom in divine consciousness. &lt;/td&gt;

It presents the Light of Life and sets the stream of life to find its fulfilment in the ocean of eternal Being, in devotion to God and in the bliss of God-consciousness.
# May every man make use of the practical wisdom given in the 45th verse of the second chapter and thereby glorify all aspects of his life and gain eternal freedom in divine consciousness. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;</text>

Ruby is an [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[w:Scripting programming language|scripting language]] originally developed by [[w:Yukihiro Matsumoto|Yukihiro Matsumoto]] (&quot;Matz&quot;). The main web site of the Ruby programming language is [http://www.ruby-lang.org/ ruby-lang.org]. Development began in February 1993 and the first alpha version of Ruby was released in December 1994. It was developed to be an alternative to scripting languages such as [[w:Perl|Perl]] and [[w:Python programming language|Python]].&lt;ref name=oreilly-matz-interview&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html | title=An Interview with the Creator of Ruby | author=Bruce Stewart | date=November 29, 2001 | publisher=O'Reilly | accessdate=2006-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby borrows heavily from Perl and the class library is essentially an object-oriented reorganization of Perl's functionality. Ruby also borrows from [[w:Lisp|Lisp]] and [[w:Smalltalk|Smalltalk]]. While Ruby does not borrow many features from Python, reading the code for Python helped Matz develop Ruby.&lt;ref name=oreilly-matz-interview/&gt;

[[w:Mac OS X|Mac OS X]] comes with Ruby already installed. Most [[w:Linux|Linux]] distributions either come with Ruby preinstalled or allow you to easily install Ruby from the distribution's repository of [[w:free software|free software]]. You can also download and install Ruby on [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. The more technically adept can download the Ruby source code&lt;ref name=ruby-download&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ | title=Download Ruby | accessdate=2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compile it for most [[w:operating system|operating systems]], including [[w:Unix|Unix]], [[w:DOS|DOS]], [[w:BeOS|BeOS]], [[w:OS/2|OS/2]], Windows, and Linux.&lt;ref name=ruby-about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/ | title=About Ruby | accessdate=2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

Ruby combines features from Perl, Smalltalk, [[w:Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[w:Ada (programming language)|Ada]], Lisp, and Python.&lt;ref name=ruby-about/&gt;

=== Object Oriented ===

Ruby goes to great lengths to be a purely object oriented language. Every value in Ruby is an object, even the most primitive things: strings, numbers and even &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;. Every object has a ''class'' and every class has one ''superclass''. At the root of the class hierarchy is the class &lt;tt&gt;BasicObject&lt;/tt&gt;, from which all other classes, including &lt;tt&gt;Object&lt;/tt&gt;, inherit.

Every class has a set of ''methods'' which can be called on objects of that class. Methods are always called on an object — there are no “class methods”, as there are in many other languages (though Ruby does a great job at faking them).{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Every object has a set of ''instance variables'' which hold the state of the object. Instance variables are created and accessed from within methods called on the object. Instance variables are completely private to an object. No other object can see them, not even other objects of the same class, or the class itself. All communication between Ruby objects happens through methods.

=== Mixins ===

In addition to classes, Ruby has ''modules''. A module has methods, just like a class, but it has no instances. Instead, a module can be included, or “mixed in,” to a class, which adds the methods of that module to the class. This is very much like inheritance but far more flexible because a class can include many different modules. By building individual features into separate modules, functionality can be combined in elaborate ways and code easily reused. Mix-ins help keep Ruby code free of complicated and restrictive class hierarchies.

=== Dynamic ===

Ruby is a very ''dynamic'' programming language. Ruby programs aren’t compiled, in the way that C or Java programs are. All of the class, module and method definitions in a program are built by the code when it is run. A program can also modify its own definitions while it’s running. Even the most primitive classes of the language like String and Integer can be opened up and extended. Rubyists call this ''monkey patching'' and it’s the kind of thing you can’t get away with in most other languages.

Variables in Ruby are dynamically typed, which means that any variable can hold any type of object. When you call a method on an object, Ruby looks up the method by name alone — it doesn't care about the type of the object. This is called ''duck typing'' and it lets you make classes that can pretend to be other classes, just by implementing the same methods.

=== Singleton Classes ===

When I said that every Ruby object has a class, I lied. The truth is, every object has ''two'' classes: a “regular” class and a ''singleton class''. An object’s singleton class is a nameless class whose only instance is that object. Every object has its very own singleton class, created automatically along with the object. Singleton classes inherit from their object’s regular class and are initially empty, but you can open them up and add methods to them, which can then be called on the lone object belonging to them. This is Ruby’s secret trick to avoid “class methods” and keep its type system simple and elegant.

=== Metaprogramming ===

Ruby is so object oriented that even classes, modules and methods are themselves objects! Every class is an instance of the class &lt;tt&gt;Class&lt;/tt&gt; and every module is an instance of the class &lt;tt&gt;Module&lt;/tt&gt;. You can call their methods to learn about them or even modify them, while your program is running. That means that you can use Ruby code to generate classes and modules, a technique known as ''metaprogramming''. Used wisely, metaprogramming allows you to capture highly abstract design patterns in code and implement them as easily as calling a method.

=== Flexibility ===

In Ruby, everything is malleable. Methods can be added to existing classes without [[w:Subclass (computer science)|subclassing]], operators can be [[w:Operator overloading|overloaded]], and even the behavior of the standard library can be redefined at runtime.

=== Variables and scope ===

You do not need to declare variables or variable scope in Ruby. The name of the variable automatically determines its scope.

* &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is a local variable (or something other than a variable).
* &lt;tt&gt;$x&lt;/tt&gt; is a global variable.
* &lt;tt&gt;@x&lt;/tt&gt; is an instance variable.
* &lt;tt&gt;@@x&lt;/tt&gt; is a class variable.

=== Blocks ===

Blocks are one of Ruby’s most unique and most loved features. A block is a piece of code that can appear after a call to a method, like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;
laundry_list.sort do |a,b|
  a.color &lt;=&gt; b.color
end
&lt;/source&gt;

The block is everything between the &lt;tt&gt;do&lt;/tt&gt; and the &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt;. The code in the block is not evaluated right away, rather it is packaged into an object and passed to the &lt;tt&gt;sort&lt;/tt&gt; method as an argument. That object can be called at any time, just like calling a method. The &lt;tt&gt;sort&lt;/tt&gt; method calls the block whenever it needs to compare two values in the list. The block gives you a lot of control over how &lt;tt&gt;sort&lt;/tt&gt; behaves. A block object, like any other object, can be stored in a variable, passed along to other methods, or even copied.

Many programming languages support code objects like this. They’re called ''closures'' and they are a very powerful feature in any language, but they are typically underused because the code to create them tends to look ugly and unnatural. A Ruby block is simply a special, clean syntax for the common case of creating a closure and passing it to a method. This simple feature has inspired Rubyists to use closures extensively, in all sorts of creative new ways.

=== Advanced features ===

Ruby contains many advanced features.

* [[w:Exception handling|Exceptions]] for error-handling.
* A mark-and-sweep [[w:Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collector]] instead of [[w:Reference counting|reference counting]].
* OS-independent [[w:Thread (computer science)|threading]], which allows you to write multi-threaded applications even on operating systems such as DOS. (this feature will disappear in [[w:YARV | 1.9]], which will use native threads)

You can also write extensions to Ruby in [[w:C (programming language)|C]] or embed Ruby in other software.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Prolog book. This book can serve as a textbook or tutorial for anyone who wants to learn the Prolog programming language. No prior programming experience is required. Some basic knowledge of logic can come in handy. For those new to the subject, a short introduction to logic is given, but this is not required reading.

The first chapters of the book (under ''Basics'') describe the central syntax and features of the language. The next section, ''Programming'', explores additional concepts that are useful when programming in Prolog. The chapters under ''Basics'' and ''Programming'' are meant to be read in order.

The section ''Built-in Predicates'' deals with the functions available in many Prolog compilers. These and other chapters can be read in any order.

Fortran is a [[w:programming language|programming language]] mainly used by the scientific community. Its name is a contraction of FORmula TRANslation, and its aim is to provide a way to tell computers to calculate complicated mathematical expressions, with more ease than assembly language.

FORTRAN is one of the earliest programming languages. The original versions used [[w:punched cards|punched cards]] to write programs with. FORTRAN's age is both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, FORTRAN has a huge number of [[w:programming library|libraries]] of code available. However, Fortran also has many archaic features, especially in the earlier versions. 

Fortran originally included a not-so-intuitive syntax, having fixed fields (a 5-digit line number, a continuation marker, and a statement area (plus a card sequence-number area on some versions). However, newer specifications for FORTRAN , such as Fortran 90, 95, 2003 and 2008 do not require such anachronistic formatting. In addition, many compilers have additional improvements for non-standard code. This book is intended to help write code compliant with the Fortran 95 standard. Some pieces of the 2003 standard are also included.  The newer standards add functionality and attempt to be fully backward compatible.  Where appropriate the differences in usage between these legacy versions and the modern standard will be highlighted as there is a significant code base written in older versions, especially FORTRAN 77.

==Spielen, Machen and Other Verbs==

All three verbs that you were introduced to in Lesson 2 are irregular in some way; however, most verbs are regular verbs. In English, the regular conjugation is very easy: only for the third person singular an &quot;-s&quot; is added to the infinitive (&quot;to see&quot; becomes &quot;he/she/it sees&quot;). Unfortunately, there are more endings in German. The following two tables show the endings for the two regular verbs ''spielen'' (''to play'') and ''machen'' (''to do; to make''):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to play|spielen|187|7}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|German
|-

|}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|to do_make|machen|152|6}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|German
|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person
|I||do/make

|-
!2nd person

|wir||mach'''en'''
|-
!2nd person
|you||do/make
|ihr||mach'''t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||do/make
|sie||mach'''en'''
|}

As you see, the endings are the same for corresponding forms of ''spielen'' and ''machen''. In fact, they are the same for all regular verbs. Thus, you can always just remove the ''-en'' from the infinitive of a regular German verb to form the stem (e.g., ''spielen'' becomes ''spiel-'' and ''machen'' becomes ''mach-'') and then add the ending for the particular person. Here is a table with these endings:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Verb|conjugation|Konjugation|168|6|German Verb - conjugation.ogg}}
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;| 
!colspan=&quot;2&quot;|English

|-
!rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|singular!!1st person

|-
!2nd person
|you||'''-'''
|ihr||'''-t'''
|-
!3rd person
|they||'''-'''
|sie||'''-en'''*
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The form for ''you (polite)'' — ''Sie'' is exactly the same as for the plural, 3rd person pronoun ''they'' — ''sie''.


===Examples===

*''Was machst du?''
:What are you doing?
*''Ich spiele Basketball.''
:I'm playing basketball.
*''Spielst du Fußball?''
:Do you play soccer?
*''Ich mache Hausaufgaben.''
:I'm doing homework.
*''Er macht Hausaufgaben.''
:He's doing homework.
*''Machst/Treibst du Sport?''
:Do you play sports?

Note that in English one ''plays'' sport, while in German one ''does'' sport. You can also use the question words from [[German/Level I/Bitte_buchstabieren_Sie#Forming Questions|Lesson 3]] to form more combinations:

*''Warum spielst du Baseball?''
:Why do you play baseball?
*''Wann machst du die Hausaufgaben?''
:When do you do the/your homework?

To say &quot;not&quot;, use &quot;nicht&quot;. &quot;Nicht&quot; goes after the verb but before the sport. 

*''Wer spielt nicht Fußball?''
:Who doesn't play soccer?
*''Wir spielen nicht Tennis.''
:We don't play tennis.

===Compound Sentences===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Conjunctions|Verbindungen|72|2}}
!English||German
|-
|and||und
|-
|but||aber
|-
|or||oder
|}

Both German and English have compound sentences; the applications of these are enormous. They can be used in lists and also in compound sentences. For example,

*''Ich spiele Basketball und er spielt auch Basketball.''
:I play basketball, and he also plays basketball.

The new word, ''also — auch'' is very important. The one grammar rule about ''auch'' is that it always comes after the verb.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Spielen, Machen, and Other Verbs|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Other Verbs and Their Conjugations===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Grammar|Verbs|Verben|135|2}}
!English||German
|-
||(to) read||lesen
|-
||(to) watch||schauen
|-
||(to) see||sehen
|-
||(to) work||arbeiten
|-
||(to) write||schreiben
|-
||(to) swim||schwimmen
|}

''Schauen'', ''schreiben'' and ''schwimmen'' are all regular verbs; i.e., they follow regular conjugations. To conjugate them, you first remove the ''-en'' from the infinitive to form the stem (i.e., ''schau-'', ''schreib-'', and ''schwimm-''), and then add the correct ending. Here is an example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!verb (infinitive)||first step (stem)||conjugated form
|-
|schau'''en'''||schau-||ich schau'''e'''
|}

''Arbeiten'' is an irregular verb; however, it has a simple change. Whenever the ending starts with a consonant, an ''-e-'' is added before it. For example, ''du arbeit'''e'''st'' (not &lt;s&gt;''du arbeitst''&lt;/s&gt;). As well as ''er/sie/es/ihr arbeit'''e'''t'' (not &lt;s&gt;''er/sie/es/ihr arbeitt''&lt;/s&gt;).

''Lesen'' is also an irregular verb. For the second and third person singular the form is ''liest'', i.e., ''du/er/sie/es l'''ies'''t'' (not &lt;s&gt;''du lesst''&lt;/s&gt;). 

''Sehen'' is the last irregular verb. The second person singular is ''du s'''ie'''hst'' and the third person singular is ''er/sie/es s'''ie'''ht''.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Other Verbs and Their Conjugations|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

===Two More Verb Forms===

There are two common verb forms in English that just don't exist in German: the ing-form (or: present progressive); e.g., &quot;I am playing&quot; or &quot;he is making&quot;; and forms with &quot;to do&quot;; e.g., &quot;I do play&quot; or &quot;he does not play&quot;.

The simple rule is: these constructions don't exist in German. Thus, you should translate ''I am playing'' to ''ich spiele''. Similarly, ''I do play'' is also translated to ''ich spiele''. Anything else (&lt;s&gt;''ich mache spielen''&lt;/s&gt; or &lt;s&gt;''ich bin spielen''&lt;/s&gt;) is either not possible in German or has a different meaning.

The phrase ''I do not play'' should be translated to ''ich spiele nicht'' (literally: ''I play not'') since ''nicht'' (''not'') comes usually after the verb. This may sound like Early Modern English in a play by Shakespeare, and this is no coincidence since German and English are both West Germanic languages.

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Two More Verb Forms|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Expressing likes and dislikes==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Expressing likes and dislikes|Vorlieben und Abneigungen ausdrücken|1|2}}
!English||German
|-
|What do you like to do?||Was machst du gern*?
|-
|I like to play.||Ich spiele gerne*.
|-
|What do you like to play?||Was spielst du gerne*?
|-
|I like to play soccer.||Ich spiele gerne* Fußball.
|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''gern'' and ''gerne'' can be used interchangeably.

In German, there are several ways to express likes and dislikes; this is just one of them. You can also add other verbs for other activities, e.g., ''I like to read.'' — ''Ich lese gern.'' or ''I like to work.'' — ''Ich arbeite gern.'' or ''I like to watch TV.'' — ''Ich schaue gern Fernsehen.''

To express preference, you can use ''lieber'' instead of ''gern.'' For example, ''I prefer to play basketball.'' — ''Ich spiele lieber Basketball.'' or ''I prefer to read.'' — ''Ich lese lieber.''

To express favorite activities, you can use ''am liebsten'' (meaning ''most of all'') instead of ''lieber'' or ''gern''. For example, ''Most of all, I like to play chess.'' — ''Ich spiele am liebsten Schach.''

To express dislikes, you can use ''nicht gern'' instead of ''gern'', for example ''I don't like to swim.'' — ''Ich schwimme nicht gern.'' or ''I don't like to work.'' — ''Ich arbeite nicht gern.'' or ''I don't like to play soccer.'' — ''Ich spiele nicht gern Fußball.'' 

&lt;big&gt;[[/Problems#Expressing likes and dislikes|Section Problems]]&gt;&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

==Numbers==

Numbers are among the most important and most useful words: we need them to talk about time, amounts, money, etc. Even if you are &quot;just&quot; a tourist, you often cannot avoid numbers. Learning numbers can be a bit of a pain; thus, here is some advice: whenever you have time, count something in German; e.g., steps, cars, people, seconds, whatever: just count.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Numbers|Zahlen|536|2}}

|-

|-
|thousand||tausend (or: eintausend)
|-
|two thousand||zweitausend*
|-
|}
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some numbers are missing in the audio recording.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;Some people sometimes say ''zwo'' instead of ''zwei'' in order to distinguishing it more clearly from ''drei'' (''three''), especially on the phone. 


Notice the pattern: ''-teen'' translates to ''-zehn'', and ''-ty'' to ''-zig''.

There is one big problem with the numbers: in German the unit position comes before the tens and is connected by ''und'' (''and''). For example: ''twenty-three'' — ''dreiundzwanzig'' (literally: ''threeandtwenty''),
''twenty-four'' — ''vierundzwanzig'', ''thirty-five'' — ''fünfunddreißig'', ''forty-six'' — ''sechsundvierzig'', etc.

One exception is ''eins'' which becomes ''ein-'' in 21, 31, 41, etc.: ''twenty-one'' — ''einundzwanzig'' (literally: ''oneandtwenty''),
''thirty-one'' — ''einunddreißig'', ''forty-one'' — ''einundvierzig'', etc.

German is not the only language with this &quot;reverse&quot; order of numbers: Danish (another Germanic language) and Arabic do it the same way. This was also the standard way of forming numbers in older versions of English (&quot;Four and twenty blackbirds/Baked in a pie.&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_a_Song_of_Sixpence).

=What's On the Test=

To go straight to the lesson test, go [[/Test|here]].

The test will have four parts to it: Grammar (79 points), Translating (95 points), Reading Comprehension (20 points), Vocabulary (20 points), and Previous Topics (10 points) in that order. The Grammar section will test your ability to know the verbs from this lesson and its various versions, to know articles - the genders of them and the correct usage of them, and correct word order. 

The Translating section is worth the most points, and it too has three sections. You must know the translations for sentences and phrases going from English to German, and be able to take a German dialogue and translate it back into English. Also you must know the translation from Numbers to German.

The third section, Reading Comprehension, is Comprehension Questions you must know how to read the conversion and after reading you will be asked question on the previous conversion.

The fourth section is a vocabulary section. You get 20 English words on the left and 20 German words on the right, and be asked to match them. To study for that, check out the 401 flashcards related to this lesson at [http://www.flashcardexchange.com/flashcards/view/249128 FlashcardExchange.com]
''Part I'' and [http://www.flashcardexchange.com/flashcards/view/249218 FlashcardExchange.com] ''Part II''.

The last section, Previous Topics, is a quick review on [[German/Level I/Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]] to get ready for this section, just look at some past notes or go to [[German/Level I/Wie heißt du?|Lesson 1]] and study. That is the whole test. [[German/Level I/Freizeit/Test|Take it!]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{prognav|Perl|The if Control Structure|Operators}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

==Control structures==
The basic control structures do not differ greatly from those used in the [[Programming:C|C]] programming language or [[Programming:Java|Java]] programming language:

===Loops===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
while ($boolean) {
    # do something
}

until ($boolean) {
    # do something
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Though syntactically the same, perl does not use 'break' and 'continue' to change the flow of loops. Perl provides the following commands: (with C equivalents in comments)
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
while ($boolean) {
    # do something
    if($finished) {
        last;  # equivalent to 'break'
    }
    if($done) {
        next;  # equivalent to 'continue'
    }
    # do some more
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the statements in a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt;) loop are not executed, if the Boolean expression evaluates to false (or true, respectively) on the first pass, even when specified at the end of the code block. Therefore the following loops are functionally equivalent: (the same applies to: &lt;code&gt;do {} until&lt;/code&gt; )
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
while ($boolean) {
    # something
}

do {
    # something
} while ($boolean);
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The &lt;code&gt;do {} while&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;do {} until&lt;code&gt; loops are technically [[../Modifiers|statement modifiers]] and not actual control structures. The statements will be executed at least once.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
for (my $i=0 ; $i&lt;10 ; $i++) { # for (initialization; termination condition; incrementing expr) { ... }
    print &quot;$i\n&quot;;
}

foreach my $variable (@list) {
    print &quot;$variable\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;$variable&lt;/code&gt; is an alias to each element of the &lt;code&gt;@list&lt;/code&gt;, starting at the first element on the first pass through the loop. The loop is exited when all the elements in the list have been exhausted. Since &lt;code&gt;$variable&lt;/code&gt; is an alias, changing the value will change the value of the element in the ''list''. This should generally be avoided to enhance maintainability of the code.

If &lt;code&gt;$variable&lt;/code&gt; is omitted, the default variable &lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; will be used.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
foreach (@list) {
    print &quot;value: $_ \n&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; are actually synonyms and can be used interchangeably.

===If-then statements===
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ($boolean_expression) {
    # do something
}

unless ($boolean_expression) {
    # do something
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Statements with &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; blocks (these also work with &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;)

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
if ($boolean) {
    # do something
} else {
    # do something else
}

if ($boolean) {
    # do something
} elsif ($boolean) {
    # do something else
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Control statements can also be written with the conditional following the statements (called &quot;postfix&quot;). This syntax functions (nearly) identically to the ones given above. 

 ''statement'' if ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' unless ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' while ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' until ''Boolean expression'';
 ''statement'' foreach ''list'';

__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;
On 23 May 1995, John Gage, the director of the Science Office of the Sun Microsystems along with Marc Andreesen, co-founder and executive vice president at Netscape announced to an audience of SunWorld&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; that Java technology wasn't a myth and that it was a reality and that it was going to be incorporated into Netscape Navigator.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFEarlyYearsSun1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

At the time the total number of people working on Java was less than 30.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFEarlyYearsSun1&quot;/&gt; This team would shape the future in the next decade and no one had any idea as to what was in store. From being the mind of an unmanned vehicle on Mars to the operating environment on most of the consumer electronics, e.g. cable set-top boxes, VCRs, toasters and also for personal digital assistants (PDAs).&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFClarkLindseyHistory1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title = History of Java
|publisher = Lindsey, Clark S.
|accessdate = [[w:7 May|7 May]] [[w:2008|2008]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Java has come a long way from its inception. Let's see how it all began.

==Earlier programming languages==
Before Java emerged as a programming language, [[C++ Programming|C++]] was the dominant player in the trade. The primary goal of the creators of Java was to create a language that could tackle most of the things that C++ offered while getting rid of some of the more tedious tasks that came with the earlier languages.

Computer hardware went through a performance and price revolution from 1972 to 1991. Better, faster hardware was available at ever lower prices and the demand for big and complex software exponentially increased. To accommodate the demand, new development technologies were invented.

The C language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie had taken a decade to become the most popular language amongst programmers working on PCs and similar platforms (other languages, like COBOL and FORTRAN, dominated the mainframe market). But, with time programmers found that programming in C became tedious with its structural syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Structural syntax is a linear way of writing code. A program is interpreted usually at the first line of the program's code until it reaches the end. One cannot hook a later part of the program to an earlier one. The flow follows a linear top-to-bottom approach.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, people attempted to solve this problem, it would be later that a new development philosophy was introduced, one named ''Object-Oriented Programming''. With OOP, you can write code that can be reused later without rewriting the code over and over again. In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++, an enhancement to the C language with included OOP fundamentals and features.
. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

==The Green team==
[[Image:James Gosling 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|James Gosling, architect and designer of the compiler for the Java technology]]
Behind closed doors, a project was initiated in December of 1990, whose aim was to create a programming tool that could render obsolete the C and C++ programming languages. Engineer Patrick Naughton had become extremely frustrated with the state of Sun's C++ and C APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and tools. While he was considering to move towards [[w:NeXT|NeXT]], he was offered a chance to work on new technology and the ''Stealth Project'' was started, a secret nobody but he knew.

This Stealth Project was later named the ''Green Project'' when James Gosling and Mike Sheridan joined Patrick.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFEarlyYearsSun1&quot;/&gt; Over the period of time that the Green Project teethed, the prospects of the project started becoming clearer to the engineers working on it. No longer was its aim to create a new language far superior to the present ones, but it aimed to target the language to devices other than the computer.

Staffed at 13 people, they began work in a small office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California. This team would be called ''Green Team'' henceforth in time. The project they underwent was chartered by Sun Microsystems to anticipate and plan for the &quot;next-wave&quot; in computing. For the team, this meant at least one significant trend, that of the convergence of digitally controlled consumer devices and computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFEarlyYearsSun1&quot;/&gt;
{{-}}

==Reshaping thought==
The team started thinking of replacing C++ with a better version, a faster version, a responsive version. But the one thing they hadn't thought of, as of yet, was that the language they were aiming for had to be developed for an [[w:embedded system|embedded system]] with limited resources. An '''embedded system''' is a computer system scaled to a minimalistic interface demanding only a few functions from its design. For such a system, C++ or any successor would seem too large as all the languages at the time demanded a larger footprint than what was desired. The team thus had to think in a different way to go about solving all these problems.

Co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy, envisioned a language combining the power of Mesa and C in a paper he wrote for the engineers at Sun named ''Further''. Gathering ideas, Gosling began work on enhancing C++ and named it &quot;C++ ++ --&quot;, a pun on the evolutionary structure of the language's name. The ++ and -- meant, ''putting in'' and ''taking out stuff''. He soon abandoned the name and called it '''Oak'''&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFEarlyYearsSun1&quot;/&gt; after the tree that stood outside his office.

==The demise of an idea, birth of another==
By now, the work on Oak had been significant but come the year 1993, people saw the demise of set-top boxes, interactive TV and the PDAs. A failure that completely ushered the inventors' thoughts to be reinvented. Only a miracle could make the project a success now. And such a miracle awaited anticipation.

[[w:National Center for Supercomputing Applications|National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA) had just unveiled its new commercial web browser for the internet the previous year. The focus of the team, now diverted towards where they thought the &quot;next-wave&quot; of computing would be &amp;mdash; the internet. The team then divulged into the realms of creating the same embeddable technology to be used in the web browser space calling it an '''[[Java_Programming/Applets|applet]]''' &amp;mdash; ''a small application''. Keeping all of this in mind, the team created a list of features tackling the C++ problems. In their opinion, the project should&amp;nbsp;...

* ..&amp;nbsp;be simple and gather tested fundamentals and features from the earlier languages in it,
* ..&amp;nbsp;have standard sets of APIs with basic and advanced features bundled with the language,
* ..&amp;nbsp;get rid of concepts requiring direct manipulation of hardware (in this case, memory) to make the language safe,
* ..&amp;nbsp;be platform independent and may written for every platform once (giving birth to the [[w:Write once, run anywhere|WORA]] idiom),
* ..&amp;nbsp;be able to manipulate network programming out-of-the-box,
* ..&amp;nbsp;be embeddable in web browsers, and&amp;nbsp;...
* ..&amp;nbsp;have the ability for a single program to multi-task and do multiple things at the same time.

The team now needed a proper identity and they decided on naming the new technology they created Java ushering a new generation of products for the internet boom. A by-product of the project was a cartoon named &quot;[[w:Duke (mascot)|Duke]]&quot; created by Joe Parlang which became its identity then.

Finally at the SunWorld&lt;SUP&gt;TM&lt;/SUP&gt; conference, Andreesen unveiled the new technology to the masses. Riding along with the explosion of interest and publicity in the Internet, Java quickly received widespread recognition and expectations grew for it to become the dominant software for browser and consumer applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFClarkLindseyHistory1&quot;/&gt;

Initially Java was owned by Sun Microsystems, but later it was released to open source; the term Java was a trademark of Sun Microsystems. Sun released the source code for its HotSpot Virtual Machine and compiler in November 2006, and most of the source code of the class library in May 2007. Some parts were missing because they were owned by third parties, not by Sun Microsystems. The released parts were published under the terms of the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]], a free software license.

== Versions ==
Unlike C and C++, Java's growth is pretty recent. Here, we'd quickly go through the development paths that Java took with age.
[[Image:Java Development Path.svg|thumb|center|800px|Development of Java over the years. From version 1.0 to version 1.7, Java has displayed a steady growth.]]

===Initial Release (versions 1.0 and 1.1)===
Introduced in 1996 for the [[w:Solaris Operating Environment|Solaris]], [[w:Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[w:Mac OS|Mac OS]] Classic and [[w:Linux|Linux]], Java was initially released as the Java Development Kit 1.0 (JDK 1.0). This included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g., JDK 1.0).

===Java 2 (version 1.2)===
Introduced in 1998 as a quick fix to the former versions, version 1.2 was the start of a new beginning for Java. The JDKs of version 1.2 and later versions are often called ''Java 2'' as well. For example, the official name of JDK 1.4 is ''The Java(TM) 2 Platform, Standard Edition version 1.4''.
:Major changes include:
:* Rewrite the event handling (add [[Java Programming/Event Handling|Event Listeners]])
:* Change Thread synchronizations
:* Introduction of the JIT-Just in time compilers

===Kestrel (Java 1.3)===
Released in 8 May 2000. The most notable changes were:
* HotSpot JVM included (the HotSpot JVM was first released in April, 1999 for the J2SE 1.2 JVM)
* RMI was modified to support optional compatibility with CORBA
* JavaSound
* Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) included in core libraries (previously available as an extension)
* Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA)
* Synthetic proxy classes

===Merlin (Java 1.4)===
Released in 6 February 2002, Java 1.4 has improved programmer productivity by expanding language features and available APIs:
* Assertion
* Regular Expression
* XML processing
* Cryptography and Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
* Non-blocking I/O (NIO)
* Logging

===Tiger (version 1.5.0; Java SE 5)===
Released in September 2004
:Major changes include:
:* [[Java Programming/Generics|Generics]] - Provides compile-time type safety for collections :and eliminates the drudgery of casting.
:* [[Java Programming/Classes, Objects and Types#Autoboxing/unboxing|Autoboxing/unboxing]] - Eliminates the drudgery of manual conversion between primitive types (such as int) and wrapper types (such as Integer).
:* Enhanced for - Shorten the for loop with Collections use.
:* Static imports - Lets you import all the static part of a class.
:* [[Java Programming/Annotation|Annotation]]/Metadata - Enabling tools to generate code and deployment descriptors from annotations in the source code. This leads to a &quot;declarative&quot; programming style where the programmer says what should be done and tools emit the code to do it. Annotations can be inspected through source parsing or by using the additional reflection APIs added in Java 5.
:* JVM Improvements -  Most of the run time library is now mapped into memory as a memory image, as opposed to being loaded from a series of class files. Large portion of the runtime libraries will now be shared among multiple JVM instances.

===Mustang (version 1.6.0; Java SE 6)===
Released on 11 December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;CITEREFSunJava61&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/presskits/2006-1211/

What's New in Java SE 6:
* Web Services - First-class support for writing XML web service client applications.

* Scripting - You can now mix in JavaScript technology source code, useful for prototyping. Also useful when you have teams with a variety of skill sets. More advanced developers can plug in their own scripting engines and mix their favorite scripting language in with Java code as they see fit.

* Database - No more need to find and configure your own JDBC database when developing a database application. Developers will also get the updated JDBC 4.0, a well-used API with many important improvements, such as special support for XML as an SQL datatype and better integration of Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) and Character Large OBjects (CLOBs) into the APIs.

* More Desktop APIs - GUI developers get a large number of new tricks to play like the ever popular yet newly incorporated SwingWorker utility to help you with threading in GUI apps, JTable sorting and filtering, and a new facility for quick splash screens to quiet impatient users.

* Monitoring and Management - The really big deal here is that you don't need to do anything special to the startup to be able to attach on demand with any of the monitoring and management tools in the Java SE platform.

* Compiler Access - Really aimed at people who create tools for Java development and for frameworks like JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Personal Home Page construction kit (PHP) engines that need to generate a bunch of classes on demand, the compiler API opens up programmatic access to javac for in-process compilation of dynamically generated Java code. The compiler API is not directly intended for the everyday developer, but for those of you deafened by your screaming inner geek, roll up your sleeves and give it a try. And the rest of us will happily benefit from the tools and the improved Java frameworks that use this.

* Pluggable Annotations allows programmer to write annotation processor so that it can analyse your code semantically before javac compiles. For example, you could write an annotation processor that verifies whether your program obeys naming conventions.

* Desktop Deployment - At long last, Java SE 6 unifies the Java Plug-in technology and Java WebStart engines, which just makes sense. Installation of the Java WebStart application got a much needed makeover.

* Security - Java SE 6 has simplified the job of its security administrators by providing various new ways to access platform-native security services, such as native Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and cryptographic services on Microsoft Windows for secure authentication and communication, Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos services for authentication, and access to LDAP servers for authenticating users.

* The -lities: Quality, Compatibility, Stability - Bug fixes ...

===Dolphin (version 1.7.0; Java SE 7)===

'''Perl''' is a programming language designed by [[w:Larry Wall|Larry Wall]], known today for its strong community and module archive [[Perl Programming/CPAN|CPAN]]. It was originally developed to process text and produce reports.  As a result, a backronym has been formed from its name: '''P'''ractical '''E'''xtraction and '''R'''eport '''L'''anguage. It makes extensive use of significant punctuation, and highly chaotic-looking code has been written in it. This has resulted in a less complimentary backronym (which is still embraced by Perl users): '''P'''athologically '''E'''clectic '''R'''ubbish '''L'''ister (said to be a quote from the language designer himself).

Perl is Free Software, available under the Artistic License and the GPL. 
It was developed on Unix, and its Unix roots are pervasive. Perl is available for most operating systems but is particularly prevalent on Unix and Unix-like systems, and is growing in popularity on Microsoft Windows systems. However, it has been ported to a multitude of environments (some say as many as Java). It's a popular systems administration tool in Windows. Most of the things done in Perl transfer well from one operating system to another (provided suggested conventions are followed).

As an example of Perl in action, until January 2002 the software running Wikipedia was a CGI script written in Perl (Usemod programmed by Clifford Adams; still available at http://usemod.com). 

Another example is Slashdot, which runs on the Perl-based Slashcode software.

When used on the web, Perl is often used in conjunction with the Apache web server and its [[Apache/mod_perl|mod_perl]] module.  This embeds the perl binary into the webserver so the CGI script need not fire up a new copy each time it's accessed.  Other features such as database connection persistence greatly reduce the access times to the page.

==History==
The [[Perl Programming|Perl]] programming language was created by Larry Wall in 1987. It borrows features from [[C programming language|C]], sed, awk, shell scripting (sh), and (to a lesser extent) from many other programming languages as well. The name is normally capitalized (&quot;Perl&quot;) when referring to the language, but not capitalized (&quot;perl&quot;) when referring to the interpreter (e.g. ''&quot;Only perl properly parses Perl.&quot;'')

== Rationale  ==
Perl was designed to be a practical language to extract information from text files and generate reports. One of its mottos is ''There is more than one way to do it'' (TIMTOWTDI - pronounced 'Tim Toady'). Another is ''Perl: the Swiss Army Chainsaw of Programming Languages''. One stated design goal is to make easy tasks easy and difficult tasks possible. Its versatility permits versions of many programming paradigms: [[Programming Languages/Procedural Languages|procedural]], [[Programming Languages/Functional Languages|functional]], and [[Object Oriented Programming|object-oriented]] &amp;mdash; though purists object to Perl's as it is not a cleanly designed language. Perl has a powerful regular expression support built in directly to the syntax. Perl is often considered the archetypal [[Subject:Scripting languages|scripting]] language and has been called the &quot;glue that holds the web together&quot;, as it is one of the most popular [[../CGI/]] languages. Its function as a &quot;glue language&quot; can be described broadly as its ability to tie together different systems and data structures that were not designed to be tied together.

==Learning objectives==

Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to

* Understand SyncML fundamentals and general syntax.
* Understand how and why SyncML is implemented.
* Quickly locate and use SyncML technical specifications.

=Introduction= 

Mobile devices such as PDAs, pagers, mobile phones and laptops are- by nature- not always connected to a network.  Yet these devices contain applications which require information obtained from a network in order to be useful.  While most PDAs and mobile phones contain applications such as calendars, task lists, and address books for storing useful information, this information is far less useful when it is static, only available on the device itself.  For example, copies of static information will always be dissimilar when changes are made on one copy or the other.  Synchronization offers a device the ability to connect to a network in order to update either the information on the device or the information on the network, such that both sets of information are identical and up-to-date.

Given the proliferation of proprietary mobile devices and protocols, as well as the increasing consumer demand for ubiquitous mobile access of information, leading technology companies saw the need to create a standard, universal language for describing the synchronization actions between devices and applications.  They formed a consortium to sponsor the SyncML initiative to create this language.  

Currently, the SyncML consortium has been adopted and incorporated into the [http://www.openmobilealliance.org Open Mobile Alliance], a larger group of over 300 companies which sponsors many collaborative technology projects and protocols.

=What is SyncML?=

SyncML or ''Synchronization Markup Language'' is an XML-based, industry-standard protocol for synchronizing mobile data across a variety of multiple networks, platforms and devices.  SyncML started as an initiative in mid 2000 by major technology companies such as Ericsson, IBM, Palm Inc., Lotus, Matsushita Ltd. (Panasonic), Motorola, Nokia, Openwave, Starfish Software, Psion and Symbian.  Their initiative's goals were to create a universal language from the myriad, proprietary, synchronization protocols used by mobile devices and provide a complete set of synchronization functionality for future devices.  The consortium released version 1.0 in December 2000.  They then implemented new features and resolved issues with the subsequent version releases, finalizing the protocol with version 1.1 in February 2002.

The SyncML protocol is designed with these goals in mind:

* As a common language, any device should be able to synchronize with any SyncML service (a networked data repository).
* Any service speaking SyncML should be able to synchronize with any SyncML-capable device.
* The protocol must address the limitations of mobile devices, specifically with respect to memory storage.
* It must support a variety of transport protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, Bluetooth and others.
* It must deliver common synchronization commands to all devices.
* It builds upon existing web technologies, specifically XML.
* Support asynchronous communication and error-handling, since the Internet has latency.

SyncML consists of client and server commands enclosed within DTD-defined...

=SyncML Fundamentals=

==Vocabulary==
Let's begin by defining a vocabulary:

* Client - the mobile device, its application and local database.
* Server - a remote system communicating to the system database or application.
* Modifications - data in fields in a database are changed.
* Sync - The client and server exchange SyncML messages with commands.
* Package - SyncML DTD conformant XML markup describing requests or actions to be taken by either a SyncML client or server. A package is a collection of actions to be performed
* Message - the smallest unit of SyncML markup.  Large packages are broken into separate messages.
* Mapping - using an intermediate identifier to tie two pieces of information together.  example: let's say 'green' is '5', and '5' is nice.  What is nice?  If you said 'green' you are correct. You've just done mapping!

Abbreviations:

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| [[../IMEI/]] || International Mobile Equipment Identifier
|-
| GUID || Global Unique Identifier
|-
| LUID || Local Unique Identifier
|}

==Messages and Packages==

SyncML messages are requests from either a client or server to perform some action.  The action may be to synchronize data, perform some checks on data, update a status, or handle any errors with these actions.  Messages are bundled together as packages, as kind of a to-do list.  Messages are a laundry list of requests, and they can be pieced together out of order if sufficient mapping information is given to identify to which package the message belongs.

SyncML is designed this way to accommodate for errors and dropped messages.  Should one message be dropped, a syncML client or server will know there is a problem because the mapping cannot be completed.  It will then issue a request for the information to be resent.  Once the data is received, the updates to the information can proceed.

==Structure of a SyncML message==

Like SOAP, there are two parts to the SyncML message, a Sync Header &lt;SyncHdr&gt; and Sync Body &lt;SyncBody&gt;.  The header contains meta-information about the request, such as the target database &lt;Target&gt; and source database &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;Source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; URIs, Authentication information  &lt;Cred&gt;, the session ID &lt;SessionID&gt;, the message ID &lt;MsgID&gt;, and SyncML version declaration &lt;VerDTD&gt;.  The body contains the actual requests, alerts and data.

==Addressing==

Addressing is done through the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;LocURI&gt; tags.  A server will have a familiar URI like &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.chris.syncml.org/sync&lt;/nowiki&gt; and a client mobile device will have an IMEI identification number like this 30400495959596904.

==Mapping==

SyncML is based on the idea that clients and servers can have their own way of mapping information in their databases.  Therefore, clients and servers must each have their own set of unique identifiers.

* Locally Unique Identifiers (LUID) are numbers assigned by the client to a data object in a local database (like a field or a row). They are non-reusable numbers assigned to these objects by the SyncML client.
* Globally Unique Identifiers (GUID) are numbers assigned to a data object for use in a remote database. This identifier is assigned by the server.

LUID and GUID numbers only have to be unique if they are being used in a table between two communicating parties.  In other words, these numbers are temporary, used for mapping data to tables and only really exist for the complete duration of transactions between client and server.

The server will create a mapping table to tie the LUID and GUID together.

== Change Logs ==

The Server and Client track of changes made to their databases during synchronization through &quot;change logs&quot;.  SyncML doesn't define the change logs, instead SyncML does require that the changes and corrections be negotiated between client and server through messages.  Using change logs, the Client and Server know which fields need to be updated. The implementation of change tracking in the application which will use SyncML is not defined.

== Sync Anchors ==

During Synchronization, the Client and Server need to know which fields to update. If a client/server application is checking the fields prior to updating/modifying them, how then does the client/server keep track of the position of current field in the database?  The answer is &quot;by using Sync Anchors&quot;.

There are two kinds of Anchors : Last and Next. The 'Last' anchor describes which updates occurred during the last synchronization event.  The 'Next' anchor describes the current and future synchronization request.  These anchors describe the events from the standpoint of the sending device.

Anchors are sent back and forth from client and server to keep track of what is happening to the database fields and what's going on in overall through the lifetime of the sync operation.

By coordinating Sync Anchors and change logs with the type of Sync that is requested, the server application can determine and track (with change logs) which information is the most up-to-date.  For example, it is possible to overwrite 'newer' information- that is information for which there is the most recent time-stamp in the change log- with older information.  This could be done by choosing a sync in which the client tells the server to overwrite it's information with client data.  This is called a 'refresh sync from client'.  The types of syncs are described below.

==Syncs==

There are seven types of Syncs in the SyncML 1.1 language.  The following section describes the types of syncs:

# '''Two-way Sync''' - The client and server exchange information about modified data. The client sends the modifications first.
# '''Slow sync''' - a two-way sync in which all fields in the database are checked on a field-to-field basis. This type of sync is used for the first sync, or after a synchronization failure.
# '''One-way sync, client only''' - the client sends the modified data first. The server accepts and updates the data and does not send its modifications.
# '''Refresh sync from client''' - the client sends the entire database to the server. The server does not sync.   Rather, the server replaces the target database with the client's database.
# '''One-way sync, server only''' - the server sends the modified data first. The client accepts and updates the data and does not send its modifications.
# '''Refresh sync from server''' - the server sends all its information from a database to the client, replacing the client's database.
# '''Server alerted sync''' - the server remotely commands the client to initiate one of the above sync types with the server.  In this way, the server is remotely-controlling the client.

==Sync Initiation==

Sync Initiation is the process the client and server must go through prior to an actual Synchronization.  The first step is for the client and server to speak the same language, exchanging and revealing each other's capabilities (as defined by device, as in amount of memory, and protocol as defined by DTD).  The second step is identification of the databases to be synchronized.  Next the two must decide on the type of synchronization.  The third and final step is authentication.  Once this step is completed successfully, the synchronization activities can begin. 


==Authentication==

The SyncML server can send the client a message containing the &lt;Chal&gt; tag in order to represent an authentication challenge to the information the client is attempting to access.  The client must then respond, giving the username and password within the &lt;Cred&gt; tag.

SyncML uses MD5 digest access authentication.  The Client and Server exchange credentials during the authentication process, returning error codes if the process breaks down at some point.  The &lt;Cred&gt; tag is used in the &lt;SyncHdr&gt; for holding the credentials to be used for authentication.

=Common SyncML implementations=

Nokia was the first company to make a SyncML-enabled phone.  It synchronized the calendar database on the phone.  SyncML can synchronize to-do lists, calendars, address books, phone-books, pretty much anything an organizer can do.  SyncML is capable of much more.  It would be appropriate to use SyncML any time there are two disparate, remote applications which need to share the same data.

Notice lines {1} and {18} start the SyncML file with the root tags.  Next, the SyncHdr is defined by lines {2} and {8}. Further, lines {3,4} define the versioning information, line {5} defines the sessionID to distinguish which unique dialogue is occurring between client and server applications, line {6} shows the MsgID to uniquely identify this set of requests (this entire markup) to be performed by the requested application.  Also in the syncHeader are credentials, on line {7}.  

The SyncBody begins on line {9}.  In this part of the syncML message, device/application status {10}, target/source URIs {12,13}, and requested actions such as the sync itself between lines {11,16}, Add and Replace {14,15} commands are given.

==WBXML and SyncML==

WAP Binary XML (WBXML) is a form of XML whereby the XML tags are abbreviated in order to shorten the markup for transmission to mobile devices, which commonly have bandwidth and memory limitations.  The XML tags are encoded into a binary shorthand to save space.  Let's take a look at an example so that this will make more sense.

The following is WBXML binary code depicting a SyncML message.  Notice in the first line there is a the document type definition, represented here in hexadecimal tokens.  Can you see what happens to the following string?  &quot;//SYNCML//DTD SYNCML 1.1//EN&quot; 

[[File:xml_wbxml.png|wbxml]]

Immediately following this string are the characters '6D 6C 71'.  Each of these represent a SyncML tag.

So you can see how using WBXML shorthand would be a more compact means of representing XML, saving bandwidth for mobile devices.

=SyncML specifications=

The best source of information on SyncML is the protocol itself.  Visit the Open Mobile Alliance for the SyncML specifications.

==Open Mobile Alliance==

Download [http://www.openmobilealliance.org/syncml/technology.html OMA SyncML Specifications and white papers] at the [http://www.openmobilealliance.org Open Mobile Alliance].  Or check out the [http://www.openmobilealliance.org/syncml/downloads.html SyncML Articles] at the [http://www.openmobilealliance.org Open Mobile Alliance].

=SyncML Implementations=

Although the SyncML specifications are useful, you still have to implement the protocol in your application. There are a few toolkits and implementations out there that you can use to get a head start.

==SyncML Reference Toolkit==
The Open Mobile Alliance has released a toolkit written in C to demonstrate SyncML. You can get it [http://sourceforge.net/projects/syncml-ctoolkit/ here]. If you can read German, you can get a sample application using the toolkit [http://www.misterm.de/diplom/index.html here].

==Funambol==
Interested in developing SyncML for Java?  Check out the open source project [https://www.forge.funambol.org/ Funambol]. It offers a Java and C++ SDK that implements the SyncML data synchronization protocol, a Java-based application framework for building SyncML server applications, and a standalone SyncML server.

=Summary=

Mobile Device Technology is improving and changing at a rapid pace.  As US telecommunication companies implement Third generation (3G) WCDMA technology (wide-band code-division multiple access), or wireless broadband, we will begin to see powerful devices emerge on the market.  These devices will be able to deliver full color, video, streaming multimedia and a variety of data services such as Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) through WAP.  In that infrastructure is becoming cheaper, these telecommunication companies are starting to shift towards being service providers and media vendors as opposed to communications utilities.  Cingular wireless, multimedia messaging and ringtones services are a good example of the shift of their company towards being a ''media platform''.  The companies that will survive will be the ones that listen to customers needs and make easy-to-use services.

Telecommunications companies can add value to their services by creating custom applications and services that use SyncML for synchronization.

=Exercises=

# Visit the Open Mobile Alliance Website, download the pdf of the SyncML v. 1.1 protocol and review it.  Reading this reference is a valuable exercise in learning.  
# Answer these questions:
#* What is WBXML and why is it used?
#* How do you foresee SyncML being used in the future?
#* Name a problematic situation whereby SyncML is the best 'tool' for the job.

&lt;font size=&quot;-3&quot;&gt;''Answers: 2a) WBXML is Wap Binary XML, it is a form of XML whereby the XML tags are abbreviated in order to shorten the markup for transmission to mobile devices, which commonly have bandwidth and memory limitations. 2b)  SyncML will likely be used as a general, standard syncing mechanism for synchronizing data sets between systems, not just for mobile devices. 2c) A ticket-tracking system called TNT helpdesk is a web-based open work request management system.  The staff running this system would like to have live data from this system on their PDAs, listing open requests.  Currently, the PDA database is synced via a docking sync station attached to the staff members' PCs.  Staff members have to download the request list as a CSV file, convert it into a usable PDA database and upload it to the PDA, making it this process cumbersome, prone to error, and always out-of-date.  Recommendation: Create a custom app to push live updates to the PDAs using SyncML over Bluetooth/Wireless''&lt;/font&gt;

== Introduction ==

With the explosion of the late 90's popularity of the internet, The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) saw the need to extend the capabilities of the web with respect to information structure and media presentation.  This is how they arrived at XML, the extensible language for describing information structure.  Furthermore, SMIL is built upon XML: it is a specialized language to describe the presentation of media objects.  Since the W3C (and everyone else) doesn't know what media types will be around in the future (virtual environments, brainwave-synch experiences, psychic/holographic/video), XML was an appropriate choice in designing SMIL to be extended to support these media.

In order to integrate this technology with HTML and extend the application of media in HTML, the W3C decided to make a push towards modularizing these languages or protocols.  SMIL is one of many modular languages which 'plug-in' to the larger framework of XML.

=== What is SMIL? ===

SMIL (pronounced &quot;smile&quot;) is an acronym for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language.  It is thought of as an open-standard version of PowerPoint for the internet.  SMIL is an XML-based language, similar in appearance to HTML, that allows for the authoring of interactive audiovisual presentations. SMIL enables the streaming of audio and video with images, text or other media types.  It is a language describing the temporal and spacial placement of one or more media objects.  Although SMIL can be written with a simple text editor, hand-writing SMIL documents can be a time-consuming and complicated endeavor.  Therefore it is better to use a tool for generating complicated SMIL documents.

=== World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) SYMM group ===

Since November 1997, the [http://www.w3c.org W3C] SYMM group has been developing the SMIL language.  It finalized SMIL 1.0 in June of 1998 and SMIL 2.0 in August of 2001.

=== Why SMIL? ===

Although plug-ins and media players have the ability to show many different types of media with varying support for interaction, only SMIL offers the ability to define the presentation in the form of text as a script.  This feature could be called media composition.  This is a powerful ability when you think about it: text presentations can be generated from other applications.  Also, SMIL offers [http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access/ accessibility options] and powerful features not present in these media players.

* Macromedia products such as ''Flash'', which require a plug-in to view flash inside a web page.
* RealAudio's ''Realplayer''
* Microsoft's ''PowerPoint''
* OpenOffice.org's ''Impress''
* Apple's ''Quicktime''
* Microsoft has already created a proprietary alternative to SMIL. It is called [http://www.webaim.org/techniques/captions/windows/ Microsoft's Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange (SAMI)], which plays ASX files through Windows Media Player (WiMP).

Given that SMIL is extensible, the SMIL language has the ability to show many of proprietary objects which are used by the above players.  SMIL was designed to be the overarching language for describing the presentation of all media, all layouts and interactive controls.  Therefore, SMIL is not a substitute for flash, mpeg-4, or HTML.  Rather, it is a new standard for describing and using all of these.

=== SMIL History ===

SMIL is still being developed.  Currently, attempts are being made to make SMIL easier to use in web browsers.  Since SMIL is XML, the W3C developed the latest standard as an addendum to the hybrid of XML and HTML (XHTML).  The following is an outline of the history of SMIL.

* The SMIL 1.0 specification defined the layout and time sequence of multimedia elements.
* The HTML+TIME specification introduced Timing, Linking, Media, and Content controls  to HTML elements.
* The SMIL 2.0 specification brought interactivity (i.e.: HTML+TIME) such as media linking and controls.
* BHTML proposal included transitions to be used in SMIL 2.0
* Finally, the XHTML+SMIL specification extends SMIL 2.0 capabilities to XHTML elements.

When fully realized and implemented in the latest web browsers, XHTML+SMIL will be able to define how media elements can be controlled.  HTML supports only static images and links.  Web browsers use plug-ins to show videos and other media objects, so the control and interaction of the objects is left to the implementation of the plug-in.  With XHTML+SMIL, the supported objects can be placed, moved or displayed according to a time-frame, interacted with using custom controls, and linked to other media objects, web pages or presentations. And since XML is extensible, support for more media objects is on the horizon.  This technology has the potential to make the WWW far more interactive, allowing presenters far more control over presentations.

The current SMIL 2.0 is comprehensive and fairly complete.  It is divided into modules which describe different aspects of the presentation.  For example, there is a structure module to describe the structure of the SMIL document itself, and there is a metadata module for describing what the SMIL document is all about.  Modularity is useful for extending the SMIL schemas on a module-to-module basis when necessary, without causing unwanted interactions with the elements in other modules.

== Implementing SMIL ==

=== Common SMIL implementations ===

* Internet or Intranet presentations.
* Slide show presentations.
* Presentations which link to other SMIL files.
* Presentations which have Control buttons (stop, start, next, ...)
* Defining sequences and duration of multimedia elements.
* Defining position and visibility of multimedia elements.
* Displaying multiple media types such as audio, video, text
* Displaying multiple files at the same time.
* Displaying files from multiple web servers.

Currently, SMIL's most widespread usage is with MMS.  MMS (Multimedia Messaging System) is a mobile device technology that is used as an envelope for sending multimedia messages to cellphones.  SMIL content is placed inside the MMS message along with any associated media binaries.  In this context, MMS is a kind of transport mechanism for SMIL.

=== SMIL files and MIME Types ===

*SMIL files have the extension *.smil (but can also have *.sml, *.smi)
*SMIL files contain tags and content necessary for showing a presentation.  This includes the layout of multimedia elements, the timeline for the elements and the source for the multimedia files.

In order for a MIME user-agent to recognize SMIL 2.0 files, the user-agent needs to be defined:

* application/smil          [deprecated]
* application/smil+xml             [current MIME type]
* application/xhtml+smil             [MIME type for embedding smil in XHTML]

When adding this new mime-type to a web browser, the definition will need to include the 'smil' extension.

=== SMIL Schema ===

The following hyperlink will direct you to the SMIL 2.0 Schemas, provided by the W3C.org.  The main schema is a general description of SMIL 2.0 modules. It is followed by each module's schema. The main schema contains the include statements for all of the module's schemas.

[http://www.w3.org/TR/smil20/smil-SCHEMA.html#language W3C.Org's SMIL Schema description]

=== SMIL Namespace Declarations === 

SMIL 2.0 files need to have the following namespace declaration in the beginning &lt;smil&gt; tag:

&lt;small&gt;SMIL 2.0 namespace&lt;/small&gt;

== SMIL Syntax ==

=== Guidelines and Rules ===

SMIL documents look a lot like HTML.  SMIL files need to be written according to the following rules:

* SMIL documents must follow the ''XML rules of well-formedness''.
* SMIL tags are ''case sensitive''. 
* All SMIL tags are written with ''lowercase letters''.
* SMIL documents ''must'' start with a &lt;smil&gt; tag and end with a &lt;/smil&gt; closing tag.
* SMIL documents ''must'' contain a &lt;body&gt; tag for storing the contents of the presentation.
* SMIL documents can have a &lt;head&gt; element (like HTML) for storing metadata information about the document itself, as well as presentation layout information.

=== SMIL template ===

=== An example SMIL ===

&lt;small&gt;Example SMIL which has in-line text and an image&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;smil xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/Language&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;layout&gt;
&lt;root-layout width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;
&lt;region id=&quot;text1_region&quot; left=&quot;0&quot; top=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;120&quot;/&gt;

&lt;region id=&quot;text3_region&quot; left=&quot;80&quot; top=&quot;60&quot; width=&quot;160&quot; height=&quot;120&quot;/&gt;
&lt;region id=&quot;image_region&quot; left=&quot;0&quot; top=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/layout&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;seq&gt;
&lt;text src=&quot;data:text/plain,First%20Slide&quot; region=&quot;text1_region&quot; dur=&quot;2s&quot;/&gt;
&lt;text src=&quot;data:text/plain,Second%20Slide&quot; region=&quot;text2_region&quot; dur=&quot;3s&quot;/&gt;
&lt;text src=&quot;data:text/plain,Third%20Slide&quot; region=&quot;text3_region&quot; dur=&quot;3s&quot;/&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;sample_jpg.jpg&quot; region=&quot;image_region&quot; dur=&quot;3s&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/seq&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/smil&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that when using in-line text instead of referring to separate plain-text files as the text source, you will have to encode the text for any non-alphanumeric characters.  This example uses '%20' in lines {13,14,15} as a space character.  Also note that in line {13} the source for the text content begins with 'data:text/plain'.  In SMIL 2.0 this is the default mime-type for text sources, so specifying it here is optional.  In SMIL 1.0, however, this would have to be specified in order to use inline text.

== SMIL 2.0 Modules ==

SMIL 2.0 divides the language description by functionality into ten modules.  Each module contains elements to describe structure, content, actions or attributes.  The following 10 modules are associated with the SMIL 2.0 namespace.

   1. Timing  
   2. Time Manipulations
   3. Animation
   4. Content Control
   5. Layout
   6. Linking
   7. Media Objects 
   8. Metainformation 
   9. Structure 
  10. Transitions

The '''timing''' module provides a framework of elements to decide whether elements appear concurrently, in sequence, or out of order and called by interactive events such as clicking on a hyperlink.

The '''time manipulations''' module provides the ability to associate media objects with time-related information such the as length of time a media object should be displayed, and a description of the timeline used as a frame of reference for the timing module.

The '''animation''' module allows media objects to be placed on a timeline defined by the time manipulations module.

The '''content control''' module allows for choices of which content is played, depending on such things as language and playback capabilities, using tags such as '''switch''' present a test of the system's capabilities.

The '''layout''' module contains elements that describe the spacial placement of media objects in the presentation.

The '''linking''' module describes hyperlinks and linking references to media objects. 

The '''media objects''' module describes the pathing and typing of media objects.

The '''metainformation''' module contains elements that describe meta information about the SMIL file itself or the media objects it contains.

The '''structure''' module is a framework to describe the structure of the SMIL file such as the head and body and SMIL elements.

The '''transitions''' module is a framework to describe transitions such as wiping and fading between the presentation of media objects.

== Viewing a SMIL file ==

In order to view a SMIL presentation, a client will need to have a SMIL player installed on his/her computer.  Currently, Apple's Quicktime player, Windows Media Player (WiMP) and RealNetworks RealPlayer are among the most popular media players.

It would be convenient to be able to show these SMIL files natively in web browser, eliminating the requirement of a separate SMIL player or plug-in.  Currently, Microsoft's Internet Explorer has limited support for SMIL features.  The open-source Mozilla project is slowly incorporating SMIL and other XML-related technologies such as SVG and MathML into their browsers, but progress is slow.  It is possible they are waiting for these XML-based languages to mature.

== Embedding SMIL files into XHTML web pages ==

As mentioned, SMIL is not yet native to web browsers, so in order to put SMIL in a web page, one must embed it and open it in a plug-in.  Embedding SMIL files into web pages is somewhat beyond the scope of this chapter.  However, should you have a need to do this, the following links are included as references to help you.

* Embedding a SMIL file is easy to do with [http://developer.apple.com/documentation/QuickTime/IQ_InteractiveMovies/quicktimeandsmil/chapter_10_section_5.html  Apple's Quicktime] media player.
* Use the Windows Media Player to view SMIL files in a web page on a non-IE browser.
* The Internet Explorer 5.5+ browser has support for SMIL.  
* Visit [http://www.w3schools.com/smil/smil_html.asp this W3Schools page] for details on how to use SMIL in IE-only web pages.

== SMIL for phones ==


As mentioned, SMIL is often used in the latest cellular phones.  Phones and vendors have varied support for MMS (multimedia messaging service), but generally, MMS uses SMIL to define the layout of multimedia content.  If the MMS message contains a SMIL file, it will include other media objects, which can be text or binary (text is treated here as a media object or file to be referenced in a smil file).

Just a general note on MMS: the telecommunications industry needed a system in order to charge for messages by throughput as well as a system for pushing multimedia messages from phone to phone, computer to phone or phone to computer.  MMS is a standard, international system for these purposes.  SMIL was adopted because it was a well-defined, standard language to describe the layout and timing of the content inside MMS messages.  In adhering to these (and other) standards developed by the 3GPP in partnership with the European Telecommunications Standards Institution (ETSI) and the W3C, the industry was able to ensure interoperability of new services between vendors, providing mutual benefit and equal opportunity.

== SMIL tools and SMIL Info ==

Given that WikiBooks is a publicly-available 'open' book, it would be inappropriate to include information about or links to any commercial SMIL tools.  In other words, everything that is not free or open source is not considered here.

Just a sidenote: some commercial tools cost upwards of $800.  It is therefore in our best interest to evaluate, provide feedback for, and contribute to opensource projects.

The following are useful links (March 18th, 2004) to free and opensource tools, current SMIL projects, specifications, and tutorials:
* [http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/ The official W3C SMIL page]
* [http://www.x-smiles.org/ X-Smiles -] a Java-based, &quot;an open XML browser for exotic devices.&quot;  Supports XSLT, XSLFO, SMIL, XForms and SVG.

* [http://www.w3schools.com/smil/default.asp W3school's ''excellent'' tutorial] on SMIL.
* [http://www.webiphany.com/perlysmil/ PerlySMIL] is a perl script for generating SMIL files from perl.
* [http://wam.inrialpes.fr/software/limsee2/ LimSee2 -] is an opensource, Java application for  generating SMIL.  It is this author's experience that several media-related Java dependencies must be properly installed before LimSee2 will work properly.

== SMIL in netbeans? ==

One can create a SMIL file in Netbeans just as one would create an XML file.  Just type it up and save it as a SMIL file.  You can check for well-formedness, but validation might be trickier.  As mentioned previously, SMIL 2.0 requires a namespace declaration, so don't forget it.  

For our simple exercises, just type up a well-formed SMIL document and save it as .smil  That's it!  

== Summary ==

We've seen how SMIL could be used to make standalone presentations.  Yet the future of SMIL may be in the connection of mobile devices to the internet.  As XML standards and SMIL tools reach maturity, SMIL will be increasingly implemented in order to define interactive presentations in the same way that Macromedia FLASH does, only this presentation will be native to web browsers and micro browsers used in mobile devices.  Since SMIL is an open standard and it is extensible, there will likely be other applications which will use also SMIL.  

Visionaries foresee the increasing ubiquity of the internet in our homes and work, on computers and mobile devices.  This ubiquity is also called 'pervasive computing'.  Mobile commerce would be an example of pervasive computing as cellular phones and portable devices become more useful for business and location-based services. SMIL is a language which facilitates this trend by providing either a pretty face for future business services or value-added multimedia content.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Vedas are the lighthouse of eternal wisdom leading man to salvation and inspiring him to supreme accomplishment. The omnipresence of eternal Being, unmanifested and absolute; Its status as That, even in the manifested diversity of creation; and the possibility of the realization of Being by any man in terms of himself, these are the great truths of the perennial philosophy of the Vedas. The Vedas reveal the unchanging Unity of life which underlies the evident multiplicity of creation, for Reality is both manifest and unmanifest, and That alone is. 'I am That, thou are That and all this is That', is the Truth; and this is the kernel of the Vedic teaching, which the rishis extol as teaching 'worthy of hearing, contemplating and realizing'. The truth of Vedic wisdom is by its very nature independent of time and can therefore never be lost. When, however, man's vision becomes one-sided and he is caught by the binding influence of the phenomenal world to the exclusion of the absolute phase of Reality, when he is thus confined within the ever-changing phases of existence, his life loses stability and he begins to suffer. When suffering grows, the invincible force of nature moves to set man's vision right and establish a way of life which will again fulfill the high purpose of his existence. The long history of the world records many such periods in which the ideal pattern of life is first forgotten and then restored to man. Veda Vyasa, the sage of enlightened vision and greatest among the historians of antiquity, records the growth of unrighteousness in the families of those who ruled the people about five thousand years ago. It was then that Lord Krishna came to remind man of the true values of life and living. He restored that direct contact with the transcendental Being which alone can give fullness to every aspect of life. He brought to light absolute Being as the basic Reality of life and established It as the foundation of all thinking, which in turn is the basis of all doing. This philosophy of Being, thinking and doing is the true philosophy of the integrated life. It not only helps the doer to gain success in his undertaking but, at the same time, sets him free from the bondage of action, bringing fulfillment at every level. Such is the teaching of eternal Truth, given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna in the Bhagavad-Gita. Gradually this teaching came to be forgotten, so that two thousand years later even the principle of Being as the absolute Reality, the source and basis of all creation, was overshadowed by misguided beliefs which glorified only the relative aspects of life. 'The long lapse of time', says Lord Krishna, is the reason for such a loss of wisdom. When the philosophy of the integrated life restored by Lord Krishna was lost from view, the idea grew that everything which life can offer is present on the obvious levels of existence, and that it would therefore be useless to aspire to anything that might lie deeper than external appearances. Society became dominated by this superficial outlook, insight into Reality was lost, the right sense of values forgotten and the stability of life destroyed. Tension, conclusion, superstition, unhappiness and fear prevailed. Lord Buddha came to remedy this situation. Finding the field of action distorted, He came with a message of right action. Speaking from His level of consciousness established in Being, in eternal freedom (nirvana), Lord Buddha taught the philosophy of action in freedom. He advocated meditation in order to purify the field of thought through direct contact with Being and bring about the state of right action in society. Lord Buddha's message was complete because He incorporated the fields of Being, thinking and doing in His theme of revival But because his followers failed to correlate these different fields of life in a systematic manner through the practice of transcendental meditation, realization of Being as the basis of a good life became obscured. The whole structure of Lord Buddha's teaching not only became distorted but was also turned upside down. The effect was mistaken for the cause. Right action came to be regarded as a means to gain nirvana, whereas right action is in fact the result of this state of consciousness in freedom. It has been the misfortune of every great teacher that, while he speaks from his level of consciousness, his followers can only receive his message on their level; and the gulf between the teaching and understanding grows wider with time. The teaching of right action without due emphasis on the primary necessity of realization of Being is like building a wall without a foundation. It sways with the wind and collapses before long. Within three or four hundred years all real connection between the essential teachings of Lord Buddha and the daily life of His followers had disappeared. Insight into the principle of the integrated life was again lost. Having forgotten the prime importance of realizing Being, society became immersed once more in the superficialities of life. Nature will not allow humanity to be deprived of the vision of Reality for very long. A wave of revival brought Shankara to reestablish the basis of life and renew human understanding. Shankara restored the wisdom of the Absolute and established It in the daily life of the people, strengthening the fields of thought and action by the power of Being. He brought the message of fulfillment through direct realization of transcendental Being in the state of Self-consciousness, which is the basis of all good in life. Shankara's emphasis on Self-realization stems from the eternal philosophy of the integrated life expressed by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita when He asks Arjuna first to be without the three gunas' and then to perform actions while thus established in Being. That all men should at all times live the bliss-consciousness of absolute Being, and that they should live the state of fulfillment in God-consciousness throughout all thought, speech and action; this is the essence of Shankara's message, as it is the essence of Lord Krishna's and of the entire Vedic philosophy. The greatest blessing that Shankara's teaching has offered to the world is the principle of fullness of intellectual and emotional development in the state of enlightenment, based on transcendental pure consciousness, in which the heart is so pure as to be able to flow and overflow with waves of universal love and devotion to God, while the mind is so refined as to enjoy awareness of the divine nature as separate from the world of action. The spontaneous expressions of Shankara's mind and heart in this state of freedom and fulfillment have been a source of inspiration both to those who live by the heart and those who live by the mind. His consciousness exemplified the highest state of human development; his heart expressed supreme transcendental devotion to God (para bhakti), while his mind expressed awareness of the Self as separate from the field of action (gyana). This it was that led Shankara's speech to flow into ecstasies of devotion and at the same time into clear expressions of knowledge, the dry and hard-headed truths concerning divine nature as detached from the world. These are the two aspects of the living reality of a life in complete fulfillment. Shankara not only revived the wisdom of integrated life and made it popular in his day, but also established four principal seats of learning in four corners of India to keep his teaching pure and to ensure that it would be propagated in its entirety generation after generation. For many centuries his teaching remained alive in his followers, who lived the ideal state of knowledge with devotion (gyana and bhakti). But in spite of all his foresight and endeavors, Shankara's message inevitably suffered with time the same misfortunes as those of other great teachers. If the occupants of a house forget the foundations, it is because the foundations lie underground, hidden from view. It is no surprise that Being was lost to view, for It lies in the transcendental field of life. The state of Reality, as described by the enlightened, cannot become a path for the seeker, any more than the description of a destination can replace the road that leads to it. When the truth that Being forms the basis of the state of enlightenment became obscured, Shankara's statements about the nature of the goal were mistaken for the path to realization. This misunderstanding was increased by the very beauty of Shankara's eloquence. His expressions of deep devotion made in the state of complete surrender and oneness with God, and his intellectual clarifications made in the state of awareness of the divine nature, are both so full and complete in themselves that, seen from the ordinary level of consciousness, they appeared to present two independent paths to enlightenment: the path of knowledge and the path of devotion. This is the tragedy of knowledge, the tragic fate that knowledge must meet at the hands of ignorance. It is inevitable, because the teaching comes from one level of consciousness and is received at quite a different level. The knowledge of Unity must in time shatter on the hard rocks of ignorance. History has proved this again and again. Shankara's teaching could not prove an exception to the rule. The idea of two paths became more predominant owing to the carelessness of the custodians of Shankara's teaching. Since they followed the recluse way of life, they were naturally concerned with thoughts of the separateness of the Divine from the world; and, with the continuance of' this situation generation after generation, the aspect of knowledge began to dominate Shankara's tradition while the aspect of devotion gradually lost its importance. The teaching became one-sided and, deprived of its wholeness, eventually lost its universal appeal. It came to be regarded as mayavada, a philosophy of illusion, holding the world to be only illusory and emphasizing the detached way of life. As the principle of Being began more and more to disappear from view, the paths of devotion and knowledge became more and more separate and finally the link between them was lost. The principle of full development of heart and mind through one process (transcendental meditation) was lost. 'he integral nature of realization was lost. The true wisdom of life's fulfillment, which lies in the simultaneous development of heart and mind, was lost. The idea that devotion and knowledge are necessarily separate was the greatest blow to Shankara's teaching. In the absence of the moon, the stars take over and provide as much light as they can. When Shankara's high ideal of transcendental devotion disappeared from sight, Ramanuja, Madhva and other teachers upheld the path of devotion, even though without its proper basis in Being. People followed them, and thus there arose many devotional sects all on the level of emotion and every one founded on the comfortable basis of hope that 'some day our prayer will be heard, some day He will come to us and call us to Him'. Indeed a comfort to the heart but, alas, such devotion is on the imaginary plane of feeling! It is far, far away from the reality of actual contact between the devotee and his God. Awareness in the state of Being alone makes the whole field of devotion real. All these sects hold that transcendental devotion is the last stage of a devotee's achievement. But Shankara's principle of devotion is founded on transcendental consciousness from the very beginning. The first step for Shankara is the last step for these devotional sects, a step which according to their understanding is far above the reach of the ordinary man. The idea that devotion must start from transcendental consciousness having been lost by the guardians of Shankara's wisdom, entrance into the field of devotion was closed. Seekers of God remained seeking in thin air, and lovers of God remained weeping for Him without finding Him. As devotion remained merely on the level of thinking and of assuming an attitude of feeling (mood-making), so knowledge met with the same fate once the direct way to the realization of transcendental consciousness had been lost. Understanding of the Unity of life cannot be significant until one has thoroughly understood, by direct experience, that one's inner divine nature is separate from the world of action. If a man has not gained consciousness in Being through the practice of transcendental meditation, he continues to live in ignorance and bondage. Because he has not yet opened himself to the experience of the separateness of the Divine from the world, the thought of Unity has no practical use for such a man. He has nothing to unite. On the fertile field of transcendental consciousness both knowledge and devotion find their fulfillment. But this principle once forgotten and the technique for developing transcendental consciousness lost, many, many generations have died without seeing the light of God and without gaining fulfillment That has been the situation for more than a thousand years. Misunderstanding itself has taken the shape of a tradition, unfortunately known as Shankara's tradition. This great loss to human life can hardly be compensated; but that has been the course of history. Time cannot be recaptured. It is no use repenting the past. In our review of the rise and fall of Truth, we must not lose sight of the great impact that Shankara produced on Indian life. It was the perfection of his presentation that caused Shankara's teaching to be accepted as the core of Vedic wisdom and placed it at the centre of Indian culture. It became so inseparable from the Indian way of life that when, in course of time, this teaching lost its universal character and came to be interpreted as for the recluse order alone, the whole basis of Indian culture also began to be considered in terms of the recluse way of life, founded on renunciation and detachment. When this detached view of life became accepted as the basis of Vedic wisdom, the wholeness of life and fulfillment was lost. This error of understanding has dominated Indian culture for centuries and has turned the principle of life upside down. Life on the basis of detachment! This is a complete distortion of Indian philosophy. It has not only destroyed the path of realization but has led the seekers of Truth continuously astray. Indeed it has left them without the possibility of ever finding the goal. Not only was the path to enlightenment lost, but the entire art of living disappeared in the clouds of ignorance which obscured every phase of life. Even religion became blind to itself Instead of directly helping people to gain God-consciousness and act rightly on that basis, religious preachers began to teach that right action is in itself a way to purification and thereby to God-consciousness. Without Being, confusion of cause and effect invaded every field of understanding. It captured even the most practical field of the philosophy of Yoga. Karma Yoga (attainment of Union by way of action) began to be understood as based on karma (action), whereas its basis is Yoga, Union, transcendental consciousness. The founder of the Yoga philosophy, Patanjali, was himself misinterpreted and the order of stages on his eightfold path reversed. The practice of Yoga was understood to start with yama, niyama, and so on (the secular virtues), whereas in reality it should begin with samadhi. Samadhi cannot be gained by the practice of yama, niyama, and so on. Proficiency in the virtues can only be gained by repeated experiences of samadhi. It was because the effect was mistaken for the cause that this great philosophy of life became distorted and the path to samadhi was blocked. With the loss of insight into Yoga, the other five classical systems of Indian philosophy lost their power. They remained on the theoretical level of knowledge, for it is through Yoga alone that knowledge steps into practical life. Thus we find that all fields of religion and philosophy have been misunderstood and wrongly interpreted for many centuries past. This has blocked the path to the fullest development of heart and mind, so precisely revived by Shankara. Interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gita and other Indian scriptures are now so full of the idea of renunciation that they are regarded with distrust by practical men in every part of the world. Many Western universities hesitate to teach Indian philosophy for this reason. The responsibility for this loss of Truth to the whole world lies with the interpreters of Shankara's teaching; missing the essence of his wisdom, they have been unable to save the world from falling ever deeper into ignorance and suffering. This age has, however, been fortunate. It has witnessed the living example of a man inspired by Vedic wisdom in its wholeness and thus able to revive the philosophy of the integrated life in all its truth and fullness. His Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the inspiration and guiding light of this commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita, adorned the seat of the Shankaracharya of the North and, glowing in divine radiance, embodied in himself the head and heart of Shankara. He expounded the Truth in Its all-embracing nature. His quiet words, coming from the unbounded love of his heart, pierced the hearts of all who heard him and brought enlightenment to their minds. His message was the message of fullness of heart and mind. He moved as the living embodiment of Truth and was addressed as Vedanta Incarnate by that great Indian philosopher, now President of India, Dr. Radhakrishnan. It was the concern of Guru Deva, His Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, to enlighten all men everywhere that resulted in the foundation of the world-wide Spiritual Regeneration Movement in 1958, five years after his departure from us. India is a country where Truth matters most and Indians are a people to whom Cod matters most. Indian soil has witnessed many times the revival of life's true philosophy. The people of India have never hesitated to return once more to the right path whenever it was convincingly pointed out to them that their way of life had taken a wrong course. This receptiveness to Truth of the Indian people has always been a source of inspiration and a signal of hope to all movements aiming at the revival of true life and living. May the present commentary on the Bhagavad-Gita produce the desired effect in response to the historical necessity of today. The purpose of this commentary is to restore the fundamental truths of the Bhagavad-Gita and thus restore the significance of its teaching. If this teaching is followed, effectiveness in life will be achieved, men will be fulfilled on all levels and the historical need of the age will be fulfilled also. The Bhagavad-Gita is the Light of Life, lit by God at the altar of man, to save humanity from the darkness of ignorance and suffering. It is a scripture which outlives time, and can be acknowledged as indispensable to the life of any man in any age. It is the encyclopedia of life and this commentary provides an index to it. There will always be confusion and chaos in the relative fields of life and man's mind will always fall into error and indecision. &quot;:he Bhagavad-Gita is a complete guide to practical life. It will always be there to rescue man in any situation. It is like an anchor for the ship of life sailing on the turbulent waves of time. It brings fulfillment to the life of the individual. When society accepts it, social well-being and security will result, and when the world hears it, world peace will be permanent. The Bhagavad-Gita presents the science of life and the art of living. it teaches how to be, how to think and how to do. Its technique of glorifying every aspect of life through contact with inner Being is like watering the root and making the whole tree green. It surpasses any practical wisdom of life ever cherished by human society. The Bhagavad-Gita has a greater number of commentaries than any other known scripture. The reason for adding one more is that there does not seem to be any commentary which really brings to light the essential point of the whole teaching. Wise commentators, in their attempt to fulfill the need of their times, have revealed the truth of the teaching as they found it. By so doing they have secured a place in the history of human thought. They stand out as torch-bearers on the long corridor of time. They have fathomed great depths of the ocean of wisdom. Yet with all their glorious achievements they have not brought out the central point of the Bhagavad-Gita. It is unfortunate that the very essence of this ancient wisdom should have been missed. The Bhagavad-Gita needs a commentary which restates in simple words the essential teaching and technique given by Lord Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield. There are commentaries to extol the wisdom of the paths of knowledge, devotion and action in the Bhagavad-Gita, but none to show that it provides a master-key to open the gates of all these different highways of human evolution simultaneously. No commentary has yet shown that through one simple technique proclaimed in the Bhagavad-Gita, any man, without having to renounce his way of life, can enjoy the blessings of all these paths. This commentary has been written to present that key to mankind and preserve it for generations to come. The Bhagavad-Gita is the Scripture of Yoga, the Scripture of Divine Union. Its purpose is to explain in theory and practice all that is needed to raise the consciousness of man to the highest possible level. The marvel of its language and style is that every expression brings a teaching suitable to every level of human evolution. Fundamentally there are four levels of consciousness on each of which the nature of the practice changes: the waking state, transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God- consciousness. Every teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita has its application on each of these planes of development. Every expression must therefore be interpreted in four different ways to explain, both in theory and practice, the ascending progression of the discourse on each of these four different levels. Thus it is obvious that the Bhagavad-Gita as a whole must also be interpreted in four different ways so that the whole path to God-realization may be explained clearly. As the Bhagavad-Gita has not yet been interpreted in this manner, the true message of the scripture has remained dormant. It is highly important that these four commentaries should be written, not only to do justice to the scripture but also to present a straight path to the seeker and bring him the profound wisdom of this practical philosophy. Thorough knowledge of any subject requires that its validity be substantiated by the criteria provided by the six systems of Indian philosophy : Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Sankhya, Yoga, Karma Mimansa and Vedanta. In order to be complete, every aspect of the theory and practice at any stage of development must be verifiable by all these six systems simultaneously. It follows therefore that six interpretations of each of the four commentaries mentioned above are necessary to bring to light the complete significance of the Bhagavad-Gita. The present commentary should be regarded as a general basis for these twenty-four commentaries. If time allows, these commentaries will be written. But because the world is in such urgent need of the basic principle of spiritual development, it has been thought necessary to bring out the present commentary without further loss of time. It will be of interest to the reader to know that this commentary is being brought out only after the technique has been verified in the lives of thousands of people of different nationalities throughout the world, under the auspices of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement founded with the sole purpose of spiritually regenerating the lives of all men in every part of the world. It presents a truth that is timeless and universal, a truth of life equally suited to all men, irrespective of differences of faith, culture or nationality. The overall conception of this commentary is supplementary to the unique vision and profound wisdom of the great Shankara, as set forth in his Gita-Bhashya. The wisdom is a gift from Guru Deva All glory to Him! It presents the Light of Life and sets the stream of life to find its fulfillment in the ocean of eternal Being, in devotion to God and in the bliss of God-consciousness. May every man make use of the practical wisdom given in the 45th verse of the second chapter and thereby glorify all aspects of his life and gain eternal freedom in divine consciousness. This chapter prepares the ground and sets the scene for the glorious dialogue of the Lord's Song, the Bhagavad-Gita. Although it does not contain the actual discourse of the Lord, which really begins in the second chapter, it presents the basic problems of life and gives Lord Krishna the chance to propound the philosophy and practice which enable man to live his life free from suffering. It is of great value for its contribution to the science of living. It serves as a petition from the representative of human kind to the Incarnation of the Divine - a petition to say that, even though we try our best to live a life of righteousness, suffering does not appear to leave us. The demand is: give us a life free from suffering. There is one short sentence in this chapter spoken by Lord Krishna to Arjuna on the battlefield. The first word that falls from the lips of the Lord fills Arjuna with love and raises his heart to the elevated plane of his mind. Arjuna's heart and mind, thus established on a high level of alertness, gain a state of such self-sufficiency that communication between them is almost lost, and with it is lost the spur to activity. But inwardly Arjuna's consciousness is raised to that high level of suspension which purifies his heart and mind of all stain and enables him to receive, within a short time, the wisdom of the Absolute, the timeless message of life for the good of all. Duryodhana, seeing his own army and the army opposing it drawn up on the battlefield, gives the signal for battle. And Arjuna, the greatest archer of his time, thoughtful and conscientious, resolved to oppose evil yet overflowing with a wave of love, visualizes the consequences of war and reaches a state of suspension between the dictates of his heart and mind. This situation, where consciousness is in a state of suspension, where both the mind and the heart are on the highest level of alertness, provides the ideal occasion for the divine intelligence to overtake and shape the destiny of man. Life is a battlefield of opposing forces. He who, like Arjuna, has recourse to divine intelligence receives the light and shares the cosmic purpose of fulfillment both for himself and others. But he who is trapped by temptation, like Duryodhana, becomes a drag upon life; he retards his own evolution and also hinders the progress of others. This chapter presents the mechanics of nature and reveals the fundamentals of life and society. While remaining on the human level, it portrays the heights of human consciousness through which the Divine descends on earth. It provides a firm foundation for the edifice of Lord Krishna's teaching the wisdom of eternal freedom in life. The chapter opens with Dhritarashtra in his royal palace at Hastinapur asking Sanjaya to tell him about the battle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.1 Dhritarashtra said: Assembled on the field of Dharma, O Sanjaya, on the field of the Kurus, eager to fight, what did my people and the Pandavas do? 'Dharma' is that invincible power of nature which upholds existence. It maintains evolution and forms the very basis of cosmic life. It supports all that is helpful for evolution and discourages all that is opposed to it. Dharma is that which promotes worldly prosperity and spiritual freedom. In order to understand the role of dharma in life, we have to consider the mechanics of evolution. When life evolves from one state to another, the first state is dissolved and the second brought into existence. In other words, the process of evolution is carried out under the influence of two opposing forces, one to destroy the first state and the other to give rise to a second state These creative and destructive forces working in harmony with one another maintain life and spin the wheel of evolution. Dharma maintains equilibrium between them. By maintaining equilibrium between opposing cosmic forces, dharma safeguards existence and upholds the path of evolution, the path of righteousness. Man's life is so highly evolved that he enjoys freedom of action in nature. This enables him to live in any way he desires, either for good or for evil. As he behaves, so he receives. When the good increases in life and the positive forces tend to overbalance the normal state of existence, then the process of dharma, restoring equilibrium, results in feelings of happiness in the heart and satisfaction in the mind. In the same way, when evil increases in life and the negative forces predominate, the power of dharma, restoring the balance, produces sensations of pain and suffering. Life is as we want it, either suffering or joy. When we allow the positive and negative forces to remain in their normal state of equilibrium, we live through normal periods of life. Assisting the growth of negative forces results in suffering; when we help the positive forces to increase we share the joy of life 'As you sow, so shall you reap', expresses the role of dharma in practical life. Calamities, crises and catastrophes in a community or country are caused by the increase of negative forces resulting from the evil deeds of a majority of their people. A high degree of concentration of negative forces, without positive forces to balance them, ends in suffering and destruction of life. Similarly, a high degree of concentration of positive forces fails to maintain life in its normal state. The life of an individual under the influence of increasing positive forces enters into a field of increasing happiness and is eventually transformed into bliss-consciousness, in which state it gains the status of cosmic existence, eternal life. In this way, we find that the increase of negative forces ends in passivity or extinction of life, whereas the increase of positive forces results in life eternal. Our individual life moves backwards and forwards automatically as we direct it under the influence of dharma. Positive and negative forces, as we develop them, play their role on the field of dharma and shape the destiny of life. The two armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas on the battlefield of Kurukshetra represent the negative and positive forces on the field of dharma. This is what made Dhritarashtra say: 'Assembled on the field of Dharma on the field of the Kurus'. Dhritarashtra, as an old experienced head of the royal family, knows that the battlefield of Kurukshetra lying within the Dharmakshetra, the land between the rivers Yamuna and Saraswati, always maintains its sanctity and brings victory to the righteous. He is anxious to hear details of the happenings and curious to find out whether the good influence of the land has had any effect on the destructive tendencies of his evil-minded sons; or whether it stimulated the righteousness of the Pandavas and encouraged them to forgive the evildoers. This is the only time that Dhritarashtra speaks in the text of the Bhagavad-Gita. He only appears in order to ask this question. The 'Kurus' are the members of the Kuru family, a leading clan of the time. 'The field of the Kurus' is a vast plain near Hastinapur in the neighborhood of Delhi. As it belonged to the Kurus at the time of this battle it is called Kurukshetra. 'My people and the Pandavas': Dhritarashtra was the blind king of the Kuru family. His younger brother Pandu was managing the affairs of the kingdom for him. When Pandu died, Dhritarashtra wanted to give the reins of the kingdom to Yudhishthira, the eldest of the five sons of Pandu, who was called Dharmarai, the embodiment of righteousness, for his noble qualities; but Duryodhana, the eldest of the hundred evil-minded sons of Dhritarashtra, by trick and treachery secured the throne for himself and began attempting to destroy Yudhishthira and his four brothers. Lord Krishna, as head of the Yadava clan, tried to bring about a reconciliation between the cousins; but when all his attempts failed and the treachery of Duryodhana continued and increased, war between the Kauravas and Pandavas became inevitable. It brought kings and warriors from all over the globe to take sides, according to the level of their consciousness, with the righteous Pandavas or the evil-minded Kauravas. The good and evil of the whole world formed the two armies. Lord Krishna's main mission, which was to destroy evil and give protection to righteousness, had been simplified. 'Sanjaya' is the charioteer of the blind king Dhritarashtra. The word, however, means one who has conquered the senses and the mind. Sanjaya was asked to narrate the details of the battle because he was clairvoyant and clairaudient and at the same time impartial. The whole of the Bhagavad-Gita is Sanjaya's answer to Dhritarashtra. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.2 Then Duryodhana the prince, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, approached his master and spoke these words: 'Master' is one who understands the meaning of the scriptures, teaches it to others and practices the teaching himself. The master here is Dronacharya, who had taught the art of war to both Kauravas and Pandavas. It is a crucial moment, so it is natural for Duryodhana to approach his master, Dronacharya, for blessings and strength. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.3 Behold, O Master, this great army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by your wise pupil, the son of Drupada. 'The son of Drupada', Dhrishtadyumna, is the commander-in-chief of the Pandavas' army. Duryodhana points out to his master that the opposing army is certainly large and powerful but that this does not matter because his own army is graced by the master, while the other is supported only by the disciple. Although wise, he remains after all a disciple, and since he is so ready to fight against his master, his morale will be weak and his strength will fail him. At the same time, by saying 'your wise pupil', Duryodhana creates an effect to excite the master's mind against the disciple who has organized the front against him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.4 Here are men of valor, mighty archers, the equals of Bhima and Arjuna in battle Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, the maharathi. 'Bhima' is the second son of Pandu, the mightiest warrior of the Pandavas' army and virtually in control of it, even though the office of commander-in-chief is held by Dhrishtadyumna. 'Arjuna', the hero of the Mahabharata, is the third son of Pandu. He is the greatest archer of his time and a close friend of Lord Krishna. 'Maharathi' means a great warrior proficient in military science who, single-handed, can fight ten thousand archers. 'Yuyudhana' is Lord Krishna's charioteer, also called Satyaki. 'Virata' is the prince in whose territory the Pandavas lived for some time in disguise after losing a dice-match with Duryodhana. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kashi, also Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Shaibya, chief among men. 'Dhrishtaketu' is the king of the Chedis. 'Chekitana' is a famous warrior in the army of the Pandavas. 'Purujit' and 'Kuntibhoia' are two brothers. 'Shaibya' is a king of the Shibi tribe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.6 Yudhamanyu, the brave; the valiant Uttamauja; also the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi all of them maharathis. Duryodhana seems to accomplish several aims in naming these great warriors in the opposing army. It strengthens his own mind, awakens a deep sense of responsibility in the mind of his master and produces alertness in all those who are listening to him. Having created these effects, this atmosphere, Duryodhana, in the following verse, draws the attention of his master to the great heroes of his own army. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.7 Know well, O noblest of the twice-born, those who are pre-eminent among us. I speak to you of the leaders of my army that you may know them. 'Twice-born' is a term that Duryodhana uses in addressing his master, Dronacharya. This is to flatter him and at the same time to arouse in him a sense of responsibility, so that he shall remain true to the cause that he has undertaken. The term 'twice-born' is generally used for one born in a brahmin family, although other castes are also eligible for the ceremony of purification according to Vedic rites. A brahmin is said to be twice-born because after his birth, when he is about eight years old, he undergoes a Vedic ceremony of purification, and this qualifies him for the study of the Vedas, the main function of a brahmin. Thus the ceremony is referred to as the second birth. This second birth is important in life because it gives a man, born of flesh, entry into the field of spirit. This is the main purpose of the study of the Vedas, which opens the door to the inner kingdom of man and enables him to see the light of God. By recalling to his master the names of the heroes of his army, Duryodhana reviews his own strength and creates an awareness of the mighty power which belongs to him and to everyone who is there to support him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.8 Thyself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, victor in battle; Ashvatthama and Vikarna and also the son of Somadatta. 'Bhishma' is the grandsire (grandfather's step-brother) of both the Kauravas and Pandavas. He brought up Dhritarashtra and Pandu. He is the most experienced of all the assembled warriors. On him, Duryodhana chiefly relies. 'Karna' is half-brother to Arjuna. 'Kripa' is the brother-in-law of Dronacharya. 'Ashvatthama' is the son of Dronacharya. 'Vikarna' is the third of the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra. 'Somadatta' is the king of the Bahikas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.9 And many other heroes there are, armed with various weapons, all skilled in warfare, who have risked their lives for me. Having recounted the names of the heroes of his own army, Duryodhana stresses their might and in the following verse compares the strength of the two sides. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.10 Unlimited is that army of ours commanded by Bhishma, whereas this their army commanded by Bhima is limited. Duryodhana had to rouse his own commander, Bhishma, against the mighty Bhima, chief of the Pandavas' army. At the same time he reminded Bhishma that, as commander, victory or defeat was his responsibility. Having proclaimed that he is more powerful than his opponent, Duryodhana, in the following verse, pronounces his final order of battle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.11 Therefore, stationed in your respective positions on all fronts, support Bhishma alone, all of you! This verse brings out Duryodhana's shrewdness. He knows that most of the warriors assembled on his side are not there primarily for his sake but because of their love for Bhishma. This is why he speaks as he does; and by so doing he wins their sympathy and confidence along with that of Bhishma. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.12 The aged Kuru, the glorious grandsire (Bhishma), gave a loud roar like a lion and blew his conch, gladdening the heart of Duryodhana. Having heard the words of Duryodhana, Bhishma, encouraging him, begins to give the signal for battle. The following verse describes how the whole army of Duryodhana joined Bhishma in making an uproar to show their readiness to fight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.13 Then quite suddenly conches, horns, kettledrums, tabors and drums blared forth, and the sound was tumultuous. 'Quite suddenly' gives expression to the way in which nature functions. Nature ensures great flexibility for the growth of good or evil in the atmosphere. But when an influence grows beyond elastic limits, nature will no longer sustain it; suddenly the breaking-point is reached. The sudden burst of the lion roar of Bhishma and the tumultuous noise produced by the whole army symbolized the great cry of nature announcing the breaking-point of the immeasurable evil that Duryodhana and his supporters had accumulated for themselves. Wars in history have resulted from the cumulative effect of aggression on the innocent; individuals continue to oppress others, not knowing that aggression is growing in the atmosphere, eventually to break upon them as their own disaster. One reaps the consequences of one's own actions. The following verses describe the effect of this upon the opposing army. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.14 Then, seated in a great chariot yoked to white horses, Madhava (Lord Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) also blew their glorious conches. In this verse the word 'then' has a special significance, for it shows that the Pandavas, Arjuna and his party, are not taking the lead in the battle but are only responding to the Kauravas' actions. This is the natural behavior of righteous people they are never aggressive. If they appear to be so, they are only playing their role as instruments of the divine plan. The Pandavas are challenged, and they have to accept the invitation as it comes; but they do not give the first signal for war. Only when they have received the signal from the other side are they obliged to answer it. And when they do answer, their reply is more powerful because it has the power of righteousness behind it. The word 'chariot' has a special metaphysical connotation. The 'chariot' is the physiological structure, the body. It stands on the battlefield of life as a vehicle for the natural process of evolution. The senses are the horses to which the body-chariot is yoked. 'Yoked to white horses': 'white' symbolizes 'sattva', or purity, meaning thereby that the chariot was driven under the influence of purity or righteousness. When the Self guides, the body moves under the influence of sattva. Lord Krishna symbolizes the Self, and the chariot He drives must be yoked to white horses. The very appearance of the chariot expresses its purpose. It stands and moves to safeguard and protect purity and righteousness. 'Madhava' means Lord of fortune and also slayer of the demon Madhu. The use of this name indicates Lord Krishna's power over nature It indicates that He will prove to be the Lord of fortune to those who are supporting positive forces and the slayer of demons to those who are promoting evil. Lord Krishna stands neutral between the two armies, blowing His conch to proclaim that He is there for anyone to derive advantage from His presence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.15 Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna) blew Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew Devadatta, Bhima of powerful deeds blew his great conch Paundra. 'Hrishikesha' has two meanings, according to the two different ways in which the word may be derived from the root. It means the Lord of the senses and also one with long hair. Both meanings are significant. Long hair has to do with control of the senses. Cutting the hair produces some subtle energy which tends to release the senses from control. So the word reveals not only the appearance of Lord Krishna on the battlefield but also the inner strength of the charioteer who, being the Lord of the senses, can control any situation. 'Panchajanya' is the conch made from the bone of the demon Panchajana. 'Devadatta' means given by God, this conch was received by Arjuna from his divine Father, Indra. 'Dhananjaya' means the winner of wealth, Arjuna. The words 'Hrishikesha blew Panchaianya' reveal many significant points. They convey first that Lord Krishna's breath was absorbed by the demon element in the conch which produced the sound. This left Lord Krishna neutral in the battle, as He had promised. Lord Krishna was revered both by the Kauravas and the Pandavas. He was approached for help at the same time both by Arjuna and Duryodhana, when each was preparing for war As Lord Krishna could not say yes to either in the presence of the other, He resolved the situation by asking them to decide between themselves. Lord Krishna said: I will be on one side, and my army will be on the other, but I shall not fight, though my army will. Now decide between yourselves who would like to have me and who would like my army. The first choice was given to Duryodhana, who preferred to take the army. Lord Krishna thus came out to help Arjuna, but as He had promised not to fight, He became Arjuna's charioteer and guided the destiny of battle. The Lord of the senses blowing the signal for war through the demon's conch has a further meaning. It indicates that Lord Krishna created a powerful demoniac force against the devilish Kauravas. The reason is that the force of righteousness is always positive. It is always creative and constructive; it cannot destroy. Destruction can be brought about only by negative forces. Because they had the power of righteousness, it was hard for the Pandavas to destroy the Kauravas. So Lord Krishna, through the sound of Panchaianya, excited the negative powers in all those present in both armies. The excitement of the negative forces in the Pandavas' army gave that army much more power to destroy evil because of the support from the great power of righteousness, whereas the excitement of the negative forces in the Kauravas' army hastened their destruction owing to an over-concentrated negative element without the support of any positive force. There is yet another implication. Lord Krishna blew Panchaianya to declare aloud that the Pandavas' response to the war signal did not belong to their righteousness. It was only the resonance of the devilish uproar of the Kauravas echoing from Panchajanya. It was a devil echoing the voice of a devil, and if there was anything original in the sound, it was Panchajanya's sigh for the pain and iniquities which the Pandavas had suffered for many long years under the Kauravas' oppression. The Lord of the senses did not use His senses: He only breathed out through Panchajanya. The occasion was too far beneath the divinity of Lord Krishna for Him to respond. The Lord of the senses is neutral, ever established in His eternal state of Being, while all things around Him react to the prevailing atmosphere. As the Lord of the senses, His status transcends the highest righteousness, and the Kauravas were on the lowest level of evil. It was because of the great difference between Lord Krishna's status and the level of the Kauravas' consciousness that He promised at the beginning that He would not fight in the battle. All these implications are contained in the first phrase of this verse. It is the glory of Vyasa, the sage of enlightened vision who wrote down the Bhagavad-Gita, that the implications of any one word in it are inexhaustible. The recounting of the names of warriors and of the conches that they blew continues through the next three verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.16 Prince Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew Sughosha and Manipushpaka. 'Kunti' is the mother of the five Pandavas, the sons of Pandu. 'Yudhishthira' is the eldest of the five Pandavas. 'Nakula' is the fourth, skilled in the art of training horses. 'Sahadeva' is the fifth and youngest, skilled in the management of cattle. 'Anantavijaya' means eternal victory. 'Sughosha' means sweet-toned. 'Manipushpaka' means gem-flowered. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.17 The King of Kashi, the great archer, and Shikhandi, the maharathi, Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unsubdued. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.18 Drupada, as well as the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, O Lord of earth, all blew their different conches. 'O Lord of earth': Sanjaya is addressing Dhritarashtra, the king. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.19 That tumultuous uproar, reverberating through earth and sky, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's men. The Pandavas announced their readiness for war by the blowing of the conches, which thrilled the air and vibrated through everything in earth and sky. A stir was created in the universe. A cosmic process is revealed here The evil doings of the Kauravas had saturated the atmosphere and had, as it were, pervaded everything with an evil influence. This evil influence was shaken when righteousness, having gained strength, rose to accept its challenge. The force of destruction in the world was to be destroyed by the rising wave of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.20 Then, seeing the sons of Dhritarashtra drawn up in battle order, as missiles where about to fly, the son of Pandu (Arjuna), whose banner bore the image of Hanuman, took up his bow. 'The sons of Dhritarashtra drawn up in battle order' represents evil prepared to annihilate righteousness. When Arjuna 'took up his bow', he expressed the readiness of righteousness to resist evil and restore harmony on earth. This is a cosmic process. Whenever evil arises and threatens to overtake life, nature moves to balance it. A wave of righteousness rises to neutralize the evil. Those who are the medium through which vice enters the world perish from the rise of such a wave, and those who have borne suffering under the influence of evil, becoming the instrument of righteousness, begin to enjoy. 'Banner bore the image of Hanuman': Hanuman symbolizes devotion and service to the supreme Lord. Arjuna's life was dedicated to the divine cause. His skill and art of archery were useful for the cause of righteousness. Therefore his chariot had a sign which bore the image of Hanuman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.21 Then, O Lord of earth, he spoke these words to Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna): Draw up my chariot between the two armies, O Achyuta. 'Lord of earth': through this expression Sanjaya draws Dhritarashtra's attention to the fact that he had the influence to intervene and stop the two armies from involving themselves in destruction. Already in verse 18 Sanjaya has addressed Dhritarashtra as 'Lord of earth'. The repeated expression indicates that he wants to make Dhritarashtra see the seriousness of the situation, both the armies have declared their readiness to fight, and now Arjuna is moving to the forefront. Every moment is vital and significant. The destruction seems inevitable. 'Achyuta' means immovable. Arjuna calls Lord Krishna 'Achyuta'. He wants the immovable to start moving for him! 'Achyuta' also means one who has never fallen. Thereby Arjuna wants to suggest to Lord Krishna that He will never fail him. Arjuna asks for the chariot to be placed between the two armies, so that both himself and Lord Krishna shall be there. By placing Lord Krishna midway, Arjuna desires to present a picture on the screen of time, absolute Being present between the opposing forces, a picture expressing the inner mechanics of nature which will explain the fundamentals of life and clarify the basic principles of war and peace for the generations to come. Lord Krishna symbolizes the absolute Being, which is the field of dharma and which, by remaining between the negative and positive powers in nature, balances them. Although remaining neutral, It always supports righteousness. Although Lord Krishna is neutral, He is with Arjuna, who enjoys His support. In the following verse Arjuna explains why he himself wishes to be placed between the two armies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.22 So that I may observe those who stand here eager for battle and know with whom I should fight in this toil of war. The skill of battle lies first in locating the strategic points of the enemy line. Arjuna's power of concentration was so great that if he correctly located the positions of the enemy leaders his arrows would fly straight at them. 'Eager for battle' shows that Arjuna wanted carefully to pick off only those who were eager for battle. He would not concern himself with those who were not eager to fight. This illustrates Arjuna's bravery and self-confidence ; it also expresses his readiness for battle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.23 Let me look on those who are assembled here ready to fight, eager to accomplish in battle what is dear to the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra. The tone of this verse shows the strength of Arjuna's indignation against the evil which the supporters of Duryodhana wish to accomplish by fighting. The contempt is so great that Arjuna does not even speak Duryodhana's name, and by naming his father, Dhritarashtra, he brings shame on him also. Arjuna is sure of his position, sure that he is making a stand to safeguard virtue and resist corruption. He does not think that all those assembled in the opposing army are evil in themselves, but they are supporters of evil. In verse 21 Sanjaya addressed Dhritarashtra as 'Lord of earth', yet here he reports Arjuna's insinuation that Dhritarashtra is being brought to shame by the actions of his sons. This shows that, as father of his evil-minded sons, Dhritarashtra is ultimately responsible for the threatened destruction of the whole community. When the collective karma (action) threatens national destruction, it is beyond the power of the individual to check it; this is even more true when it has reached the ultimate limit and is about to break into catastrophe. Therefore it is wise for people of every generation to be cautious and not to tolerate an increase of wrongdoing in their surroundings, but to nip it in the bud. For it is the cumulative influence of these small wrongs done by individuals in their own little spheres of activity that produces national and international tensions and leads to catastrophe. There is a way of transcendental meditation, taught by Lord Krishna, to be practiced by each individual daily in order to infuse the transcendental divine consciousness into his own mind, so that by nature man may become freed from wrong tendencies and may become the source of good influence in all spheres of life. Had Dhritarashtra, as a king, educated his sons in the art of transcending and gaining divine consciousness, the royal family of the Kauravas would not have been the cause of this great war, which brought disaster on the civilization of the time. This is a message which should be heeded in every generation. It is for the world's rulers and for those in public life, who have the welfare of mankind at heart, to organize education in such a way that everyone has an opportunity of learning how to cultivate divine consciousness. No generation should be allowed to leave behind an evil influence, the accumulated consequences of which will be reaped by future generations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.24 Sanjaya said: O Bharata, thus invoked by Gudakesha (Arjuna), Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna), having drawn up the magnificent chariot between the two armies, Sanjaya is reporting to Dhritarashtra what is happening on the battlefield. Here he addresses him as 'Bharata', descendant of the great king of Bharata - greater India. Arjuna, the hero of the Mahabharata, drives out between the two armies to see with whom he has to fight. Sanjaya here uses the name Gudakesha to refer to him. This is to symbolize an essential quality of Arjuna's, for Gudakesha means the Lord of sleep, one who has mastery over sleep, over dullness of mind. Arjuna's one-pointedness of mind is thus expressed. As an unfailing archer, Arjuna has a mind which is fully alive; Sanjaya uses the word Gudakesha to depict the character and quality of the hero. Such is Vyasa's narrative skill; he uses exact and concise expressions with great fullness of meaning to tell the story. It only needs a mind to understand them in order to enjoy his writings and derive the maximum from them. Vyasa has used the adjective 'magnificent' to describe Arjuna's chariot. This one word, which in the Sanskrit text reads 'uttamam', conveys a world of glory. It indicates magnificence, comfort, stability, lightness and strength, in fact, all the qualities of a chariot that is designed to meet the fiercest enemy there could be. Again, the chariot is magnificent not only for its quality but also for its charioteer and the hero within it. Hrishikesha, the Lord of the senses, is the charioteer and Gudakesha, the conqueror of sleep, is the hero. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.25 Before Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth, said: Partha (Arjuna)! behold these Kurus gathered together. Lord Krishna had seen that Arjuna was outraged. Anger is a great enemy; it reduces one's strength. And his charioteer does not like to see Arjuna's strength waning. Lord Krishna is required to do something to restore Arjuna to his normal stature. But this alone will not suffice; something more is necessary to make Arjuna really strong. Anger in him indicates that he is not really strong, for anger is a sign of weakness. Lord Krishna knows that Arjuna, although the greatest archer of his time, has not been given the real secret of warfare. He has been taught the art of archery, but he has not been trained to shoot his arrows while remaining firm in himself. If an archer shoots while he is angry, his anger will make him weak. Arjuna has called Lord Krishna 'Achyuta', which means firm and unmoved. This is what Lord Krishna has to teach Arjuna to be. But wisdom cannot be given to a man unless he asks for it and shows his readiness to receive it. It is therefore necessary for Lord Krishna to arouse in Arjuna the need and desire to learn. It would have been demoralizing if Arjuna had been told on the battlefield that he needed to know the art of being firm. He had to recognize this for himself; only then could Lord Krishna help him. To produce the desired result in Arjuna, the Lord speaks one short sentence: 'Partha! behold these Kurus gathered together.' This is the first utterance of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, the first word of advice to Arjuna on the battlefield. The miracle it produced in Arjuna has for centuries escaped the attention of practically every commentator, and in consequence Arjuna is portrayed as a confused mental wreck. A close study of the commentary on the following verses will reveal the true nature of Arjuna's condition. Lord Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'Partha', the son of Pritha. With this expression He reminds Arjuna of his mother and thereby creates a warm wave of love in his heart, the warmth of love that connects son and mother. It is this tender bond of love that develops into all family and social relationships, that maintains a family, a society, a nation and a world. Having created this wave of love in Arjuna's heart, Lord Krishna desires to strengthen it; and for this He says: 'behold these Kurus gathered together'. This quickens all the ways of the heart, where different relationships are held in different shades of love. Seeing all his dear ones 'together' in one glance, his whole heart swells with love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.26 The son of Pritha (Arjuna) saw there before him uncles and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons and grandsons and many friends as well. 'The son of Pritha saw' indicates that when Arjuna gazed on the opposing army his vision was colored by love and not by enmity or bravery. Had he seen with the vision of the 'scorcher of enemies' this is what he would have been called. This indicates the power of control that Lord Krishna possesses He said: 'Partha behold', and Arjuna became as a son before his mother, full of love and reverence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.27 Fathers-in-law and well-wishers also in both the armies. Then that son of Kunti (Arjuna), seeing all these kinsmen thus present, Arjuna stands up to behold his opponents but he fails to see opponents; instead he sees his dear ones. This is because his vision has been colored with love by Lord Krishna's calling him Partha. With this the whole scene takes a critical turn. Arjuna, who was about to go into battle, is overtaken by pity, as the following verses show. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.28 Possessed by extreme compassion, spoke this in grief: Seeing these my kinsmen, O Krishna, gathered, eager to fight, This verse presents the basis of the problems that Arjuna is going to lay before Lord Krishna. He expresses his thoughts aloud to Lord Krishna, who is close at hand. One thinks aloud with someone who is close to one's heart and mind and wise enough to further the thought. Lord Krishna is like this to Arjuna He can share his thoughts and feelings and think intimately with Him. 'Possessed by extreme compassion' and 'kinsmen' indicate the basic principle of 'grief'. It is born of the condition of the individual and his relationship with others. This verse not only depicts Arjuna's condition but lays open the fundamental principle of suffering in human society and seeks a solution to it. Compassion is among the most glorious qualities of the heart. 'Extreme compassion' expresses fullness of heart. But once dissociated from the qualities of the mind, the heart as such can no longer be effective in supporting action in life. Even good qualities of heart or of mind fail to uphold life in the absence of co-ordination between them. This verse proclaims 'extreme compassion' as the source of all the problems confronting Arjuna, a most balanced man of noble character. The whole discourse of Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-Gita is designed to give the wisdom of life and the technique of living which enable man to live all the good qualities of life with full coordination of heart and mind. By this wisdom and this technique the individual is raised to a high level of consciousness where he gains eternal contentment within himself. He lives a life in fulfillment, useful to himself and society. Such a life supports surrounding nature; all becomes harmonious, resulting in ideal relationships with others. Here is the glory of the Bhagavad-Gita it records for all time and for the use of all men the wisdom of life and the technique of living. So that everyone may live a life free from suffering, it selects the most noble character, Arjuna, leading the most balanced life, and places that life completely under the influence of the most cherished qualities of heart and mind. On this high level of glory and grace, where heart and mind are at their best, it locates the basic cause of all suffering at a point between the heart and mind. The heart is full of feeling, saturated with love; the mind is completely alert, full of the sense of righteousness and the call of duty. Both are at their full stature. No suffering can possibly touch either of them taken separately, but as the Upanishad says: 'Dvitiyad vai bhayam bhavati: Certainly fear is born of duality'. Whenever and wherever there is a sense of two, fear or suffering can exist. Within man there is mind and there is heart. These, by their very existence as two, hold the possibility of suffering. When they are united, when there is harmony between a heart and mind full of righteousness and noble inspiration, suffering cannot arise. But when there is a lack of co-ordination or a conflict between them, suffering automatically results. Arjuna's 'grief' is born of the basic difference between the heart and the mind. Religious scriptures prescribe a mode of conduct to save man from falling into error and suffering. They induce man to do good and to spurn evil. The Bhagavad-Gita, the scripture of the eternal religion of realization, in its diagnosis of suffering is not satisfied by the rejection of evil or the acceptance of virtue alone; it finds that suffering can result even from two good qualities. For a life to be free from suffering, it is not enough for heart and mind to be free from the stain of sin and established in righteousness. The Bhagavad-Gita undertakes to solve the problem of suffering completely. It locates the ultimate cause of suffering and provides a means to eliminate it The seed of suffering in life is located in the duality inherent in the characteristic difference between the qualities of heart and mind. The Bhagavad-Gita therefore takes Arjuna, already most noble, sinless and most highly developed in both heart and mind, and sets him down in an environment which further stimulates his heart and his mind. As both continue to grow more active in their respective domains, the basic difference in their structure becomes greater. When heart and mind are both at their best, each is full in itself and is no longer concerned with the other; there is no link left between them. The heart, fully saturated with love, naturally becomes sufficient unto itself and oblivious to the decisions of the mind. Likewise, the mind becomes oblivious to the cry of the heart. Separately they are each in a state of fulfillment. But because there is no communication between them, both cease to contribute to activity in life. That is why Arjuna is in a state of suspension without activity. Activity starts with the flow of desire. When the heart feels the lack of something and the mind responds to it, or when the mind feels the lack and the heart responds, then a stream of desire arises from between them and flows towards the object in view, engaging different faculties of heart, mind and body as well as the available material in the surroundings. This makes it clear that communication between heart and mind must exist for desire to arise. And if the flow of desire is in the direction of the natural current of evolution, it is further supported by the invisible influence of nature and will find fulfillment. Arjuna is land a state where the mind and heart are held high in the fullness of their respective qualities with no link between them. In the fullness of heart and mind, where both are contented in themselves, neither feels the lack of anything, and hence there exists no room for desire to arise Absence of desire leaves Arjuna in a state of suspension in which the entire personality loses its dynamic structure and is faced with seemingly insuperable problems whenever the need for action arises in any sphere of life. Thus the Bhagavad-Gita portrays a situation in which life can be full of problems, even while it is established in fulfillment of heart and mind. By resolving such an extreme situation, it brings to light the wisdom and technique of living life without suffering at any level. It establishes that life must be without suffering. No one should ever suffer in life: this is the teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita. Duality is the fundamental cause of suffering. But when the entire field of life is dual in nature, how can life be free from suffering? This has always been a serious problem of metaphysics and indeed of practical life as well. The solution lies in the infusion into the field of duality of a non-dual element which blesses man's life with a status unaffected by suffering, even while he remains in the field where suffering is possible. This will be appreciated as the discourse advances. Arjuna starts placing his problems before Lord Krishna. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.29 My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body quivers and my hair stands on end. A great strength of noted warriors lies in their concern for their fellow men, which has moved them to become the saviors of their societies. Arjuna was filled with a concern for others which enabled him to accept the challenge of his time when evil threatened. Because this concern for others formed the basis of his acceptance of battle, it comes as no surprise that the power of love overwhelms his heart and brings it to fullness. In this state of self-contentedness the heart becomes oblivious to the need of the mind the call of duty. Arjuna is caught between the power of love and the call of duty. He finds' he cannot yield to either. The call of righteousness and the tide of love rising in the heart both are dear to him because life, as he understands it, is all love of righteousness. But as he is placed now, suspended between the heart and mind, he is not in a position to undertake activity. Even if, by some miracle, he tries to initiate action, he is faced with a terrible situation. If he follows the call of righteousness, he must rebel against love and kill all his dear ones assembled for battle And if he follows the call of love, he must sacrifice the cause of righteousness and yield to evil. From this viewpoint we find that Arjuna is divided between the two forces which have so far been the essential components of his life. He stands like a child who is being called with love by his mother and at the same time is being summoned by his father from the other side. If he goes towards one, the other pulls him. He swings both ways. That is why he begins to feel shaken in body and mind. When one is deeply absorbed in thinking, the attention no longer remains outside on the level of the senses, and the co-ordination of the body and mind becomes weak. If at this time the heart is not supported by the mind, that co-ordination is weakened still further. If this process goes far enough, the body does not function properly. This is why Arjuna felt his limbs failing, his mouth parched, his body quivering. His physical state indicates that the power of love is dominating Arjuna and challenging the call of duty by throwing his body out of balance. The consequences of a further rise in this power of love are described in the following verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.30 Gandiva (the bow) slips from my hand and even my skin burns all over; I am unable to stand and my mind seems to whirl. 'Gandiva slips from my hand': Arjuna's fast grip on Gandiva has been in response to the call of righteousness. His mind was completely dominated by the call of duty, and it was this which made him hold Gandiva fast. But now, after the wave of love created by Lord Krishna, the power of love has filled his heart and in its fullness equals the power of his mind. They balance each other, and therefore the power of mind no longer remains dominant. Consequently, his grip becomes loose, and Gandiva slips from his hand. Never before had the bow slipped from Arjuna's hand. The wave of love causes this to happen. 'My skin burns': Arjuna has been overwhelmed with the power of love. The warmth of love is soothing and comforting. What then burns his skin? We have seen that the power of dharma upholds existence and evolution. As long as love is on the level of dharma or on the path of righteousness, it helps evolution, supports life and is soothing and comforting. But when the innocent power of love stands without supporting the path of righteousness, it is influenced by negative forces and becomes a means of destruction, misery and suffering. In thinking that he could avoid fighting, Arjuna is deserting the cause of righteousness, and so he feels his skin burning in the warmth of love. 'Unable to stand': love with the power of righteousness makes a man strong but without it leaves him weak. Arjuna has been overcome with love, which threatens to overthrow the cause of righteousness. Therefore it is no surprise that he feels weak, 'unable to stand'. 'Mind seems to whirl': Arjuna is overtaken by the qualities of the heart But Arjuna's mind is strong. It has the essential qualities of a brave man. Even when his heart is overwhelmed by the force of love, his mind is active and alert. The alert mind puts out a great force to change the course of the heart It is as if the car of Arjuna's life were being driven with great speed on the road of love, and there came a great force of mind to reverse the direction. This attempt at reversing the flow of the life-stream produces the impression that his mind is whirling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.31 And I see adverse omens, O Keshava (Lord Krishna), nor can I see good from killing my kinsmen in battle. Arjuna in this verse gives expression to the feeling of the whole of nature at that perilous moment of war. 'Killing my kinsmen' is an expression which contains the cry of both Arjuna's heart and mind. 'Killing' comes from the mind, for it is dedicated to Truth and righteousness and the destruction of evil. 'My kinsmen' is the cry of the heart. Arjuna's heart, full of love, allows him to see his opponents only as his 'kinsmen' and not as the aggressor and the enemy. Seeing them thus, he is right in saying: 'nor can I see good from killing my kinsmen in battle'. In his present state of deep concern, Arjuna feels love for all his kinsmen standing before him and, at the same time, grief for their destruction in battle His heart is torn between these two feelings. Deep within himself, immersed in feeling the situation and its consequences, he visualizes 'adverse omens' The cries of anguish and the terrible sufferings that follow destruction in war flash through his mind. Arjuna's vision of omens reveals the purity of his heart and the deep state of concentration of his mind. The future casts its image on the sanctuaries of pure hearts. 'Good' here means spiritual comfort. The Sanskrit word used is 'shreyas', which means evolution or fulfillment, the security and accomplishment that lies in spiritual freedom. Arjuna sees that spiritual comfort does not lie in killing his kinsmen. But this is the act that awaits him. Under the circumstances he finds he can do nothing but reject all that could possibly be desired. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.32 I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor a kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what avail will a kingdom be to us, or enjoyments, or even life, O Govinda? Desire presents no problem if it is allowed to flow freely. Problems arise when a desire is checked or encounters resistance. Arjuna's words express this fact. He challenges the validity of victory, pleasures, kingdom and even life in which desire has no chance of fulfillment. The desire of a great man rises to support others and rejoices in the happiness that others derive from such support. Having found the cause of battle to be damaging to body, mind, and surroundings, Arjuna now looks at the situation from the point of view of usefulness to his own aims in life. He finds that nothing in the outside world is of interest to him personally because, as he sees life, it is for others. So, from this point of view also, he sees no reason for fighting. Arjuna raises his voice against the corrupting influences of a kingdom, pleasure and power. He has seen in the case of Duryodhana how they can blind a man's vision and cause the destruction of a whole civilization. In the previous verse Arjuna has said that he can see no good from killing his kinsmen. Here he gives expression to the possible advantages that could come from the battle and weighs them in terms of their validity in life. This shows his presence of mind and the unbiased manner in which he is analyzing the situation. He rejects the validity of victory, a kingdom and pleasures if they are for selfish ends. He expresses not only indifference but positive aversion towards them. He makes it clear that 'even life' has no significance for him. Arjuna uses the word 'us', which can imply either that he wants to verify his views with Lord Krishna, or that he is sure that Lord Krishna's views are in accord with his own. 'Govinda' means master of the senses. In using this word Arjuna is also silently suggesting that Lord Krishna, as master of the senses, naturally also has little use for the objects of the senses and the pleasures derived from them. In his present state of deep contemplation, what Arjuna finds significant is a dedicated way of life. In the next verse he says clearly that his whole life is dedicated to others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.33 Those for whose sake we desire a kingdom, enjoyments and comforts are here on the battlefield, having resigned their lives and riches. This brings to light the greatness of Arjuna's heart and mind. His vision is clear: he views the situation with a serene and deep insight. His logic is profound. His thought is balanced and noble. His feeling is for others: when he thinks, it is in terms of others; if he wants to fight and gain sovereignty, it is for the sake of others; if he wants to amass enjoyments and pleasures, it is for the sake of others; if he wants to live, it is for others. Such is his developed consciousness, devoid of any thought of self-interest. This is the status of truly great men, living, they live for others; dying, they die for others. The question may be asked: If Arjuna's character shows such greatness of heart and mind, why does he come on to the battlefield prepared to fight? A close study of Arjuna's utterances reveals that he is bent upon resisting evil; he is not interested in killing people. He wants to destroy the evil without destroying the evildoer. It is a noble ideal. His aim is to destroy the evil on earth, if possible without bringing down upon society the untold suffering and destruction of war. Only a man of such an ideal character can speak as does Arjuna in the next two verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.34 Teachers, uncles, sons and likewise grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other kinsmen. This portrays the state of Arjuna's heart. It is full of love, full of life. From all sides he finds different channels of love pouring life into his heart and leaving it full. When love is full, life is full like the ocean. It is full like a silent ocean, for it ceases to flow in any direction. It just is. It is freed from any desire. That is why Arjuna could only mention the names of relationships to portray the different fields of love and give expression to the condition of his heart. This verse, coming in the midst of verses which express many problems, presents a vast field of life in love and silently proclaims that there are no problems in this field. The field of love is an innocent field of life. Problems arise when attachment or detachment overshadows pure love. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.35 O Madhusudana (Lord Krishna), these I do not wish to kill, though killed myself, even for the sake of sovereignty of the three worlds, how much less for this world. 'Madhusudana' means the slayer of the demon Madhu. By using this name, Arjuna suggests to Lord Krishna that, as the slayer of the demon, He may rise to kill the Kauravas if He finds that they are demoniacal; but as far as he himself is concerned, he finds that they are dear relatives and noble elders whom he would do anything to protect. Whatever the cost of letting them live, he cannot think of killing them. Arjuna speaks as only a conscientious, deeply thoughtful and brave man will speak. This is his character. He stands for principle. Nothing can tempt him to deny the high ideals of life. That is why his thinking is so uncompromising. The words 'even for the sake of sovereignty of the three worlds' indicate that Arjuna's vision was not restricted to the field of man's life on earth. Only such a man as he could challenge the value of sovereignty over the three worlds. Such is the height of human consciousness which upholds Arjuna even at this hour of his great concern. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.36 What happiness could come to us from slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana (Lord Krishna) ? Only sin could come upon us through killing these aggressors. This verse presents another change in Arjuna's vision. In the opposing army, he has been seeing just his own kinsmen; now, once again, they are the 'sons of Dhritarashtra', 'these aggressors'. Arjuna has so far looked at the situation from the aspect of love but has arrived at no solution to his problem. He therefore decides to consider it from the mind, with discrimination and intuition yet cannot suddenly abandon the fullness of love in his heart. Maintaining that fullness of heart, he begins to make more use of his mind. As he gives himself over to reason, the call of duty begins to gain ground. With this his vision changes. He begins to see his kinsmen as 'aggressors'; the reality begins to dawn. Seeing them in this light, Arjuna asks: 'What happiness could come to us from slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra?' And when he starts thinking in these terms, he finds killing is sin. The act of killing does not produce life-supporting influences for anyone at any time. Killing is a sin for all time No matter who is killed, killing is sin. The pain and suffering caused in the act of killing produce negative influences in creation, and the reaction recoils on the killer. So Arjuna says : 'Only sin would come upon us'. The killing of aggressors is supposed to be a right action. The aggressor's life is put to an end, and thereby he is prevented from producing more negative influences for himself and others. But this justification of killing arises from a completely different consideration. The act of killing as such is sinful. And this is Arjuna's main concern here. Arjuna can see killing as sin even when he is on the battlefield. This indicates that his mind is clear and his vision not obstructed either by feelings of the heart or by the call of duty. He is deep in thought, evaluating the situation from every side. Arjuna is at a high pitch of mental and emotional activity. Both his alertness of mind and fullness of heart are displayed in the innocent utterance of truth: 'Only sin would come upon us through killing these aggressors'. The expressions: 'What happiness could come to us' and 'Only sin would come upon us' indicate that happiness and suffering are considered as well as sin and virtue. For suffering results from sin, and happiness from virtue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.37 Therefore it would not be right for us to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our own kinsmen. How shouId we be happy after killing our own people, O Madhava? Arjuna's arguments have gone further. Previously it was only his 'wish' not to kill, but now he finds that it is not 'right' for him to engage in killing. In this verse Arjuna seems to weigh the killing of his kinsmen in terms of the happiness which could be derived from it: could any happiness remain after killing them? This does not mean that happiness is the criterion of action for Arjuna. He only wants to emphasize that he does not even see any happiness to justify it. Happiness has certainly to be taken into account while considering the performance of any action, because the aim of any action is the increase of happiness, the very purpose of creation and of evolution is expansion of happiness. So if happiness does not result from an action, then that action defeats the very purpose of action, and its performance cannot be justified. That is why Arjuna says killing 'would not be right for us'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.38 Although, their minds clouded by greed, they see no wrong in bringing destruction to the family and no sin in treachery to friends, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.39 How should we not know to turn away from this sin, we who clearly see the wrong in bringing destruction upon the family, O Janardana ? 'Know' shows Arjuna's chief concern at this moment He tries to understand why he is unable to take a right course of action when he sees the truth of the situation and, even more so, when he knows what is right. Arjuna expresses his concern over the influence of greed that has blinded the vision of his kinsmen and has prevented them from seeing 'the wrong'. This again shows that Arjuna's vision is clear. The tone of the verse indicates that he does not give as much importance to the actual 'destruction' as to 'the wrong' that will result from it. But, for all his purity and clarity of vision, Arjuna fails to see the right way, out of this sin of killing that awaits him. He turns to the Lord to receive the light. Such moments in life make a man fall at the feet of God moments when he sees and yet does not see, moments when he wants to act yet is unable to act. When we investigate the invisible mechanics of nature, we find that everything in the universe is directly connected with everything else. Everything is constantly being influenced by everything else. No wave of the ocean is independent of any other. Each certainly has its individuality, but it is not isolated from the influence of other waves. Every wave has its own course to follow, but this course is dependent on that of every other wave. The life of any individual is a wave in the ocean of cosmic life, where every wave constantly influences the course of every other. Certainly man is the master of his own destiny. He has free will, the greatest of God's gifts to him, whereby he has complete freedom of action. But having performed an action he has to bear its consequence, for reaction is always equal to action. When people behave rightly, a corresponding atmosphere is naturally produced, and when such an influence is dominant, the individual's tendencies are affected by it. If in such an atmosphere of grace and glory an individual is tempted to follow a wrong path, he is protected by the unseen influence of righteousness which surrounds him. Similarly when a man fails in his efforts, the unseen working of nature is behind that failure. No amount of intellectual analysis can reveal to him why the failure occurs. He must rise to another level and realize the working of nature and the power behind it. He must rise to understand the laws of nature and the cosmic law which underlies all of them. Arjuna fails to understand why his decision to refrain from battle produces no result, and he continues to be drawn into the battle. It is not because he is in a state of confusion, but because no amount of intellectual clarity can provide anyone with insight into the complex workings of diverse nature. Arjuna, although his consciousness is pure, has not yet fathomed the absolute Being which is the field of the cosmic law. This is why he fails to see that he is living in an atmosphere saturated with evil influence, in which it is not possible for virtue to survive for long. Arjuna is trying to refrain from fighting out of consideration for family and caste dharmas; he is not aware of the absolute state of dharma whose power is leading him to fight. In consequence he fails to see why he is unable to act according to his feelings. The following verse presents Arjuna's argument on how the path of evolution becomes extinct and bears witness to his concern for society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.40 The age-old family dharmas are lost in the destruction of a family. Its dharma lost, adharma overtakes the entire family. 'Dharmas', the plural of dharma, signifies the different powers of nature upholding different avenues of the way of evolution. They take expression as specific modes of activity or different ways of righteousness, which keep the whole stream of life in harmony every aspect of life being properly balanced with every other aspect, and moving in the direction of evolution. As these specific modes of activity are passed on from generation to generation, they form what we call traditions. It is these traditions which are referred to here as family dharmas. 'Adharma' means absence of dharma. When adharma prevails, the great power of nature, which maintains the equilibrium between positive and negative forces, is lost, and the process of evolution is thereby obstructed. Arjuna uses the word 'age-old' because the ideals of life that have withstood the test of time represent the genuine path of evolution, the upward current in nature. Nothing that is against evolution lasts long. Therefore the tradition which has survived the ages has certainly proved itself to be the right one, the one nearest to the Truth, which is Life Eternal. That is why Arjuna is afraid to break this path of evolution for the generations to come. In the process of analyzing the quality of the act of fighting, Arjuna shows great foresight and a highly developed mind. It is clear that his thinking is extremely logical and correct, and that it certainly does not come from the superficial level of consciousness. Its basis is dharma the basic power of evolution. Arjuna's vision is not restricted the boundaries of his foresight lie far in the future. As a great man of his time, Arjuna, before entering upon an undertaking, gauges its influence on succeeding generations. Only such a heightened state of consciousness could inspire the dawn of great wisdom on earth. Arjuna's chief concern is the preservation of the path of evolution. With this in view he places great value on dharma and on the conduct of society, which supports it and is upheld by it. Arjuna continues his argument in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.41 When adharma prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt, and with the corruption of women, O Varshneya, intermixture of castes arises. A mother's life is the expression of the creative power of nature. Creative intelligence has to be pure in order to be effective. Impurity brings ineffectiveness, and when ineffectiveness increases, destruction is the result. For the creation of more effective people, the purity of the mother's life is of great concern. 'Intermixture of castes' is of concern to Arjuna because he understands how difficult and dangerous it is to shift from one boat to another in a fast current All beings, under the tremendous influence of the mighty force of nature, are held fast in the current of evolution. Each has his own specific course to follow. If a man deviates from his own natural course, his own dharma, then it is like changing boats in a fast current. He has to struggle hard to maintain life, a struggle which is experienced as sorrow and suffering and which gives rise to all problems on the path of evolution. The answer to every problem is that there is no problem. Let a man perceive this truth and then he is without problems. This is the strength of knowledge the strength of Sankhya The strength of the wisdom that offers instantaneous realization. This is the knowledge that Lord Krishna is going to reveal to Arjuna in answer to all the basic problems of life that Arjuna is posing in these verses 28 to 46. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.42 This intermixture leads only to hell, both for the family and its destroyers. Their forefathers fall as well, when the offerings of the Pindodaka cease. Purity of blood is at the basis of long life for a family and a society. And this purity depends upon the preservation of ancient family traditions. Destruction of the social order is the greatest loss to a nation. Arjuna is viewing the battle with this vital consideration in mind, taking into account the life of many future generations. His vision is perfect and his concern is genuine. The depth of his thought, his foresight and love for human life and society inspire Lord Krishna to strengthen him with the wisdom of eternal liberation. Lord Krishna quietly listens to what he is saying in order to prepare him more thoroughly for this great blessing. Every sentiment expressed by Arjuna, every doubt raised by him and every inquiry of his into the field of knowledge is being sympathetically received by Lord Krishna and will be answered by Him to Arjuna's satisfaction. 'Pindodaka': according to the Vedic Karma Kanda, the exposition of karma, or action, sons and grandsons are expected to perform certain rites and ceremonies in the name of their departed father and grandfather. The performance of these rites by the direct blood relations, according to the law of affinity, brings goodwill, peace and satisfaction to the departed forefathers wherever they may be in the field of evolution. Not only this, but as a child receives blessings and comforts from his parents, so the departed also bless their children. The Vedic performance of the Pindodaka connects the departed parents with their children on earth and serves as a channel through which the blessings flow. Having shown his concern for the life of individuals, Arjuna, in the following verse, again expresses his concern for the path of evolution and for the whole of society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.43 Through the wrongs done by the destroyers of the family in causing the intermixing of castes, the immemorial dharmas of caste and family become extinct. The laws maintaining the well-being of the whole body consist of a collection of the laws maintaining its different parts, together with others added to co-ordinate different limbs. The laws of the evolution of the body likewise are the sum total of those governing the evolution of different limbs, along with those coordinating them. In a similar way, there are dharmas governing individual evolution and there are dharmas which connect and co-ordinate different individuals. These latter are said primarily to govern the evolution of the society or caste. In verse 40 Arjuna was thinking in terms of the dharma of the family. In this verse he is considering the dharma of the caste, that is, a collection of families upholding similar dharmas. The intermixing of castes destroys the ideals preserved by the immemorial traditions and has the direct result of upsetting the social equilibrium. What happens to a life which is not based on ancient traditions is shown in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.44 Men whose family dharmas have lapsed, so we have heard, O Janardana (Lord Krishna), necessarily live in hell. 'Family dharmas' are the powers of different principles which uphold the co-ordination between different members of a family, at the same time enabling every member, consciously or unconsciously, to help every other member on his path of evolution. Such family dharmas are, for example, those that go to make the relationship of a mother with her son or daughter, or of a brother with his brother or sister, and so on. Family dharmas are maintained in the family traditions. If the family traditions are broken, people living together do not know how to live in such a manner that their way of life naturally helps each of them to evolve. The result is the loss of the path of evolution and the increase of disorder and chaos in the family. Life in such a family is a life in hell, and those fallen into such a degenerate pattern of life remain off the path of evolution and continue to mould their destinies in wretchedness. This is what Arjuna means when he says 'necessarily live in hell'. Here is a great teaching of vital importance which has been missed for centuries. It sets a standard for any society. 'Family dharma' is an established tradition where people born in a particular family engage in the profession of that family. Because of their parental heritage they work efficiently, produce better material for society and improve in their profession. Working with all ease and comfort in their profession, they do not exhaust themselves in work and find time to be regular in their practice for spiritual unfoldment, which is the basis of all success in life. This is how family dharmas and traditions help both the individual and society. Arjuna addresses Lord Krishna as 'Janardana', which is a reminder that He established law and order by destroying the demon Jana. Now, as a result of battle, greater chaos will prevail, for family dharmas will be lost, the world will become hell. Arjuna's concern over the destruction of dharmas indicates that he is reviewing the whole situation from the point of view of the working of nature. This verse establishes a fundamental principle of action: the action should be such that it does not stray from the invisible power of dharma. The following verse indicates how one's wisdom could fail one and wrong decisions result. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.45 Alas! We are resolved to commit great sin in that we are prepared to slay our kinsmen out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. Arjuna feels sorrowful because he is going to sacrifice a greater end for a smaller gain, family and caste dharmas are going to be sacrificed for the sake of his individual dharma. Arjuna calls it a great sin because he is aware that the establishment of righteousness, the Kingdom of God on earth, is a cooperative enterprise. All men have to play their part in it, and this can only be done when family and caste dharmas are properly maintained by the individuals firmly established in their individual dharmas. The loss of family and caste dharmas is a calamity for the social order, a destruction of righteousness, it is a sin against God. That is why Arjuna calls it 'great sin'. Arjuna begins in the following verse to express the line of action he would like to take. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.46 It were better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, should slay me, unresisting and unarmed in battle. Arjuna sees that he would be committing great sin by fighting. As a warrior, once having come on to the battlefield he can neither hold back from fighting nor can he flee; but if he fights, there remains that fear of great sin. He sees no way of escape from this situation, so he says that he were better killed in battle. Because he cannot be killed while armed and alert, he wishes to be unarmed and unresisting. In this way he will not incur great sin against God. This is the faultless mind of the greatest archer of all time, this is bravery and nobility of character. Arjuna considers it better to die than to commit sin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$1.47 Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus at the time of battle, casting away arrows and bows, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with sorrow. 'Having spoken thus': in the previous verses, Arjuna has described the consequences of battle as they presented themselves to his developed heart and mind. Now, still unable to decide his course of action, he becomes aware of himself standing with bow and arrow in his chariot, apparently prepared for war. Arjuna may have thought that by standing armed for battle he did not allow himself to be impartial in his consideration and so decided to cast away arrow and bow, abandon his battle posture and sit down to reflect more deeply in order to find an answer which would satisfy both sides of his problem, love for dear ones and the demand of duty. Arjuna's mind was 'overwhelmed with sorrow': the hour of duty was at hand, but his heart prevented him from responding. With his clear mind he could visualize the far-reaching effects of the destruction the battle would bring. This overwhelmed his thought with sorrow. Fortunate are they whose minds are distressed for the misfortunes of others. More fortunate still are they who are able to relieve the misfortunes of others, themselves remaining undisturbed. In the following chapter, Arjuna will receive the light which will enable him, without a trace of distress and established in the blissful freedom of God-consciousness, to alleviate the evil overshadowing the world. Thus end the Yoga of the Despondency of Arjuna. This chapter is the soul of the Bhagavad-Gita, while all those that follow form the body. Hope and fulfillment are the blessings of this glorious chapter. It gives a direct way to peaceful, energetic and successful life in the world, together with spiritual comfort and freedom from bondage. The chapter expounds Brahma Vidya in its completeness the wisdom of the Absolute both in its theoretical and practical aspects and presents the central idea of the entire theme of the Bhagavad-Gita. It has seed-ideas which are developed in all the following chapters. At the same time this chapter is self-contained. It is in itself powerful enough to uplift any mind, however low its level. It presents a complete philosophy of life, starting from the state of a seeker and ending in the state of fulfillment. The thought of the first chapter continues to flow into the early part of this one. The potential force underlying Arjuna's state of suspension finds an outlet in the ocean of the eternal wisdom of Lord Krishna. Arjuna's condition, which inspired Lord Krishna to reveal the secret wisdom of integrated life, is portrayed at the beginning of the chapter, and the key to this wisdom is revealed in the 45th verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.1 Sanjaya said: To him thus overcome by compassion, full of sorrow, his eyes distressed and filled with tears, Madhusudana (Lord Krishna) spoke these words: 'Madhusudana': the slayer of the demon Madhu The use of this word indicates that a mighty power is rising to put an end to Arjuna's paralyzing state of suspension. Even a mind as highly alert and intelligent as was Arjuna's had become caught in a situation which was out of control. His heart could not be reconciled with his mind, his love of kinsmen with the call of duty to destroy evil. On the practical level, this is like wanting to remain in darkness and yet be in the light. Arjuna has set himself a task which is impossible unless he attains a state of consciousness which will justify any action of his and will allow him even to kill in love, in support of the purpose of evolution. Arjuna could not reconcile killing and loving. This is no weakness on his part and does not detract from his greatness. Any man of similar high development would arrive at this state of suspension between heart and mind. Arjuna was a man of dynamic nature. His heart was full of love, yet he could not at this time love his dear ones. His mind was clear, alert and full of purpose, yet he could not at this time act according to its dictates. Held in suspension as he was, he could not fight and satisfy his mind, nor could he love his dear ones and satisfy his heart. For this reason he was 'full of sorrow'. Arjuna was not confused, as commentators in general have portrayed him. His heart and mind were at the height of alertness, but they could not show him a line of action to fulfill their contradictory aspirations. Even this could not throw Arjuna of his balance, for Sanjaya says: 'eyes distressed and filled with tears'. Had he been off his balance, his eyes would have been vacant. But they had life in them: distress is seen in them, and they express the heart through tears. The 'distress' seen in the eyes gives expression to his great concern, and this shows mental alertness. The sequence of the expressions used in this verse is of great significance in arriving at the truth of Arjuna's condition. 'Overcome by compassion' shows that his heart is filled with compassion alone. The expression that follows is 'full of sorrow'. If the heart is full of compassion, then there is no place in it for an emotion of such a dissimilar quality as sorrow. This makes it clear that the phrase 'full of sorrow' does not refer to Arjuna's heart. It does not describe an emotion, but only the state of his mind. Thus Arjuna's heart was full of compassion and his mind full of sorrow. His state should not be misunderstood as indicating weakness or confusion. This verse shows Arjuna in his full stature, at the height of his intelligence, sensitivity and alertness, and at the same time without any line of action to follow. This condition of suspension is of value, for it provides a real basis for divine intelligence. At first sight it appears to be the result of circumstances, but it is in fact produced by the first word of Lord Krishna on the battlefield. The purity of Arjuna's life, receiving a wave of love from Lord Krishna, developed into a state of suspension and prepared the ground for the divine wisdom to dawn. Here is the picture of a man of the world who is going to receive the greatest divine wisdom ever revealed to man. In order to find the real Arjuna on whom the blessing came, we must look beyond the appearance of tears and distress. The outer structure of tears and distress serves to protect the inner glory of consciousness in a state of suspension. It is like the bitter skin of an orange which contains sweet juice within it. The apparent phenomenal phase of the world is not so attractive, but within it is the altar of God whose light sustains our life. Lord Krishna will not allow even the outer aspect of Arjuna's life to look 'sorrowful'. He will improve the appearance also. And with that in view He shocks Arjuna as He begins His speech. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.2 The Blessed Lord said: Whence has this blemish, alien to honorable men, causing disgrace and opposed to heaven, come upon you, Arjuna, at this untimely hour? Problems are not solved on the level of problems. Analyzing a problem to find its solution is like trying to restore freshness to a leaf by treating the leaf itself, whereas the solution lies in watering the root. Arjuna, in the previous twenty-one verses, has raised, basically, all the problems that may confront any life at any time. When the Lord begins to answer, He does not devote a moment to Arjuna's arguments. He simply dismisses everything that Arjuna has said without analyzing it, because by analyzing each statement it would not be possible to resolve the situation. All problems of life arise from some weakness of mind. All weakness of mind is due to the mind's ignorance of its own essential nature, which is universal and the source of infinite energy and intelligence. This ignorance of one's own self is the basis of all problems, sufferings and shortcomings in life. In order to root out any problem of life it is only necessary to be brought out of ignorance, to be brought to knowledge. In order to bring anyone to knowledge, it is first necessary to bring him to a state of mind where he will listen. Arjuna being in a state of suspension, the Lord said something to him which would shake his mind and make him capable of hearing and understanding. In this verse the Lord appraises Arjuna's situation in words which suggest its solution. The first word spoken by Lord Krishna in this discourse expresses the whole philosophy of life, the whole of Vedanta: the world of forms and phenomena in its ever-changing nature, and the absolute never-changing Reality of transcendental nature, both are full, 'purnamadah purnamidam'. Whence then has come this blemish of ignorance, which causes sorrow? Again, as the present is composed of the two 'fulls', the blemish does not belong to any present time; that is why it is 'untimely' at any 'hour'. Arjuna has presented his problems in verses 28-46 of the first chapter, how Lord Krishna sees the situation and disapproves of it is clear from the expressions of this verse. 'Whence' indicates the baselessness of the whole argument. This word runs parallel to verse 28 which provides a basis for Arjuna's argument. 'Blemish' refers to the content of verses 29-31. 'Alien to honorable men' expresses the nature of verses 32-35. 'Causing disgrace' refers to verses 36-39. 'Opposed to heaven' refers to verses 40-46. The Lord exclaims to Arjuna: 'Whence has this blemish . . . come upon you?' He speaks with surprise and uses the word 'blemish' to epitomize Arjuna's overall state and way of thinking. The word 'blemish', accompanied by 'alien to honorable men, causing disgrace and opposed to heaven' and 'untimely hour', hit Arjuna hard. His alert mind and heart received a severe shock, which jolted him out of the state of suspension. Immediately he lost confidence in the way he was thinking. This made him look to the Lord. The following verse brings another shock to Arjuna and strengthens the effect produced by this verse. The Lord implies that, whether surroundings and circumstances are favorable or unfavorable, men of honor and grace always act in a way that leads them to glory here on earth and in heaven. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.3 Partha! Yield not to unmanliness. It is unworthy of you. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies Again this verse shows psychological skill in handling a problem. Here the Lord uses the word 'unmanliness', at the same time reminding Arjuna of his honorable heritage by calling him Partha, the son of Pritha. This is to neutralize in Arjuna what Lord Krishna calls 'faintheartedness'. Lord Krishna realized that when He first addressed him as Partha, asking him to behold the Kurus assembled in the battle,' He awoke in him the love of his mother Pritha, and He knew that the great wave of love instilled by Him in Arjuna's heart was responsible for his present state of suspension. Therefore, to bring Arjuna back to his initial preparedness to fight, it was necessary to expand the one-sided nature of the love produced by the word Partha. This is the reason why Lord Krishna here again uses 'Partha' and associates it with 'faintheartedness'. Having produced this effect in the heart, it was at once necessary to direct the flow of Arjuna's mind away from the state of suspension towards action; so the Lord tells him to 'stand up'. In this way, the Lord sets up an impulse in his mind towards fighting and immediately supplements it by reminding him of his status as a 'scorcher of enemies'. The Lord wants to stop Arjuna at once from thinking in a manner that will lead him nowhere. He tells Arjuna that this way does not belong to him, for he has always been a dynamic personality, 'It is unworthy of you'. This saying of the Lord's also has a deeper meaning. 'It is unworthy of you' reminds Arjuna of his essential nature. 'That thou art', declare the Upanishads unbounded eternal Being. You should breathe universal life and not fall prey to 'faintheartedness', for that belongs to the field of ignorance. Asking him to shake off his 'faintheartedness', the Lord qualifies it by 'paltry'. By this He means to encourage Arjuna: the weakness he has to overcome is not great but just a failing of the heart. Lord Krishna wants to convey to Arjuna that when love grows in man's heart, his outlook becomes more universal, and he should become stronger and more dynamic, but that in his case this has not happened. Arjuna has not gained a universal outlook. This expresses a great metaphysical truth: ignorance has no material substance. It is just an illusion which should be easy to shake off. Unfortunately this ignorance has deprived Arjuna of the strength that the wave of love should naturally bring. Certainly, as a great warrior, Arjuna is brave by nature. That is why the Lord seems only to remind him of what he is: unbounded and eternal in his absolute nature and the 'scorcher of enemies' in his relative nature, in his human form. A close study of these two verses, which form the Lord's first exhortation, shows that they contain in essence the entire teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.4 Arjuna said: How shall I fight Bhishma and Drona with arrows on the battlefield, O Madhusudana? Worthy of reverence are they, O slayer of enemies! Arjuna addresses Lord Krishna as Madhusudana, slayer of the demon Madhu, while recounting the names of Bhishma and Drona. Thereby he silently suggests to Lord Krishna: You are the slayer of demons; how can you ask me to slay these noble elders? You are the slayer of enemies; how can you ask me to kill those who are worthy of reverence! This shows Arjuna's alertness of mind even in this state of suspension. If: one is alert and awake in heart and mind, there is always hope of rising above any time of trial. Arjuna presses his point further in the next verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.5 If is surely better to live even on alms in this world than to slay these noble-minded masters; for though they are desirous of gain, having killed them I should enjoy only blood-stained pleasures in this world. This shows Arjuna's greatness, nobility of character and farsightedness. It shows the quality of his human heart. Arjuna, as a great archer, was aware of the pathetic records of bloodstained conquests in history. He could foresee great damage to the civilization of his time. He could picture in his mind ruins of war everywhere; he could hear within himself the cries of children and lamentations of women, tales of calamity and oppression. Arjuna, a hero with a good human heart, would do anything to hold back from the situation that seems imminent. He goes so far as to say that it is 'better to live even on alms in this world than to slay these noble-minded masters' and 'enjoy only blood-stained pleasures'. In the following verse he continues his argument. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.6 We do not know which is better for us: that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashta stand face to face with us. If we killed them we should not wish to live. This shows Arjuna's selfless view of life If: he is to enjoy the kingdom, he wants the joy of it to be shared by all those who are dear to him; and if he cannot share it with them, he prefers to forego the kingdom altogether. The verse brings to light the way of thinking of a man of evolved consciousness. Arjuna, realizing the gravity of the situation, is concerned over the responsibility that rests upon him. He thinks about the consequences of victory or defeat and finds no justification even for a victory of his own side, if that will deprive him of his dear ones. Placed in a helpless situation, Arjuna decides that it cannot be resolved on any level of human thinking or feeling. He therefore looks to the Lord for divine guidance. The following verse records the helplessness of the greatest archer of all time, the most innocent and sincere feelings of surrender of a great and wise man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.7 My nature smitten with the taint of weakness, confused in mind about dharma, I pray Thee, tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple; teach me for I have taken refuge in Thee. Arjuna has persisted in his attitude, and when he has gone as far as he possibly can in that direction, he suddenly feels unable to think any more. He stops, his intellect rebounds and he falls at the feet of the Lord. It generally happens that as long as a man feels that he can think and do for himself, he sees no need to listen to others. When he is at his wits' end, he looks for refuge. If he finds a refuge, he approaches it in all humility and puts his trust in it. When he has surrendered himself completely, it takes full care of him. This is the impartial divine nature: I am to them as they are to Me. 'Tell me decisively' reveals Arjuna's character. He is a practical man who does not want to remain on the level of idealistic talk. He asks for a clear line of action, which he can follow without doubt and which will prove to be right for him, his aim being the good of all. If a man has dedicated his life to the service of others and is conscientious about his responsibilities, he has all the greater need to be right in the course of action he adopts. This situation does not in any way reflect on Arjuna's character. It is the integrity of his inner life that makes him see weakness in himself. His greatness is revealed when he says: 'confused in mind about dharma'. On one side he has his family dharma (duty of a householder) impelling him to protect and love his kinsmen, and on the other his caste dharma (duty of a kshatriya, protector of society) demanding that he kill the aggressors. He is not able to decide for himself which dharma to follow and looks upon this as his weakness. In reality it is the circumstances that are responsible. No man of heart and mind would consider it to be Arjuna's weakness; but he calls it his weakness. His greatness of character makes him too humble in analyzing his condition before Lord Krishna. When Arjuna surrenders himself to gain wisdom as a disciple, the Lord accepts him, and it is from this point that Lord Krishna's teaching commences. This is really the beginning of the Bhagavad-Gita. It is an established natural law that action and reaction are equal to one another. In order that the reaction may take place, the action has first to begin. In the same way, in order that the teaching may begin, the pupil has first to approach the teacher. When he has done this he is considered serious, and the teacher feels a responsibility to teach him. As long as Arjuna was talking to Lord Krishna on a friendly basis, Lord Krishna answered in the same manner. But when Arjuna became serious and said: I submit myself to you as a disciple, show me the way, guide me to the light, for I am unable to see for myself, when Arjuna became quiet and turned completely to Lord Krishna, then the Lord took him seriously and began to enlighten him with the practical wisdom of life. When a patient will not keep still, the surgeon cannot start the operation; only when the patient submits himself to the surgeon to do as he wishes does he feel free to operate. This is a great secret of success when guidance is sought from another in any walk of life. And the wisdom of peace and happiness in life, the wisdom of success in the world and freedom from bondage is the greatest secret of life. It is Brahma Vidya, the knowledge of the Ultimate. Naturally it can be imparted only to those who are at least willing to receive it. Their willingness is judged by their readiness to receive, and this in turn by their one-pointed attention in faithful devotion to the master. Faith makes the student a good assimilator of knowledge. Devotion sets him free from resistance and at the same time influences the heart of the master, whence the spring of wisdom pours forth. Devotion on the part of the disciple creates affection in the heart of the master. When a calf approaches its mother, the milk begins to flow from her udder, ready for the calf to drink without effort. Such is the glory of devotion and faith in a disciple. He surrenders at the feet of the master and cuts short the long path of evolution. The result of Arjuna's sincere surrender to Lord Krishna was seen without delay. By His teaching, both theoretical and practical, He helped Arjuna to free himself from his state of suspension. At the end of a short discourse on a battlefield, Arjuna had become a yogi, a bhaktat and a gyani. He had become established in the fullness of resolute intellect, in great skill in action and in the eternal freedom of existence. To reach that state, Arjuna had only to surrender at the feet of the Lord. Surrender does not mean blind passivity. Throughout the Bhagavad-Gita, Arjuna continues to ask questions, for the student gains complete freedom to ask anything, once he has impressed the master with his sincerity. In a relationship of this quality between the teacher and the taught, the task of both becomes easy and free from resistance. Wisdom flows spontaneously from one to the other. Having surrendered himself, Arjuna, in the next verse, shows clearly the present state of his mind. The path of surrender does not allow any reservations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.8 Indeed I do not see what could dispel the grief that dries up my senses, though I should obtain an unrivalled and prosperous kingdom on earth and even lordship of the gods. 'Dries up my senses': by reason of Arjuna's state of suspension, the co-ordination between the mind and the senses is lost. A plant becomes dry because it has received no nourishment from the root, and there is no way of giving it nourishment from outside. Without co-ordination with the mind, the senses have no chance of remaining alert and cannot enjoy even the greatest pleasures on earth. If the surrender described in the previous verse had been complete, Arjuna should have been silent about his grief from that moment. But he expresses it even after declaring that he has surrendered. This shows that even the sense of surrender cannot immediately free him. It can happen that even the ocean fails to subdue a volcanic eruption. Nothing in the outer world can dispel the grief in Arjuna's mind, for he is overtaken by a suspension so profound that it renders him incapable of action. Study of this verse brings out a fundamental principle of spiritual life The true state of surrender does not leave one suffering; one casts off all difficulties, and the relief brings one to silence. This and the previous four verses summarize the basic problems of life that Arjuna put before the Lord in verses 28 to 46 of Chapter I. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.9 Sanjaya said: Gudakesha, oppressor of the foe, having spoken thus to Hrishikesha, said to Govinda (Lord Krishna): 'I will not fight' and fell silent. Arjuna has been called 'Gudakesha' (the conqueror of sleep) and 'oppressor of the foe' These expressions indicate that at this point, when Arjuna says: 'I will not fight', he is free from dullness and his strength is not failing him. The use of 'Hrishikesha' or 'Govinda', the lord and master of the senses, expresses Lord Krishna's position in relation to Arjuna. With all his strength and alertness of mind, Arjuna stands as a child before the greatness of Lord Krishna. His words: 'I will not fight', are like the words of a child who says: 'I will not go there', and yet looks to his father to find out his intentions. Once Arjuna has surrendered' himself at the feet of the Lord, he becomes as a child before Him. Arjuna is justified in saying that he will not fight, because he has surrendered himself. Arjuna is a warrior; when he says he has surrendered, he means it and begins to behave accordingly. Now his heart, body and mind all belong to Lord Krishna; therefore he cannot fight or do anything unless he receives orders. He knows that the problem must be expressed clearly, and then the solution will come easily. Arjuna has had his say; now Lord Krishna will speak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.10 To him, O Bhavata (Dhritarashtra), sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, Hrishikesha smilingly spoke these words: 'Hrishikesha smilingly spoke': this expression is used to indicate that lifting Arjuna out of his state of silence and hesitancy and releasing him from the benumbed condition of the senses was not a big task for one who is the Lord of the senses. 'Smilingly' may also be understood as indicating the technique of enlightening a disciple by encouraging him at the very start. The disheartened seeker becomes encouraged by the first sign of the master's smile, which shows him without a word that his problems are neither so serious as he thinks nor so difficult as to be insurmountable. The contrast brought out is significant. It shows Arjuna in despair, while Lord Krishna smiles in His usual divine, playful, blissful mood The two aspects of existence are represented here: on the one hand, unmanifested absolute bliss-consciousness, symbolized by Lord Krishna; and on the other, the height of human consciousness represented by Arjuna. The darkness is on the point of being illumined by the celestial light; the silence of Arjuna is about to be broken and made melodious by the celestial song, as his grief is transformed into the smile of the Lord. The word 'smilingly' also refers to the unshakeable nature of Lord Krishna. Anyone but the Lord would have been overwhelmed to find that, with the two great armies drawn up ready to fight, the hero on his side was sinking into despair. In the following verse Lord Krishna begins his glorious discourse. But it should be noted again that He does not enter into Arjuna's arguments; He dismisses them all with the first word that He speaks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.11 The Blessed Lord said: You grieve for those for whom there shouId be no grief, yet speak as do the wise. Wise men grieve neither for the dead nor for the living. The Lord tells Arjuna that he speaks in the language of the wise, and in saying this He also shows him how wise men think. The first mark of such men is that they do not grieve over anything, for they know that everything is in its essence everlasting. From the point of view of real existence, Bhishma and Drona and all those for whom Arjuna is concerned have infinite life. It is wrong for Arjuna to grieve for them. Can there be grief in the mind of a wise man either for the living or for the dead? He does not grieve over the past, nor can anything in the present make him unhappy, for he is established in Truth, the unchangeable Reality. This verse reveals the wisdom of the master: he makes the aspirant aware of his own position and at the same time makes clear to him his goal. Lord Krishna makes Arjuna see his present state of mind, in which he is grieving over nothing, and his goal, the state of wisdom, in which he would not grieve over anything. This also illustrates a principle of the relationship between master and pupil: the master is only concerned with taking the disciple from his present state to the goal. The Lord does not bring Himself into the picture here; He only describes Arjuna's present position and the state to which He wishes to lead him. He has only hinted at the goal but has made Arjuna clearly aware of his condition, His purpose being to bring Arjuna to that complete dependence which will enable him to receive His skilful guidance to the fullest advantage. The disciple is not asked to be alert and listen, yet this effect is produced in his mind at the beginning of the discourse by making him aware of his position. This verse begins the first part of Lord Krishna's discourse, which is known as 'Sankhya'. From here to verse 38, Lord Krishna gives Arjuna this wisdom of full life, the wisdom of both the absolute and the relative aspects of existence, which He calls Sankhya. A close study suggests that the questions raised by Arjuna in five verses are answered by the five expressions contained in this verse: 1. You grieve for those for whom there should be no grief. 2. Yet speak as do the wise. 3. Neither for the living nor for the dead. 4. Grieve not. 5. Wise men. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.12 There never was a time when I was not, nor you, nor these rulers of men. Nor will there ever be a time when all of us shall cease to be. Here the Lord presents to Arjuna the permanent nature of the inner man, the inner Reality of individual life The nature of this spirit in man is imperishable. Despite the continual change of bodies in the past, present and future, it ever remains the same The permanent nature of the inner aspect of life, the Self, is an abstract conception and so, in order to make it as concrete as possible the Lord speaks about it in terms of Himself, Arjuna and those present This illustrates an important aspect of teaching: abstract theories are explained by concrete illustrations. The Lord says we shall all continue to exist even after the death of these bodies, for the self is eternal, life continues to be, it is everlasting. Here follows an illustration which illumines the wisdom of Sankhya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.13 As the dweller in this body passes into childhood, youth and age, so also does he pass into another body. This does not bewilder the wise. The wise are not taken aback by changes of the body; the death of the body is like the change that takes place when children become grown-up, or when the young become old. Phenomenal changes continue to take place, while the never-changing Reality of life, the dweller in the body, remains ever the same. It is not possible for a man who knows this to feel great concern about the death of the body, but even with this knowledge he still feels heat and cold, pleasure and pain. How this situation should be met is explained in the next verse. These verses express the vital content of the wisdom of Sankhya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.14 Contacts (of the senses) with their objects, O son of Kunti, give rise to (the experience of) cold and heat, pleasure and pain. Transient, they come and go. Bear them patiently, O Bharata! Firmly established in the understanding of the unchangeable, the wise are never affected by the changing conditions of the body during life or after death. The experience of the objects of the senses and their effects, the experience of pleasure and pain, are just phenomena which come and go. Here the Lord wants to show Arjuna that things which are not of a permanent nature should not weigh heavily. It is as if He were saying: Take it lightly, for things will naturally go in the same way in which they came. Your life should be based on something which is of lasting nature, Arjuna! Do not give importance to the consideration of the fleeting and impermanent phases of life. Rise to the understanding that the permanent Reality of existence will continue to be, while that which is temporary will go on changing. So take life as it comes. This alone befits you, for you are called Bharata, the descendant of the great Bharata, who was established in the light, the Reality of life. The result of remaining even-minded in pleasure and pain is shown in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.15 That man indeed whom these (contacts) do not disturb, who is even-minded in pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit for immortality, O best of men! The Lord emphasizes to Arjuna that, once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent Reality of life as explained in verse 13 his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and lives in the permanent phase of life; he attains eternal life. It is the Lord's purpose that Arjuna shall gain this state where he will be above all considerations in the relative field, even death, and all problems of life and death. The unlimited state of the ocean is not affected either by the inflow of rivers or the process of evaporation. In the same way, a man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from influence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life. At this present time it is generally found that people try to make a mood of equanimity in pleasure and pain, in loss and gain, they try to create a mood of equable behavior and unaffectedness while engaged in the diverse activities of the world. But trying to make a mood on the basis of understanding is simply hypocrisy. Many seekers become trapped in such an attitude. This will become clearer as we proceed. The understanding does not become ripe as a result of moodmaking. It is only necessary to understand the meaning of this and the previous three verses once, in order to live the Reality of the relationship between the inner eternal life and the outer everchanging phases of existence When once a man knows that he is king and the state belongs to him, he immediately begins to make use of his relationship with the state, begins to behave as a king. He is not required to cultivate kingship by practice and by constant thought about his position, just as a child is not required to remember always that his mother 'is his mother. He just knows it once and lives the relationship at all times. So simple is the path of understanding which results in freedom from bondage. The whole truth of life is that there is nothing substantial to bind the never-changing to the ever-changing sphere of life. And nothing to keep them bound together. It is only ignorance of the natural state of freedom existing between these spheres that results in binding them together. This ignorance, and the bondage born of it, keep life in motion, the inner aspect remaining never-changing and the outer ever-changing. The outer ever-changing aspect continues eternally by virtue of the inner. Thus life flows onward in the natural state of eternal freedom, on the basis of ignorance! The knowledge contained in these verses, the wisdom of Sankhya, cuts asunder the bonds of ignorance and allows life to be in its natural state of eternal freedom. The following verses further expound this wisdom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.16 The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be. The final truth about them both has thus been perceived by the seers of ultimate Reality. The indestructibility of human essence is explained here. Ultimate Reality has been defined as that which never changes. Opposed to it is the unreal, which is ever-changing; for clearly that which always changes has no substance, no real existence. Here in this verse the Lord brings Arjuna to see the Reality at the basis of the multiplicity of creation. This is the next step, following logically upon that of the previous verse. Here the seer of Truth perceives clearly the difference between the permanent, never-changing absolute state of life and its ever-changing states of diversified phenomenal existence. It is this which gives him that stability and heightened state of consciousness by which he rises above the binding influence of activity in the phenomenal world. Arjuna is being led step by step towards the vision of a realized man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.17 Know That to be indeed indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can work the destruction of this immutable Being. The Lord presents to Arjuna the indestructibility of the inner Reality, the Being of the phenomenal objective world, which pervades everything. It may be made clear here that the omnipresent Being and the spirit within man are not two different entities. They are found to be different because of the different individual nervous systems. As the same sun appears as different when shining on different media, such as water and oil, so the same omnipresent Being, shining through different nervous systems, appears as different and forms the spirit, the subjective aspect of man's personality. When the nervous system is pure, Being reflects more and the spirit is more powerful, the mind more effective. When the nervous system is at its purest, then Being reflects in all its fullness, and the inner individuality of the spirit gains the level of unlimited eternal Being. Thus it is clear that in its essential nature the spirit is undying and omnipresent. This explains the universality of individuality. In the previous verses, step by step, and each a step of profound wisdom, the everlasting nature of the spirit was brought home to Arjuna. In this verse its indestructible nature is stressed. In the verses which follow, the impermanence of phenomenal life will be emphasized and with it the principle that the phenomenal world is just the manifested phase of eternal unmanifested Being. The conclusion is that, from both points of view, that of the permanence of Being and that of the impermanent level of life, Arjuna's duty is not to worry about anything, but to rise up and do what he has to do. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.18 These bodies are known to have an end; the dweller in the body is eternal, imperishable, infinite. Therefore, O Bharata, fight! It is obvious that at every moment the body is changing. The body of a child is not the body of a youth; and the body of a youth is not the body of an old man. So if death is inevitably going on, even during what is said to be life, nothing new seems to happen when one body dies and another body is taken. There is no point therefore in lamenting the death of the body and even less in lamenting it in anticipation. 'Dweller in the body': this verse brings out a distinction between the body and the spirit that dwells within it. There is no aim here of classifying the different aspects of the spirit. within, but only of drawing a line between the unchangeable inner content of life and the destructible nature of the outer body. It can, however, be explained that the inner spirit may be understood in two ways: first, as the ego, together with the mind and senses, which constitutes the doer and the experiencer, the enjoyer and the sufferer; secondly, as the 'dweller in the body', which is the individual aspect of cosmic existence, of eternal Being, and which is known in Sanskrit terminology as 'jiva'. Jiva, then, is individualized cosmic existence; it is the individual spirit within the body. With its limitations removed, jiva is Atman, transcendent Being. When the individuality of the jiva and the universality of the transcendent Self the Atman, are united and found together on one level of life, the I: there is Brahman, the all-embracing cosmic life. As the individual jiva in its essence is Atman, it is here called 'eternal, imperishable, infinite'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.19 He who understands him to be the slayer, and he who takes him to be the slain, both fail to perceive the truth. He neither slays nor is slain. It has been made clear that the self, or spirit, in its essential nature, knows no change or variation, is free from any attributes, is neither the doer nor the doing. All attributes belong to the relative, the manifested field of life; therefore the spirit cannot be regarded as either the subject or the object of any action. The activity assumed by an ignorant man to belong to himself, to the subjective personality that he calls himself, does not belong to his real Self, for this, in its essential nature, is beyond activity. The Self, in its real nature, is only the silent witness of everything. That is why the Lord says: 'He who understands him to be the slayer, and he who takes him to be the slain, both fail to perceive the truth'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.20 He is never born, nor does he ever die; nor once having been, does he cease to be. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, he is not slain when the body is slain. The eternal unmanifested absolute nature of the spirit, or self, is ever unaffected by happenings in the relative field. It is ever the same, beyond the limits of time, space and causation. Without beginning or end, it knows no birth or death. Whether in this or that body, the self continues to be The immutable eternal life remains through the ever-changing phases of the bodies which it takes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.21 One who knows him to be indestructible, everlasting, unborn, undying, how can that man, O Partha, slay or cause anyone to slay ? In these verses Lord Krishna provides the intellectual conception of that state to which He wants Arjuna to rise, the state where he will be established in his real, eternal Self. Once established in It, he will attain to the Reality of existence and thus rise above the influence of the action of fighting and, indeed, of all actions in life. For action is in the field of ever-changing existence, and his consciousness will be established in the changeless existence of Being. Therefore he will quite naturally be above the influence of action. The discourse is presented with marvelous skill. Since the Lord wants to give Arjuna the intellectual conception of Reality, not only does He continue to describe that which has no attributes, but He also questions Arjuna to attract his attention and to awaken his wits so that the description will be more clearly understood. It is obvious, the Lord tells him, that anyone who knows the Reality of life as never-changing eternal Being would not, how could he, attribute to It anything of the perishable order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.22 As a man casting off worn-out garments takes other new ones, so the dweller in the body casting off worn-out bodies takes others that are new. This is an illustration to make clear the idea contained in the previous verse. It presents a picture of the unchanging nature of the dweller in the body, the spirit or jiva, which is enlarged upon in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.23 Weapons cannot cleave him, nor fire burn him; water cannot wet him, nor wind dry him away. The intention here is to bring home to Arjuna the immortality, the never-changing nature of the self, and to make him see clearly that nothing can possibly affect it in any way. One thing was deep-rooted in Arjuna's mind: the feeling that his sharp arrows would pierce and mutilate the bodies of those he held dear and slay them. That is why the Lord begins by making him understand that their existence would not, in the real sense, be destroyed by his weapons. Reality is one, omnipresent, devoid of any duality, without components, that is why It cannot be slain. The body is composed of different parts, that is why it can be slain. To make the idea still clearer, the Lord explains that even the elements of air, water and fire, which are much more refined and powerful than Arjuna's weapons, are unable to disturb the self. The Lord mentions weapons, fire, air and water as symbolic of the entire creation. His aim is to show Arjuna that the self, being transcendental, remains ever untouched by anything in this relative field. This idea is developed in the verses that follow, so as to leave Arjuna in no doubt regarding the permanent nature of the self. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.24 He is uncleavable; he cannot be burned; he cannot be wetted, nor yet can he be dried. He is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, ever the same. The teacher may start, as in this verse, by explaining Reality in terms of the negation of common experience. When the mind of the pupil begins to rise to something abstract, beyond the sphere of his present experience, he is then told of what may be called the positive attributes of Reality. It is true that absolute Reality is without any attribute, but even so, expressions have to be used to convey some sense of It. Here the Lord uses both means of enlightenment, negation and affirmation, beautifully in one stroke. The teacher has to be alert enough not to miss a single reaction of the pupil's mind to every word he speaks. Only by striking at the right moment are the desired results achieved. The sequence of words is important: being eternal, Reality is all-pervading, being all-pervading, It is stable; being stable, It is immovable; and being immovable, It is ever the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.25 He is declared to be unmanifest, unthinkable, unchangeable; therefore knowing him as such you should not grieve. It was essential for Lord Krishna to impart to Arjuna a vivid intellectual conception of the soul, the real Self, transcendent and without attributes, and He had to do this when Arjuna's mind was 'full of sorrow'. It was therefore all the more necessary to present the conception of the unknowable through attributes of the already known world. Arjuna had to be given this clear intellectual conception of Reality in order to prepare him for the state of enlightenment. He could not be given the direct vision but had to be shown the intellectual conception first and then be led to experience step by step. Otherwise Arjuna could not have understood that behind obvious phenomenal existence there lies eternal Being, and that he himself is That, and everything is That. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.26 Even if you think of him as constantly taking birth and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, you should not grieve like this. Up to this stage in the dialogue, the Lord has explained life from the viewpoint of the indestructibility of the self. In this verse He begins on a different argument. Even if Arjuna remains unconvinced of the immortality of the dweller in the body, this does not justify his grieving; even if the dweller in the body is seen as repeatedly dying with the death of the body and repeatedly being born with the birth of the body, Arjuna still has no need to grieve. So perfect is the Lord's logic that one argument is given and a statement established, and then, even when quite contrary reasoning is applied, the same conclusion is reached. This is the glory that belongs to the teaching of the Absolute: It is found to be the same whatever one's angle of vision. Only the Absolute can be known in this manner. While this is the glory of the Absolute, it is also the glory of the master's mind that can deduce the same conclusion from two diametrically opposed lines of reasoning. If Arjuna is not convinced by one line of reasoning, the Lord does not leave him to his fate but tries to convince him through another. This is the situation between Arjuna and the Lord that was created by his surrender at His feet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.27 Certain indeed is death for the born and certain is birth for the dead; therefore over the inevitable you should not grieve. Change is inevitable in the field of relative existence; it is going on even in the present, as it was in the past and will be in the future. Therefore birth and death are natural events about which one should not feel much concern. The phenomenon of birth and death is the expression of the eternal process of evolution, which in its turn expresses the purpose of creation. Life evolves with a view to the realization of perfection. Development through change is the natural course of this cosmic process. Every change is significant, for it provides a step to perfection. The manner in which change takes place is also in line with the cosmic purpose of evolution, for it too is governed by the eternal laws of cause and effect. This is how, through birth and death, the plan of life finds its fulfillment. Man has freedom of action; thereby he can adopt any channel, good or bad, through which he wants the course of his life to flow. This is in his hands. But change is inevitable, and it is for the sake of life that this is so: 'therefore over the inevitable you should not grieve'. On the contrary, change should be welcomed for it opens new vistas of life towards fulfillment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.28 Creatures are unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the middle state and unmanifest again at the end, Oh Bharata! What grief is there in this? Here again, and from yet another angle, the same conclusion is reached: the phenomenal presents the manifested state of life; while Being is of unmanifested transcendental nature. According to the findings of modern physics, all matter has only phenomenal existence and is in reality formless energy. Both in its previous state and in its present obvious form, matter is nothing but pure energy, and on dissolution of the present form it will remain the same energy. Similarly, the present phenomenal phase of existence is seen to have no permanent significance, and it is this that the Lord is impressing upon Arjuna. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.29 One sees him as a wonder, another likewise speaks of him as a wonder, and as a wonder another hears of him. Yet even on (seeing, speaking and hearing) some do not understand him. Because the self is of unmanifested nature, and because man's life is always in the field of the manifested, it is not to be wondered at if some people hear about it with great surprise and others are not able to understand it at all. The purpose of this verse is simply to give a picture of the dissimilar nature of the ephemeral and eternal aspects of life. Although Arjuna is obviously unfamiliar with eternal Reality, it is not the Lord's aim to stress the difficulty of understanding It. It is a wonder to some because, although omnipresent, It is found as the individual self, and although eternal, It is found dying and being born. That is why it is difficult to comprehend Its full nature by mere intellectual process. It needs a direct experience for the abstract Reality to be properly understood. There is yet another implication. Up to this verse, the Lord has been trying in different ways to make Arjuna understand that he should not grieve. But he is not free from grief, and therefore, as an additional step in the task of enlightening him, the Lord points out that his response to what he has heard is a feeling of strangeness. In order to encourage him, the Lord seems to be saying that this feeling of strangeness does not matter, for it is natural with regard to knowledge of eternal life. Many marvel at it and find it a wonder. One can take a different point of view and conclude that the Lord means to show that Reality is difficult to attain, for many having heard of It and spoken about It are not able to understand It. Nevertheless it is wiser to hold that the purpose of the verse is not to convince Arjuna of the difficulty of attainment, but to give him hope that, although many find it difficult, it is going to prove easy for him. This verse speaks of eternal Reality, which is strange to many in many different ways, because everyone looks at It from his own level of consciousness. For this reason, many who seek It find It impossible to attain on the level of the senses and the intellect, since these are concerned only with the temporary, phenomenal phases of life. The next verse brings to an end the intellectual description of the two aspects of life, the ever-changing and the never-changing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.30 He who dwells in the body of everyone is eternal and invulnerable, O Bharata; therefore you should not grieve for any creature whatsoever. This is the conclusion of all that has been said by the Lord from the eleventh verse onwards. Every creature is on the path to perfection. Through births and deaths of bodies, everyone is progressing towards fulfillment. No one should grieve over the death of another. Arjuna, having acquired understanding of the permanent nature of the dweller in the body and the impermanence of the body, should respond to the call of duty, for that alone will help his own evolution and that of others. The following verse begins the argument on the level of duty. This is to deepen the understanding of life after the absolute and relative aspects of existence have been made clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.31 Even if you consider your own dharma you should not waver, for there is nothing better for a kshatriya than a battle in accord with dharma. The event of war is a natural phenomenon. It is a process of restoring the balance between the negative and positive forces of nature To rise to the call of a war to establish righteousness is to respond to the cosmic purpose, the will of God To live and die to maintain law and order in society, thereby remaining a faithful instrument in the hand of God, is the privilege of a man born in a kshatriya family. The Lord's purpose is to convince Arjuna that, from the point of view of his duty, the only worth-while course is to shake off his reluctance to fight and face up to the action for which he is born. Having explained to him in the previous verse that from the viewpoint of life's eternal existence he need not grieve either for the living or for the dead, He wants to bring home to Arjuna that to him, born a kshatriya, fighting is natural; it is his normal duty in life. To do 'battle in accord with dharma' and establish righteousness for the good of the world is the most glorious and justifiable way of fulfilling the life of a kshatriya, who is born to protect dharma at any cost. Dharma maintains the stream of evolution in life. The kshatriya who does not accept a just fight wavers from this natural stream of evolution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.32 Happy are the kshatriyas, O Partha, who find, unsought, such a battle an open door to heaven. 'Open door to heaven': by following his dharma, a kshatriya serves to uphold law and order in society and maintains the stream of his own evolution. If he dies while fighting in this cause, he is a hero of cosmic life and gains the highest happiness in heaven. This verse makes a general statement proclaiming the good fortune of a kshatriya who gains an opportunity for such a battle. At the same time, by calling him 'Partha', the son of Pritha, Lord Krishna reminds Arjuna that he is a kshatriya. When a kshatriya has a chance of battle he feels happy, because he gains whether he wins or loses: victorious, he achieves glory on earth; dying in battle, he gains heaven. What will happen if Arjuna does not participate in the battle? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.33 Now, if you do not engage in this battle, which is in accord with dharma, then casting away your own dharma and good fame, you will incur sin. 'Casting away your own dharma' means falling out of the path of evolution, and that in itself is a positive sin. 'Sin' is that through which a man strays from the path of evolution. It results in suffering. Having reminded Arjuna of his great good fortune in being given this opportunity for battle, the Lord immediately impresses upon him the danger of not accepting it. To abstain from fighting, and so neglect his dharma, would bring loss of fame and would plainly be sinful. Dharma and fame are placed together in this verse. The connection between them is clarified in the commentary on the following verse. In the 71st verse the Lord began the argument on the basis of duty. Having enlightened Arjuna about his duty, his dharma, which maintains the natural stream of evolution, He now wants to make clear also the nature of duty from the level of social consideration. It may be mentioned that the moral code of conduct in any society has dharma at its basis, whether or not the people in that society are aware of the inner workings of nature guided by the invincible force of dharma. The fundamentals of social behavior in every society on earth are based on this principle which governs the laws of evolution. Therefore the Lord wants to analyze the nature of duty in the light of its influence on society. How others think of one's life, how others are affected by one's actions and how others talk about one are here the main concern. The word 'fame' covers all these points. The following three verses are devoted to this consideration, which will complete the wisdom of Sankhya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.34 Moreover men will ever tell of your disgrace, and to a man of honor ill fame is worse than death. Those who are esteemed are they who, living for themselves, live for others and dying, die for others. Their lives are justified in the degree to which others recognize them. Their happiness in life is in proportion to the goodwill accorded to them. Therefore if those who have enjoyed goodwill and fame in society lose it, they suffer shame and misery, which is worse than death. Loss of renown for a once famous man is more than death to him. Arjuna was the most famous archer of his time; that is why Lord Krishna makes this telling point about the nature of a famous man. The underlying principle of good fame in society is that when a man constantly does good he becomes a centre of harmonious vibrations which, enjoyed by the people around him, naturally create warmth and love in their hearts. That is why he is described in glowing terms by all. In this way the good fame of a man is the criterion of his goodness, and ill fame the criterion of his badness. No one who is good could possibly acquire ill fame. It is the vibrations spreading from a man's actions that induce people to speak well of him or otherwise The Lord particularly wants to bring home this truth to Arjuna. The way to uplift a man is first to remind him of the glorious aspects of his character and so gain a sympathetic response. The second step is to point out at once some delicate feature in the situation. The Lord does this in the next verse by saying that the brave will attribute cowardice to Arjuna. A close study of this verse in relation to preceding and subsequent verses will make the point clear. The Lord lays stress on the importance of fame, not for the sake of fame itself but to call Arjuna's attention to a principle of life: if he behaves in a way that will bring him ill fame, he will become a centre of something unrighteous, and this will impair his personal evolution. It is primarily the principle of personal evolution that is the subject of this consideration of life from the point of view of Sankhya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.35 The great warriors will think you fled from battle out of fear, and they who held you in esteem will belittle you. The Lord now speaks to Arjuna of the great humiliation which awaits him if he does not fight. For a man of honor and repute this is a very telling point. Arjuna is being reminded of the different implications of ill fame. Lord Krishna is helping him to break through the state of suspension by raising points that will touch his heart and mind and induce him to fight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.36 Your enemies will speak many ill words of you and will deride your strength. What greater pain than this? The Lord shows Arjuna exactly how he will be put to shame in the eyes of the world. Having demonstrated in the previous verses the validity of fighting from the point of view of its social implications, and having made it quite clear in the present verse that pain awaits him if he does not fight, the Lord, in the following verse, shows Arjuna the rewards that fighting will bring him both in this life and hereafter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.37 Slain, you will reach heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti, stand up, resolved to fight! This verse considers the performance of duty from the point of view of gain. The Lord says to Arjuna: You should realize that, whether you die on the battlefield or whether you survive, you stand to gain,' because fighting is in accordance with the natural course of your evolution. And if you are established on that course, then you are automatically on the path of increasing fortune in this life and hereafter. Therefore without losing more time, come, make up your mind to fight. This places the teaching of Sankhya on the most practical level of life. It is not right to associate this teaching with the life of the recluse only. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.38 Having gained equanimity in pleasure and pain, in gain and loss, in victory and defeat, then come out to fight. Thus you will not incur sin. Having made clear to Arjuna in the last verse that he stands to gain whether he dies or wins the battle, the Lord now wishes to convince him that he should waste no more time in the consideration of victory or defeat. Whatever the consequences, he should be prepared to fight, because at least one thing is certain: by fighting he will not incur sin. If, on the other hand, he refuses to fight, he is certain to fall into sin. Arjuna was convinced that, whether he won or lost the battle, by killing he would in fact incur great sin. That is why, in this verse, bringing to an end the intellectual aspect of His discourse, the Lord says to him: I am not asking you to fight with a view to this or that loss or gain, but because by fighting you will not incur sin. Unfortunately, for the last few centuries this part of Lord Krishna's teaching has been interpreted as indicating that a mood of equanimity should be cultivated during the experience of either loss or gain. In fact, the Lord means that right or wrong, virtue or sin, should be the primary consideration when deciding upon the validity of an action. It should not be decided on the basis of loss or gain. In judging the validity of an action, the first consideration should be its nature, whether or not it will in any way be sinful. It is the purpose of the action that creates its need. Once the need for an action is felt, the first step is to make sure that it is not in any way sinful To consider the loss or gain is only the second step. If it is an action leading to the fulfillment of one's mission in life, or an action which it would be sinful to leave undone, then its performance becomes a necessity. In such a case the consideration of a temporary loss or gain becomes all the more unimportant. In this verse the Lord is clearly saying to Arjuna: First rise to the wisdom of life given so far (11-37). Established in this wisdom, come out to fight. Thus you will not incur sin. 'You will not incur sin': this is the guarantee that the Lord offers. One becomes uninvolved in sin as a result of 'having gained equanimity in pleasure and pain, in gain and loss, in victory and defeat'. This state of equanimity is born of the wisdom so far given to Arjuna, starting from verse 11, the wisdom of Sankhya, as the Lord names it in the verse that follows. To sum up, this wisdom of Sankhya comprises: 1. Understanding of the perishable and imperishable phases of life (11-30). 2. Understanding of dharma (31-33). 3. Understanding of one's relationship with others (33-36) . 4. Understanding of the results of action (36-37). 5. Understanding of the nature of the doer as uninvolved with action, giving rise to equanimity in loss and gain. Knowledge of the perishable and imperishable aspects of life broadens the vision and makes a man see beyond the mundane and limited sphere of daily life. This, when supplemented by knowledge of dharma, induces in him a natural tendency to act rightly. His life becomes more useful to himself and to others. Through the understanding of his relationship with others, he rises above selfish ends to more and more universal aspects of life. This growing universal outlook, enriched by the proper understanding of the results of action, helps a man to develop and make progress on all levels of life. And finally, with the understanding of the nature of the doer as uninvolved, he gains equanimity,' rises above the influence of dualities, lives a life free from sin and suffering and enjoys eternal freedom. The following verse begins the teaching of Yoga, whereby the mind will rise above the binding influence of action, the teaching whereby the intellect, cultured by the wisdom of Sankhya, will be eternally established in the oneness of life, in the oneness of absolute Being, the eternal liberation in divine consciousness here and now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.39 This which has been set before you is understanding in terms of Sankhya; hear it now in terms of Yoga. Your intellect established through it, O Partha, you will cast away the binding influence of action. Yoga, the path of Union, is a direct way to experience the essential nature of Reality. This Reality is described and understood intellectually by a system which the Lord calls Sankhya, and which has been set forth in the previous verses. The Sankhya of the Bhagavad-Gita presents the principles of all the six systems of Indian philosophy, while the Yoga of the Bhagavad-Gita presents their practical aspects. This verse illustrates the technique of intelligent teaching. The subject is introduced and its result made clear in one stroke so that, seeing both the scale of the subject and the possibility of achieving the desired goal, the disciple is eager to begin the practice. For the Lord assures him that he will 'cast away the binding influence of action' as a result of his intellect becoming established in Yoga. Intellectual understanding of Reality convinces a man of the existence of a nobler and more permanent field of life that lies beyond and underlies the ordinary level of phenomenal existence. That has been the purpose of the discourse up to this point. Now Lord Krishna wishes to introduce Arjuna to the practice whereby his intellect will become established in Reality. This is to give him that positive experience of the truth of existence which will bring him to a state where he is unaffected by the binding influence of action. The direct experience of transcendental bliss gives a man such great contentment that the joys of the relative world fail to make a deep impression on him, and he rises above the binding influence of action, just as a contented business man, having achieved great wealth, is not affected by small losses or gains. By using the word 'intellect', the Lord makes it clear that the mind, purified or settled by the wisdom of Sankhya, becomes established in the Self through the practice of Yoga. As has already been shown in the commentary on verse 151 no practice is involved in gaining the understanding of life through Sankhya. If one wants to practice, one should turn to Yoga. The use of the words 'intellect established' indicates that it is the intellect that accomplishes Yoga, not the wandering mind. The suggestion is that the mind should be raised to the state of intellect through the wisdom of Sankhya and then be turned to Yoga to become established in the Self This presents Sankhya and Yoga as complementary, a point which is developed in Chapter V. It is interesting to note that the essence of the wisdom of Sankhya was given in four verses (12-15) and that the essence of Yoga is also given in four verses (45-48). These two groups of four verses expound the essential wisdom of the Bhagavad-Gita. All other verses are simply an extension of them. In the following verse, the Lord conveys to Arjuna the simplicity and effectiveness of the technique which he is about to give him and which will establish him in complete contentment, the state of eternal freedom from the bondage of action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.40 In this (Yoga) no effort is lost and no obstacle exists. Even a little of this dharma delivers from great fear. 'Obstacle': the Sanskrit word 'pratyavaya' also means any reversal of progress or any adverse effect. 'Dharma' signifies the path of evolution. The practice of Yoga is a direct way to evolution. Through it, the individual mind gains the state of cosmic intelligence that unbounded state of universal Being which is the summit of evolution. Dharma is natural to man, and so is this practice of Yoga, for it is in accordance with the very nature of the mind and brings fulfillment to life. That is why this Yoga is the dharma of everyone. Lord Krishna's wonderful teaching in this verse brings great hope to mankind. On the way to eternal freedom 'no effort is lost'. Any effort on this path results in the goal; the process, having started, cannot stop until it has reached its goal. This is so in the first place because the flow of the mind towards this state is natural, for it is a state of absolute bliss, and the mind is always craving for greater happiness. Therefore as water flows down a slope in a natural way, so the mind flows naturally in the direction of bliss. Secondly, 'no effort is lost' because, for the mind to become blissful, no effort is needed! If effort were necessary, then the question of effort being lost would arise. When an action is being performed, one stage of the process leads to another, which in turn gives rise to a further stage, so that when one stage has been reached, the previous stage is a thing of the past. In the performance of every action, therefore, some stage is lost, some energy is lost, some effort is lost. When the Lord says here that no effort is lost, it can only be because no effort is required. This means that Lord Krishna's technique of establishing the intellect in the Absolute is based on the very nature of the mind. We must therefore inquire how the mind, motivated by its own nature, succeeds in gaining divine consciousness without effort. When a man is listening to music and a more beautiful melody begins to come from another source, his whole mind will turn to enjoy it. No effort is needed to shift the attention to the more charming melody; the process is automatic. There is no loss of energy between starting to listen and enjoying the music with rapt attention. This is the Lord's meaning: since the field of eternal freedom is absolute bliss, the process of uniting the mind with it, once having begun, comes to completion without loss of energy or effort. It does not stop until the experience is full, for 'no obstacle exists'. Seen from this angle, the very beginning of the process is its fulfillment, for it is the movement of the mind to bliss. The end is found in the beginning. The very start of the process brings the mind to the goal because, according to the Lord, there is no resistance on the way, there is 'no obstacle' to surmount It is a path of no resistance, a pathless path, a path whose goal is omnipresent. That is why 'a little of this' 'delivers from great fear'. Following the path of no resistance means that the technique of establishing the mind in the Absolute has only to be started, and from that point deliverance from suffering follows. The very start in this direction relieves a man 'from great fear' in life. To establish the mind in the Absolute, says the Lord, very little - if anything has to be done This is because not even the natural direction of the mind has to be changed. The mind wanders from object to object, and it wanders, not for the sake of the object itself, but for the possibility of happiness that the object provides. Thus it does not actually wander from object to object but moves from a point of lesser happiness to a point of greater happiness. Since the greatest happiness is its goal, and the flow of the mind is already in the direction of greater happiness, the direction need not be changed. And since there is no need even to change the direction of the mind, it appears that nothing need be done to realize the goal. But the Lord says 'a little of this' practice. This shows that something has to be done. What is necessary is only to begin to experience the increasing charm on the way to transcendental absolute bliss. As in the case of diving, one has only to take a correct angle and let go, the whole process is accomplished in an automatic manner This is what the Lord means by 'a little of this'. Just as the first ray of the sun dispels the darkness of the night, so the first step in this practice dispels the darkness of ignorance and fear But although the first ray of the rising sun is able to dispel the darkness of the night, the sun still continues to rise, because its nature is not only to remove darkness, leaving the atmosphere dimly lighted, but also to shine forth in splendor and illumine the whole earth. The glory of the sun is its full mid-day light. The Lord clearly means that the path of divine unfolding is so simple and natural that the process, once having been consciously started, encounters no obstacles. Quickly it produces an effect strong enough to enlighten the mind and release a man from all negativeness in life, from fear of the cycle of birth and death. This is a noble way of enlightening the aspirant. There is a confident assurance of results from the very beginning of the practical teaching. Arjuna is told the nature of the technique and the results that until follow from its practice so that he may know in advance what it involves. Realization is not something that comes from outside: it is the revelation of the Self, in the Self, by the Self. This revelation cannot occur unless a man gives himself completely to it, and then it happens by itself. But in order to be able to give himself completely to it, he has to know at least two things: first, that it is within his power to accomplish, and secondly, that its accomplishment will be of use to him. This is why Lord Krishna speaks the words of this verse. Arjuna is being prepared for the direct experience of Reality which wipes out all uncertainties and brings stability to life. The Lord proclaims to him the simplicity of the approach to the Divine and at the same time describes its result. Why is it that in the modern world this spiritual practice has faded into the background of life? The answer lies in the wrong interpretation of verses such as this and the consequent spread of a misguided view of Reality which has persisted for many centuries. Having explained the simplicity and effectiveness of the principle of establishing the intellect in the Divine, the Lord, in the following verses, introduces the technique for its accomplishment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.41 in this Yoga, O joy of the Kurus, the resolute intellect is one-pointed, but many-branched and endlessly diverse are the intellects of the irresolute. 'In this Yoga': in this path to bliss. When the mind moves towards bliss, it experiences increasing charm at every step; as when one proceeds towards the light, the intensity increases continuously. When the mind experiences increasing happiness, then it does not wander; it remains focused in one direction, unwavering and resolute. Such is the state of the mind moving in the direction of bliss, and when it arrives at the direct experience of bliss, it loses all contact with the outside and is contented in the state of transcendental bliss-consciousness. When the mind comes out of this state into the field of action again, it remains contented and therefore maintains its resolute state to a greater or lesser degree. Through practice this state becomes established. This is what the Lord means when He says that 'in this Yoga . . . the resolute intellect is one-pointed'. The minds of those who do not practice this Yoga are constantly in the field of sensory experience. This fails to provide the mind with that great joy which alone can satisfy its thirst for happiness. That is why the minds of such people continue to search and wander endlessly. The Lord here further clarifies verse 38. Arjuna is advised to rise to the state of resolute intellect. For only in this state will he be able to win that evenness of mind in pleasure and pain, loss and gain, victory and defeat, which the Lord makes the prerequisite for battle. It may appear that there is something negative in this approach to Reality, for although the purpose is to establish Arjuna in the resolute state of mind, in this verse the characteristics of the irresolute mind are emphasized. This is significant. If a man on a mountain peak, wishing to guide another who is only halfway up, keeps shouting directions about where he himself is standing, it will not help the other man to arrive at the top. The direct way of guiding him up is first to tell him where he is and describe his surroundings, thus making him aware of his own position, and then to guide him to the peak. Arjuna is in a state of irresoluteness, and the Lord's intention is to bring him to the resolute state by first showing him all about the irresolute state of his mind, and then guiding him to the resolute state. Having pointed out these two states of mind, the Lord, in the following three verses, explains the conditions under which the mind continues to remain irresolute. After this He will direct Arjuna to rise from that state and become resolute, so that his mind may be established in Reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.42 The undiscerning who are engrossed in the letter of the Veda, O Partha, and declare that there is nothing else, speak flowery words. The Vedas are authentic expositions of the path of evolution. They elucidate, step by step, the gradual process of the integration of life and teach the knowledge by which a man may quickly rise through all levels of evolution and attain final liberation. To enable a man to profit by this great wisdom of life, the Vedas advocate a course of disciplined action and thought. The discipline of action is dealt with in those chapters collectively called Karma Kanda, which means pertaining to action, while discipline of mind is set forth in the chapters called Upasana Kanda, which means pertaining to the mind in relation to Reality. The nature of the supreme Reality and of life's fulfillment forms the subject of the chapters collectively called Gyana Kanda, which means pertaining to knowledge. The purpose of the Vedic Karma Kanda is to establish a code of action that will bring success and prosperity in this life and hereafter. It deals with the rites and rituals necessary to establish coordination between the different aspects of individual life: coordination between man and other creatures, between man and the different forces in nature, between man and angels, and between man and God in heaven. It is great practical wisdom of the highest order; it deals with innumerable types of action and the unfathomable nature of their influence. When those who are learned in this field begin to enlighten others, their discourse is both fascinating and positive. Their exposition of the theory and practice of the rites and rituals is so complete in itself and so decisive and precise in its nature as to be completely authoritative. The Karma Kanda of the Vedas lays down specific conditions for the attainment of specific results. It is a clear, practical exposition of the laws of nature governing cause and effect in creation. Innumerable are the aspirations of man, innumerable the objects to be attained. Innumerable also are the ways and means of acting to attain these ends. The purpose of the Karma Kanda is to bring about the co-ordination of the mind with the body and with the forces of nature in such a way that it results in progress to a higher level and an improved quality of life. The purpose of the Upasana Kanda is to bring about the coordination of the mind with the inner forces of nature and the ultimate transcendental Being in such a way that it results in the integration of life. In this and the following two verses, the Lord refers to the Karma Kanda, and then in the 45th verse He brings out the glorious practical aspect of the Upasana Kanda, that of bringing the diffused mind to a resolute state, in order that it may be established in Reality and may live It, thereby fulfilling the purpose of the Gyana Kanda of the Vedas. This is what makes the Bhagavad-Gita the essence of the Vedas and the highway to the fulfillment of the Vedic way of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.43 Filled with desires, with heaven as their goal, (their words) proclaim birth as the reward of action and prescribe many special rites for the attainment of enjoyment and power. This verse speaks of the tendency of man to resort to Vedic rites for the sake of a better life and greater worldly joys. The result of being engrossed in worldly desires is that one remains in the cycle of birth and death. For the joys of the senses can never satisfy, they involve man more and more and thus keep him in bondage. There being no chance of lasting contentment, the cycle of birth and death continues. The following verse reveals the loss that occurs when the mind becomes entangled in these joys which enrich life only with material gains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.44 The resolute state of intellect does not arise in the mind of those who are deeply attached to enjoyment and power and whose thought is captivated by those (flowery words). It does not necessarily follow that a man who has great knowledge of relativity cannot also have the wisdom of the Absolute. If even an illiterate man can enjoy the absolute bliss which is his own Being, why not the man of learning? The verse objects not to worldly enjoyment and power, not to the Vedic wisdom of action, which is a way of gaining such enjoyment and power, but to the mental state of being engrossed in them that is produced by hearing the glory of Vedic rites proclaimed in flowery words. It is not surprising that those always occupied in the field of action should proclaim that every attainment is possible through action, and specifically through the Vedic way of action, which undoubtedly provides a direct path to the attainment of anything whatsoever This point of view, while quite valid in the relative field of life, obviously does not concern itself with the Being of the Absolute. The manifested and the unmanifested fields of life together comprise the whole of Reality. But those who only possess the wisdom of the Vedic Karma Kanda aspire within the manifested field alone. Their wisdom of action does not directly give them the wisdom of the unmanifested field of Reality. Owing to lack of knowledge of the unmanifested Absolute, such people are heard proclaiming in flowery language that there is nothing beyond the field of Vedic action (verse 42). In the 42nd verse, the Lord has depicted the mind held fast in the grip of action. Fascinated by the flowery language which proclaims the glory of action, it becomes involved in vigorous and manifold activities. Such an ever-active mind naturally remains outside the realm of the resolute intellect. Worldly joys, together with a sense of progress through action and effort, keep the mind engaged in outside activities. It is difficult for such a mind to converge towards the resolute state by itself; activity engages the mind in diversity and by so doing is clearly opposed to the process of convergence, which leads to the resolute state. Only if the intention is there and guidance is received can the mind gain one-pointedness, and that even in the midst of 'enjoyment and power'. In the following verse, the Lord gives the principle of the technique for bringing such a diffused mind to a resolute state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.45 The Vedas' concern is with the three gunas. Be without the three gunas, O Arjuna, freed from duality, ever firm in purity, independent of possessions, possessed of the Self. This is the technique of instantaneous realization. The Lord shows Arjuna a practical way of converging the many-branched mind into the one-pointedness of the resolute intellect. Here is an effective technique for bringing the mind to a state where all differences dissolve and leave the individual in the state of fulfillment. Everything that has so far been said by Lord Krishna is to prepare Arjuna to understand this practice of bringing his mind from the field of multiplicity to that of eternal Unity. This practice is to brighten all aspects of his life by bringing his mind to transcendental consciousness, the limitless source of life, energy, wisdom, peace and happiness. It is to raise him to that cosmic status which harmonizes all the opposite forces of life. Modern psychological theories investigate causes in order to influence effects. They grope in darkness to find the cause of darkness in order to remove it. In contradistinction, here is the idea of bringing light to remove darkness. This is 'the principle of the second element'. If you wish to produce an effect on the first element, ignore that element, do not seek its cause; influence it directly by introducing a second element. Remove the darkness by introducing light. Take the mind to a field of happiness in order to relieve it of suffering. However, even if we accept that by investigating the cause it is easy to influence the effect, we shall find that this verse will serve our purpose, for it provides a technique by which the ultimate cause of all human life can be investigated. If knowledge of the cause can help to influence the effect, then knowledge of the ultimate cause of life will effectively put an end to all suffering. The greatness of Lord Krishna's teaching lies in its direct practical approach and its completeness from every point of view. The idea of introducing a second element and the idea of investigating the cause in order to influence its effect represent two principles distinctly opposed to each other, yet both of them are fulfilled in one technique. It is this completeness of practical wisdom that has made the Bhagavad-Gita immortal. Lord Krishna commands Arjuna: 'Be without the three gunas'; be without activity, be your Self. This is resolute consciousness, the state of absolute Being, which is the ultimate cause of all causes. This state of consciousness brings harmony to the whole field of cause and effect and glorifies all life. Arjuna's main problem was to reconcile love of kinsmen with the necessity to root out evil. He was desperately seeking a formula of compromise between righteousness and evil But on any plane of relative life these are irreconcilable. That is why, having explored all the avenues of his heart and mind, Arjuna could not find any practical solution, could not decide on any line of action. Lord Krishna, however, shows him the field where righteousness and love merge in eternal harmony, the eternal life of absolute Being. The Lord makes clear to Arjuna that all influences of the outside world, and their consequences as well, will cling to him and affect him so long as he is out of himself, so long as he allows himself to remain in the sphere of relativity and under its influence. Once out of that sphere, he will find fulfillment in his own Self. It is difficult for a man to improve his business affairs while he himself is constantly immersed in all their details. If he leaves them for a little while, he becomes able to see the business as a whole and can then more easily decide what is needed. Arjuna has a deep belief in dharma; his mind is clear about considerations of right and wrong. But the Lord asks him to abandon the whole field of right and wrong for the field of the Transcendent. There, established in a state beyond all duality, beyond the influence of right and wrong, he will enjoy the absolute wisdom of life, from which springs all knowledge of the relative world. And the Lord says to Arjuna: The field of that absolute wisdom is not outside you. You have not to go out anywhere to acquire it. It is within you. You have only to be within yourself, 'possessed of the Self', ever firm in the purity of your Being. Here indeed is the skill of bringing light to remove darkness. Arjuna is not asked to come or go anywhere; he is only asked to 'be without the three gunas'. This instruction serves as a direct means to take man to the absolute state of 'his consciousness. It is enough for the Lord to say: 'Be without the three gunas, O Arjuna, freed from duality'. The entire creation consists of the interplay of the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas, born of prakriti, or Nature. The process of evolution is carried on by these three Gunas. Evolution means creation and its progressive development, and at its basis lies activity. Activity needs rajo-guna to create a spur, and it needs sato-guna and tamo-guna to uphold the direction of the movement. The nature of tamo-guna is to check or retard, but it should not be thought that when the movement is upwards tamo-guna is absent. For any process to continue, there have to be stages in that process, and each stage, however small in time and space, needs a force to maintain it and another force to develop it into a new stage. The force that develops it into a new stage is sato-guna, while tamo-guna is that which checks or retards the process in order to maintain the state already produced so that it may form the basis for the next stage. This explains why the three gunas have inevitably to be together. No one guna can exist in isolation without the presence of the other two. It is for this reason that the Lord asks Arjuna to be out of all the three gunas, to be entirely out of the influence of the` forces that constitute life in the relative field. While giving him the wisdom of Sankhya, the Lord has told Arjuna that there are two aspects of life, perishable and imperishable. The perishable is relative existence, and the imperishable is absolute Being. All life in the relative field is under the sway of the gunas. Therefore, in order to give Arjuna the direct experience of the absolute state of life, He asks him to 'be without the three gunas. There are gross planes of creation, and there are subtle planes. When the Lord says: 'Be without the three gunas', He means that Arjuna should bring his attention from the gross planes of experience, through the subtle planes and thus to the subtlest plane of experience; transcending even that subtlest plane, he will be completely out of the relative field of life, out of the three gunas. So the Lord's words: 'Be without the three gunas', reveal the secret of arriving at the state of pure consciousness. When you say to someone: 'Come here', you imply by these two words that he must get up and begin to put one foot before the other, and that this walking on both feet will bring him to you. When the Lord says: 'Be without the three gunas', He obviously means that in whichever field of the three gunas you have your stand, from there you are to begin moving towards subtler planes of the gunas and, arriving at the subtlest, come out of it, transcend it, be by yourself, 'possessed of the Self', 'freed from duality', 'ever firm in purity', 'independent of possessions'. Lord Krishna, in this verse, has really given the technique of Self-realization. Arjuna was held in suspension between the dictates of his heart and mind. The Lord suggests to him that he should come out of the conflict and he will then see his way clear. That is why, having said: 'Be without the three gunas', He immediately adds: 'freed from duality', freed from the field of conflicts. The relative field of life is full of conflicting elements: heat and cold, pleasure and pain, gain and loss, and all the other pairs of opposites which constitute life. Under their influence life is tossed about as a ship on the rough sea, from one wave to another. To be freed from duality is to be in the field of non-duality, the absolute state of Being. This provides smoothness and security to life in the relative field. It is like an anchor to the ship of life in the ocean of the three gunas. One gains steadiness and comfort. Arjuna was highly sensitive to right and wrong. For this reason the Lord, after saying: 'freed from duality', at once adds: 'ever firm in purity'. He wants to assure Arjuna that this state will always prove right, in accordance with dharma, ever furthering the process of evolution for the good of all. Nothing wrong can possibly result from it, because that is the state of fulfillment. To convey this idea of fulfillment the Lord says: 'independent of possessions'. The Sanskrit word used in the text is 'niryogakshema', which carries the meaning that in this state one is not required to think of gaining what one does not have or of preserving what one has. Duryodhana's desire to possess and preserve possessions is the cause of the battle. Even in the ordinary life of man, it is this tendency to possess that tempts him to go the wrong way. So the Lord tells Arjuna that he will transcend this cause of transgression in life. Thereby He also reminds Arjuna that Duryodhana could take the wrong path because he gained kingdom, pleasure and power but did not gain the wisdom of remaining 'independent of possessions'. That is why possessions kept him bound to themselves and he lost his sense of proportion. By using this expression: 'independent of possessions', the Lord is providing the answer to Arjuna's own words in verse 32 of Chapter I: 'I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor a kingdom nor pleasure'. Arjuna had seen how pleasure and power may ruin a man's life by blinding him to the cause of righteousness. Here Lord Krishna is educating him in the art of independence in the midst of possessions, for after the battle Arjuna is going to be placed in a position of great wealth and power. Having said: 'freed from duality, ever firm in purity, independent of possessions', the Lord then adds: 'possessed of the Self'. This is to indicate to Arjuna that this blessed state of life is not far distant from him. It is within himself and therefore always within his reach. And moreover, it is his own Self, nothing other than his own Self. There is great presence of mind, great skill in enlightening the ignorant, and the height of perfection in the style of this discourse. If you are told by someone: 'I will take you to the field of great wisdom and abundance of life', without some indication of where that field lies, you may well be puzzled about many things about the distance, the difficulties on the way, your own ability to get there. That is why the Lord uses the words: 'possessed of the Self'. Let yourself be possessed by your Self. Once you are possessed by your Self the purpose of all wisdom has been achieved. There the Vedas end. That is the end of the journey of life, that is the state of fulfillment. For this reason, 'possessed of the Self' stands at the end of the verse. Here is a technique that enables every man to come to the great treasure-house within himself and so rise above all sorrows and uncertainties in life. From this verse onwards, the entire teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita proclaims the glory of achieving the state of the Transcendent. It is this transcendental state of Being which enables a man to become a karma yogi, one who is successful on the path of action. It is this that enables a man to become a bhakta, one who is successful on the path of devotion, and it is this that enables a man to become a gyani, one who is successful on the path of knowledge. This is the highway to the fulfillment of life's purpose. If a man wants to be a true devotee of God, he has to become his pure Self; he has to free himself from those attributes which do not belong to him, and then only can he have one-pointed devotion. If he is enveloped by what he is not, then his devotion will be covered by that foreign element. His devotion will not reach God, and the love and blessings of God will not reach him. For his devotion to reach God, it is necessary that he should first become purely himself, covered by nothing. Then the process of devotion will connect him directly with the Lord, thereby bestowing on him the status of a devotee. Only when he has become himself can he properly surrender to the Great Self of the Lord. If he remains in the field of the three gunas, in the many sheaths of gross and subtle nature, then it is these sheaths that prevent direct contact with the Lord. Therefore the first step towards Union through devotion is to be oneself. This, likewise, is the first step on the path of Gyana Yoga, the path of Union through knowledge, and also on the path of Union through action, Karma Yoga , because it is the state of transcendental consciousness that is the state of gyana, or knowledge, and that delivers from the bondage of karma. This state is also the basis of success in any field of life. The field of the three gunas is enlivened by the light of the absolute Being beyond the gunas. The following verse shows that the purpose of all activity is fulfilled in this state of Being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.46 To the enlightened brahmin all the Vedas are of no more use then is a small well in a place flooded with water on every side. 'Enlightened brahmin': one who has gone through the study and practice of the Karma Kanda, Upasana Kanda and Gyana Kanda of the Vedas. That is, one who knows the secret of action, dedication and knowledge. While every action has the aim of happiness, the actions prescribed by the Vedas at the same time help a man to evolve beyond his present level. But a jivan-mukta, a man of cosmic consciousness, finds himself at the ultimate fulfillment of all the duties prescribed for him. He knows Reality with such great fullness that he becomes established in That, in the state of absolute bliss-consciousness. This is how, having gained the final aim of the whole Vedic way of life, such a man rises above the field of Vedic injunctions about right and wrong and also above the need for Vedic rituals; he rises above the need of the Vedic guidance. The state of realization is like a reservoir full of water, from which people quite naturally draw to satisfy all their needs instead of getting Their water from many small ponds. Therefore the Lord asks Arjuna to 'be without the three gunas' and not waste his life in planning and achieving small gains in the ever-changing field of the three gunas, to be a self-contained whole instead of trying to achieve a little here and there. Not only does the state of realization fulfill the overall purpose of man's craving for greater and greater happiness, it also brings the mind naturally to the highest degree of mental development. It brings a realized man to a state where, by virtue of a high development of mental strength and harmony with the laws of nature, he finds that his thoughts naturally become fulfilled without much effort on his part. A man in this state has given such a natural pattern to his existence that he enjoys the full support of almighty Nature for life. He is in direct attunement with cosmic law, the field of Being, which forms the basis of all the laws of nature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.47 You have control over action alone, never over its fruits. Live not for the fruits of action, nor attach yourself to inaction. There is a marvelous sequence of instruction here This verse demonstrates once more the awareness of Lord Krishna and His clear and deep insight into Arjuna's mind. As Arjuna was instructed to 'be without the three gunas' in verse 45 and in the next verse was told that as a result he would fulfill all his aspirations in the relative field, he might very well infer that he was not required to do anything more. Therefore in order that Arjuna might not develop an aversion to action, the Lord says in this verse: 'You have control over action alone'. This should bring Arjuna to feel that he is to concern himself with nothing but action. He should be so completely absorbed in the action itself as to become oblivious of everything else, even of its fruits. For this reason the Lord adds: 'never over its fruits' This does not mean that Arjuna is not to fight for the sake of winning the battle; it does not mean that the action should be done without caring for its result. That would be hypocrisy. It is the anticipated fruit of an action that induces a man to act. It is desire for a result that makes him begin to act and enables him to persist in the process of action. The Lord wishes to show that the result of the action will be greater if the doer puts all his attention and energy into the action itself, if he does not allow his attention and energy to be distracted by thinking of results. The result will be according to the action, there is no doubt about that. If a student thinks the whole time about passing an examination, the progress of his study will be hampered, and this will jeopardize the result It is to ensure the greater success of an action that the doer is asked not to concern himself with results during the course of the action. But this does not imply that he should be indifferent to results. If he becomes consciously indifferent to results, the process of action will certainly become weak, and this will also weaken the results. It would be absurd to infer from this verse that a man has no right to the fruits of his action. Only the technique for achieving the maximum result from an action is given here. The doer has every right to enjoy the fruits of his action; the Lord says that he has no control over the fruits because the fruits will inevitably be according to the action. Having fixed the objective, having begun to act and having become intimately engrossed in the process of action, he should fulfill the action with such complete devotion and undivided attention that he is oblivious even of its fruits. Only in this way will he achieve the maximum result from what he does. The teaching of non-anticipation of the fruit of action has an even deeper, cosmic significance in that it is supported by the very process of evolution. If a man is held by the fruit of action, then his sole concern is centered on the horizontal plane of life. Seeing nothing higher than the action and its fruit, he loses sight of the Divine, which pervades the action and is the almighty power at its basis leading it to ultimate fulfillment. He thus loses direct contact with the vertical plane of life, on which the process of evolution is based. Thus it is clear that the Lord's teaching on the one hand supports activity and on the other upholds evolution and freedom. The following verse indicates that it is possible for everyone to live the values of the Divine in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.48 Established in Yoga, O winner of wealth, perform actions having abandoned attachment and having become balanced in success and failure, for balance of mind is called Yoga. Established in Yoga' means established in cosmic consciousness. Yoga, or Union of the mind with the divine intelligence, begins when the mind gains transcendental consciousness; Yoga achieves maturity when this transcendental bliss-consciousness, or divine Being, has gained ground in the mind to such an extent that, in whatever state the mind finds itself, whether waking or sleeping, it remains established in the state of Being. It is to this state of perfect enlightenment that the Lord refers in the beginning of the verse when He says: 'Established in Yoga'. Towards the end of the verse He defines 'Yoga' with reference to action as 'balance of mind'. This balanced state of mind is the result of the eternal contentment which comes with bliss-consciousness. It cannot be gained by creating a mood of equanimity in loss and gain, as commentators have generally thought. Yoga is the basis of an integrated life, a means of bringing into harmony the inner creative silence and the outer activity of life, and a way to act with precision and success. Established in Yoga, Arjuna will be established in the ultimate Reality of life, which is the source of eternal wisdom, power and creativity. Part of the training for one who wishes to become a good swimmer is the art of diving. When one is able to maintain oneself successfully in deep water, then swimming on the surface becomes easy. All action is the result of the play of the conscious mind. If the mind is strong, then action is also strong and successful. The conscious mind becomes powerful when the deeper levels of the ocean of mind are activated during the process of transcendental meditation, which leads the attention from the surface of the conscious mind to the transcendental field of Being. The process of diving within is the way to become established in Yoga. When the Lord says that having been through this process Arjuna should come out and act, He gives him the mechanics of successful action. To shoot an arrow successfully it is first necessary to draw it back on the bow, thus giving it great potential energy. When it is brought back to the fullest possible extent, then it possesses the greatest dynamic power. Unfortunately the art of action, which Lord Krishna expounded to Arjuna in this discourse, seems to have disappeared from practical life today. This is because for many centuries, owing to the lack of proper interpretation of these verses, it has been considered difficult to lead the mind to the Self and become established in Yoga. It is, in fact, perfectly easy to lead the attention to the field Of Being: one has only to allow the mind to move spontaneously from the gross field of objective experience, through the subtle fields of the thought-process to the ultimate transcendental Reality of existence. As the mind moves in this direction, it begins to experience increasing charm at every step until it reaches the state of transcendental bliss-consciousness. The reward of bringing the mind to this state is that the small individual mind grows to the status of the cosmic mind, rising above all its individual shortcomings and limitations. It is like a small business man becoming wealthy and reaching the status of a multimillionaire. The losses and gains of the market, which before used to influence him, now have no effect upon him and he rises quite naturally above their influence. The Lord wants Arjuna to act, but He wants him, before beginning the action, to gain the status of cosmic mind. This is His kindness. When a wealthy man wants his son to start a business, he does not usually wish him to begin in a small way, because he knows that in that way small losses and gains will influence his dear son and make him miserable or happy over trivialities. Therefore he gives him the status of a wealthy man and then asks him to start business from that level. Lord Krishna, like a kind and able father, advises Arjuna to attain the state of cosmic intelligence and then to act from that high state of freedom in life. A man cannot remain balanced in loss and gain unless he is in a state of lasting contentment. Here the Lord is asking Arjuna to get to that state of lasting contentment by a direct experience of transcendental eternal bliss. He is not advising a mere mood of equanimity. The state of transcendental bliss in eternal Being is so self-sufficient that, in its structure, it is absolute. It is fullness of life, perfection of existence, and therefore completely unattached to anything in the relative field, completely free from the influence of action. When the Lord says: 'having abandoned attachment', He means having gained this state of eternal Being, which is wholly separated and detached from activity. And when He says: 'having become balanced in success and failure', He means having reached stability in this state of eternal Being. The regular practice of transcendental meditation is the direct way of rising to the state of transcendental Being and stabilizing it in the very nature of the mind, so that irrespective of the mind's engagements in the conflicts inherent in the diversities of life, the structure of Unity in eternal freedom is naturally maintained and life is not lost to itself. Here is the definition of Yoga for which the ground was prepared by the words, 'Be without the three gunas in verse 45: Yoga is that eternally balanced and never-changing state of transcendental consciousness which, remaining transcendent while yet grounded in the very nature of the mind, sets the mind free to participate in activity without becoming involved in it. The following verses extol the glory of this Yoga, the balanced state of mind, and make clear its usefulness in raising the dignity of action and bringing eternal freedom to the doer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.49 Far away, indeed, from the balanced intellect is the action devoid of greatness, O winner of wealth. Take refuge in the intellect. Pitiful are those who live for the fruits (of action). 'Balanced intellect' (buddhi yoga): the balanced state of mind as explained in the last verse. Here the Lord makes clear the distinction between the action in which the intellect becomes involved and that in which it remains uninvolved. He says that the action performed without gaining balance of mind, or Yoga, is of an inferior nature, it is ineffective and weak, 'devoid of greatness'. He asks Arjuna to rise to the uninvolved state of intellect, so that his action may acquire greatness and he may be enabled at the same time to gain the state of freedom. The Lord derides the fate of those who are unable to rise to this state of action in non-attachment. He says that they are 'pitiful' who seek only to enjoy the outer field of life, who do not live the fullness of the inner and outer glories of life by developing the balanced state of mind described in the previous verse. The Lord says: 'Take refuge in the intellect', thereby asking Arjuna first to turn within and 'be without the three gunas' ('nistraigunyo bhav-Arjuna', verse 45) and then, remaining established in the state of Yoga, in the Self, to perform actions ('yogastah kuru karmani', verse 48). The Lord wants Arjuna, before he begins to act, to establish himself in Yoga. He has defined Yoga as 'balance of mind', a state of fullness which is a state of natural equanimity. In this state a man is not affected by success or failure. It is not that he consciously tries to treat loss and gain as the same, but that he is naturally unaffected by them, a really good and desirable state which is reached through the practice of transcendental meditation referred to in the 45th verse The endeavor to preserve equanimity of mind without gaining this state, merely by trying to view all things as alike, may be called hypocrisy or self-deception. The Lord is certainly not telling Arjuna to cultivate a mood of equanimity or maintain a conscious indifference towards results during the process of an action. Any such attempt to maintain equanimity on the thinking level can only lead to tension and dullness of mind. The emphasis here, as in the previous verse, is on gaining pure intelligence, or Being. It is the state of Being which cultures the mind to be one-pointed, thus improving its effectiveness during action. It is unfortunate that, for many centuries past, this and similar verses spoken by Lord Krishna on the Yoga of action have been misinterpreted, for this has caused people to lose their vigor and perseverance in action in the name of non-attachment. The result has been idleness, impotence and the weakening of the very structure of both individual and social life. Here is a dynamic philosophy which is meant to inspire a disheartened man and strengthen a normal mind. Instead, owing to general misinterpretation, it has become a means to incapacitate man in all fields of activity; it has become a dragging influence on human endeavor. The whole philosophy of karma, or action, is clearly explained to Arjuna so that he may become an integrated and dynamic person. The Lord says: 'Pitiful are those who live for the fruits' of action, those who look forward to the results of their actions are to be pitied. This statement in particular has been much misunderstood by commentators. They have advised people to work but not to aim at a result. It is certain, however, that an action must be done to achieve some result No action can be performed without some clear result in view. The Lord here only means to show Arjuna a principle of raising the value of action by raising the level of the mind and enabling it to rise to the state of unbounded consciousness in eternal freedom. When an arrow is to be shot, the first step is to pull it back on the bow. If, instead, in the hurry of things, the arrow is shot forward without being pulled back on the bowstring, then the aim will not be achieved, the target will not be reached, the action will be without force and the actor will remain unfulfilled. The Lord means that pitiable are those who are in such a hurry to achieve the fruit of action that they begin to act without adequate preparation to make the action forceful. They are not pitiable because they aim at the fruit of action, as so many commentators wrongly declare, but because they fail to achieve the full fruit of their action. They are pitiable because they do not know how to make their actions yield the maximum result and bring fulfillment to their aspirations. They are pitiable because they care nothing for the cause, they care only for the effect. In this way they lose opportunities for improvement and greater gain. The intellect is the source or cause of action. Therefore the Lord says: 'Take refuge in the intellect' and 'far away, indeed, from the balanced intellect is the action devoid of greatness'. Unless his mind is withdrawn and brought back to the absolute state of intellect, a man's deeds in the world will be weak, and that is why he is called pitiable. Pitiable is he, says the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, who fails to commune with the inner divine consciousness. He is pitiable because he is neither able to enjoy the full result of his actions nor to overcome their binding influence. Action is performed on the level of the senses but has its origin at the inception of the thinking process. A thought starts from the deepest level of the mind; it is appreciated on the thinking level, where it takes the form of a desire; desire, in its turn, expresses itself in the form of action. This is why the Lord says that the 'balanced intellect' and the field of action are far apart. One is on the level of absolute life-energy; the other is on a weak and diffused level of energy because, as the process of manifestation of a thought develops into action, the concentration of energy becomes weaker. For this reason the Lord declares that they are pitiable who tend towards action alone, rather than towards a resolute state of intellect first and then to action later. He who practices transcendental meditation and becomes acquainted with the inner divine consciousness truly enjoys the greatest fruit of action in the world. At the same time he grows increasingly free from bondage and eventually achieves integration of life. This is the purpose of Lord Krishna's teaching: 'Take refuge in the intellect'. It introduces the ideal principle for the integration of life and provides a simple technique for its achievement. The Lord wants Arjuna to have a deep conviction and a clear conception of the relationship between the state of Yoga and action, and also between Yoga and the doer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.50 He whose intellect is united (with the Self) casts off both good and evil even here. Therefore, devote yourself to Yoga. Yoga is skill in action. Here the Lord contrasts the opposing characteristics of Yoga and karma (action). Yoga is pulling the arrow back; karma is shooting the arrow forward. One who tries to shoot the arrow without first pulling it back on the bow is said to have a poor sense of action. His shot will not be strong, and his arrow will not go far because it will not be carried forward with force. Wise in the skill of action are those who first pull the arrow back before they proceed to shoot it ahead. As the mind becomes established in transcendental consciousness, the state of Being becomes infused into the very nature of the mind, which thus gains the status of cosmic intelligence. Coming out of the transcendental state of consciousness, a man regains individuality, by virtue of which he is able to act in the relative field of life, but he now acts infused with Being. Such a person is as naturally above the influence of right and wrong as the wealthy business man is' above loss and gain. In this verse, the Lord emphasizes that the effect of Yoga is to raise a man to his real stature of eternal freedom in divine consciousness, where he will ever remain untouched by the influence of action, be it good or bad This is not because he should be deprived of the good and bad fruits of his action, but because it is his due that, while enjoying the fruits of his actions, he should enjoy the state of eternal freedom as well. It is not the action or its fruits that bind a man; rather it is the inability to maintain freedom which becomes a means of bondage. Yoga removes this inability. It is the glory of Yoga that it increases the power of both the action and the actor, bringing dignity to life in all its aspects. Bondage certainly lies in the field of action, but it is not born of action: it is born of the weakness of the actor. When a small business man incurs a loss, his mind is profoundly affected by it. This creates a deep impression, which comes to the surface again as a desire for gain when favorable conditions present themselves. An impression on the mind is the seed of the desire which leads to action. Action in turn produces an impression on the mind, and thus the cycle of impression, desire and action continues, keeping a man bound to the cycle of cause and effect, the cycle of birth and death. This is commonly called the binding influence of action, the bondage of karma. When the Lord says that Arjuna will transcend the binding influence of right and wrong, He immediately makes it clear that this will not be the result of inaction but will be due to 'skill in action'. What is 'skill in action'? It is the technique of performing an action so that the whole process becomes easy. The action is completed with the least effort, leaving the doer fresh enough to enjoy fully the fruits of his action while at the same time remaining untouched by its binding influence. And not only this; the action is performed quickly so that the doer begins to enjoy the results immediately. 'Skill in action' does not allow any negative influence from outside to hinder the performance of action, nor does it produce any negative influence either upon the doer or upon anyone anywhere; on the contrary, the influence it creates is wholly positive. The process of action, if carried out with what is here called 'skill in action', produces good results in all directions and enables the doer to derive maximum benefit from it. At the same time, it fails to produce a binding influence on him. This is because it influences the doer in such a way that its fruits do not leave an impression in the mind deep enough to form the seed of future action, the doer being established in the Self, the eternal Being, and ever unattached to the field of activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.51 The wise, their intellect truly united with the Self, having renounced the fruits born of their actions and being liberated from the bonds of birth, arrive at a state devoid of suffering. 'Liberated from the bonds of birth': birth marks a step on the long road of evolution. Births continue one after the other until the goal of evolution is reached. Individual life reaches its highest state of evolution when it finds itself established on the level of cosmic life, on the level of unbounded and eternal Being. In this verse, Arjuna is made to realize that by establishing his mind in transcendental Being he will rise to a state separate from and unattached to the sphere of action. The Lord tells him that because they are established in Being, which is naturally unattached to activity, the wise live in eternal freedom and are not bound by the fruit of action. Fully established in the divine intelligence, they break the shackles of bondage and are free even while remaining in the field of action, for they are ever in the state of the eternal unchanging existence of absolute Being. It is a wonderful way of enlightenment. The Lord asks Arjuna to come completely out of the field of action: 'Be without the three gunas, O Arjuna' (verse 45). He thereupon bids him act with full force (verse 47)- Then, combining these two commands, the Lord tells Arjuna to act while remaining established in Self-consciousness (verses 48--50)- And in the present verse, He demonstrates that action of this kind leads to cosmic consciousness, liberation from all suffering and bondage during lifetime here on earth. Arjuna is given a systematic and direct way to the highest state of human evolution. The first step is to bring the mind to the Transcendent. Through transcendental meditation, the attention is brought from gross experience to subtler fields of experience until the subtlest experience is transcended and the state of transcendental consciousness is gained. The march of the mind in this direction is so simple as to be automatic; as it enters into experience of a subtler nature, the mind feels increased charm because it is proceeding towards absolute bliss. Once the mind reaches transcendental consciousness it no longer remains a conscious mind; it gains the status of absolute Being. This state of transcendental pure consciousness, also known as Self-consciousness, Self-awareness, samadhi, represents the complete infusion of cosmic Being into the individual mind. When, after this infusion, the mind comes out again into the field of relativity, then, being once more the individual mind, it acts while established in Being. Such action is called Karma Yoga, it is by virtue of Karma Yoga that transcendent Being is lived in the field of activity. And when complete fullness of Being has begun to be lived in the field of activity, the relative field of life, then one gains all-embracing eternal life in absolute freedom. That is cosmic consciousness, jivan-mukti. That is the state of which the Lord says: 'their intellect truly united with the Self'. We may say that there is only one step on the path to this state of cosmic consciousness: a step out of the field of action into the Transcendent and back to action again. Thus we find that a man reaches his highest evolution on the plane where he is already. He has only to take himself to a field which is outside action and come back again to his normal field of activity. One dives into the ocean, reaches the bottom, gathers the pearls and comes out of the water to enjoy their value, the whole act is done in one dive The technique of diving lies only in taking a correct angle and then letting go; reaching the bottom and coming up with the pearls follows automatically. What a seeker of Truth has to do is only to learn how to take a correct angle for the dive within. This will quite naturally result in Self-consciousness, which in its turn develops into cosmic consciousness in the most natural way; the whole process goes by itself. The state of cosmic consciousness is inclusive of transcendental consciousness as well as of consciousness of the relative order; it brings cosmic status to the individual life. When the individual consciousness achieves the status of cosmic existence then, in spite of all the obvious limitations of individuality, a man is ever free, unbounded by any aspect of time, space or causation, ever out of bondage. This state of eternal freedom, set out here in principle, is a result of establishing the mind in the state of transcendental consciousness. The Lord tells Arjuna that when he becomes established in the eternal freedom of divine intelligence, his life will become naturally full of meaning. That is why he need no longer seek the meaning of all the words of wisdom that he may hear or may have already heard, as the following verse makes clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.52 When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, then will you gain indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard. Arjuna is caught up in what he has learnt about right and wrong. All his knowledge of the scriptures has not prevented him from falling into a state of suspension, or saved him from becoming inactive. He is still held in the state of suspension. This he will overcome only when his intellect rises above duality and reaches the field of pure transcendental consciousness. The state of realization is beyond the limitations of thought, speech and action; having reached it one truly rises above doubt and delusion. The Lord is here summarizing all that he has so far told Arjuna. He has described to him the real state of Yoga, a state which satisfies both the intellect and the heart because, bringing fulfillment to both, it leaves no room for doubt or discontent in the domain of either. The emphasis in this verse is on the practice of arriving at transcendental consciousness and allowing the intellect to gain purity. This will mean the fulfillment of all the wisdom of life, of what has been heard in the past and what is worthy of being heard in future. 'What has been heard and what is yet to be heard' will be superseded by the experience of Reality, for all hearing about Truth gains fulfillment in Its direct experience. This verse takes one to a level of life that is free from problems. It makes clear the state in which one will 'gain indifference', and thereby shows a way to 'abandon attachment', as demanded by verse 48. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.53 When your intellect, bewildered by Vedic texts, shall stand unshaken, steadfast in the Self, then will you attain to Yoga. 'Vedic texts': this refers to verses 42 to 44. The Vedas expound the wisdom of right and wrong at various levels of evolution. They lay open the whole field of life, leaving a man to make his choice as to how he wants to proceed on the path of his evolution. Therefore it is quite possible that the mind influenced by Vedic learning, finding such a vast range of knowledge at its disposal, may become bewildered. But when once it has recourse to its own nature, the mind stands 'unshaken'. In this resolute state, when it transcends the whole field of relative life, it gains Self-consciousness, or pure awareness; and when this pure state of consciousness is never lost under any influence, then Yoga, or skill in action, is achieved. Vedic wisdom comprises various expressions of Reality, as seen from different points of view and taught by different schools of thought. These manifold theories are meant to satisfy the different levels of human understanding, the purpose of the Vedas being to enlighten people of all types. When one sees the different perspectives in Vedic literature, one may be confused by the differences of opinion about the path of realization. But when the mind comes to samadhi, or transcendental consciousness, the goal of all paths is reached. This resolute state of the mind in attainment stands completely clear, free from any confusion about the paths towards it. From the centre of Reality the whole circumference of life is seen to be completely harmonious, for when the centre is found it becomes clear that the innumerable radii all converge from the circumference towards a single point. If the centre is not found, then the various radii will be regarded as separate from one another with no common meeting-point. That is why the Lord stresses the importance of the direct experience of samadhi, pure consciousness. This alone can dispel the uncertainties of the mind. The purpose of the present verse is to strengthen the teaching given by the Lord in the 45th verse; it is in no way to refute the validity of the knowledge contained in the Vedic texts, without which intellectual satisfaction would not be possible. Scriptural knowledge becomes significant once Reality has been directly experienced. Yoga here means 'skill in action', as defined in verse 50. The Lord makes it very plain to Arjuna that unless his mind first arrives at transcendental consciousness, and unless the intellect is then unshakably established in this state of pure consciousness, that is to say, unless cosmic consciousness is attained, he cannot obtain Yoga, or skill in action. In order to understand more thoroughly how transcendental consciousness is compatible with action and gives rise to skill in action, Arjuna, in the following verse, asks a very practical question. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.54 Arjuna said: What are the signs of a man whose intellect is steady, who is absorbed in the Self, O Keshava? How does the man of steady intellect speak, how does he sit, how does he walk? Arjuna's question shows that the discourse up to this point has been very clearly understood by him and that his mind is attuned to Lord Krishna's thought. 'Keshava': one with long hair, Lord Krishna. When Arjuna asks for the outward 'sign' of the man of steady intellect, he addresses Lord Krishna by a name which refers to His outward appearance. Arjuna wants to know the distinctive characteristics of a man of steady intellect both when he is deep within himself, withdrawn from activity, and when he is active. There are two ways of life: that of a householder and that of a recluse. Karma Yoga is the way of the householder, while Sankhya, the way of knowledge, is for the recluse. Both types of men achieve the state of steady intellect and, having attained it, rise above the limitations of life and of society. Their lives present a synthesis of individual and cosmic existence The freedom that they live and the universal outlook that they hold inspire the society to which they belong. Their lives are an expression of those ultimate values which are the foundation of social values of all time. Wherever they are, busy in the market-place, or silent in a Himalayan cave, they are the guiding light of the human race. Arjuna asks for some signs, some distinguishing marks of such souls. Being a practical man he wants to know the outward signs of a life of inner fulfillment. The question shows that his mind is clearer at this moment than it was as the beginning of this chapter, when he could not think decisively. It also indicates the power of the teaching of Sankhya and Yoga to clarify a man's mind and raise his consciousness. Arjuna has been quietly listening to Lord Krishna. A discourse of forty-three verses (11-57) has turned his state of suspension to thoughts of a concrete nature. No longer occupied with thoughts of sorrow, his mind now rises to ask about the practical aspect of the integrated state of life. And this transformation has taken place within five to ten minutes, the time required to speak these verses. His question is answered in the following eighteen verses, which present the characteristics of realized men who have gained steady intellect, whether by renouncing action through the knowledge of Sankhya, or by way of Karma Yoga. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.55 The Blessed Lord said: When a man completely casts off all desires that have gone (deep) into the mind, O Partha, when he is satisfied in the Self through the Self alone, then is he said to be of steady intellect. Here Lord Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'Partha'. This is to maintain the tide of love created by the use of the same word when He spoke to Arjuna for the first time on the battlefield. Now that the Lord finds Arjuna's mind thinking on a more practical level, He still wants the qualities of Arjuna's heart to remain at their height and not be overshadowed by those of the mind. This verse presents the 'steady intellect' in the state of samadhi, or transcendental consciousness, and also in the state of nitya-samadhi, or cosmic consciousness; in both cases the mind gains that state in which it 'completely casts off all desires that have gone (deep) into the mind'. When, through the practice of transcendental meditation, the mind gains transcendental consciousness, it is completely out of the field of desires. This is the 'steady intellect' in the state of samadhi. How then is the 'steady intellect' maintained in nitya-samadhi, when the mind, established in pure consciousness, is yet engaged in the field of action? Because in this state the mind has become transformed into bliss-consciousness, Being is permanently lived as separate from activity. Then a man realizes that his Self is different from the mind which is engaged with thoughts and desires. It is now his experience that the mind, which had been identified with desires, is mainly identified with the Self. He experiences the desires of the mind as lying outside himself, whereas he used to experience himself as completely involved with desires. On the surface of the mind desires certainly continue, but deep within the mind they no longer exist, for the depths of the mind are transformed into the nature of the Self. All the desires which were present in the mind have been thrown upward, as it were, they have gone to the surface, and within the mind the finest intellect gains an unshakeable, immovable status. 'Pragya' is anchored to 'Kutastha'. This is the 'steady intellect' in the state of nitya-samadhi, cosmic consciousness. Thus the wavering intellect gains a very stable basis, and as a result the field of activity is managed with great efficiency. It is quite wrong to think that one who has gained this state remains slumped in inertia and does not engage in action. This state of life is such that it maintains the freedom of the inner Being, keeping It uninvolved with activity, and at the same time deals with all actions most efficiently and successfully. The word 'when' is very important. It indicates that one is said to be of 'steady intellect' only when one has gained transcendental consciousness, the state of separation from activity; or when one has gained cosmic consciousness, the state where one naturally maintains Self-consciousness even together with consciousness of the waking, dreaming or sleeping states, and where the Self, or Being, remains unshadowed by any experience whatsoever. It is wrong to conclude that only a recluse, who has given up all worldly desires, can attain this state of 'steady intellect'. It can be gained by anyone through the practice of transcendental meditation. The recluse way of life does not necessarily produce a condition where 'a man completely casts off all desires that have gone (deep) into the mind'. The state described by this phrase has nothing to do with any particular way of life Lord Krishna is clearly referring to a state in which one is free from desires and 'satisfied in the Self' And this is easily attained by anyone who knows how to meditate and transcend relativity, whether he be recluse or householder, whether he meditate in a palace or a cave. Shankara, the great exponent of the philosophy of integrated life, says in his commentary on this verse: 'By direct experience of the blissful nectar of the transcendent Reality the steady intellect holds itself absolutely without anything other than itself'. And again he defines the man of steady intellect in the following words: 'He whose intellect, born of realization of the distinction between the ultimate and non-ultimate, is settled; he is a man of steady intellect'. The intellectual understanding gained by the analysis of, and discrimination between, the ultimate and non-ultimate aspects of life does not produce the state of steady intellect. Such practices, remaining as they do on the level of thinking, can at best create moods of the mind; they certainly will not produce the state of mind called 'steady intellect'. This results only from direct experience of pure consciousness to such a degree of clarity that the difference between the 'ultimate' and the 'non-ultimate' is clearly cognized and appreciated on the intellectual level as well. Thus Shankara plainly holds that this state of steady intellect is produced by the practice of transcending relativity, as expressed in verse 45, and not by merely spinning words about it or merely trying to understand it. The process of experience is very different from that of intellectual discrimination of Reality and non-Reality. This should be sufficient to remove the misunderstanding created by commentators or translators of the Bhagavad-Gita who hold that the steady intellect can only be gained by recluses, a view which is responsible for spiritual decadence in modern society. Unfortunately, Shankara's own view has been misrepresented by commentators who undertook to propagate his philosophy. They seem to have missed the central part of spiritual life, transcendental consciousness and the direct way to its realization. As a result, everything which aimed at clarifying the process of transcending has been held to belong to the path of renunciation and attributed to the recluse way of life. This lack of insight into principle cast the centre of spiritual life on to the recluse order, thus debarring the householder from the gains of spirituality, and throwing the whole of humanity out of joint. This verse does not record any outer sign of the man whose intellect is steady and who is established in the Self, because there cannot be any outer sign to show that a man is absorbed deep within himself. The inner state of such a man cannot be judged by outer signs. It cannot be said that he sits life this or like that or closes his eyes in any particular manner. No such external signs can serve as criteria of this state. A man may sit in any style and go deep within himself and be in bliss-consciousness. It may be said that when someone goes into samadhi his face becomes serene and more glowing, but this is not something that can be gauged by any fixed standard. For this reason the Lord does not enter into any such description. The signs recounted here are only subjective. They concern the inner condition of the mind as indicated by 'casts off all desires' and 'is satisfied in the Self'. This verse brings to light the basis of the steady intellect: the realization of Being in transcendental consciousness or in cosmic consciousness. The next verse presents the nature of the man who has gained steady intellect. Verse 57 describes the nature of the means whereby he acts in the state of steady intellect: non-attachment. Verse 58 explains the nature of his activity in this state: his senses are withdrawn from their objects. Finally, verse 59 points to the influence of the Unseen on the steady intellect. It shows that not merely are the senses withdrawn from their objects, but even their taste for these objects vanishes when the Supreme unfolds Itself to them in Its unbounded grandeur, when the Supreme comes to be lived on the sensory level of existence. These five verses taken together reveal the essentials of the 'steady intellect'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.56 He whose mind is unshaken in the midst of sorrows, who amongst pleasures is free from longing, from whom attachment, fear and anger have departed, he is said to be a sage of steady intellect. 'A sage' (muni) is defined in this verse. The Lord begins to answer Arjuna's question about the man of steady intellect, who quite naturally maintains balance of mind while he continues to act in the field of relative existence. The verse does not provide any signs of an objective nature, but it describes the subjective aspect of a man of steady intellect. Just as a millionaire who has great wealth remains unaffected by the rise and fall of the market, so the mind which has gained the state of bliss-consciousness through transcendental meditation remains naturally contented on coming out from the transcendental. The basis, the doer, the means, activity and Providence are the five factors for the accomplishment of any action, as given in XVIII,14. state to the field of activity. This contentment, being grounded in the very nature of the mind, does not allow the mind to waver and be affected in pleasure or pain, nor allow it to become affected by attachment or fear in the world. This natural equanimity of the mind, even while it is actively engaged, is the state of steady intellect. 'Sorrows' arise in the mind through want of understanding. When one understands only so much and no more of life, lacking vision of the whole span of life, then one feels sorrow. But the man who understands both the unchanging eternal phase of life and the unending nature of the ever-changing cycle of life and death will recognize the ephemeral nature of sorrow and not be overwhelmed by it. The feeling of sorrow in the heart, as distinct from the mind, is due to lack of fulfillment, lack of love, lack of happiness. One who practices transcendental meditation experiences the bliss which fills the heart and brings eternal contentment, which leaves no room for any negative emotion, for sorrow, depression, fear or the like. Neither does it leave room for waves of joy or other positive emotions because the heart is by nature full and contented. It is like the heart of a grown man remaining unaffected by the toys which create great emotions in the hearts of children. The experience of transcendental consciousness raises a man's consciousness to a level where he finds his Self completely separate from all activity, and naturally his values will change. The values of life are different at different levels of evolution. This is why, when the normal behavior of a man of steady intellect, established on the level of divine consciousness, is seen from the ordinary level of human consciousness, it appears different and more than normal - unshaken by pleasure and pain, fear and anger. The basis of such a detached state of life is explained in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.57 He who has no undue fondness towards anything, who neither exults nor recoils on gaining what is good or bad, his intellect is established. The man whose mind is established in the Unity of bliss-consciousness knows by experience that his Self is separate from all activity. He acts in the field of relativity, but experience cannot make any deep impression. This is whv he naturally remains consistent in his outlook and behavior with others, even while experiencing the diverse nature of the world. Many a commentator upon these verses has introduced the idea that in order to achieve the state of established intellect one should try to be dispassionate and detached. But in the field of behavior and experience the strain of attempting to be dispassionate and detached, of trying to make a mood of equanimity in pleasure and pain, only puts unnatural, undue stress on the mind, resulting in the development of an unnatural and warped state of the inner personality. This kind of practice has helped to bring dullness, artificiality and tension to life in the name of spiritual growth, it has spoiled the brilliance of many a genius in every generation for centuries past. As a consequence, there has grown up in intelligent levels of society throughout the world a kind of fear of the spiritual life, which has gone so far that young and energetic people today find even discussion about spiritual practices embarrassing. In his reply to Arjuna's question, the Lord wants to bring home to him that through the practice of transcendental meditation the mind becomes infused with divine intelligence and bliss. Thereafter, even while one acts in the world, the state of equanimity is naturally maintained. This verse can never be interpreted in terms of mood-making, or of controlling the mind in an attempt to live evenness intellectually. it brings out that the man of steady intellect is by nature grounded in non-attachment. Unfortunately some interpreters have gone so far in misrepresenting the. truth of this verse as to disapprove even of enjoying a flower in full bloom or rejecting a faded one. And this way of making life cold and devoid of heart has been recommended as a way of gaining established intellect. What cruelty to life! It is a mistake to copy the behavior of a realized man while remaining in the unrealized state. If a poor man puts up the sign of a wealthy man and tries to behave like one, this can only result in tension. By superficially copying the behavior of a rich man, he cannot possibly become rich. Similarly, the behavior of a man of steady intellect provides no standard for one whose intellect is not steady. If he tries to go that way, his life will become cold, deprived of the qualities of heart and mind. This has been the destiny of many a sincere seeker of Truth down the ages. Misguided interpretations of verses like this, which are found in almost all scriptures, are responsible for the spiritual plight of innumerable generations. It must not be forgotten that there are two ways of life, that of a householder and that of a recluse. Men from both ways who meditate and arrive at the state of steady intellect will continue in their respective ways of life. The householder, by nature habituated to the field of activity with all the diversity of phenomenal existence, continues to act in the world, while the recluse continues in his detachment from worldly affairs. The state of steady intellect simply brings them fulfillment. They rise above attachment and detachment, finding their life on the level of eternity, unbounded by any limitation of time, space and causation, far above the boundaries of any social bond or obligation. Their life is one of cosmic consciousness. They are above the distinction of day and night: waking or sleeping they are established in the oneness of divine intelligence and bliss. This world of joys and sorrows, of man's great enterprise and ambition, is for them like a world of dolls and toys with which children play and amuse themselves. Toys are a source of great excitement for children, but grown-ups remain untouched by them. The man of established intellect remains even and does not rejoice or recoil 'on gaining what is good or bad'. 'Has no undue fondness' means is not too emotionally attached. But this does not imply that the man of established intellect is cold and without warmth of heart. On the contrary, he alone is a man of full heart. He is an unbounded ocean of love and happiness. His love and his happiness flow and overflow for everyone in like manner; that is why he has no 'undue fondness towards anything'. It may be stated that the detached and unshakeable nature of a man of established intellect, described in the previous verse, is based on the principle of non-attachment, as taught in this verse. Such non-attachment develops naturally with the growth of awareness of the Self as separate from activity. This same natural state of non-attachment is at the basis of activity in the state of steady intellect even when the senses remain 'withdrawn' from their objects, as shown in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.58 And when such a man withdraws his senses from their objects, as a tortoise draws in its limbs from all sides, his intellect is established. This verse pictures the state of the senses of a man of established intellect by drawing a comparison with the indrawn limbs of a tortoise that from the outside seems to have no limbs at all. By this example the Lord also implies that it is not possible correctly 'to express the outward signs or distinguishing marks of a man of established intellect. But at least one thing is clear, his senses are drawn in, they are not turned in an outward direction. It may appear that that man of steady intellect referred to in this verse is only he who is in the state of transcendental consciousness, for in this state alone are the senses completely withdrawn from their objects. But 'withdraws his senses' does not necessarily mean that the senses do not experience outside objects, as in the state of transcendental consciousness. The senses can be involved with outer experiences and yet not be totally engrossed in them to the extent that they transfer to the mind impressions deep enough to become the seed of future desires. It is very important to understand the verse in this way; otherwise, the man of steady intellect would have to remain for ever outside the domain of sensory activity, which is physically impossible. The established intellect has, in fact, little to do with the activity or non-activity of the senses; its basis lies in the natural state of non-attachment described in the previous verse. It is plain, therefore, that the present verse refers not to transcendental consciousness alone but also to cosmic consciousness, where it is possible for the senses to be in a state of non-attachment even while they are active. The Lord is here emphasizing that in the state of established intellect the senses, being free from attraction towards their objects, remain as though withdrawn from them. When the mind is mainly identified with the inner Being, the senses do not identify themselves with their objects. Moreover the next verse shows that when the senses are exposed to the unbounded grandeur of the Supreme, they lose even the taste for their objects. This makes it clear that when the transcendent Being fills the mind and begins to be lived on the sensory level, then the intellect is established. This is a very different state from mere non-indulgence of the senses, which is certainly no absolute criterion of the established intellect. A man who, because of some circumstance, does not enjoy the objects of sense may appear to be like an indrawn tortoise, although the mind within may be active, quietly absorbed in the thought of the joys of the senses. Such a state of mind is obviously not the resolute state; it is not established intellect. The principle here brought out does not depend on whether or not the senses are active. It reveals the inner condition of non-attachment, on the sensory level, in the state of established intellect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.59 The objects of sense turn away from him who does not feed upon them, but the taste for them persists. On seeing the Supreme even this taste ceases. 'Taste for them persists' means that the mind continues to experience objects through the finer levels of the senses. In thus distinguishing between the gross and subtle fields of sensory perception, the Lord means to convey that in the state of steady intellect even the finer faculties of the senses remain unattached to objects. This verse presents a challenge to the whole philosophy of control of the senses. It shows clearly that the senses cannot be controlled from their own level. In the field of the senses, the senses predominate. They drag the mind towards their objects, towards the joys of the world. None of the objects of the senses, however, is able to satisfy the longing of the mind for happiness. Therefore the mind is ever found wandering in the field of the senses. Only when the state of established intellect is gained and the mind ceases to wander, can the senses be controlled. It is wrong to assume that unless the senses are controlled one cannot realize the Truth. As a matter of fact, the converse is true: according to this verse, the senses come under complete control only with the light of realization, only when the transcendent Self, or Being, comes to be appreciated on the level of the senses. Wrong interpretations of this and other verses have led many genuine seekers of Truth to undertake rigorous and unnatural practices in order to control the senses, thus wasting their lives and benefiting neither themselves nor others. Mastery of the senses is gained only through the state of established intellect, for in this state where man is established in awareness of the Self as separate from activity, his behavior is quite naturally unaffected by the otherwise overpowering influence of the senses. At the end of this chapter, the Lord concludes that when behavior in the sensory field does not in any way disturb the state of established intellect, and established intellect behaves as master of the senses, the highest state of human evolution has been reached. 'On seeing the Supreme': when the intellect goes beyond the field of the three gunas and cognizes the transcendent Reality, that is, gains transcendental consciousness. When this state of transcendental consciousness is maintained even while the senses are active, then a situation is created in which the Transcendent comes to be lived naturally on the level of sensory perception. And when the Transcendent comes to be appreciated on the sensory level, then a man is said to have truly gained established intellect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.60 The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, forcibly carry away the mind even of a discerning man who endeavors (to control them). Here the Lord describes to Arjuna the nature of the senses. Being the instruments which enable the mind to enjoy the glory of the diversity of creation, they are in duty bound to draw it towards objects of pleasure. Their main purpose is to bring the greatest possible happiness to the mind. And this they will continue to do so long as the mind has not become eternally contented in the bliss of the Absolute. How to make best use of the senses in order to come to the experience of eternal bliss is described in the following verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.61 Having brought them all under control, let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme; for his intellect is established whose senses are subdued. The previous verse explained the nature of the senses and their overpowering influence on the mind, while the verses that follow depict the dangers which result from their indulgence when the level of the Transcendent is not maintained. In this verse the Lord holds out hope by showing that it is possible to control the senses and that 'his intellect is established whose senses are subdued'. The Lord says: 'Having brought them all under control, let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme'. This opens up a way, for when the attention has been brought to the Transcendent, the activity of the senses ceases and they will be automatically controlled. In this state of life, says the Lord, 'let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme'. The technique of bringing them 'all' under control is to engage any one sense in providing increasing happiness for the mind on the path of transcending that is, to begin the practice of transcendental meditation. In this process the mind, using a particular sense for passing through the finer levels of experience and transcending the subtlest experience, also transcends the field of that sense and the fields of all the senses. Gaining bliss-consciousness in this way, the mind wins automatic control over all the senses. 'Let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme': the man who sits united is one whose self is united with the Self, or Being, even though he is engaged in action. Through the repeated practice of transcendental meditation, he has realized Being to such fullness that no activity can overshadow It; that is to say, he has realized Being as separate from activity. Having gained this state, says the Lord, let him maintain it and in that state be devoted to Me, the Lord of all creation, who presides over both the absolute and relative phases of existence. The teaching is that, having gained cosmic consciousness and having thereby created a situation where mind and senses remain naturally organized, using their full potential to fulfill desires that further the good of the world, a man should devote himself to God and let the heart flow and overflow in love for Him, the great Lord of all. He alone can be someone to whom life in cosmic consciousness can turn; for, being omnipotent and omniscient, He ranks higher than life in cosmic consciousness. The purpose of this teaching of devotion to God on that high level where man has reached his full potentiality is to enable him to experience the great waves of bliss in the ocean of cosmic consciousness, to experience that joyfulness of eternal life which brings complete fulfillment to his existence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.62 Pondering on objects of the senses, a man develops attachment for them; from attachment springs up desire, and desire gives rise to anger. This verse depicts one who is not turned towards the Divine, but towards the objects of the senses. The Lord shows how such a man gradually sinks deeper and deeper into the mire of delusion until he perishes. Thought is a great force in man. It develops into desire, which in turn translates itself into action, bringing glory or disgrace. 'Anger' arises from weakness or inability to fulfill one's desires, although it is generally attributed to obstacles in the way of such fulfillment. And thus desire is said to be the direct cause of anger. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.63 From anger arises delusion; from delusion unsteadiness of memory; from unsteadiness of memory destruction of intellect; through the destruction of the intellect he perishes. Anger excites the mind, which loses its balance and power of discrimination; it loses proper vision and foresight and a right sense of values. This state of 'delusion' obscures the track of memory, and thereby one feels as if disconnected from the harmonious rhythm of life. Wisdom fails, and the intellect ceases to function. The boat of life is left with nobody in control; it meets with disaster as a matter of course. The intellect is the finest aspect of one's subjective nature. As long as the intellect is intact there is every hope of the advancement and fulfillment of life. That is why the Lord says that the destruction of the intellect results in a man's ruin. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.64 But he who is self-disciplined, who moves among the objects of the senses with the senses freed from attachment and aversion and under his own control, he attains to 'grace'. 'Grace' here means delight and wholeness, resulting from the state of pure consciousness. This verse contrasts with the two preceding verses. Having explained to Arjuna the plight of those who surrender themselves to the call of desire without possessing control of the senses, the Lord, in this verse, shows him the reward gained by the man who disciplines himself before plunging into worldly life. The Lord here explains the status of the integrated man. He is established in the Self, and by virtue of this, even when he acts in the field of the senses and experiences their objects, he is not lost in them; maintaining his status in Being, he quite naturally maintains evenness of mind. His sense of values is balanced. Acting in the world, he is not lost in it. He is above attachment and detachment, contented in himself, not bound by anything. The results of reaching this state of blissful freedom are described in the verses that follow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.65 In 'grace' is born an end to all his sorrows. Indeed the intellect of the man of exalted consciousness soon becomes firmly established. The experience of pure bliss-consciousness puts an end to all suffering; filling the heart with happiness it brings perfect tranquillity to the mind. The principle is that if freedom from suffering, lasting peace, health and fulfillment are desired, it is necessary to gain bliss-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.66 He who is not established has no intellect, nor has he any steady thought. The man without steady thought has no peace; for one without peace how can there be happiness? The glory of the established intellect is brought out here. When the mind is established in the Self, then it is in tune with cosmic intelligence, and then only has it what the Lord calls 'intellect', the faculty of discrimination. Unless one is in tune with cosmic intelligence there is no wisdom, no steadiness, no peace, no happiness in the real sense. The verse may also be interpreted as showing the stages through which a worldly Inind passes on the way to bliss-consciousness. Confused in the world as the mind is, it has to become peaceful in order to have a steady thought, which then converges into a state of one-pointedness called 'intellect', which then becomes established in Being. When, during meditation, the mind enters into the experience of subtle levels of thought, it becomes more collected, more steady, with every step and therefore feels itself entering a field of increasing charm. This process ends in the absolute happiness of the Transcendent. If the mind is more steady, it is in a better position to experience greater happiness. As on a calmer surface of water the sun reflects more clearly, so a calmer mind receives a clearer reflection of. the omnipresent bliss of the absolute Being. As the mind fathoms finer fields of thinking during meditation, the metabolism is simultaneously reduced. This establishes the nervous system in degrees of ever-increasing peace. Eventually, when the entire nervous system comes to a completely peaceful state, it reflects Being, and this gives rise to bliss-consciousness. The state of transcendental consciousness cannot be gained unless the nervous system is completely peaceful. This is the truth revealed by the words 'for one without peace how can there be happiness?'. The bliss is already there; it is only necessary to calm down the wanderings of the mind. A question arises here. If the wanderings of the mind are due to its search for happiness, could it not be said: unless there is happiness how can there be peace' But no; the expression 'unless there is happiness' is completely wrong; it could not have been framed by Lord Krishna because it is not true For bliss is omnipresent and eternal, while happiness is the expression of the reflection of the omnipresent bliss on the mind. Absolute bliss being always there, the experience of happiness thus depends upon the degree of steadiness of the mind. If the mind is more collected, more peaceful, it experiences more happiness. During meditation the mind, entering the subtle phases of a thought, becomes more collected and more peaceful, that is why it proceeds that way automatically. This truth is expressed by the Upanishads when they declare that happiness varies in different states of creation, at different levels of evolution. As the mind evolves to higher levels of consciousness during meditation, it experiences increasing degrees of happiness, until it comes to absolute bliss in the most highly evolved state of pure transcendental consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.67 When a man's mind is governed by any of the wandering senses, his intellect is carried away by it as a ship by the wind on water. The mind by nature thirsts for great happiness. Let us suppose it is enjoying experience through a particular sense. In its eagerness to enjoy the utmost which that sense can provide, it becomes absorbed in the process of enjoying, and in this one-sided absorption loses the power (4f discrimination, which is the main faculty of the intellect. This is what the Lord means when He says the senses rob a man of intellect. The mind is prepared to accept anything that can tempt it with the promise of happiness. Any sensory object which promises happiness is capable of taking possession of the mind. This is not to the discredit of the mind, for its nature is to enjoy. If the senses draw the mind to the joys of their objects, this similarly is no discredit to the senses. They are the machinery through which the mind enjoys and, like a ready servant, are waiting to serve the mind. As a ship is carried away by the wind, so is the mind completely carried away by the senses in the outward direction of gross creation, the direction of the objects of the senses. It loses the power of concentration, for it travels as if in a diverging beam, a course naturally opposed to the concentrated state of intellect. The following verse advises control over the senses for safety's sake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.68 Therefore he whose senses are all withdrawn from their objects, O mighty-armed, his intellect is established. This verse, which is almost a repetition of verse 58, presents the conclusion of the last six verses. It gives the quintessence of the entire scheme of fulfillment in life, which is to channel the mind into regions of experience more blissful than the ordinary gross fields of sensory life. 'Therefore' refers back to the words of verse 66: 'for one without peace how can there be happiness?'. It indicates that if happiness is sought, peace has to be created, the nervous system has to be brought to a state of restful alertness. For this to happen, the activity of the senses must cease. That is why the Lord says: 'whose senses are all withdrawn from their objects'. The verse establishes that the senses lose their relationship to their objects when the intellect is resolute, when it is established in the Self. The senses function on different levels. On the gross level they enable the mind to enjoy the external aspects of their objects. Functioning on subtler levels, they enable it to experience the more subtle aspects of objects; and joys arising from the experience of the subtler states of objects are greater than those arising from their gross states. When, during meditation, the mind begins to experience the subtler aspects of a thought, it experiences increasing charm and thus is naturally attracted to the experience of the subtlest aspect of the thought. The experience of this finest state of thought, which is on the subtlest level of creation, provides the mind with the greatest joy in the field of relativity, but even this joy is not permanent, is not of absolute nature. Arjuna is being directed to bring his mind to a state beyond the greatest joy of relativity, so that he can free himself from dependence upon the transitory relative joys of life and become established in the bliss of the Absolute. To reach this eternal bliss, the Lord asks him to leave completely the field of sensory perception, both gross and subtle Thus he will come to established intellect, intellect established in the Transcendent. To live this principle in daily life is simple, for one need only know how to allow the mind to come quite naturally out of the field of the senses and reach the state of established intellect. ' Thus in this verse, the principle that has already been explained from the point of view of the mind is illustrated from that of relative sensory perception. The following verse distinguishes between the fields of life of the enlightened and the ignorant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.69 That which is night for all beings, therein the self-controlled is awake. That wherein beings are awake is night for the sage who sees. 'Sage' (muni): not necessarily a recluse, but rather a man of calm, far-seeing prudence and wisdom. 'Sees' means sees the Truth. Here the Lord shows Arjuna the difference between the state of the ignorant man and that of the realized: one exists in darkness, the other in light. Or the night of the one is the day of the other, for the realized man is awake in the light of the Self, while the ignorant is awake in the light of the senses. The realized man is awake in the light of absolute bliss, the ignorant in the light of relative joys of perishable nature. The Lord says that the light in which the established intellect behaves is not perceived by the ignorant, and the light in which the ignorant behave is looked upon as darkness by the enlightened. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.70 He whom all desires enter as waters enter the ever-full and unmoved sea attains peace, and not he who cherishes desires. When a man has risen to this lasting state of consciousness, the state where his Self is detached from and not overshadowed by the relative states of life, waking, dreaming and deep sleep then his state is like that of an ever-full and steady ocean. This, being the state of absolute bliss, is the goal of all desires in life. Desires arise from a particular want, from a lack of happiness; the mind is ever seeking a field of greater happiness. Thus desires are always flowing towards eternal bliss-consciousness, as rivers to the ocean. Once bliss-consciousness is permanently attained, desires have served their purpose and therefore cravings do not arise. This is a state of true contentment, a state of lasting peace. The Lord says that lasting peace is never achieved by one who is not complete in himself and still craves worldly things. However, this does not mean that in order to attain peace in life a man should cease to desire and to aspire. It is the desires that lead a man to greater happiness and to fulfillment, not the control and killing of desires, which has been widely advocated through the ages. This verse too has been wrongly interpreted, with a consequent increase in dullness and inefficiency, particularly in the lives of young people in India The undue stress laid on fatalism has proved disastrous for their physical well-being and for the material progress of society. Thinking that to desire and to aspire will not lead to peace, people begin to abstain from enterprise and cease to open the gates of progress. This is simply a wrong understanding of the Lord's teaching. The verse shows Arjuna very clearly that the Self-awareness of the realized is like an ocean, which will accept any stream of desires and will satisfy it without being affected. The ocean accepts the river as it comes and denies no stream rushing in, yet its status remains unaffected. Such is the state of established intellect, which cannot be affected by anything. It is a state of eternal peace. The following verse gives the technique of maintaining such a permanent state of peace in the midst of activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.71 When a man acts without longing, having relinquished all desires, free from the sense of 'I' and 'mine', he attains to peace. 'Having relinquished all desires' does not mean that the mind no longer entertains any desires, because this would not be possible for a living being. It means that the Self has been realized as detached from activity, as was made clear in the commentary on verse 55. Because a man in this state acts while remaining 'free from the sense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot;,' it is quite natural that activity does not in any way disturb his state of established intellect. He has gained that eternal freedom in life where the status of one's Being remains unaffected by any activity. The following verse throws more light on this. To have 'relinquished all desires' means to have gained transcendental divine consciousness permanently. This happens through meditation. When, after meditation, the mind comes out infused with the transcendental divine nature, the individual acts in the world, and this action is quite naturally free from the narrowness of petty individuality, from the shortsightedness of selfish attachment, which previously held him imprisoned. Everything moves according to the cosmic plan, and although the individual ego continues to function, the action is that of divine intelligence working through the individual who is living cosmic existence. Such a life is a very natural expression of cosmic intelligence in the world It represents the state of eternal freedom here on earth. Nothing in the world is able to overshadow or disturb this state, because it is inclusive of all that lies between two extremes of life - the transcendental divine nature of the Absolute and human nature in relative existence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$2.72 This is the state of Brahman, O Partha. Having attained it, a man is not deluded. Established in that, even at the last moment, he attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness. The state of life described in the previous verse, says the Lord, is the state of cosmic consciousness. If a man is to attain to this state, it is necessary for him to gain stability of Self-consciousness in the midst of activity. This entails culturing the nervous system, the seat of consciousness, in such a way that it becomes capable of maintaining Self-consciousness, which in its nature is transcendental, along with the waking, dreaming or sleeping states of consciousness. The process of refining the nervous system is a delicate one and takes its own time, depending upon the various factors of individual life. When the mind transcends during transcendental meditation, the metabolism reaches its lowest point; so does the process of breathing, and the nervous system gains a state of restful alertness which, on the physical level, corresponds to the state of bliss-consciousness, or transcendent Being. In order that the consciousness of the waking state may be maintained along with transcendental bliss-consciousness, it is essential for the nervous system not to lose this state of restful alertness corresponding to bliss-consciousness. At the same time, the nervous system should maintain a metabolic rate corresponding to the activity taking place in the waking state. For this to come about, regular and continued practice of such meditation as leads to transcendental consciousness is necessary. This has to be followed by activity, because activity after meditation brings an infusion of transcendental Being into the nature of the mind and through it into all aspects of one's life in the relative field. With the constant practice of' meditation, this infusion continues to grow and when it is full-grown cosmic consciousness will have been attained. Once this state is attained, to fall from it is impossible. It holds transcendental consciousness intact in the field of all the relative states, waking, dreaming and deep sleep. Thus, in 'the state of Brahman', the state of eternal life, the activity or the silence of relative existence belongs to the absolute Being. Having reached this state, a man's life is really the expression of divine life. The divine life is found in the individual life, the absolute Being on the human level, eternal freedom within the limitations of individuality: time, space and causation It would be wrong to estimate the state of cosmic consciousness in a man by anything he displays in the field of action, because this state accepts every activity, great or small, and at the same time retains complete stillness. His state cannot, in principle, be judged by what he does. There are no outer signs of a man who has risen to this state of Brahman. Those seekers of Truth who have accepted a life of renunciation naturally continue to abstain from all activities of life even when they attain cosmic consciousness. This is due to their long-established habit of non-indulgence in activity. In the same way, when men of the world, actively engaged in many phases of life, reach the state of cosmic consciousness through Yoga, they continue to act, mainly from force of habit But whether involved in activity or leading a quiet life, a soul evolved to this cosmic state is eternally contented. This state is ever the same, whether the mind is active in the waking or dreaming state, or inactive in deep sleep. It is a state of eternal liberation during life here on earth. The Lord's words: 'even at the last moment' provide a firm assurance that the fulfillment of life's purpose will be achieved through the teaching of this chapter. Arjuna has been given all that he needs to enable him to rise to 'eternal freedom in divine consciousness'. Thus end the Yoga of Knowledge, Sankhya Yoga. The second chapter has presented Brahma Vidya, the wisdom of the full life, the wisdom of the Absolute and the relative, in both its aspects, theoretical and practical. The theoretical aspect is called the wisdom of Sankhya; it brings understanding of the absolute and the relative fields of life as separate, one from another. The practical aspect is called Yoga, and it brings direct experience of these two fields of life in separation. The nature of this experience gained through the practice of Yoga and its application to life in the world are unfolded in this third chapter. The aim is to make permanent the state of absolute bliss-consciousness, so that it will not be lost even when the mind is engaged in the activity of the relative field. This alone can give full experience of life, for life is relative and absolute simultaneously. This third chapter presents a practical application of the second. It describes in detail the role of the 'established intellect' in practical life, so as to provide those occupied in the marketplace of the world with a direct way of evolution and eternal liberation. Its teaching is applicable to everyone, whatever his vocation. This chapter develops the seed-thought contained in the first three words of verse 48 of the second chapter: 'Yogastah kuru karmani established in Yoga, perform actions'. This doctrine of Karma Yoga, the Yoga of action, forms the chapter's main theme. Karma is in the field of diversity, and Yoga is Unity. Therefore in order to understand Karma Yoga one must be as familiar with the Unity of life as with the field of diversity; only by being at home in both fields can one understand the link between them. The teaching of the third chapter is designed to bring this about But it is important for the student of Karma Yoga to remember that an intellectual understanding of the teaching of this chapter, without personal experience of the real nature of Unity, can never bring the fruits of Karma Yoga. The technique of directly contacting the transcendental divine consciousness, as brought out in verse 45 of the second chapter, has to be practiced; only on the basis of that personal experience is it possible to attain fulfillment in life through Karma Yoga. The practice of transcendental meditation is essential if the wisdom of this chapter is to be put to practical use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.1 Arjuna said: If Thou considerest knowledge superior to action, O Janardana, why dost Thou spur me to this terrible deed, O Keshava ? Arjuna's question, with which this chapter opens, does not indicate that he was confused and had missed the import of the Lord's discourse in the second chapter, as commentaries have often suggested. Such interpretations show the commentators' own inability to follow the sequence of the Lord's words. They have clearly failed to understand the aptness of Arjuna's questions in helping to develop the Lord's theme. His questions represent the glorious links between the teachings which precede and follow them in the ascending order of the Lord's discourse. A close examination of the context will reveal that Arjuna's questions present themselves in a natural way. This is due not only to the skill of the Lord's teaching and Arjuna's promptness in following it, but also to the nature of the subject under consideration. The teaching about life deals with many points, even points opposed to each other, for it deals with the unlimited fields of the relative and absolute phases of existence. These lie so far apart that in their essential nature there exists no link between them. The mind, however, can serve as such a link, because it is able to remain in activity and in the state of absolute Being at the same time. Moreover it uses activity as a means to end activity and thus to make possible the state of transcendental consciousness. Karma thus becomes a means to Yoga. Such are the apparently self-contradictory phases of the teaching about life to which Arjuna's questions draw attention. It is obvious, therefore, that his questions are pertinent and arise out of his right understanding of the discourse. The relevance of the questions asked by the pupil reveals the success of the teaching. The teacher even creates an opportunity for the pupil to ask each question, thus sustaining his interest and making sure that he is properly following the discourse. And when the teaching advances in this manner, by way of question and answer, it unfolds the whole of wisdom for the pupil. 'If Thou considerest knowledge': in order to probe deep into the nature of Arjuna's understanding about 'knowledge', it is necessary to analyze the teaching of the second chapter. Life has two aspects, relative and absolute. The relative aspect is perishable and the absolute is imperishable. In order to give meaning to life, it is first necessary to bring the perishable aspect into living harmony with the imperishable. This is achieved through action according to one's dharma,t which maintains existence in a way that furthers one's own evolution and that of others. In order to set the whole stream of life flowing naturally in the ascending current of dharma, it is necessary to cultivate the resolute intellect.' This will ensure that both aspects of man's life, perishable and imperishable, the body and the Self, will naturally maintain their dharma and be in perfect harmony, the Self remaining in Its state of eternal freedom in absolute Being and the mind entertaining activity which will naturally be in tune with the process of evolution. In order to cultivate the resolute intellect, one has to be 'without the three gunas', completely out of the field of activity, established in the transcendental state of Being. When, through constant practice in gaining the state 'without the three gunas', the mind gains fixity in Being, one becomes aware of the Self, or Being, as separate from activity. In this state one acts in the world while established in the eternal contentment and freedom of divine consciousness. Therefore although knowledge begins with the intellectual understanding of the two aspects of life, perishable and imperishable, it becomes a living Reality only when, through the practice of transcendental meditation, one becomes directly aware of the Self as separate from activity. This awareness is the state of knowledge, the state of established intellect. Arjuna has rightly understood all that the Lord has spoken about knowledge. But he demands confirmation that his understanding is correct. The word 'if' brings out this meaning. 'Knowledge superior to action': Arjuna asks his question not because he has failed to grasp the principle of action in the state of knowledge,o but because he has thoroughly understood that 'when a man acts without longing, having relinquished all desires, free from the sense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; he attains to peace'. He has understood that by fighting he will not incur sin. But for that great heart of Arjuna's, merely to escape from sin is not a sufficient reason for plunging into action. He judges the action of fighting at its face-value and finds that to kill his dear ones would be a 'terrible deed'. He raises the question whether, on the strength of knowledge, he could after all avoid the 'terrible deed' of battle. having reached this high state of established intellect, should not a man have freedom to act or not to act This is Arjuna's question from his high state of consciousness. Arjuna here silently uses the Lord's teaching about the freedom which knowledge gives, in favour of freedom to choose that actions he wishes to perform. He probes deep into the Lord's teaching and finds that this point has not yet been answered. This question further indicates that Arjuna has understood not only the relationship between action and knowledge, but also that between action and dharma. He has understood the Lord's teaching about dharma.oo He has understood that one's own dharma is the best criterion for judging the appropriateness of an action, and that, for a kshatriya, a battle such as this is in accord with dharma. But the stress that the Lord has put on knowledge gives Arjuna an opportunity to question Him about the relationship between knowledge and dharma, which has not yet been made clear and without which the teaching about action remains incomplete. Arjuna wants to know whether knowledge can override dharma to the extent of permitting one to forego a particular 'deed'; whether knowledge gives a man sufficient freedom to enable him to make his own choice about action. Arjuna implies that if it does he would like to choose to forego 'this terrible deed'. The question that Arjuna raises is of deep significance and has great value in furthering the theme of the Lord's discourse. It is this question of Arjuna's that brings forth a complete doctrine of action from the lips of the Lord. Commentators in general have missed the great depth of understanding from which Arjuna was speaking and asking questions, because they have misunderstood his position right from the first chapter. Arjuna, from his high level of consciousness, is able to distinguish the finest points of the Lord's discourse and to weigh them up in terms of practical life. His alert mind locates many contradictory statements in the teaching so far, and he makes mention of these in the verse which follows. This explains how apt is Arjuna's question and how well it serves to unfold the wisdom of action in the light of knowledge, which forms the main subject of this chapter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.2 With these apparently opposed statements Thou dost, as it were, bewilder my intelligence. So, having made Thy decision, tell me the one by which I may reach the highest good. The tone of this verse brings to light Arjuna's intimacy with the Lord and his good understanding of the teaching. 'It also further reveals the alertness of Arjuna's mind in evaluating different aspects of the discourse. 'Apparently opposed': in verse 38 of the preceding chapter, the Lord enjoined Arjuna to 'come out to fight'. But in verse 45 He said to him, 'Be without the three gunas', which means: come out of the field of activity. Again, in verse 471 He said: 'You 'have control over action alone', do not 'attach yourself to inaction'. Then, in verse 48, He expressed the synthesis of action and the established intellect in the words: 'Established in Yoga, O winner of wealth, perform actions' In verse 49, however, he went on to destroy the very principle of this synthesis by declaring: 'Far away, indeed, from the balanced intellect is the action devoid of greatness'. Arjuna wants to verify whether 'these apparently opposed statements' point to some hidden principle which has not yet been expressed, or whether there exists some hidden link joining them together. In the seventh verse of Chapter II, Arjuna had surrendered himself to the Lord, saying: 'tell me decisively what is good for me'. Now he finds that he is being provided with two boats, each apparently going in an opposite direction. He is asked simultaneously to come on to this and to get into that. So he stands bewildered and asks: Tell me which boat to take, this or that, for if I start in two boats I am sure to drown. His question is a pertinent one. The words 'apparently opposed' indicate Arjuna's modesty. Wishing to draw attention to the fact that Lord Krishna is offering him statements that oppose each other, he softens the expression by adding 'apparently'. And again, when he wants to convey that the Lord is bewildering his intelligence, he shows his modesty by adding 'as it were'. Arjuna needed some intellectual jolt, some means of quickly shaking the intellect to bring him out of the state of suspension. To this end the Lord showered Arjuna with apparently opposed statements of Truth. Thus Lord Krishna succeeded in bringing Arjuna's mind to the level where he could think in a practical manner. He became so practical as to say: 'Thou dost . . . bewilder my intelligence'. Now the Lord begins the second course of His teaching, the most glorious aspect of the wisdom of practical life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.3 The Blessed Lord said: As expounded by Me of old, O blameless one, there are in this world two paths: the Yoga of knowledge for men of contemplation and the Yoga of action for men of action. In this verse the word 'Yoga' is common to both Gyana Yoga, the Yoga of knowledge, and Karma Yoga, the Yoga of action. The state of transcendental consciousness is the state of Yoga, or Union, where the mind remains so completely united with the divine nature that it becomes It. When this Union is naturally maintained, irrespective of the modes of the mind in the waking, dreaming and sleeping states, then that state of consciousness is said to be cosmic consciousness. Then the state of transcendental consciousness, or Yoga, is supplemented by the process of thinking and discrimination in order to develop it into cosmic consciousness, the way is called the Yoga of knowledge, Gyana Yoga ; whereas when the state of transcendental consciousness is supplemented by action on the sensory level in order to develop it into cosmic consciousness, the way is called Karma Yoga, the Yoga of action. These two types of Yoga fulfill the needs of all men, whether contemplative or active. The experience of the Transcendent during meditation is realization of only one aspect of Reality the unmanifested, absolute aspect. For realization of the complete Truth, this experience has to go hand in hand with the experience of the manifested aspect, which is the relative phase of existence. In order that transcendental bliss-consciousness may be lived at all times, it is necessary that it should not be lost when the mind comes out of meditation and engages in activity. For this to be possible the mind has to become so intimately familiar with the state of Being that It remains grounded in the mind at all times, through all the mental activity of thinking, discriminating and deciding, and through all phases of action on the sensory level. For this in turn, it is necessary that the process of gaining transcendental consciousness through meditation and that of engaging in activity should be alternated, so that transcendental consciousness and the waking state of consciousness may come close together and finally merge into one another to give rise to the state of cosmic consciousness, the state in which one lives bliss-consciousness, the inner awareness of Being, through all the activity of the waking and dreaming states and through the silence of the deep sleep state. As there are two types of people, men of thought and men of action, so there are two ways of life, the way of the recluse for the man of thought and the way of the householder for the man of action. The man of thought, after meditation, engages in the mental activity of contemplation and thereby achieves the integration of the transcendental and waking states of consciousness; whereas a man of action, after meditation, engages in the field of action and thereby accomplishes the same goal. Thus the Gyana Yoga of the recluse and the Karma Yoga of the householder differ from one another only in the phase of activity. One type of man devotes himself to the mental activity of thinking, discriminating and deciding about the nature of the world and the Divine; the other devotes himself to action without making the process of thinking a means of fulfillment. In this way, both engage in activity after gaining transcendental consciousness. The Lord says to Arjuna that these two ways of realization have been handed on from generation to generation, from time immemorial. They are two distinct paths for the two distinct types of people who lead two distinct ways of life. Unfortunately a muddle has been created in the understanding of this principle of realization, the highway of evolution. If the householder adopts the outlook of the Yoga of knowledge, then he falls into the world of thought and becomes less practical. Similarly, if a recluse embraces the outlook of the Yoga of action, he loses the opportunity of impartial discrimination and the constant flow of contemplation. He falls into the field of action, into the market-place of life. Both paths are equally valid for developing cosmic consciousness. Karma Yoga and Gyana Yoga each presents a direct way to fulfillment, but the path chosen should suit the way of life and the natural tendencies of the aspirant. A householder should not try to realize through Sankhya or Gyana Yoga: let him adopt the path of Karma Yoga and, fulfilling the aspirations of a life in the world, he will gain cosmic consciousness in a natural and harmonious manner. Similarly, a recluse, or sanyasi, should not aspire to adopt the path of Karma Yoga. He should follow the Sankhya teaching, or Gyana Yoga, and fulfilling the aspirations of a recluse way of life, he also will attain cosmic consciousness in a natural and harmonious manner. Those interested in spiritual progress have for centuries adopted an outlook suited only to the recluse way of life. While perfectly valid for the few who retire from the world, such an outlook has no place in the lives of the vast majority of mankind who lead 4he householder's way of life. The path of Karma Yoga does not, like the path of knowledge, proceed by way of thinking or intellectual understanding; it is the innocent path of action, supplemented by transcendental meditatiom. Thinking of the divine Self or of God has no place on the path of Karma Yoga. Those who try to keep their mind on God while they are engaged in action neither succeed in taking the mind to God-consciousness at the level of transcendental Divinity, nor do they properly succeed in the field of action, because action becomes weak when the mind is divided and not fully given to it This amounts to a loss in both directions. They neither fully become men of God nor succeed as men of the world. For those who want to be successful both in the field of the Divine and in the world, the path is that of Karma Yoga, a few minutes of meditation in the morning and in the evening and normal activity during the rest of the day. The meditation, however, should be of a kind that takes the mind directly to transcendental consciousness, and the activity during the day should be undertaken with ease and without strain. It must be borne in mind that the practice of meditation is essential for both the recluse and the householder. At the same time, it is essential for enlightenment that after the practice both should engage in activity, whether' the activity is of the intellect, as in the case of the recluse, or of the senses, as in the case of the householder, is immaterial. A recluse is provided with a particular code of thinking which serves to keep him fixed to his path of renunciation. The householder likewise is provided with a code of action to keep him fixed to his path of action. This activity after meditation is important for the integration of the waking and transcendental states of consciousness, but the actual content of the thinking of the recluse and the action of the householder does not in any way help to bring about the integration of the two states of consciousness. It is the activity as such, physical or mental, which is of value in bringing about integration. The content of thought and action certainly has its value in the two ways of life but it does not touch the field of Being. The purpose of both paths is to establish a man on a level of consciousness where he will enjoy a meaningful life, established in the eternal freedom of bliss-consciousness. Such a man becomes more powerful and successful in his own way of life, the activity of the householder and the seclusion of the recluse are fully protected and brought to fulfillment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.4 Not by abstaining from action does a man achieve non-action; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection. 'Non-action' is the nearest translation of the Sanskrit word 'naishkarmyam', which expresses a specific quality of the doer, a quality of non-attachment whereby he enjoys freedom from the bondage of action even during activity. It expresses a natural and permanent state of the doer. Whether he is engaged in the activity of the waking or dreaming state or in the inactivity of deep sleep, he retains inner awareness. It is a state of life where Self-consciousness is not overshadowed by any of the :three relative states of consciousness, waking, dreaming or sleeping. In this state of 'naishkarmyam', the doer has risen to the fourth state of consciousness, 'turiya'; this, in its essential nature, is Self-consciousness, the pure absolute state of bliss-consciousness, Sat-Chit-Ananda, but yet is inclusive of the three relative states of consciousness. The Lord began to explain 'non-action', in verse 48 of Chapter II, in terms of abandonment of attachment. In the present verse He explains it without any reference to attachment. In verse 70 He will explain it with reference to Himself, surrender of all actions to God. But in every case the direct experience of Being forms the basis of non-action. 'By abstaining from action' one merely falls into a state of idleness or the inactivity of sleep. This is far removed from the state of non-action, where the mind, deep within itself, remains attuned to absolute Being even when activity is maintained on the surface; where the two fields of Being and activity are cognized as separate from one another. 'Renunciation': a state of non-attachment where the doer remains separate from the field of activity; the state of non-action. The blessing of the state of renunciation, or non-action, is that the Self finds Itself separate from the field of activity. But the awareness of separation from activity resulting in the total loss of activity for the self, will not bring 'perfection'. Perfection demands not only separation from activity, but positive Union with God. It means that the individual self, detached from activity on the level of individual life, comes to unite itself with cosmic Being, God, who is detached from activity on the level of cosmic life. Cosmic consciousness, the permanent state of Self-consciousness, rises to the state of God-consciousness; the stale of non-action rises to the state of God's action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.5 No one, indeed, can exist even for an instant without performing action; for everyone is helplessly driven to activity by the gunas born of Nature. In all the states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep, which constitute relative life, outward and inward physical activity continues. Everything in creation evolves, and the process of evolution is always through activity. This is what the Lord means when he says: 'No one, indeed, can exist even for an instant without performing action'. 'Nature': this is the nearest English rendering of the word 'prakriti'. The ultimate aspect of creation is transcendental unmanifested absolute Being. Its 'nature' consists of the three 'gunas', whose various permutations and combinations constitute all phenomenal existence. Their activity continues unceasingly in all fields of creation, and that is why the Lord says that 'everyone is helplessly driven to activity by the gunas'. It is only in the transcendental field of existence that no activity iS found. This verse, by establishing activity as universal, demonstrates the impossibility of gaining the state of 'non-action' through non-engagement in activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.6 He who sits, restraining the organs of action, and dwelling in his mind on the objects of sense, self-deluded, he is said to be a hypocrite. The previous verse established activity as absolutely necessary for life in the relative field. The present verse makes it clear that even thinking belongs to the sphere of activity. This leads to the conclusion that, if action binds, one becomes subject to its binding influence even if one has entertained only a thought of action. The Lord says that it is wrong to sit 'restraining the organs of action' while the mind is dwelling on the objects of the senses. Here is a definite negation of the principle of sense-control. It silently suggests that the technique of controlling the senses does not lie in direct restraint; it lies, rather, in the field of the mind, in the sphere of mental activity. The teaching of this verse is: do not create strain by attempting directly to bridle the senses. The actual technique is given in the following verse. 'A hypocrite' is he who is neither true to himself nor true to others. He hides his true nature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.7 But he who, controlling the senses by the mind, without attachment engages the organs of action in the Yoga of action, he excels, O Arjuna. The Yoga of action, or Karma Yoga, is performance of action with a skill that does not allow the senses of perception to register deep impressions of experiences. The organs of action remain at work during activity; the senses of perception also continue to experience, but the manner of their activity is such that, while experiencing fully, they do not register deep impressions of experiences. The man who is able to experience in this manner is described here as acting 'without attachment'. Karma Yoga is that state where the senses of perception are functioning in an organized and controlled manner, while the organs of action are active. How do the senses remain organized and controlled? The Lord says that it is by virtue of a particular state of mind. How the mind arrives at this state is not explained here, for it has already been made clear to Arjuna in the 45th verse of the preceding chapter the mind has to be established in the absolute bliss of divine consciousness, through transcendental meditation. This is the simple technique by which the senses of perception are automatically controlled and organized; to become a karma yogi, nothing need be done save to infuse the mind with transcendental consciousness. When the senses of perception are active while the mind is in this state of pure consciousness, then this is called Karma Yoga: the senses remain on their objects and the mind remains established in Being. The technique of controlling the senses by the mind is elaborated in verses 42 and 47: one has to transcend the fields of mind and intellect or, as the Lord puts it in verse 45 of Chapter II, one has to 'be without the three gunas'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.8 Do your allotted duty. Action is indeed superior to inaction. Even the survival of your body wouId not be possible without action. 'Allotted duty' is that which it is natural for one to do, that for which one was born, natural action in accordance with the laws of nature, action according to one's own dharma, action which is in line with the natural stream of evolution, action which is an innocent link between Self-consciousness and cosmic consciousness, action which serves as a way to achieve God-consciousness, the fulfillment of life. An important aspect of natural duty is that it is imperative for a man; if he does not perform his allotted duty, he will be engaging in actions which lie outside the path of his own evolution. Allotted duty comprises all actions which enable a man to survive and to evolve. The rightness of such actions lies in this: that in performing them a man feels no strain; they are not a burden in life; in one stroke they maintain life and lead to evolution. It is equally essential to understand that action which is not natural will inevitably produce strain and tension both in the doer and in the atmosphere around him. If the process of action is strained, it interferes with the harmony between the doer and his work, the subject and the object; this in turn hinders the infusion of the divine nature into the field of activity, and resistance is created to the development of cosmic consciousness. That is why the Lord particularly mentions 'allotted duty'. The question arises of finding out what is one's allotted duty. In those parts of the world where natural divisions of society still exist, a man's duty is apparent 'by virtue of his birth in a particular family. Thus, Arjuna is born a kshatriya and it is natural for him to fight. But in the complexities of the mixed civilizations and mixture of traditions in the world today, it seems hard to discover one's 'allotted duty'. If, in the absence of any scriptural authority or tradition, a criterion of natural duty has to be found, it may be said on the basis of common sense, that an action which is necessary and does not produce any undue tension or strain in the doer and his surroundings is his natural duty. It is true that there may be many flaws in a criterion based only on common sense. Meditation, however, smooths the flow of life and naturally sets the stream of life in accordance with the laws of nature, upholding it on the way to higher evolution. Therefore in the absence of any other means to discover one's allotted duty, it would be wise to accept transcendental meditation as a means to direct one towards a natural way of life. It may be recalled that when the Lord began to instruct Arjuna in the art of spontaneous right action, He advised him to come out of the field of relativity and take his stand in the field of the Absolute; he would thereby rise to that state of life, cosmic consciousness, where one becomes capable of performing actions in complete accordance with the laws of nature, thus fulfilling one's dharma and serving the cosmic purpose. The Lord says: 'Action is indeed superior to inaction', and He then adds: 'Even the survival of your body . .' These words contain great wisdom about the integration of life and a supreme secret of evolution by way of action. The word 'even' is of deep significance If survival of the body is the least result that the Lord attributes to action, what then is the greatest? It is the attainment of God-consciousness, the highest state of human evolution. The Lord means that, without action, not only would the body not survive, but the heights of evolution would not be attained. It must therefore be understood how action is necessary for attaining God-consciousness. When, during transcendental meditation, the mind goes so deep within that it transcends the subtlest state of relativity, it attains the transcendental absolute state of Being. This is the state of pure awareness, or consciousness of the Self. When the mind, having been in that state, is subjected to action, the transcendental divine nature of the Self is brought out to be lived in the field of'relativity. First the worldly mind of the waking state is led to the inner divine nature by the inward stroke of meditation, which is a withdrawal from activity; then, by virtue of embracing activity through the outward stroke of meditation, the inner divine nature is brought out into the world. It should be noted that, in stressing the indispensability of action for the maintenance of life and the attainment of its purpose, the Lord is careful to qualify the action to which He refers. He does not say: Do your duty. He says: 'Do your allotted duty', your natural duty. How this commandment of the Lord's may be brought to bear on life can be expressed in one word: meditate. Meditation is the key to the performance of one's allotted duty. it is a direct way to make glorious every aspect of life, for it transforms a life of bondage in the world into the divine life of eternal freedom in cosmic consciousness, where one experiences the Self as separate from activity. Cosmic consciousness in turn develops into God-consciousness through devotion, the most highly refined type of action, which unites in the light of God the two separate aspects of cosmic consciousness, the Self and activity. This is the blessing of action, that it leads one from the waking state of consciousness to transcendental pure consciousness, thence to cosmic consciousness and finally to God-consciousness, the highest state of human evolution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.9 Excepting actions performed for yagya, this world is in bondage to action. For the sake of yagya engage in action free from attachment. 'Engage in action free from attachment': having stabilized the state of bliss-consciousness and thereby clearly realized the Self as separate from activity, engage in action, do your 'allotted duty', as enjoined in the previous verse. The process of action brings the doer out of himself; action is a direct way to bring the Self out into the field of relativity. This limits the unlimited absolute Self, and the effect is called the binding influence of action. Here the Lord gives Arjuna a technique whereby action itself may be used to take the individual back to his eternal status of absolute Being. 'Yagya' is action which helps evolution. Any action in the world which tends towards absolute Being helps to free man from bondage; actions in any other direction result in bondage. When the Lord begins, in this chapter, to teach the theory of action, He naturally draws a distinction between those actions which are a means of liberation and those which lead to bondage. The word 'yagya' commonly means a religious performance or a holy ritual, a sacrificial ceremony in which gifts are offered to the presiding deity and are consumed in fire. But here the Lord means the act of going to the transcendental Being bringing the attention from the gross external experience of the world to the state of the Transcendent, allowing all thoughts and desires to converge upon the Transcendent, as objects of oblation consumed in the sacrificial fire. In the light of this verse, yagya is not confined to the narrow limits of particular ceremonies. It is a way of life which furthers evolution. The interpretation of yagya in terms of transcendental consciousness does not in any way undermine the validity of the Vedic rites performed to please different gods. Whatever a man does 'by way of activity after the practice of transcendental meditation, it helps him to integrate transcendental consciousness with the waking state of consciousness and thereby to develop cosmic consciousness. If, during such activity, he cherishes the act of pleasing the higher powers in nature, the gods, this in no way hinders his progress; on the contrary, it brings him greater accomplishment through the support he receives from these powers in nature. Yagya is the subject of the Vedas. The Vedas are divided into various branches, called shakhas. Each shakha expounds its yagya, covering the whole range of life, relative and absolute, and aiming at glorifying life in all its aspects, gross, subtle and transcendent. Every shakha has three sections. One section, called 'Karma Kanda' (Chapter of Action), deals with the gross aspect of yagya, which is designed to improve the gross aspect of life, the body and all that relates to it in the world. The gross aspect of yagya establishes the duties of men belonging to different levels of evolution, living in different times, in different places and under different circumstances, so that they do not act against the laws of nature. This helps a man to evolve by virtue of whatever he does or experiences on the gross levels of life. The second section of the shakha is called 'Upasana Kanda' (Chapter of Worship) and deals with the subtler aspects of yagya, which win the blessings of the higher powers of nature, the Vedic gods. This section has its own gross and subtle aspects. The gross aspect deals with ritualistic performances to please different Vedic gods and win their blessings, while the subtle aspect deals wit)l training the mind to contact higher powers and receive their blessings upon all achievements in life. The main purpose of this section is to connect man with the more evolved beings in creation so that he may receive their goodwill, their blessings and their help in improving every aspect of his life. The third section of each shakha is called 'Gyana Kanda' (Chapter of Knowledge) and it contains the wisdom of eternal life. The Upanishads belong to this section. Each shakha has its own Upanishad to show the way of contacting Brahman, the ultimate Reality, for all those people to whom traditionally the teaching of that shakha applies. The wisdom of the Absolute and the way to transcend the relative fields of life and thereby infuse the divine nature into all spheres of human existence are dealt with in this section of each shakha. In this way, each Vedic shakha contains wisdom to shape the entire field of human life in such a way that all its aspects, physical, mental and spiritual, are perfectly co-ordinated with each other on every level and at the same time are in perfect harmony with the entire scheme of evolution. The aim is to lead every soul to the state of perfection, the highest and most exalted state of existence, God-consciousness. Such is the comprehensive scope of yagya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.10 In the beginning, having created men along with yagya, the Lord of Creation said: By this yagya shall ye prosper and this shall bring forth the fulfillment of desires. Yagya has been defined as action which helps evolution. It follows, therefore, that yagya ultimately leads man to the highest state of evolution, to realization of God. Every step of evolution is connected with yagya. Yagya thus upholds life from its beginning to its ultimate goal. This is what the Lord means when he says 'having created men along with yagya'. God is the source of all creation, and man's link with Him is through pure transcendental consciousness. Creation came out of this absolute level of Life, and the Creator proclaimed that It would be forever the source of all prosperity and advancement in life. By attuning the mind with It, one finds great intelligence, energy, happiness and harmony and, possessed of these, no limit to the fulfillment of desires. In this verse the Lord points to the prosperity of the individual as one result of yagya; in the following verse He goes on to show another of its advantages. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.11 Through yagya you sustain the gods and those gods will sustain you. By sustaining one another, you will attain the highest good. The various types of yagya expounded by the Vedas connect the individual with the entire process of cosmic evolution. Yagya thus has various levels of influence, ranging from the grossest to the subtlest states of creation, but always pointing towards the ultimate goal of God-consciousness. This verse explains the mechanics of the vast influence which one's actions create throughout the universe, all the laws of nature on the level of the doer react to every action. Yagya is regarded as the means to that complete success in life which consists of all possible achievements in the world together with freedom from bondage. Yagya, in fact, is a means to accomplish perfection of life. It brings the blessings of the powers which control and direct the evolution of the entire creation, wins the favour of almighty Nature and ultimately brings fulfillment in God-consciousness. Yagya is a process of bringing the individual into harmony with the stream of evolution, which enjoys the favour of all the forces of nature engaged in the advancement of life, individual and cosmic. The 'gods' mentioned here are the deities presiding over the innumerable laws of nature, which are present everywhere throughout relative life. They are the powers governing different impulses of intelligence and energy, working out the evolution of everything in creation. The existence of gods may be understood by an analogy: each of the myriad cells in the human body has its own level of life, energy and intelligence; together, these innumerable lives produce human life. A human being is like a god to all these small impulses of energy and intelligence, each with its own form, tendencies, sphere of activity and influence, working for the purpose of evolution. The Lord wishes that by way of yagya, the act of coming to the Transcendent, men should simultaneously please the world of gods. This is possible only if the means of gaining transcendental conciousness is such that the influence produced by it supports the stream of evolution and wins the favour of the deities presiding over the laws of nature, the gods. We take a word which produces such an influence of harmony in creation and experience its subtle states until the mind transcends even the subtlest and gains the state of transcendental consciousness. This is how the Lord wants us to create and maintain a mutual harmony with the higher powers of nature on the way to becoming one with the transcendental eternal Divine. When, through the practice of transcendental meditation, activity is realized as separate from the Self, then all of life's activity is said to have been given over as an offering to the gods. This means that activity continues in its sphere of relative life, over which the gods preside, while the Self remains in the freedom of the Absolute. This is the way to please all the gods through every activity at all times. A situation is created in which every activity automatically becomes a yagya. This manner of offering actions to the gods does not imply surrender to them or coming under their subjugation. The Self in this state becomes completely free from all the influences of relative life, including the gods. 'Highest good': the ritualistic aspect of yagya produces effects in the relative field of life; its highest attainment is heaven, the summit of the relative world, where life is free from suffering. The technique of transcending through the process of yagya, on the other hand, leads the individual to transcendental bliss-consciousness, The state of eternal freedom in life, and thence to God-consciousness, which is the 'highest good' of all, higher than the highest in the relative sphere of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.12 Satisfied by the yagya, the gods will certainly bestow the enjoyments you desire. But he who enjoys their gifts without offering to them is merely a thief. 'Without offering to them': without forgoing possession in their favour, without performing the act of transferring ownership to them. The fruit of every action is the response of nature to that action and is therefore nothing but the gift of the powers of nature, the gods. How is it possible to forgo possession of everything that we gain in life? It is possible only by putting into effect the teaching of verse 48 of Chapter II and realizing the Self as separate from the field of activity. When a man has become established in the state where he is aware that all things are separated from the Self, he has, in effect, given over all things completely to nature, or to the powers of nature, the gods. In this way, he has risen above the charge of theft made by this verse and is able to enjoy the advantage shown in the following verse. To create a mood of offering is to make a mockery of 'offering'. The teaching of this discourse is a teaching of practical life, it is a discourse of Yoga Shastra, the Scripture of Yoga, the science of Divine Union. Its truth is far removed from imagination or moodmaking. Unfortunately, owing to superficial interpretations current for many centuries, the essential teaching of this whole discourse has been greatly distorted, and society stands today surrounded by superstitions and lacking a proper sense of the values of life. The prosperity and happiness that arise from the blessings of the gods, gained by means of yagya, should not cause a man to become engrossed in enjoyment to the extent of forgetting the source of his prosperity. The Lord says that he who undermines the higher forces in nature by possessing himself of the field of action, which actually belongs to them, acts like a thief. This is because he has not realized his Self as detached from activity. Anyone who has not gained fixity in Being automatically remains involved with activity; he assumes authorship of action and obtains ownership of its fruit, which in reality belong to nature or to the gods, the powers of nature That is why such a man is called a 'thief', a usurper of possessions belonging to others. A thief commonly enjoys the wealth of other men but makes no attempt to grow wealthier by his own efforts. Here is the warning that the Lord gives: one should not be satisfied 'only with the growth of material prosperity, wisdom and creativity in the relative field of life, but should aspire to go beyond this and achieve oneness with the eternal life of absolute Being in God-consciousness. This is how one becomes established at the level of life underlying all creation and automatically produces life-supporting influences for all the powers of nature and, indeed, for everything that exists throughout all the gross and subtle strata of creation. Thus one begins to live the basic teaching of this verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.13 The righteous, who eat the remains of the yagya, are freed from all sins. But the unrighteous, who prepare food for themselves alone, truly, they eat sin. Remains of the yagya': that which is left over after the performance of a yagya has come to an end. Yagya is action which furthers evolution, from the waking state of consciousness to transcendental consciousness, from transcendental consciousness to cosmic consciousness, from cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness. These are the different states which develop through different types of practices. Each practice in itself is a performance of yagya. Evolution finds ultimate fulfillment in God-consciousness, and once this is gained the goal of yagya has been attained. That is why 'the remains of the yagya' in its highest sense refers to the state of God-consciousness. The state of cosmic consciousness, which forms the basis of God-consciousness, may also be said to be the remains of a yagya. So may the state of transcendental consciousness, which forms the basis of cosmic consciousness. That which is left over after the performance of the yagya of transcendental meditation is bliss-consciousness. This is the remains of the first and fundamental yagya on the path to God-consciousness and forms the basis of cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness; he who partakes of it is 'righteous', says the Lord, because in this state his life is transformed into a life without wrong, a life that is wholly righteous. It is in this state that through every thought, word and action, he creates life-supporting influences for himself and for the whole creation, because he is established in eternal Being, the basis of all life in creation. Transcendental consciousness being the remains of the fundamental yagya, transcendental meditation is the most important of the yagyas. The wise man, established in bliss-consciousness, is free from any sinful attitude because of the inner contentment which he experiences in the state of absolute consciousness. In contrast, the Lord describes those who concern themselves only with the affairs of their petty individuality and do not attempt to gain the unbounded status of the Absolute. Moved by their selfish thought, they forgo the chance of higher evolution; blinded by selfishness, their joys are only in the field of the senses. The Lord says they commit sin who do not work for their connection with the higher powers of nature or for their own evolution. Here is the technique for rising above the influence of all sin. It is, as Lord Krishna puts it, to 'eat the remains of the yagya'. This is a metaphor explaining that the states of transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness should be made use of in daily life, so that actions may be free from sin. The Lord means that if the mind has not completed the course of yagya - if it has not taken a dive into the Self and has not become connected with absolute Being, if it has not realized the Self as separate from activity, if it has not attained God-consciousness, then it is not attuned to cosmic Being and its activity is not attuned to the cosmic purpose. Therefore actions are not wholly in harmony with the process of evolution. Under these circumstances there is no certainty that a man's activity will be wholly right; there is always the possibility of an element of sin. Even in the state of cosmic consciousness, before God-consciousness has been attained, every action fulfils the cosmic purpose and serves as a yagya. But if one has not yet attained cosmic consciousness and created a situation where the Self is lived as separate from activity, then one's activity will not be graceful; it will be gripped by individuality, it will not have been set free to become universal. Such activity does not belong to the dignity of cosmic life. When those who have not realized Being as separate from activity engage in action, they appropriate the action to themselves and in so doing are taking something which does not belong to them, something which belongs to a realm outside the self, belongs to cosmic life. They fall within the category of thieves (Verse 12) and partake of what, in the present verse, is called 'sin'. The self, then, has no right to usurp activity, because activity belongs to cosmic life. There is also a further consideration. Activity thus usurped will actually damage the self by overshadowing its nature The overshadowing of the true nature of the self, bliss-consciousness, is the basis of all suffering, and that which causes suffering is called sin. For this reason the present verse also speaks of the association of the self with activity as 'sin', ignorance is sin. Only when a man has,become permanently established in the eternal freedom of absolute Being is he 'freed from all sins'. Such a man alone is a 'righteous' man, a man who is always right. Through all his activity he produces life-supporting influences in nature because, having gained freedom from activity, his actions belong to the dignity of cosmic life. They fulfill the cosmic purpose of evolution; that is why they never fall into the realm of sin. This is what the Lord means when he uses the word 'righteous'. If a man has not become 'righteous', if he has not placed his life in tune with the cosmic life of absolute Being, then he may be committing sin in everything he does. The only way out of the field of sin, or the binding influence of karma, is to come under the influence of the eternal freedom of absolute Being. This is the subtlest level of the message of this verse. At its more obvious levels it refers to the gross fields of life, which demand ritualistic performances of yagya for their development. The quality of the mind depends upon the qualities of various factors, such as food and environment and the experiences, past and present, which have an effect upon it. The quality of food directly affects the quality of the mind. It depends on many factors, such as the materials themselves and the manner in which they were earned, whether this was legal or illegal, and also the manner of cooking and its purpose. Here the Lord lays emphasis on the purpose of cooking the food. He says that if the food is cooked to be offered to God and eaten by a man after the offering has been performed, then the man enjoys the blessings of God by means of that food; and thus the mind produced by such food will be pious, progressive and graceful. Such a mind will certainly be quite naturally outside the sphere of sin. The contrary will be true, however, if the food is prepared without the purpose of making the offering, but with the sole intention of satisfying the man's own hunger. In the following verse the Lord gives a graded sequence of creation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.14 From food creatures come into being; from rain is produced food; from yagya comes forth rain and yagya is born of action. 'From food creatures come into being': the Lord says that individual life is born of food, implying that it has little to do with divine Being, which is the Self of all; it is born of food, of nourishment that does not belong to the field of Being. Ego, intellect, mind, senses and body belong to the relative field of existence. 'Food' likewise is born of rain, which again has little to do with divine Being. 'Yagya' has been considered in the previous verses as the process whereby the Self comes to be experienced as separate from activity. In this state of realization, activity is completely natural and perfectly attuned to the cosmic purpose of creation and evolution. As such, it produces a life-supporting influence in every field of creation and as a result the whole of nature remains harmonious. The sun shines in due time, rain falls in due time, and all the seasons remain regular. This is how yagya comes to be regarded as a cause of rain which, in turn, is responsible for the production of food. 'Yagya is born of action': it is through action that a yagya is performed. Yagya is a performance or an activity of a specific nature whereby one becomes united with cosmic Being. This is the true meaning of yagya in the present context of a discourse on Yoga. But this interpretation should not be understood as detracting from the truth of Vedic action, the performance of the Vedic rites, known as yagya. The Vedas prescribe certain ritualistic performances by certain competent people to produce certain life-supporting influences in nature. This also results in gaining the sympathy of the laws of nature by creating an influence of harmony in the atmosphere and maintaining the rhythm of nature, so that rain comes in due time for the production of food. Naturally this type of yagya too 'is born of action', has action for its basis. The more gross aspect of yagya, that is, performance of rites and rituals to please the higher forces of nature for the sake of material well-being, needs action in the gross field of life for its accomplishment. Likewise, the more subtle aspect of yagya, which is the process of contacting the transcendental divine Absolute, needs action in the subtle fields. This action 5n the subtle aspect of life is the process of transcendental meditation, whereby the mind travels through all the subtler levels of existence and transcends the subtlest level of manifested life to reach the state of absolute Being. This explains why the glory of action is emphasized here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.15 Know action to be born of Brahma (the Vedas). Brahma springs from the Imperishable. Therefore the all-pervading Brahma is ever established in yagya. It has been said in the previous verse that 'yagya is born of action'. Here the Lord says that action (karma) and all knowledge of it is contained in the Vedas, and that the Vedas are an expression of eternal life. The Vedas expound the theory of action and everything pertaining to it, its causes and its effects. This is the first reason why the Lord says that action arises out of the Veda. The second is understood when we discover the origin of the Veda in the unmanifested transcendental divine Being. The first manifestation of creatibn is the self-illuminant effulgence of life. This is the field of established intellect, or the individual ego in its own established state This self-illuminant effulgence of life is called the Veda. The second step in the process of manifestation is the rise of what we call vibration, which brings out the attributes of prakriti, or Nature, the three gunas. This point marks the beginning of the functioning of the ego. Here experience begins in a very subtle form: the trinity of the experiencer, the experienced, and the process of experience comes into existence. This is the beginning of action in the process of creation. Just before the beginning of action, just before the beginning of the subtlest vibration, in that self-illuminant state of existence, lies the source of creation, the storehouse of limitless energy. This source of creation is the Veda, the field of almost absolute intelligence which underlies and pervades all activity responsible for the creation and evolution of life. This, being the source of all creation, is said to be Brahma, the Creator. Brahma, or the Veda, is naturally the source of all activity. That is why the verse says: 'Know action to be born of Brahma'. Yagya is that which helps evolution. It is a way to all accomplishment in life. Extending the meaning of yagya to the fields of common life, it could be said that any action that helps evolution can be called yagya. Thus we find that every yagya is permeated with, and gives rise to, some degree of divine consciousness, In its higher aspect, yagya is the way to cosmic consciousness and ultimately to fulfillment of life in God-consciousness; in its lower, it is the performance of rites and rituals to win the favour of the gods. This is the complete conception of yagya. Certainly the Divine is omnipresent and is therefore present in a latent form even in those things which are opposed to evolution. But the Lord says here that divine consciousness, the Brahma, is present in yagya. He does not say that divine consciousness is present in actions other than yagya. Every orange is meant to contain juice, but a shrivelled orange does not yield any. So it is said that lulce is present in a fresh orange. Even a shrivelled orange has juice, but because this cannot be extracted, such an orange is not considered when lulce is wanted. Likewise divine consciousness can be developed through those types of action which help evolution. It cannot be developed through sinful or impious actions, which tend to make the mind coarse and lead to inertia. This robs the mind of its ability to transcend relativity and attain divine consciousness. That is why the Lord says that actions which fall into the category of yagya carry divine consciousness in them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.16 He who in this life does not follow the wheel thus set revolving, whose life is sinful, whose contentment lies in the senses, he lives in vain, O Partha. 'The wheel thus set revolving': life passes through different spheres of existence, gross and subtle, and by this means the process of evolution is carried out. The beginning of life is in the unmanifested pure consciousness, 'the Imperishable' of the previous verse. If a man remains always in the field of the senses and fails to reach the source of his being, if his mind does not travel from gross, to subtle in order to realize that Imperishable, the ultimate source of all creation, 'he lives in vain'. He has not made use of the opportunity of enjoying that great happiness which lies beyond the range of the senses; he has not traversed the whole field of life; he has not gone from origin back to origin; he 'does not follow the wheel thus set revolving'. He has committed sin against himself and sin against God, because he has failed to rise to fulfillment. Therefore the Lord says that his 'life is sinful'. One who has realized life through all the subtle and gross layers of existence and lives the ultimate Being through all actions, who lives fulfillment in God-consciousness, can be said to have followed the 'wheel' of creation, he has gone to That whence he came. In the following verses, the Lord brings out in detail the state of one who is enjoying this full life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.17 But the man whose delight is in the Self alone, who is content in the Self, who rejoices only in the Self, for him there is no action that he need do. 'The man': one who is firmly established in the Self, the eternal Being, and is not involved with anything else; who has realized Being as separate from the field of activity and is always detached from everything other than 'his own Self; who, despite any activity on the surface of life, eternally remains in the awareness of the Self; who, living through the relative states of consciousness, waking, dreaming and sleeping, is ever established in the absolute state of consciousness, the state of Being, the awareness of Self. All actions that a man performs are prompted by the desire to accomplish something and to enjoy it. When he reaches the field of absolute bliss-consciousness, that state which is the fulfillment of all desires, he becomes filled with lasting contentment, for the purpose of all desires and actions is achieved. This is why the Lord says that 'for him there is no action that he need do'. Does he then cease to act? The Lord answers in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.18 Neither has he any profit to gain in this life from the actions he has done or from the actions he has not done; nor is there any living creature on whom he need rely for any purpose. The man who is thus contented in himself certainly continues to act in the world, but his behavior has become natural behavior. It is no longer motivated by selfish desires, nor is its effectiveness disturbed by any shortcomings that might arise from dullness on his part. This comes about because he has fulfilled the purpose of all possible desires and all possible actions in his life. He now engages himself in actions motivated not by selfish individuality but by cosmic purpose. Through him works the divine intelligence, for he has become a fitting instrument to carry out the divine plan in the world Such a life is a natural life. It is the result of the established intellect. This verse has generally been thought to advocate desireless action arrived at by creating a mental sense of disinterestedness in action but this interpretation is wrong. Such a sense of disinterestedness has no bearing on the realization of either Self-consciousness, cosmic consciousness, or God-consciousness, nor does it in any way add to effectiveness in life. It can only weaken all phases of life, material, mental and spiritual. In the next verse the Lord emphasizes the validity of action for the integration of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.19 Therefore, remaining unattched, always do the action worthy of performance. Engaging in action truly unattached, man attains to the Supreme. Therefore, says the Lord, uninvolved as you are, detached as you are, forever separated as you naturally are from the field of action, perform 'action worthy of performance'. The Lord demands action in the state of freedom and proclaims that freedom is there, natural to man, man's life is already in liberation. No effort is needed for the attainment of freedom; it is already there. The doctrine of Karma Yoga, then, only asks man to be in his natural and normal state of Self-consciousness, to be in his own nature. The Lord, indeed, advises him to act, and this advice is in order to cultivate liberation in God-consciousness. The mind, moved by its own nature to enjoy more, flows towards the subtler fields of experience during transcendental meditation and most spontaneously attains the state of Being. Activity after this state of Being is gained is likewise spontaneously carried out by nature. Therefore the development of cosmic consciousness, which forms the basis of the supreme attainment of God-consciousness, is a natural process, free from effort. 'The Supreme': God, presiding over the relative and the Absolute in the fullness of both. This verse reminds us of the 47th verse of the second chapter. The Lord reveals the significance of unrestricted, natural action on the way to the realization of God-consciousness. The previous verses brought out man's ability to act in a natural manner by virtue of possessing cosmic consciousness. The present verse shows that performance of action in an unstrained, natural manner is a means of realizing 'the Supreme'. In the state of cosmic consciousness the validity of action is accepted for the sake of developing God-consciousness. This verse should be studied very carefully in order to understand the means by which God-consciousness may be attained. The means should not be confused with the end. Cosmic consciousness, in which the Self is experienced as separate from activity, is not the end, not the final state of development; it is a means to God-consciousness. When, through meditation, the mind has reached transcendental Self-consciousness and then returns from the field of absolute Being, it becomes necessary for it to engage in activity. In this way the nature of transcendental Being, infused into the mind, has an opportunity of maintaining itself even when the mind is engaged in experiencing the relative field of life through the senses. This is how one remains permanently established in Self-consciousness and thereby enjoys life in cosmic consciousness. This is how, by virtue of action, the transcendental divine nature is infused into practical life, making a man fully integrated, so that he acts in the relative field of existence while remaining established in absolute Being. In this state of contentment his actions are natural and normal, 'worthy of performance'. When, in the state of cosmic consciousness, the Self has been realized as separate from all activity, 'the action worthy of performance' is action in devotion to God. The activity of devotion is the highest and most refined type of activity, fbr it directly raises the awareness of separateness of Being from activity, as experienced in the state of cosmic consciousness, to a unified state of awareness of God alone. The awareness of Self and of activity, the awareness of the two, gives way to oneness in the awareness of God, in God-consciousness. The duality of the Self and activity finds itself pervaded by God. He alone remains, He alone dominates life,. and in the light of Him, permeated by Him, the Self stands in Unity with Him and with the whole field of action dominated by Him. In Him are found united forever both the Self and the activity of cosmic consciousness. This is the state of life in the oneness of God-consciousness expressed by the words 'attains to the Supreme' in this verse which extols action in the state of cosmic consciousness. Action worthy of performance may be considered on five different levels of life: one, during the ordinary waking state of consciousness; two, when Self-consciousness has been gained and is developing into cosmic consciousness; three, action in the state of cosmic consciousness; four, action which helps cosmic consciousness to develop into God-consciousness; and five, action in the state of God-consciousness. This verse is concerned with the last three levels of action. The expression 'worthy of performance' lays emphasis upon the quality of the action which is helpful for gaining the higher states of consciousness. One who has realized the Self in transcendental consciousness, who has realized the Self as completely separate from activity in cosmic consciousness, and who has gained fulfillment by realizing the Self in Union with God in God-consciousness, has reached the state where the purpose of all' activity has been fulfilled. Because his self is fixed in the universal Self, there is nothing that he could gain from another. His Self is uninvolved in every way, it is uninvolved with activity (verse 17) and it is uninvolved with the selves of individual beings (verse 18). His own Self is the Self of all beings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.20 By action alone, indeed, Janaka and others gained perfection. Moreover, even looking to the welfare of the world, you shouId perform action. This verse extols action for its value to the world and as a means to eternal liberation from bondage. At the same time it illustrates with concrete examples the abstract principles of Karma Yoga and their effects. It was the glory of action that brought integration of life in God-consciousness to 'Janaka and others' and enabled them to do good to the world. Integration of life depends upon the mind passing in a cycle between the field of the Absolute and the field of activity. The mind goes to the unmanifest and comes back to the manifest, thus experiencing both fields of life, absolute and relative This is the state of the integrated man in cosmic consciousness. When King Janaka and others like him were found to be established in Reality while fully active in the world, the secret did not lie in their continuous outward activity. It lay in the fact that such activity was supplemented by their experience of the Transcendent through the inward activity of meditation. If we consider the march of the mind from gross outward activity to the Transcendent, we can say that it is activity in the direction of putting an end to activity that gives the mind the status of the Absolute. Meditation itself is an activity. In view of this, it can certainly be held that it is 'action alone' that brings perfection. The Self is omnipresent and eternal. It does not need anything to realize Itself. Man loses It by remaining in the field of activity. Therefore in order to realize It, he has simply to come out of activity, to engage himself in subtler fields of activity until he is completely out of the field of activity, in the field of the Transcendent. This explains the principle of enlightenment through action. As a direct result of this inward activity of meditation, outward activity in the world becomes more successful, more perfect. This is what the Lord means when He says: 'By action alone, indeed, Janaka and others gained perfection'. Every action starts from the subtlest stratum of relative life, which is almost one with the level of the Absolute, with pure Being. It starts as a thought. The thought itself passes through many stages from the subtle to the gross. At a certain stage it reaches that level of the mind where it is consciously appreciated as a thought, and it may then be translated into speech or action. Through the practice of transcendental meditation, the thought begins to be appreciated at a subtler level. Here it is more powerful and results in more successful action. Thus, by direct experience of transcendental Being through the inward stroke of action during meditation, a man not only gains spiritual freedom but also greater success in the world. The contentment and serenity gained through this action of meditation produce harmonious and life-supporting influences for the whole world. By raising man's consciousness, they fill his heart with universal love, which induces him the work for 'the welfare of the world' in a most natural 2vay. It should be remembered that it does not need a long time of silent meditation to reach transcendental Being: just a dive within the Self for a few minutes and the mind is infused with the nature of pure consciousness, which keeps it enriched through all the activities of the day. This is the way to live the spiritual life, which makes glorious even the physical and material aspects of life in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.21 Whatsoever a great man does, the very same is also done by other men. Whatever the standard he sets, the world follows it. A great man is he who lives the awareness of Being in his daily life and has gained a state in which he naturally maintains his high status of eternal Being even when engaged in activity and in doing good to others. This verse describes the tendency of the masses to follow the example of evolved men. At the same time, it touches Arjuna's pride. In this lies the great skill of the discourse. Although indirectly stated, the idea is conveyed to Arjuna that he is venerated in society, and that people will follow his example. Therefore he has a responsibility which extends beyond the limits of his own interest. For the evolution of his own soul, Arjuna is expected to stand up and engage in activity. And even should he not care about his own evolution, it behoves him to embrace activity for the sake of others. The following verses throw more light on this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.22 in the three worlds there is no action which I need do, O Partha; nor is there for Me anything worth achieving unattained; even so I am engaged in action. Having mentioned 'Janaka and others' in verse 20, the Lord here points to Himself as an example to illustrate the principle affirmed in verse 2l. He speaks from His absolute state of eternal contentment . Having brought to light the importance of action in man's evolution, and having shown the authenticity of this principle by citing the example of men who lived perfection in life through action, the Lord now reveals the validity of action in the pure field of the Divine, which is completely free from activity in the relative field. It may be explained that whereas man in the state of enlightenment lives fully both activity and divine consciousness because his life has two aspects, relative and absolute, there is no trace of relativity in the pure transcendent divine field of the Lord. Nevertheless, the Lord says that He is 'engaged in action'. The supreme Lord of creation, presiding over the absolute and the relative fields of life and the refuge of both, is 'engaged in action', the divine activity that underlies the continuity of ever-changing creation. When the Lord speaks about Himself and the three worlds, He addresses Arjuna as 'Partha' to maintain the fine bond of love between Himself and Arjuna. This is skill in teaching. Arjuna should see Lord Krishna as close to himself and not far off as a high ideal beyond his reach. By 'the three worlds' is meant the entire field of relative existence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.23 What if I did not continue unwearyingly in activity, O Partha? Men in every way follow My example. The Lord means to convince Arjuna of the truth of the great principle that there can be no escape from duty without setting a sinful example in which the whole of society will be involved. Moreover, the Lord points out that His own incessant activity lies at the root of all life. The entire creation is the manifested aspect of His unmanifested Being. Remaining unmanifested, He manifests Himself, and this action of manifestation expresses itself as creation. His continued activity is responsible for the maintenance and evolution of everything that exists; without it the entire creation would be reduced to nothingness. This is how the Lord explains His perpetual activity, quoting it as an example to be followed by others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.24 If I did not engage in action, these worlds would perish and I wouId be the cause of confusion and of the destruction of these people. The principle elaborated in the previous three verses is again emphasized, and a point is brought out similar to that raised by Arjuna in the 39th to the 45th verses of the first chapter. In these verses Arjuna had said that by fighting he would be causing the disruption of society. In this verse, the Lord, by referring to Himself, turns the tables on Arjuna. He brings home clearly to him by His own example that if he does not engage in action he will corrupt the whole of society, and that his bad example will be responsible for allowing its values to be destroyed. The conclusion is that even if a man has gained fulfillment in his own life, it behoves him to act for others. This idea is brought out very clearly in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.25 As the unwise act out of their attachment to action, O Bharata, so should the wise act, but without any attachment, desiring the welfare of the world. The Lord shows Arjuna that there is absolutely no difference between the action of an ignorant man and that of one who is enlightened; action is action whether performed by the ignoranant or the enlightened. The difference is found only in the result. The result of an ignorant man's action is enjoyed by himself and concerns mainly himself, because he is attached to it; when the doer is attached to the action, the result of the action is naturally attached to the doer. But when the doer is not attached to the action, the results are not attached to him. The ignorant man acts and benefits from the results of his actions; since he is attached to these results, they make a deep impression on him. The effects of the enlightened man's actions spread out in the world and everything benefits from them; the impression of the result passes him by, leaving him free from the bondage of action because he has realized the Self as separate from activity and acts from the basis of eternal contentment. His actions are in response to the needs of the time; they fulfill the demands of their surroundings. The wise are tools in the hands of the Divine; they innocently carry out the divine plan. Their actions arise from their desire for 'the welfare of the world'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.26 Let not the wise man create a division in the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action. Established in Being, he should direct them to perform all actions, duly engaging in them himself. 'Let not the wise man create a division in the minds of the ignorant': the state of a realized man is the result of many years of inner development founded on right values in life This causes his life to flow naturally in right channels of conduct. Although his Being is above the realms of right and wrong, his actions are quite naturally right actions. He is advised in this verse to allow the ignorant man to do his duty. He should refrain from telling him that the state of enlightenment is free from both good and evil, and that the whole field of relativity is just the play of the three gunas, which do not belong to his Being. It is perhaps even more important that the wise man should not confuse the ignorant by telling him about the uninvolved nature of the Self The intellect of the man who is not realized is wholly involved with activity. The realized should not create a division in such a man's mind. He should not talk to him of the separateness of the Self from activity, otherwise the ignorant man may lose interest in practical life, and if this happens he will never be able to gain realization. It is not the intellectual understanding of the separateness of the Divine and of activity, but rather the experience of this state which brings a man enlightenment. In order that one may gain this experience and become established in it, conscious activity both in the gross and subtle fields of life is necessary. The Lord exhorts the wise: Teach transcendental meditation to the ignorant man so that he may engage himself in subtler phases of activity and thereby realize the transcendent Being, the Self, in Its true nature as devoid of any activity. Teach him that, having gained this realization, he should continue to act in daily life so that it may become firmly established in the very nature of his mind. And then set him an example by 'duly engaging' in actions yourself. 'All actions': every type of activity is necessary for life in the world, activity of the ego, intellect, mind and body. All activity, gross and subtle, in every field of life, has its place in the scheme of one's evolution. Activity at more subtle levels is the activity of the thought-process. During meditation, the process of experience becomes at every moment more and more refined, and eventually the mind transcends the finest level of activity. The Lord implies that this finer activity also should not be ignored in the midst of the gross activity of thinking, speaking and acting. It is given to the wise to see that all activity, gross and subtle, is undertaken by every man in society in due proportion, the activity of daily life should be supplemented by morning and evening meditations. 'All actions' should not be taken to include wrong actions. This has been shown in verses 8 and g. The following verses present Lord Krishna's justification for the performance of all right activity by the ignorant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.27 Actions are in every case performed by the gunas of Nature. He whose mind is deluded by the sense of 'I' hoIds 'l am the doer'. This verse reveals the doer of all actions and provides a graceful answer to the question which naturally presents itself when, through the practice of transcendental meditation, one begins to live in bliss-consciousness, begins to feel self-contained. How can action, which is always motivated by some desire, be possible in the state of complete contentment? The answer to this question is: 'Actions are in every case performed by the gunas'. Sattva, rajas and tamas are the three gunas of Nature (prakriti). Prakriti is the primal motive force It is the essential constituent of manifested creation and is at the basis of all activity. This is what the Lord means when He says that all actions and all happenings in creation arise out of the three gunas and their permutations and combinations. How the gunas interact may be made clear by an example. It is a natural law that when a vacuum is created somewhere in the atmosphere, at once a flow begins from an area of greater pressure. But while the flow starts from the area of greater pressure, the cause lies in the vacuum. It is the vacuum that creates the situation. Similarly, the currents of the three gunas flow in order to keep a balance among themselves. They continually flow from one field of existence to another and in this way create and maintain various activities in a natural way. The entire phenomenal world is nothing but the interplay of the three gunas. The gunas find an expression, for instance, in the metabolic processes of the body, and on their basis feelings of hunger and thirst arise. The need for food and water is in the physiological sphere, but the ego feels 'I am hungry', 'I am thirsty'. The gunas are responsible in a similar way for all experience. They are the basis of all events and activities, but the ego takes these upon itself and feels 'I am acting'. As long as the Self has not been experienced as separate from activity, the mind remains 'deluded' about its own status and its relationship with activity; associating itself with the nature of the gunas, it assumes the authorship of action, which actually belongs to the gunas. This is how, through ignorance of his own Self, man falls into the bondage of action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.28 But he who knows the truth about the divisions of the gunas and their actions, O mighty-armed, knowing that it is the gunas which act upon the gunas, remains unattached. This verse, in contrast to the preceding verse, shows the state of mind of the man who is realized, and at the same time provides insight into the process of realization through knowledge of the three gunas. There are three gunas which constitute prakriti. Prakriti is eight-fold. This gives rise to the 24 basic divisions in the field of the gunas. Knowledge of these 24 divisions and their actions liberates man from the bondage of action by showing how both the subjective and objective aspects of our life emanate from the gunas, and how the Self is eternally uninvolved with anything in the manifested field of life. The path of liberation from bondage here laid out has the following significant features: 1. The knowledge has to be thorough and comprehensive, for the Lord says: 'he who knows the truth'. 2 The knowledge has to be about (a) 'the gunas' (b) their 'divisions' (c) their 'actions'. 3 The knowledge has also to be about the interplay of the gunas; one has to know that the gunas are themselves the subject, are themselves the object and are themselves the subject-object relationship, and that they constitute the entirety of phenomenal existence. For the Lord says: 'it is the gunas which act upon the gunas'. Having, in the previous verse, attributed the authorship of action to the three gunas, the Lord, in this verse, says that he who knows the truth about the gunas and their actions 'remains unattached'. The question may be asked: Is intellectual understanding of the gunas sufficient to bring freedom? If intellectual understanding could fulfill the conditions of knowledge given above, then, according to this verse, it could certainly make a man sufficiently 'unattached' to become completely free. But it is doubtful if the 'truth' about the three gunas and their interplay can be known only on the level of intellectual understanding, without directly comprehending the nature of the gunas at the subtlest level of creation. The question then arises: What is the way to such direct comprehension? The answer is simple. The gunas are the finest aspect of creation. Therefore if a man could take his attention to the subtlest level of creatibn, it would be possible for him to know what the gunas are, their divisions, and all details concerning their actions. In fact, all this knowledge is gained during transcendental meditation when the mind is about to transcend the subtlest state of the object of attention. Consequently, the Lord's saying: 'he who knows the truth about... the gunas' may be said to include in its scope the teaching: 'Be without the three gunas', for this is the way of knowing 'the truth' at the subtlest level of creation. Once established in transcendental consciousness, the state without the three gunas, the knower of Reality knows by experience that the realm of action lies at the surface of his life and is separate from his real existence Thus 'he who knows the truth' does not mean only he who knows 'the divisions of the gunas and their actions', but also he who has realized the Self as separate from activity. This natural state of separation from action, gained through the practice of transcendental meditation, is the basis of his remaining 'unattached'. When the state of Being, or pure consciousness, is firmly established in time very nature of the mind, one lives quite naturally this state of pure existence separated from the field of activity, even while ego, intellect, mind and senses are engaged in action. One finds that the field of activity remains in the province of the three gunas and is no longer intimately connected with one's existence. This is how one naturally 'remains unattached' in the midst of activity. This state of knowledge fills the whole field of one's understanding. That is why the Lord says: 'knowing that it is the gunas which act upon the gunas, remains unattached'. The present verse speaks of action in terms of freedom through the knowledge of 5ankhya, but as this knowledge gains completeness only through the process of direct experience, it is inclusive of the technique and philosophy of Yoga. Therefore the Lord, in this verse, brings together the philosophies of Sankhya and Yoga, described separately in the second chapter, and initiates a principle of liberation from the bondage of karma resulting from the combined effect of the two teachings. This provides the basis of Karma Yoga and the essentials for its fulfillment. The whole purpose of this verse, even though it speaks in terms of the gunas, is to throw light on the state of fullness of life in absolute bliss-consciousness, jivan-mukti. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.29 Those deluded by the gunas of Nature are attached to the actions of the gunas. Let not him who knows the whole disturb the ignorant who know only the part. Again the Lord warns the enlightened man not to thrust his understanding of life upon the unenlightened. The reason for this is that the enlightened man, established in Being, has a permanent ground on which to stand; from this he sees the world as the interplay of the three gunas and knows by experience that the effects of sattva, rajas and tamas have no bearing on him. But if an ignorant man tries to copy the state of the enlightened in his own life, then he will create confusion in his behavior, and his action may fall into a pattern in which the validity of good and evil in the field of practical life is undermined. Such a man will prove useful neither to himself nor to others. After committing a theft, the unenlightened man might say that it was only the three gunas reacting among themselves, while his Self was uninvolved, so that he is not responsible. He has not done anything! This is why the Lord warns the enlightened not to reveal the inner state of their mind to the ignorant. The inference is that if the enlightened man wants to bless one who is ignorant, he should meet him on the level of his ignorance and try to lift him up from there by giving him lhe key to transcending, so that he may gain bliss-consciousness and experience the Reality of life He should not tell him about the level of the realized, because it would only confuse him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.30 Surrendering all actions to Me by maintaining your consciousness in the Self, freed from longing and the sense of 'mine', fight, delivered from the fever (of delusion). As the whole of creation is the play of the three gunas, the Lord tells Arjuna to contact the source of the three gunas. By bringing the attention to transcendental consciousness arrd becoming established in that field of Being, He says, you will be freed from all activities and their influence In that state of freedom and contentment, stand up and fight. This verse is complementary to verse 28 because the knowledge of relativity gains fulfillment in the realization of the Supreme. Furthermore, even for the complete knowledge of the three gunas, which form the basis of the whole creation, a thorough intimacy with the Creator is essential. 'Fever (of delusion)': 'the Lord reminds Arjuna of the bewilderment which he expressed in verse 2. 'Freed from longing': because one has gained fulfillment in life (verses 17 and l8). 'Freed from . . the sense of &quot;mine&quot;': when one has gained Union with Being and disunion from the field of activity (verses 27 and 28), the 'I' ceases to assume authorship of actions and therefore ceases to be bound by their fruits. All action is automatically passed on to the Lord of creation. During the inward stroke of meditation, one gains a clear experience of transcendent Being. With repeated practice of transcending, one experiences one's Self as aloof from activity and recognizes It as non-doer, even though one is engaged in action. In this state one attributes all activity to the power of the Almighty underlying the gunas, their divisions and their actions (verse 28). One remains fixed in the Self, while the Lord is recognized as the author of all actions, carrying them out through the agency of the gunas. The steps by which this state is attained are as follows: through the practice of transcendental meditation one first experiences the Self, or Being, and then, as a result of this experience becoming deeper and clearer, one experiences the separateness of Being from activity. Again, as this experience of separateness becomes deeper and clearer, one is enlightened by knowledge about the mechanics of activity (verses 23, 24, 27, 28). This knowledge reveals one's own true position in the scheme of things and one's relationship with activity and with the Lord of all creation. This provides one with a sound basis for eternal life in God-consciousness. The glory of the present discourse is this: direct connection with God is established for ever by virtue of one's having gained proficiency in the art of action. Surrender of all actions to God is the living Reality of one's life. It is not a fanciful thought or a mood of surrender. It is the Truth of one's life in activity. The range of surrender is not restricted to any one aspect of life: it comprehends all spheres of one's existence, physical, mental and spiritual. Therefore it certainly includes the mind and the intellect. But to regard this state of surrender of action to God as merely an act of the mind, a thought or feeling, will be to do injustice to the principle brought to light by this verse. 'Maintaining your consciousness in the Self' means maintaining Self-consciousness while performing action. Maintenance of transcendental Self-consciousness along with activity in the waking state of consciousness requires co-existence of the two states of consciousness. The ability of man's nervous system, which is the physical machinery through which consciousness expresses itself, has to be developed to express these two states simultaneously. This is brought about by regularly interrupting the constant activity of the waking state of consciousness with periods of silence in transcendental consciousness. When, through this practice, the nervous system has been permanently conditioned to maintain these two states together, then the consciousness remains always centered in the Self. The Lord explains that this centering of consciousness in the Self is the way of 'surrendering all actions to Me'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.31 Those men who are possessed of faith, who do not find fault and always follow this teaching of Mine, they too are liberated from action. The teaching of the previous verse was directed to Arjuna himself, for the Lord said to him: 'fight'. The present verse extends the teaching to all men at all times. 'Possessed of faith' means that faith is unwavering, that it is permanent. When a man has become fixed in faith, he is freed from doubt and therefore ceases to find fault. Not finding fault and not speaking ill of others is counted an essential pre-requisite to the realization of God and freedom from bondage. When a man speaks ill of others, he partakes of the sins of those of whom he speaks. Such a man thus draws more and more bad influence to himself; that is, he falls deeper into impurity. Here the Lord means: Those who are devoted and who feel full in themselves do not find fault with Me or My teaching, they are released from bondage. The benefits of the teaching are gained only when one begins to practice it. The teaching of the Lord in the previous three verses is so complete that its practice can result in nothing less than the fulfillment of life. It may be that one is not able to grasp the scope and significance of the teaching intellectually, but those who practice it faithfully, even without understanding it, 'they too are liberated from action', they too realize that eternal contentment in bliss-consciousness which establishes the Self as separate from activity and thereby brings fulfillment in God-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.32 But those who find fault and do not follow My teaching: know them to be deluded about all knowledge, doomed and senseless. The Lord's words are plain and effective. 'Those who find fault' do so because, failing to understand, they begin to misunderstand. They 'do not follow My teaching' means that they do not understand it and do not put it into practice; they do not investigate the nature of the three gunas or the Reality which lies beyond. 'Deluded about all knowledge' means confused about the knowledge of relative existence and about the nature of absolute'Reality. 'All knowledge': knowledge about the divisions of the gunas and their actions (verses 27 and 28), knowledge about the Self as separate from the field of action (verses 17 and 18), knowledge about the great Lord of all creation presiding over the absolute field of the Self, or Being, and over the relative field of the gunas (verses 30 and 31) and knowledge about the activity of the Lord (verses 22 and 23). 'Doomed': the purpose of their life is lost. They cannot find worldly fulfillment and they are lost to the Divine. They fail to live bliss-consciousness and so remain in suffering. 'Senseless': without proper values in life and devoid of pure consciousness. They have not attained the state of Being. They have not experienced the Self as separate from activity; their self is involved in activity, it is not in its own nature. For this reason the Lord says that they are 'senseless', as if without life, without consciousness. In this verse the Lord declares that realization of the state of all knowledge is the only way to salvation and success in life; there is no other way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.33 Creatures follow their own nature. Even the enlightened man acts according to his own nature. What can restraint accomplish? This verse brings out the truth that freedom from bondage is gained in a natural manner. The Lord denies the validity of control on the path of enlightenment. He means to introduce a natural way of life for fulfillment. In the field of activity, it is not desirable to create stress and strain by attempting control either from within or from without. Let everyone proceed naturally, complementing the state of transcendental consciousness gained during meditation with the activity of daily routine, and so be sure to win fulfillment. Because the natural tendency of the mind is towards greater happiness, it will inevitably find contentment in the supreme happiness that is transcendental bliss-consciousness and will rise above 'attachment' (verse 74), which is the basis of bondage. In condemning 'restraint', the Lord, in this verse, advises Arjuna to take things easily and not strain even to follow the teaching. Restraint, being unnatural, cannot bring about that natural state of life where the Self' stands by Itself in the state of non-attachment, uninvolved with activity. Having said in the previous verse: 'know them to be deluded about all knowledge', the Lord, in this verse, gives the clue to all knowledge: in order to 'be 'liberated from action' (verse 31) it is not necessary to use 'restraint'; it is only necessary to raise the level of one's consciousness by the experience of Being, it is only necessary to become 'enlightened'. 'Restraint' offered to activity does not 'accomplish' the goal because, as the next verse explains, the natural seat of bondage does not lie within the mind or the senses, which alone could be influenced by restraint. Attachment, the seat of bondage, does not lie within; it is located outside, in the region of the object of experience. Therefore non-attachment cannot be gained by restraining the mind or senses; keeping them away from activity does not create a state of non-attachment; non-attachment cannot be gained by non-activity (verse 4) or by any kind of restraint It can only be gained by realizing the Self (verse 17) and by realizing Its separateness from activity (verse 28). There is no other way: because creatures must 'follow their own nature'. They must be engaged in activity according to their own level of consciousness, and therefore enlightenment, if it is to be of universal application, must be possible irrespective of the kind of activity in which one is engaged. That is why the state of enlightenment, the state of knowledge, cannot be gained through restraint, which discriminates between different kinds of activity. It must be on the level of absolute Being, on the level of realization of the Self and completely regardless of the activity that a man undertakes 'according to his own nature'. The next verse throws more light on this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.34 The attachment and aversion of each sense are located in the object of that sense; let no man come under their sway, for both indeed are enemies besetting his path. The Lord means to point out that all is well and wisely set: let everything remain in its place. The attachment and aversion of each sense are located in 'the object of that sense'. Let them remain in that field and let the field of the Self remain free from them. This verse supplements the previous verse, for even the idea of restraint engages the mind in the objects of the senses: in order to forget them, the mind continues to think of them. And the moment the mind comes in contact with the object through the senses, it is influenced by attachment or aversion, which is present in the object. Therefore it is wrong to think in terms of abstinence from the activity of experience as the means of gaining a state of permanent freedom from attachment and aversion, because it is not physically possible to remain without activity at all times. The teaching is: realize Being in Its fullness, realize It as separate from activity; and this will automatically maintain the Self as aloof from attachment or aversion in the midst of all activity and in the presence of all objects of the senses. In the previous verse, the Lord asked Arjuna not to follow the way of 'restraint'. In this verse, he puts attraction and aversion on one level: 'both indeed are enemies besetting his path'. This leads to a remarkable conclusion in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.35 Because one can perform it, one's own dharma (though) lesser in merit, is better than the dharma of another. Better is death in one's own dharma: the dharma of another brings danger. Life has different stages of evolution. For the process of evolution to advance, it is necessary that one stage should give rise to the next, and in this process each successive stage is of vital importance. The Lord gives expression to this truth by laying down a principle which has its significance at every level of evolution: 'Because one can perform it, one's own dharma (though) lesser in merit, is better than the dharma of another'. There are people at various levels of evolution, and each level has a guiding principle, a standard of its own. The guiding principle, or dharma, of a higher level will be suitable and practical for that level, but will not be so for men of lesser development. The Lord emphasizes that a person should go by his own level of consciousness, because only by following that will he make sure of reaching the next stage of evolution. So far as the process of evolution of life is concerned, one's own dharma is the most suitable even though it may appear 'lesser in merit' when compared with the dharma of another. The true merit of dharma lies in its usefulness in promoting evolution in the most effective manner. Life at one stage, when promoted by the dharma of that stage to a higher stage, begins to be governed by the dharma of that higher stage. This is how, stage by stage, life evolves through the dharma of different stages of evolution. The comparative merit of the dharma of one's present state may be less than the dharma of a higher state, but its merit in its own place is greater by far The First English Reader is certainly inferior to Milton's Paradise, but it is more valuable for the student of the first grade because it is more suited to him. If a man were to try to follow a dharma suitable for one of higher development, he would not be able to put it into practice successfully and thus would waste his time and energy. This may go so far as to entail loss of the path of his evolution. Following his own dharma, should he die, he would naturally rise to a higher state of life; but if he were to die while trying to practice the dharma of another, he would die dislocated from his own level o' development, in utter confusion about the path of his evolution. The Lord says: 'Better is death in one's own dharma', and the reason which He gives is that 'the dharma of another brings danger'. It is evident from this that there is a yet greater danger to life than the phenomenon of death. Death as such only causes a temporary pause in the process of evolution. A pause like this is no real danger to life because, with a new body taken after the pause, more rapid progress of life's evolution becomes possible. A greater danger will be something that actually retards the process of evolution. In following the dharma of another, one certainly produces some effect in one's life, but it will not have any bearing on one's present level of evolution, for this is solely concerned with one's own dharma. The dharma of another belongs to a level of evolution different from one's own. Because man has freedom of action, he is certainly capable of trying to assume the role of action belonging to different levels of evolution This means that he is capable of attempting to perform actions suitable to the dharma of another. But if he performs such actions, he loses the continuity of progress on the level from which he could evolve. This is the greatest danger to life: that one lives life, time goes by, without any progress on the path of evolution. The Lord teaches that everyone should live according to the level of his own dharma, for this will ensure steady progress on the path of evolution. Certainly there are ways to enhance one's progress, but each of them starts by raising the present level and not by abruptly abandoning it. The present teaching being a discourse on Yoga Shastra, it is necessary to consider dharma not only on the level of relative life, the level of the three gunas and their activity, but also on the level of Being, which is devoid of activity. The dharma of the Self is eternal, while dharma in the relative field has its different values at different levels of activity. Life is inclusive of both these types of dharma, the eternal dharma of the unchanging Self and the changing states of dharma on different levels of life in the relative field. The teaching of this verse on its highest level is this: it is better to remain established in the dharma of the Self, which is absolute bliss-consciousness, than to partake of the dharma of the three gunas and come under the sway of attachment and aversion. For when a man is established in his own dharma, the dharma of the Self, his activity is carried on under the direct influence of almighty Nature and enjoys Its full support; whereas if he partakes of the dharma of another, the dharma of the three gunas, he loses the support and patronage of almighty Nature in cosmic life, and his activity becomes limited by the limitations of individual life. As this principle is true for the dharma of the Self, it is equally true for the dharma of the three gunas. Let not the field of activity usurp the field of the Self. Only thus can a man naturally live both the dharma of the Self and dharma in the field of activity at every level of evolution. The field of the Self and the field of activity will be forever maintained in their full stature. Man will live eternal freedom in the midst of all success in the different spheres of life's activity, individual and social. When the body of a realized man meets with death and the nervous system finally ceases to function, the Self remains established in Its own dharma, the eternal dharma of Being, while the sphere of the three gunas continues in its dharma of continuous change, transforming the dead body into its different component elements. In such a case, death only amounts to the cessation of individual activity, leaving the Self in Its unbounded state of eternal freedom. Such a death is just a silent declaration of no return, no return to the cycle of birth and death When the Lord says: 'Better is death in one's own dharma', He is not extolling death; He is only establishing a principle of gaining that state of eternal Being in which death loses its miserable significance. This, then, is the Lord's answer to all the concern that Arjuna has shown regarding dharma in verses 40 to 45 of the first chapter. Whereas Arjuna considered dharma mainly on the level of behavior, on the level of the gross aspect of relative life, the Lord's consideration of dharma comes from the very basis of life, from the level of Being, the basis of the three gunas. Considered from this fundamental level of life, dharma will provide a solution to any problem at any stage of life's evolution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.36 Arjuna said: What is it that impels a man to commit sin, even involuntarily, as if driven by force, O Varshneya? 'Varshneya': Lord Krishna, a member of the Vrishni family belonging to the Yadava clan. It is an essential and practical question that Arjuna asks; he wants to know what force it is that is driving on Duryodhana and his supporters and may cause him personally to commit the great sin of killing his kinsmen. A thief knows that he is committing a sin and that this will result in punishment. Yet he is not able to resist. Why is this? Having heard the deep philosophy of the separateness of the inner divine Self from the field of activity, and having clearly understood from the previous verse that it is dangerous for the Self to fall from Its dharma of eternal existence into the sphere of dharma in the ever-changing nature of the three gunas, it amazes Arjuna to see that this truth of the separateness of the Self and activity, which is the natural state of life, is not manifest in the daily lives of the people. It is this which makes him ask the question in the present verse. He wants to understand the force that robs man of the Reality of his existence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.37 The Blessed Lord said: If is desire, it is anger, born of rajo-guna, all-consuming and most evil. Know this to be the enemy here on earth. 'Rajo-guna': rajas, one of the three gunas of Nature. It is responsible for motion and energy. It is desire that establishes contact of the senses with their objects and thereby influences the Self by way of attachment or aversion (verse 74)l which in turn create a spur to activity involving the self. Self-consciousness, unmanifested pure consciousness, manifests as vibration, consciousness vibrates and becomes conscious mind, and a thought arises. The process of manifestation continues, and the thought develops into a desire. Desire is vibrating consciousness set in motion and channelled in a particular direction. It is all motion superimposed on ever-motionless pure consciousness; and this is by virtue of rajo-guna. When the flow of a particular desire is obstructed by another flow, energy is produced at the point of collision, and this flares up as anger, which disturbs, confuses and destroys the harmony and smooth flow of the desire. Thus confusion is created in the manifested field of Reality, and the purpose of manifestation, which is the expansion of happiness, is marred; the very purpose of' creation is thwarted. That is why anger is called 'the enemy' by the Lord. It is like a whirlpool in a river which threatens to upset the smooth flow of everything passing along it. It is like fire which burns up everything in its path. Anger is said to be the great evil, mutilating the very purpose of creation. Here desire and anger both stand accused. Whereas anger destroys the purpose of creation, desire keeps the mind floating in the field of sensory experience and is therefore responsible for the mind's involving the Self with action unless the self has gained stability in its own nature And thus the natural eternal freedom of the Self is overshadowed. Desire in the state of ignorance overshadows the pure nature of the self, which is absolute bliss-consciousness, and this keeps the life in bondage and suffering. 'All-consuming': this expression is preceded by 'born of rajo-guna'. This implies that since rajo-guna is responsible for the functioning of sattva and tamas, since rajo-guna lies at the basis of all the constructive and destructive forces of nature, desire, having its source in rajo-guna, also has the natural capacity of either supporting the whole field of the three gunas or overthrowing their entire purpose. The Lord here does not discuss the upholding and supporting aspect of desire, because in the present context he is analyzing its very nature as bringing the Self out of Itself. As such, it is 'all-consuming and most evil', for it overshadows the real nature of the Self and so obscures absolute bliss-consciousness, the true nature of life eternal. The nature of desire, as brought to light here by the Lord, applies only so long as one has not gained enlightenment. It is only true of a seeker, an ignorant man, and not of a realized man. When one gains realization of the Self as separate from activity, desire ceases to be 'the enemy here on earth', because it is then upheld only by the three gunas, while the Self remains completely free from its influence. In the remainder of this chapter the Lord continues to reflect upon the nature of anger and desire, and eventually shows a way to conquer these enemies of life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.38 As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo is covered by the amnion, so is This covered by that. 'This covered by that': pure consciousness is overlaid by desires. There are three metaphors in this verse, each with its own significance. Smoke arises from fire and covers it: desire arises from pure consciousness and veils it. The mirror is covered by dust, which comes from outside it. The source of desire lies outside the field of Being in the field of the gunas. This outer stimulus creates a desire and covers pure Being. So it can be said that the desire coming from outside covers Being as dust covers a mirror. As the amnion covering the embryo supports it and keeps it alive, so does the desire overshadowing Being support and give life to beings, nourish them and keep them alive. Therefore it is desire which in every way veils the uninvolved nature of the Self and leaves It involved, as it were, and as if bound by activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.39 Wisdom is veiled by this insatiable flame of desire which is the constant enemy of the wise, O son of Kunti. 'Wisdom': see verse 32. Desire, as defined in the 77th verse, is like an unquenchable fire, because the flow of desire in a particular direction, kept moving by the experience of happiness or the search for it, continues to flow from point to point, there being no point in the field of relativity to satisfy finally its craving for greater happiness. This is how the ceaseless activity of desire continues to maintain a close tie of association between the self and the outside world, thus keeping the self bound, as it were, to the field of action. Desire does not allow the self to remain uninvolved with the field of action, even though all activity is in reality carried on by the three gunas. 'The wise' in this context are they who know 'the truth about the divisions of the gunas and their actions' and who know 'that it is the gunas which act upon the gunas', as explained in verse 28. The wise are they who, established in the knowledge of the three gunas, remain uninvolved with the field of action. When the Lord says in this verse that desire 'is the constant enemy of the wise', He is warning students of Sankhya that mere intellectual understanding of the three gunas is not sufficient to establish the Self as uninvolved with action and its fruits. It is necessary to rise above the influence of desire But as long as life continues, it has to be in the field of desires. No practical man could ever be without desires. When the Lord says: 'wisdom is veiled by this insatiable flame of desire which is the constant enemy of the wise', He does not intend to lay down the principle that desire has to be eradicated, because this is not physically possible. Any attempt in that direction will only make life dull, useless or tense. The Lord's purpose is to lay the facts before Arjuna, and then to give him a technique by which he can rise with ease above the binding influence of desire and make his life brighter, more successful and fulfilled on every level. The Lord explains clearly the mechanics of bondage, so that Arjuna may be better able to realize that to rise above this bondage and live a life of eternal freedom is not difficult but easy. The great emphasis in this verse upon the enmity of desires implicitly shows that the Lord is going to lead Arjuna to a way that will transform the influence of desire from enmity to usefulness. Desires will cease to be the 'enemy of the wise'; they will prove to be supporters of the wise and will bring them fulfillment on every side. The Lord, out of His great kindness, is going to give Arjuna a simple technique of transforming the whole machinery that gives rise to desire, of transforming the mind and heart so that the rising up of desires and all their activities will serve as tidal waves of love and bliss in the unbounded ocean of the oneness of God-consciousness. This involves giving a pattern to the machinery that 'creates desire, senses, mind, and intellect, so that even while remaining in the field of desire, it remains free from the impact of desire. This allows the Self to remain uninvolved, leaving the desires to be taken care of by the three gunas, by virtue of which they arise, grow and have their play. The following verse analyses the machinery which gives rise to desires, and the remaining verses of this chapter are devoted to bringing out the basic and at the same time most highly advanced teaching of the technique whereby one passes out of the binding influence of desires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.40 The senses, the mind and the intellect; are said to be its seat. Overshadowing wisdom by means of these, it deludes the dweller in the body. Having thus far explained that the loss of wisdom is due mainly to the mind's incessant engagement in the field of activity, to desire, the Lord now begins to describe a way whereby the subjective aspect of one's life, which is responsible for all desire and activity, can be influenced in such a manner that, on the one hand, it does not permit desires to overshadow Being and, on the other, it brings fulfillment to them, thus bringing both success and salvation to life. The Lord first describes the subjective machinery responsible for making concrete the abstract essence of desire. Through the intellect, mind and senses, abstract desire in the form of a thought takes on a concrete shape. As a result, the Self becomes as if involved with the field of activity. This is how the uninvolved nature of the Self is deluded, as it were. The wisdom that holds the Self to be uninvolved and out of bondage is overshadowed by the senses, mind and intellect coming into action under the sway of desire. Having shown the senses to be the direct means through which desires function, the Lord, in the following verse, stresses the necessity of conditioning the senses to become free from the overshadowing nature of desires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.41 Therefore, having first organized the senses, O best of Bharatas, shake off this evil, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. 'Organized': the Sanskrit word used in the text is 'niyamya', which means literally having introduced law and order, having organized something to function in an orderly manner. Even the word 'organize' is inadequate to convey the accurate meaning, but it has been chosen to avoid the sense of control and restraint which has generally been implied by commentators and which has only resulted in mutilating the whole meaning and purpose of the teaching. This verse brings out a fundamental principle showing how to make life free from 'this evil' of desire, leaving it in fullness of wisdom and freedom in divine consciousness. The previous verse has declared the senses, mind and intellect to be the 'seat' of desire In teaching Arjuna how to regulate and organize the flow of desire so that it may cease to overshadow the essential nature of the Self, the Lord begins with a consideration of the field of the senses; for the senses are the fountainhead from which all the streams of desire flow. In a mountain, various underground currents of water flow from all directions and all of them find a common outlet in a spring. The only way to organize all these underground currents is to organize the outlet. Desires in the fields of intellect and mind are like currents underground. The field of the senses is like the outlet from which the currents emerge into the open air. By controlling the outlet, it is quite possible to use the whole outflow of water to advantage. according to this verse, organizing the outlet, organizing the senses, is the way to make the best use of the underground currents of desire. The advice here is not to abandon or kill desires, not to control desires as such, but to control the outlet of desires by organizing the senses. The purpose is to give a pattern to the functioning of the senses so that their activity will always, as a matter of course, be in accordance with the laws of nature conducting the process of evolution. This is the simple and effective means to 'shake off this evil, the destroyer of knowledge and realization'. Organizing the senses lies at the root of all real accomplishments in life The verses which follow expound the technique. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.42 The senses, they say, are subtle; more subtle than the senses is mind; yet finer than mind is intellect; that which is beyond even the intellect is he. After emphasizing in the previous verse the necessity of organizing the senses, the Lord now indicates the sequence of the subtler aspects of subjective life which lie beyond the senses. This is to find the key to organizing the senses. If one has difficulty in dealing with an officer, one should seek out his superior in rank. In the field of inner life, the Lord says, he who is beyond the intellect is the highest authority of all. The next verse makes clear that, by contacting him, the senses are naturally subdued. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$3.43 Thus, having known him who is beyond the intellect, having stilled the self by the Self, O mighty-armed, slay the enemy in the form of desire, difficult to subdue. 'Having known him': this means having known the indweller of the body in his true nature as Being, separate from the whole field of activity of the body, senses, mind and intellect. The expression implies that this is the way to 'slay the enemy in the form of desire'. 'Difficult to subdue': subduing of desires will be difficult by any attempt that aims directly to subdue them. Desires are the impulses of the mind. Unless the mind turns to Being it is naturally engaged in desire. As this is the natural relation of the mind to desires, and as the mind is the basis of the existence of desires, the only way to subdue them is to turn the mind to Being. This is the great wisdom of life, the essence of the doctrine of Karma Yoga. The Lord makes a fundamental statement about cause and effect: influence the cause to modify the effect, go to the realm of Being in order to modify the nature of the intellect, mind and senses. Go to the absolute ultimate Reality, and all levels of relativity will cease to be a burden. Be illumined, and life will ever be in freedom and fullness, away from the darkness of ignorance. The Lord says: Realization of the Ultimate is within your easy reach. You have the power to realize the Supreme, provided you do not undermine that power. It only amounts to being what you are. Being what you are, you will find the whole field of existence set in eternal harmony. Intellect, mind and senses, all will function in accord, none will overpower the others, and no side of life will be impaired. Life will be lived in fullness. This is a reaffirmation of the Lord's words in the 45th and 46th verses of the second chapter. It is an approach which does away with the need for controlling the senses by any unnatural or strenuous austerity. It makes unnecessary any practice of detachment or renunciation for the sake of cultivating the state of enlightenment. A very practical method of realization is provided, whether one is on the path of Gyana Yoga, the way of knowledge, or of Karma Yoga, the way of action. Irrespective of one's way of life, that of a householder or that of a recluse, this is a direct approach to fulfillment. Unfortunately it is commonly held that desires should be subdued in order to attain enlightenment. This is completely wrong. The misunderstanding has grown during the last few hundred years, and in consequence the task of those who seek the Truth has become more difficult than ever before. Here the Lord says: Go to the state of enlightenment in order to come out of the bondage of karma, bring the light in order to remove the darkness. It is this which is the underlying principle of the verse; not that one should try to remove the darkness in order to come into the light. So that Arjuna may be released from the bondage of karma, the Lord wishes him to leave the whole field of karma. He wants him to know the transcendental Reality and thereby build up his mind to such a degree that it will rise above the binding influence of desires and actions. This is a direct way of realizing the state of integration and of eternal freedom during one's lifetime here on earth. This, being the last verse of the chapter, sums up the Lord's answer to Arjuna's questions in verses 1, 2 and 76. This chapter, which expounds the science of action, advocates transcending desire as a technique of subduing desires and also of bringing fulfillment to them; useless desires will be subdued while useful ones will find their fulfillment. The principle of maintaining the life of a tree is to go beyond the tree. If one attends to the area surrounding the root, to the transcendental field of the tree, it is easy to bring nourishment to all its parts. If one attends to the field of the Transcendent one can make the whole tree of life healthy and fruitful. The blessing of this chapter is the principle of transcending the field of action in order to bring fulfillment to action. It upholds and supports both the life of a householder and the life of a recluse. Thus end the Yoga of Action, Karma Yoga. This chapter springs from the same breath of the Lord as Chapter III. Verse 48 of Chapter II contains the seed-thoughts which give rise to both chapters: 'Established in Yoga . . . perform actions' to Chapter III, and 'having abandoned attachment and having become balanced in success and failure' to Chapter IV. These two chapters together are therefore sufficient to bring enlightenment to a seeker. They give him, insofar as words can, the desired experience and full understanding of it. The second chapter presented the doctrine of liberation. It analysed life in its relative and absolute aspects and promised liberation through knowledge of these. Knowledge in its entirety comprises both understanding and experience. Therefore in order to gain fulfillment, a man must necessarily acquire both understanding and experience of the relative and the Absolute, irrespective of whether his path is that of a householder or a recluse. It follows that the wisdom of Sankhya, which brings liberation through understanding of the relative and the Absolute, and the practice of Yoga, which brings liberation by providing direct experience of these two spheres of existence, are both paths to enlightenment. All this teaching is contained in the second chapter. The third chapter presented a doctrine of action designed to make permanent the experience of the Absolute first mentioned in the 45th verse of the second chapter. When this experience of the Absolute has become permanent, Self-awareness is naturally maintained through all the waking, dreaming and deep sleep states of consciousness. One experiences oneself as separate from activity. As one lives this life of non-involvement, of natural non-attachment, one's intellect begins to enquire: 'Is this the truth of life? Has this sense of separateness or non-attachment anything to do with real life, or is it an escape from life? Is the reality of life a duality the duality of Being and activity?' Such doubts are removed by the knowledge given in the fourth chapter. This chapter, dedicated to the knowledge of renunciation, analyses the nature of action and the nature of the actor on both the individual and cosmic levels, on the level of man and on the level of God, and then proclaims the result of this systematic and rational analysis: action and actor are independent of one another; there exists a natural state of separation between them at every level. This state of non-attachment, or renunciation, provides on the one hand a solid foundation of eternal freedom for the actor, and on the other the maximum possible success in action with most glorious fruits. It is this state of renunciation that provides the eternal playground for the Divine and for man. Ignorance of this natural basis of life is the cause of bondage and all suffering. Knowledge of it results in eternal freedom. To unfold this knowledge is the purpose of the fourth chapter. The most fascinating aspect of this chapter is that, in bringing out knowledge of the renunciation of action, it explains the whole field of action, showing how the stream of life advances towards the higher spheres of existence (verse lo) and towards the higher forces in nature (verse 12), until it merges with the ocean of eternal freedom in God-consciousness (verse g). This chapter of knowledge is of the utmost importance to a seeker, for it explains the most valuable experience on the path to enlightenment, the experience of the separateness of the Self and activity. As his practice advances, every seeker must necessarily reach this experience; and if he is to proceed smoothly on his path, unhindered by doubts, he must possess this knowledge. In order to bring out thc complete knowledge of the separation, or the state of renunciation, that exists between the Self and activity, this chapter explains the two spheres of life, relative and absolute. In so doing, it proclaims the philosophy of two fullnesses found in the Upanishads: this is full and That is full, 'purnamadah purna-midam', That transcendental unmanifested absolute eternal Being is full, and this manifested relative ever-changing world of phenomenal existence is full. The Absolute is eternal in its never-changing nature, and the relative is eternal in its ever-changing nature. This living Reality of two fullnesses in cosmic consciousness finds its consummation in the grand Unity of God-consciousness. In expounding this unified philosophy of the two fullnesses, this chapter presents the core of the wisdom contained in this Scripture of Yoga, and for this reason the Lord begins by giving Arjuna an account of the tradition of this Yoga. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.1 The Blessed Lord said: I proclaimed this imperishable Yoga to Vivaswat, Vivasvat declared it to Manu and Manu told it to Ikshvaku. 'This imperishable Yoga': the preceding chapters have been devoted to Yoga Sankhya Yoga and Karma Yoga. By saying: this.. Yoga', the Lord speaks of them both as one. This is to bring home to Arjuna that although they have been declared to be different, they have the same basis and yield the same results.'The basis is: 'Be without the three gunas', which brings fulfillment both to the wisdom of Sankhya and to the practice of Karma Yoga. Thus the word 'Yoga' in this verse stands for both Sankhya and Karma Yoga. The Yoga expounded by Lord Krishna is imperishable because it brings to light the wisdom of the Absolute and the wisdom of the relative. The relative and the Absolute, both these are eternal; and so is Yoga, which expounds the truth of both, the truth of life in its fullness. It is eternal because it serves the cosmic purpose and is natural to the mind of man. The Lord says that He taught this eternal Yoga to Vivasvat in the beginning of creation in order to infuse strength into the kshatriyas and to enable them to maintain law and order and preserve the path of righteousness for the well-being of society. Vivasvat revealed it to the son Manu, the law-giver to the world. And Manu gave it to his son Ikshvaku, who ruled at Ayodhya as the first king of the Solar dynasty. The Bhagavad-Gita is the highest expression of divine intelligence understandable by man. Dealing with the unseen aspects of life, it also touches on the past and present of the world of our daily life. Furthermore, the Bhagavad-Gita, while expounding universal Truth, is itself an historical record and relates incidents that took place five thousand years ago. In order to understand the historical significance of the Bhagavad-Gita, one must be familiar with the Indian conception of history and time. The study of history has a definite purpose and a place in the life of the individual. Its aim is to educate the mind of the present with information from the past in order to ensure a better present and a better future. In this way each generation takes advantage of the achievements of the past and advances towards greater wisdom in life. But it is not knowledge of the chronological order of events that educates students of history; it is the value of events that is important, and this is the aspect of history on which Indian historians have concentrated. They have put on record, for all generations to read, only such instances in the great span of time as can help to integrate men's lives. Their purpose is to inspire men both as individuals and as members of society. The sage of enlightened vision, Veda Vyasa, who is regarded as the greatest historian of the Aryan culture of India, had before him a vast span of time to take into account. As a conscientious and fully integrated man, he could not write the history of this immeasurable period as a sequence of days and years. He could only select particular happenings and record them in such a way as to inspire and guide people of all times on the path of evolution and educate them in the integration of their life. This is why no chronological order is to be found in Indian histories. Vyasa thought it absurd to pin every event down chronologically just for the sake of establishing each link on the long road of time. Moreover, it is not physically possible to write the history of millions of years in chronological sequence. In the case of small countries with a few thousand years of civilization, it is quite practicable for historians, with a vision of that small area and that small span of time, to maintain chronological order But Vyasa had a clear vision of the whole span of time beginning from the day of creation. Such a mind would not and could not assign any value to chronology. The Indian conception of time, as set out below, will clearly show the situation that confronted Vyasa and other writers of Indian history. Time is a conception to measure_eternity. Indian historians base their conception of time on eternal Being, for them eternity is the basic field of time. To arrive at some conception of the eternal, the best measure will be the life-span of something that has the greatest longevity in the relative field of creation. This, according to the enlightened vision of Vyasa, is the Divine Mother, the Universal Mother, who is ultimately responsible for all that is, was and will be in the entire cosmos. The eternity of the eternal life of absolute Being is conceived in terms of innumerable lives of the Divine Mother, a single one of whose lives encompasses a thousand life-spans of Lord Shiva. One life of Lord Shiva covers the time of a thousand life-spans of Lord Vishnu. One life of Lord Vishnu equals the duration of a thousand life-spans of Brahma, the Creator A single life-span of Brahma is conceived in terms of one hundred years of Brahma; each year of Brahma comprises 12 months of Brahma, and each month comprises thirty days of Brahma. One day of Brahma is called a Kalpa. One Kalpa is equal to the time of fourteen Manus. The time of one Manu is called a Manvantara. One Manvantara equals seventy-one Chaturyugis. One Chaturyugi comprises the total span of four Yugas i.e. Sat-yuga, Treta-Yuga, Dvapara-yuga and Kali-yuga. The span of the Yugas is conceived in terms of the duration of Sat-yuga. Thus the span of Treta-yuga is equal to three-quarters of that of Sat-yuga; the span of Dvapara-yuga is half that of Sat-yuga, and the span of Kali-yuga one quarter that of Sat-yuga. The span of Kali-yuga equals 432,000 years of man's life. Now consider the time of creation: for how many billion trillion years the world has been! Even if the account of one year were to occupy a page or even a single line, how could anyone possibly read such a history and apply its lessons to his life? This is why chronological order was not maintained by Indian historians. Apart from being impracticable, it was considered to be unnecessary, useless and damaging to the very purpose of history. All this should be borne in mind by those modern historians who tend to reject as non-history any series of events for which they fail to find a proper chronological order. It is deplorable that such precious accounts of life on the highest human level as are to be found in the historical material of ancient India should have been regarded as myth. They should, on the contrary, be recognized as a most useful history of the highest civilization that has ever existed on earth. The Bhagavad-Gita forms the central core of the most authentic record of Indian history, the Mahabharata. This cannot be dismissed as mythology just because the narrow vision of modern historians, tied to rigid chronology, fails to understand it as an historical record and puts it in the compartment of imaginative literature. It is regrettable that some modern commentators on the Bhagavad-Gita have followed in the footsteps of modern historians and refused to admit its historic authenticity. It is to be hoped that the light will dawn and truth will be recognised as truth. When Lord Krishna recalls for Arjuna that the great wisdom of the Bhagavad-Gita was given to Vivasvat in the beginning of this Kalpa, He does not enumerate in detail all the custodians of this supreme knowledge. To satisfy Arjuna about the original source of the teaching, it is sufficient to give him the idea of this eternal wisdom being handed on from generation to generation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.2 Thus having received it one from another, the royal sages knew it. With the long lapse of time, O scorcher of enemies, this Yoga has been lost to the world. The Lord says that this technique of integration of life was handed on to the philosopher-kings, men who led active lives and had great responsibilities in the world. In those days the rulers were held responsible for every aspect of the development of their people, physical, mental and spiritual. They gave this wisdom of Yoga to the people in general. In the modern democratic world each man has to look after his own affairs. Thus it is in keeping with our times that each man should feel responsible for his own development. As spiritual development is the basis of all other forms of development, it is necessary that this great science and art of successful living should now be handed on to every man everywhere in the world. The Lord says: 'having received it one from another'. By this, He brings an unquestionable authenticity to this system of Yoga. It has been since the beginning of history. Again He says: 'the royal sages knew it', showing it to be a precious doctrine followed by those in positions of great responsibility. The reason for its loss, the Lord says, is 'the long lapse of time'. But in the first verse He has spoken of this Yoga as 'imperishable'. This implies that while its principle is imperishable, its practice needs periodic revival, according to the changed conditions of living from age to age. Because it awakens man's consciousness to extreme purity, this system of Yoga is equally suitable for people in every age. Sometimes, however, it is not followed in its pure form; then the desired results are not achieved and this eventually leads to indifference towards its practice. Thus this great principle of life becomes lost from time to time. But it cannot be lost for ever because, as the Truth of existence, it must be brought to light again and again. Nature helps to restore it. From time to time great teachers come with the proper inspiration to reveal the path once more. They renew the tradition which maintains the teaching. The renewed tradition remains dominant so long as it continues to inspire the people. But when it fails to respond to the need of the age new teachers arise. This cycle is repeated again and again. Some who come to revive the tradition honor the ancient line of teachers; others, failing to relate the traditional solutions to their present need, break away from the established tradition. Their teachings form new branches of the old trunk. The custodians of the ancient tradition of Vedic wisdom act as the guardians of the main trunk, from which different branches have sprung from time to time in the form of different religions, faiths, philosophies and cultures in different parts of the world. Today the most cherished tradition of Vedic wisdom is the Shankaracharya tradition which, in its present shape, began about 2,500 years ago' with the teaching of the first Shankaracharya. He revived the forgotten Truth. By his faithful interpretation of the essence of Vedic literature, he re-established the principle of the Unity of all-pervading Being in the midst of the diversities of life. He established the unified philosophy of the two fullnesses as the essential teaching of the Vedanta. His commentaries on the Brahmasutra, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad-Gita, are extolled for their depth of wisdom and magnificent exposition of the Reality of life. Strange how the truth of a teaching becomes distorted with the passage of time! The truth of Shankara's teaching has been so misrepresented by his interpreters that modern writing about his thought retains little of his spirit. The sanyasi, or recluse orders, of Shankara's tradition have been interpreting Shankara-Vedanta as being completely closed to the householders, who form the main section of society, and open only to themselves. This has resulted in spiritual decadence and in the moral downfall of Indian society. Such decay is nothing new. It happens, says Lord Krishna, 'with the long lapse of time'. The Truth is overshadowed, and distorted interpretations take its place. But when these depart so far from the Truth that the principle itself is in danger of extinction, then a revival comes to save it. The holy tradition of great masters, which is responsible for reviving the teaching after every lapse, has captured the minds and hearts of lovers of Truth in every age. It is not merely held in high regard, but has come to be actually worshipped by seekers of Truth and knowers of Reality. A verse recording the names of the greatest and most highly revered masters has not only inspired seekers, but has been a joy even to the fulfilled hearts of realized souls passing through the long corridor of time. 'Scorcher of enemies': by using this expression, the Lord indicates to Arjuna that this Yoga has been lost through falling into the hands of the weak, and that now, by finding its way into the strong hands of Arjuna, it will prove its worth and help the world to restore and maintain the path of righteousness. The Lord's expression also indicates to Arjuna that he will not prove unworthy of this great blessing. In the following verse He gives further reasons for teaching this wisdom to Arjuna. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.3 This same age-old Yoga, which is indeed the supreme secret, I have today declared to you because you are my devotee and friend. 'Age-old Yoga' indicates that the teaching has withstood the test of time, and that it cannot but prove useful. The Lord is not trying out any new method; He is only restoring the old tradition. Such has been the declaration of all the great masters from time immemorial; they never claimed that their teaching was new, but rather that they were bringing out the forgotten wisdom of life. They spoke only of restoration because the truth of any useful principle continues to exist in time. The Lord here mentions two qualities of Arjuna's which entitle him to receive this great secret wisdom: 'friend' and 'devotee'. And also two qualities of the system of Yoga: 'supreme' and 'secret'. That which is secret can be passed on to a friend, but that which is supreme can be passed on only to a devotee. A devotee never questions his master. In order to allow Arjuna the freedom to question, Lord Krishna calls him His friend. Arjuna makes use of this freedom in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.4 Arjuna said: Later was Thy birth and earlier the birth of Vivasvat: how am I to understand this saying that Thou didst proclaim it in the beginning ? This question shows Arjuna's alertness to every word that the Lord speaks to him, his vigilance and careful scrutiny of every point. Such is the mind of a good seeker of Truth A good master is only encouraged by such questions. In the previous verse, Lord Krishna, through Himself, has connected the far distant past with the present. Now Arjuna isolates Him in time and states his difficulty in understanding the eternity of time in Him. Lord Krishna's answer is plain and simple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.5 The Blessed Lord said: Many births have passed for Me and for you also, O Arjuna. I know them all but you know them not, O scorcher of enemies. This verse may be said to exemplify what verses 12 and 22 Of the second chapter spoke of in principle: bodies change in time, but time changes in the Self, in Being, which continues to be, regardless of past, present or future. As the embodied self remains unchanged when the body passes into the changing states of childhood, youth and old age, so does the Self continue unchanged in the eternity of time. The Lord says: 'I know them all but you know them not'. This points to a difference between the life of man and the Incarnation of God. Man is born as a result of his past actions, good and bad, so that his vision remains colored or obstructed by those influences. The nature of the divine Incarnation is ever pure eternal unbounded intelligence. His vision is absolutely clear; that is why for Him the eternity of knowing is maintained and the factor of time fails to obstruct it. The Lord's Being is the playground of the time which He creates. It comes and goes, but He, steadfast in His eternal Being, for ever and ever continues to be. He is the ocean of life, while time rises and falls as the tide on the surface of the ocean. Though the tidal waves draw on the depths they can never fathom the unfathomable abyss. The life of man is like a wave which rises up to see, it can see so far and no more; but Lord Krishna's stature is like that of an ocean on which the whole of space is reflected. Thus the Lord knows 'them all' and Arjuna knows 'them not'. Arjuna had challenged Lord Krishna's words, and the expression 'you know them not' shows that the Lord is obliged to use His authority. But at the same time He addresses Arjuna as 'scorcher of enemies', so as to prevent his morale from sinking. Lord Krishna uses His authority with love. The next verse further explains the Lord's nature. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.6 Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, though Lord of all beings, yet remaining in My own nature I take birth through My own power of creation. At this point there is an illustration of an important psychological technique. As the Lord has earlier affirmed the authenticity of this system of Yoga, declaring that it is ancient and has a great tradition, He must also make clear to Arjuna that He who is giving out this eternal wisdom is great in Himself, is one whose word alone can be taken as authoritative. The direction of the discourse is such that it makes Arjuna question the Lord on the very point about which He wants to speak next. Had the Lord spoken the words of this and the preceding verse in a different context and not in reply to Arjuna's question (verse 4)1 then they would not have been so effective and convincing. It is the greatness of the teacher that brings out the right question from the pupil. In answering it, the teacher freely develops his own theme and at the same time keeps the interest of the pupil more actively engaged than it would be if only the teacher spoke. Although manifest creation, which includes men and other creatures, springs from the unmanifest, its manifestation is by virtue of prakriti. But the divine manifestation of the unmanifest Being, which comes to re-establish the forgotten wisdom of life, is by virtue of 'Lila-shakti' which is the very power of the Absolute, an integral part of Its transcendent divine nature. Surgery is the inseparable power of the surgeon. Sometimes it is active, as when the surgeon works at the operating table, but at other times it is latent, as when he is resting at home. Lila-shakti (the play-power of Brahman) functions in an analogous way, and by virtue of this the unmanifest, ever remaining in its absolute state, manifests into creation. The almighty nature of the eternal Being thus maintains Reality in both Its aspects, absolute and relative. The Lord says: 'remaining in My own nature I take birth'. Just as the sap in a tree appears as a leaf and a flower without losing its quality as sap, so the unmanifest Being, remaining unmanifest imperishable and eternal, takes birth. Nothing happens to the Absolute, and yet the Incarnation of the Absolute springs up, by virtue of Its own nature. Here the Lord is saying: While remaining in My own nature I take birth through My power of creation, and through that I function; that is how I remain unbound and at the same time am able to restore law and order in creation. This principle is developed in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.7 Whenever dharma is in decay and adharma flourishes, O Bharata, then I create Myself. 'Adharma': the opposite to dharma. 'Dharma' is derived from the root 'dhri', meaning 'that which upholds'. Dharma is that which upholds or sustains all that is. What is this that sustains creation? Charaka and Sushruta, the ancient Indian exponents of Ayurveda, the doctrine of health, hold that it is the equilibrium of the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas, that sustains all things. Creation gains in integrity with the rise of sattva and disintegrates with the rise of tamas. The equilibrium of the three gunas is maintained automatically, just as law and order are automatically maintained by a government. But whenever a crisis arises, the head of state has to exercise his special power. Whenever dharma is in decay, the balance of the three gunas is disturbed, the equilibrium in nature is lost, the path of evolution is distorted and chaos prevails. At such special times the Lord incarnates. The Incarnation of Lord Krishna is such a special manifestation of Brahman, the eternal immutable Being. Life has two phases, relative and absolute. Both are full: the Absolute is full in its eternal never-changing nature, and the relative is full in its eternally ever-changing nature. This eternally ever-changing nature of relative life is maintained in all its aspects of creation and evolution by virtue of the enormous power of nature called dharma, which is at the basis of the smooth functioning of the three gunas. It is like a powerful current which forcibly carries with it all that comes in its path. Dharma upholds evolution; but when, as a result of the wrongdoing of a large majority of people on earth, the power of dharma becomes greatly overshadowed, the natural force of evolution in nature becomes weak. A situation is created whereby the everchanging world of relative existence begins to lose its natural pattern. This endangers the fullness of the relative aspect of life. The almighty power that holds intact the fullness of the Absolute together with the fullness of the relative phase of life is stirred. And that almighty power incarnates. The decay of dharma, the distortion of the path of evolution, the decline of righteousness in society, brings about a need for the restoration of the true principles of life; the Incarnation comes, the whole of nature rejoices in that coming, dharma is restored and evil is brought to an end. The righteous, therefore, feel obliged to the wicked because, as wickedness increases and dominates the world, the need is created for the Almighty to take form and be enjoyed by the righteous. The full purpose of Incarnation is made clear in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.8 To protect the righteous and destroy the wicked, to establish dharma firmly, I take birth age after age. The Lord says that He has a twofold purpose: to protect the righteous and destroy the wicked. The protection of the righteous is implied in the destruction of the wicked; but when the Lord here speaks of protecting the righteous, He means something more than merely removing the thorns from their path. The righteous continue to uphold dharma and they succeed in this, even in times when unrighteousness dominates society, by virtue of the great strength that they receive when, during their daily meditations, they come into communion with the Divine As their minds grow in divine consciousness, the purity of their lives increases until they eventually begin to feel a strong need for the abstract bliss of God-consciousness to be materialized, to be brought to the level of the senses, where it will become the object of all the senses and be enjoyed by them. Their hearts are more and more filled with love, and the need for divine revelation in some form becomes increasingly intense. When nature can no longer resist it, then the Lord takes birth and fulfils the desire of the righteous. This is how the righteous are protected by the Lord. The Lord says: 'I take birth age after age'. This shows that in every age there are those ardent, loving devotees of God for whose sake He takes form; and when He comes to satisfy them, He also purifies the earth by destroying the negative forces which contaminate the atmosphere by opposing righteousness. Destruction of the wicked, although a reason for the Lord's Incarnation, is not His main purpose. He comes to satisfy and protect the righteous. He comes on earth moved by the righteous, for the love of the righteous, for the fulfillment of the righteous, and to come on earth in order to give His love to His devotees is a joy for Almighty God. He comes on earth, and the light comes; it brings extinction to the darkness of ignorance and destruction to the wicked. Equilibrium in nature is restored, and the forces of evolution become stronger. Dharma becomes firmly established in the world. The establishment of dharma in God's creation is His own work. He does it He does it again and again, either through the automatic arrangement of His government, He Himself remaining behind the scenes, or by taking a body and coming to be active in the affairs of the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.9 My birth and My activity are divine. He who knows this in very essence, on leaving the body is not reborn. He comes to Me, O Arjuna. 'My birth': the birth of the Lord is not the same as the birth of man. It is divine in the sense that He, the Divine, ever remaining in His cosmic state of transcendental Being, takes a body and comes on earth. The divine birth needs no period of transition and involves no process of physical birth: the divine Being does not become non-divine and non-Being; remaining divine and remaining Being, He appears as man to save human life on earth and re-establish the path of righteousness. 'My activity': the unmanifest transcendental Divine, assuming human form, remains in His divine nature and He acts. The divine nature is all Being, eternal, unchanging and non-active, even though it is the infinite source of life-energy. Because the Lord acts while remaining in His divine nature, His actions also are divine. In order to understand the divine birth and the activity of the divine Incarnation, man has to rise to the state of Divinity. Having risen to this state, having become established in the eternal Being of the Absolute, he rises above the bondage of time, space and causation. For him there is no question of birth or death. He has life eternally, and he has it in the timeless unbounded omnipresence of the Lord; his life is in His life. 'He comes to Me', says the Lord. There is no question of his rebirth in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.10 Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the austerity of wisdom, many have come to My Being. The sequence of expressions is highly significant: 'Freed from attachment, fear and anger' is a pre-requisite to 'absorbed in Me'. 'Freed from attachment, fear and anger': attachment, fear and anger find fertile ground in the soil of ignorance, where the self has not discovered its meaning in the Self Transcendental meditation, as explained in Chapter II, verse 451 takes the mind to the field of bliss-consciousness, supreme contentment and infinite energy, leaving no room for any kind of weakness. It brings the mind to the state of Being, which forms the basis of God-consciousness, expressed in the words 'absorbed in Me' and 'taking refuge in Me'. 'Purified by the austerity of wisdom': austerity means denial of the pleasures of the senses, or coming out of the field of sensory activity and enjoyment. The purpose of austerity is to purify by freeing the mind from the impact of the objects of sense. Likewise knowledge separates the Self from the whole field of activity. This is the significance of the expression: 'austerity of wisdom'. It should not be understood to mean that, as the practice of austerity involves hardship, so does the path of knowledge. On the contrary, gaining knowledge is joyful from beginning to end: from the state of transcendental consciousness, through cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness. As the mind proceeds towards the Transcendent, it becomes more and more free from the gross fields of experience and this brings it nearer and nearer to a state of purity. Eventually, when the mind transcends the subtlest state of experience, it is left to itself, and then it reaches the state of absolute purity. This state of absolute purity, gained during transcendental consciousness, becomes permanent in cosmic consciousness and finds its purpose and consummation' in the state of purity born of knowledge of the ultimate oneness of life in God-consciousness. In this state of knowledge man finds that Union with God of which the Lord says: 'many have come to My Being'. Bg the use of the word 'many', the Lord extends the hope of Union with God to any man. Having now described the direct way of attaining the ultimate knowledge in God-consciousness, the Lord, in the following verse, speaks about His reaction to the method of approach adopted by the seeker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.11 As men approach Me, so do I favour them; in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path. 'As men approach Me, so do I favour them': it is an established natural law that action and reaction are equal to one another. In the fullness of Divinity, God is ever full, and like the water of a great lake, so does this fullness remain. The water has a tendency neither to flow away nor to resist flowing; it just remains as it is. It a farmer wants to take water to his field, he brings a pipe up to the level of the water The water does not refuse to flow once the pipe is raised to its level. Furthermore, the Lord says: 'in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path'. This has different meanings at different levels. First, the nature of man is like the nature of God in that man behaves to others as others behave to him. Secondly, learning that the nature of the Lord is such that He Himself does not take any initiative, that He only responds, people try to derive the maximum benefit from surrendering themselves completely to Him through meditation, which is the direct way to God-consciousness. One who reaches this state, truly losing his limited identity, gains the status of unbounded eternal Being in God-consciousness. The Lord's purpose in disclosing this essential characteristic of His nature is that thereby all men should reach this state of divine existence. Here is the exposition of a technique by which the limited personality of man is enabled to rise to the unlimited status of eternal existence in God-consciousness. It is open to all. Thirdly, the natural tendency of every man is to turn towards greater happiness, and therefore to proceed towards the eternal happiness of God-consciousness. This is another reason why the Lord says: 'in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path'. Finally, 'in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path' indicates that God's own consciousness is the sole guiding factor of man's consciousness. It underlies all life in the cosmos and is the basic motivating intelligence of all beings. Cosmic intelligence upholds man's intelligence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.12 Those who desire fulfillment of actions here on earth make offerings to the gods, for success born of action comes quickly in the world of men. Success is certainly gained by effort. Those who know how to contact the Vedic gods do so through specific sacrificial ceremonies and, having contacted these higher powers in nature, receive their goodwill and achieve greater success in life When the Lord says here: 'success born of action comes quickly in the world of men', He means to bring home to Arjuna that whereas in the lower species the evolution of the soul depends upon the upward moving currents of evolution in nature, in the human species the soul has freedom of action, and that therefore the development of man depends upon how he acts and what he does. This verse establishes the necessity of action as such for success in the world and at the same time shows the direction in which the activity must proceed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.13 The fourfold order was created by Me according to the division of gunas and actions. Though I am its author, know Me to be the non-doer, immutable. The entire creation is the interplay of the three gunas. When the primal equilibrium of sattva, rajas and tamas is disturbed, they begin to interact and creation begins. All three must be present in every aspect of creation because, with creation, the process of evolution begins and this needs two forces opposed to each other and one that is complementary to both. Sattva and tamas are opposed to each other, while rajas is the force complementary to both. Tamas destroys the created state; sattva creates a new state while the first is being destroyed. In this way, through the simultaneous processes of creation and destruction the process of evolution is carried on. The force of rajas plays a necessary but neutral part in creation and destruction; it maintains a bond between the forces of sattva and tamas. Thus all three gunas are necessary for any state of manifested life. 'The fourfold order': mathematically, the three gunas may combine with each other in slx possible ways: 1. Sattva dominates, rajas is secondary 2 Sattva dominates, tamas is secondary 3. Rajas dominates, sattva is secondary 4. Rajas dominates, tamas is secondary 5. Tamas dominates, sattva is secondary 6. Tamas dominates, rajas is secondary Combinations 2 and 5 are not possible because of the contrast in the nature of sattva and tamas. Thus the three gunas have only four possible combinations. This is the fourfold order in creation. Every species, whether vegetable, animal or human, is divided into four categories according to the four divisions of the gunas, which determine the natural mode of activity of each category. 'Non-doer': activity in all fields of life is caused by the three gunas.' The ultimate universal Being is the basis of the gunas; therefore it is said that the 'I' of the unmanifested omnipresent immutable Being is the Creator. He is the Creator and at the same time, ever remaining established in His own Being, is uninvolved, 'the non-doer'. This may be further clarified by an example. Oxygen and hydrogen ions combine to give rise to the properties of water. The water freezes, giving rise to the properties of ice. In these different states of gas, liquid and solid, the basic elements, oxygen and hydrogen -- remain the kame. Inasmuch as they are the fundamental material from which gas, water and ice are formed, oxygen and hydrogen could be said to have created these different substances. But because they remain oxygen and hydrogen through their various stages, they could be said to be non-doing. Such is the state of ultimate Being. Lying at the base of all creation, it is the 'author' and, remaining unchanged, it is the 'non-doer' and 'immutable'. When the Lord says: 'know Me to be the non-doer', He is asking Arjuna to take his mind to the transcendental state of consciousness, beyond the field of the three gunas, and gain first-hand knowledge of the source of creation; to see for himself that absolute silence is the creative energy and intelligence of eternal Being, the fountainhead of all creative energy and intelligence in the relative field. In this verse, the Lord takes upon Himself the authorship of creation, at the same time declaring His absolute immutable nature. Being almighty, He is able to maintain His non-involved status even while giving rise to creation. The next verse further clarifies this idea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.14 Actions do not involve Me, nor have I any longing for the fruit of action. He who truly knows Me thus is not bound by actions. Anyone who has God-consciousness, constant awareness of the source of creation, will know by his own experience that it is transcendental in nature. That is why the Lord says: 'He who truly knows Me thus is not bound by actions'. 'Truly knows Me thus' means knows Me completely. Complete knowledge means knowledge on the basis of experience as well as understanding. 'Actions do not involve Me': it will be recalled from verse 28 of Chapter III that 'it is the gunas which act upon the gunas' while Being remains uninvolved. Again, it will be recalled from verse g of the present chapter that the activity of the Lord is not worldly, not within the field of the gunas; it is divine and takes place in His eternal freedom. The nature of the Lord as absolute has been brought out in verse 6. The uninvolved nature of the Lord is therefore perfectly clear. 'Nor have I any longing for the fruit of action': the Lord has already expressed His eternal state of contentment in Chapter III, verse 22. 'He who truly knows Me thus' means he who has thoroughly known My nature as absolutely uninvolved with actions as well as with their fruits. The word 'truly' is highly important. It means knowing by participation, indicating that a man has gained God-consciousness. The expression: 'nor have I any longing for the fruit of action' brings out by implication a feature common to the manifested and unmanifested spheres of life. Both eternally continue to be by virtue of the eternal nature of the almighty and supreme Lord. Precise knowledge of the non-involvement of the Supreme in the midst of the vast activity of unlimited creation can only dawn on the basis of one's own experience of the Self as uninvolved with the field of activity. Here is the sequence of realization of the true nature of the Lord: first, one realizes one's own Self as separate from activity and thus, gaining knowledge of the true nature of one's Self, surrenders all activity to the Lord and takes refuge in Him (verse lo). Then, in Unity with Him, one knows Him in His true nature as uninvolved with activity and without any longing for the fruits of action. This knowledge of the true nature of God results in eternal freedom from the binding influence of action. That is why the Lord says: 'He who truly knows Me thus is not bound by actions'. This verse presents one of the most important teachings of Sankhya. It reveals the non-involved nature of the Lord and, simply through the knowledge of this fact, promises liberation from bondage. This is the strength of Sankhya, which offers liberation through the path of knowledge. A similar teaching was contained in verse 28 of Chapter III. But there the argument was in terms of the knowledge of the three gunas, the knowledge of the relative field of activity; whereas in this verse it springs from the knowledge of the essential nature of the divine Being, personified by Lord Krishna, who is beyond the relative and the Absolute, beyond the Unity of Being and the diversity of creation, but holds within Himself the fullness of both. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.15 Having known this, even the ancient seekers of liberation performed action; therefore, do you perform action as did the ancients in olden days. 'Having known this' refers to the teaching of the two previous verses. In order to bring home to Arjuna that there could be a state of life in which the greatest activity would not disturb the eternal status of absolute Being, the Lord, in the two previous verses, gave an example of this state by referring to His own case. Seeing thus before him a living embodiment of the ideas which were being taught to him, Arjuna might then become convinced that he also could rise to this state in his own life. 'Ancient seekers of liberation': this expression refers to 'Janaka and others' The use of the phrase 'seekers of liberation' makes it clear that action is necessary even for those who have devoted their lives to the pursuit of Truth and are not interested in anything other than liberation. But, as the expression: 'Having known this' shows, knowledge about the real nature of the Lord is a pre-requisite for the activity of 'seekers of liberation'. When the seeker of liberation has attained cosmic consciousness and realized himself as separate from activity, he has reached his goal. He will be liberated from the bondage of action and, if he has no greater ideal before him, he will feel fulfilled. But if one feels fulfilled in the state of cosmic consciousness and does not aspire to God-consciousness, then one has missed the chance of the supreme attainment that is Union with God. For this reason, knowledge about the real nature of the Lord is essential even for the seekers of liberation. There is no doubt as to its necessity for the seekers of God. In this verse, the Lord wants to make clear that knowledge of the three gunas and their interplay should be supplemented by knowledge of the essential nature of the supreme Lord t in order that it may bring fulfillment to the state of liberation. 'Ancients in olden days': by this expression the Lord gives authority to His statement. The teaching is that the path of evolution that has withstood the test of time should not be doubted, because only that which is in accordance with the laws of evolution can last. Anything that does not conform to these laws is thrown off by nature. In the following verses the argument turns to a close analysis of action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.16 What is action, what inaction? Even the wise are bewildered here. I shall expound to you that action, knowing which you will be freed from evil. In the previous verse the Lord gave Arjuna reasons for action; so it is natural that in this verse He should bring out the gravity and far-reaching influence of action in order to prepare Arjuna's mind for the details of that action which will be useful to him and deliver him from all 'evil'. Ignorance of one's own blissful divine nature as non-involved and independent of activity keeps one under the binding influence of action, causing the complications and sufferings of life. The Lord says that 'even the wise are bewildered' over the issue of action and inaction. The wise man is he who has understood that action is by virtue of the three gunas and that he himself remains uninvolved because his true nature is transcendental. But such understanding, says the Lord, is not sufficient, for even the wise continue to be bewildered. The 'wise' have known the Self as separate from activity and thereby they have attained liberation. The Lord says that even the wise are bewildered over action and inaction. Gaining freedom from action is one thing; gaining full knowledge about action and inaction is quite another The Lord says in the next verse: 'Unfathomable is the course of action' It is impossible to know the full range of action on the level of intellectual understanding. That is why the Lord says: 'Even the wise are bewildered'. It may be recalled that while enlightening Arjuna with the wisdom of Sankhya in verse 38 of Chapter II, the Lord said: 'Having gained equanimity... you will not incur sin'; in the present verse He says: 'I shall expound to you that action, knowing which you will be freed from evil' A careful study of these expressions unfolds the ascending order of the Lord's teaching, as the capacity for understanding increases, the teaching is imparted in subtler yet simpler forms. In the earlier verse it is implied that something has to be done to gain the equanimity which will result in freedom from sin. in the present verse, the Lord shows that nothing has to be done, that simply by the knowledge of activity Arjuna will be freed from evil The teaching has shifted from the level of doing to the level of knowing. It may well be that, as the teaching advances, even knowing will be replaced by a simpler process on the common sensory level of hearing or seeing. This is the technique of teaching Sankhya a series of arguments will eventually culminate in some simple spoken word which will revolutionize the whole understanding of life and will once and for all raise a man to the state of eternal freedom from bondage. It is also of interest to note that the two preceding verses proclaimed liberation from bondage through knowledge of the non-involved nature of the transcendent Lord; whereas this verse promises freedom through knowledge even of the relative field, the knowledge of activity and non-activity. This knowledge is given in the following five verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.17 Action, indeed, should be understood, wrong action should also be understood and inaction should be understood as well. Unfathomable is the course of action. 'Action': to understand action it is necessary to know the different states of consciousness of the actor, because the value of action depends mainly upon the level of consciousness of the one who acts. The possible states of consciousness are : waking, dreaming, sleeping, transcendentaI consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. Action is here used to mean right action, which produces life-supporting effects for the doer and for the entire creation, action which helps the evolution of the individual and simultaneously serves the cosmic purpose. Such action is possible only when man's mind is in complete harmony with the transcendent Being, which underlies all creation and is the basis of all life and all the laws of nature. This is the case in cosmic consciousness. God-consciousness is another state where such action is automatically carried out. In cosmic consciousness, a man established in cosmic life performs action as an individual; in the state of God-consciousness, the individual's activity, set in the light of God, is on a level which corresponds to the level of cosmic activity. He lives the eternal Unity of life through all activity. 'Unfathomable is the course of action': one's natural activities in the three relative states of consciousness waking, dreaming and sleeping, are governed by the dharma of one's level of evolution. Dharma differs at different levels of evolution. Moreover, even on the same level dharma differs in different circumstances and in different spheres of life In all these differences there is the additional complexity that in each case dharma refers not only to activity as it affects the individual, but also as it affects the family, society, the nation and the world. Every thought, word or act sets up waves of influence in the atmosphere. These waves travel through space and strike against everything in creation. Wherever they strike they have some effect The effect of a particular thought on any particular object cannot be known because of the diversity and vast extent of creation. This complexity goes beyond the possibility of comprehension. That is why the Lord says: 'Unfathomable is the course of action'. 'Wrong action' can be of many kinds: actions that harm the doer in the present or the future; those that do not succeed; those that hinder evolution; those that lead to dissolution; those that bind the doer to the cycle of birth and death; those that produce life-damaging influences upon the surroundings and upon others; those that are against the laws of nature. Even the field of wrong action is thus found to be 'unfathomable'. Such wrong actions are possible so long as the doer is in a state of ignorance about his own dharma, so long as he is unaware of the essential nature of his own self, the nature of activity and the nature of God, and so long as his waking state of consciousness is not supported by transcendental pure consciousness. 'Inaction': absence of activity. Deep sleep is a state of inaction, but it is not the only such state. The state of inaction is also found in transcendental consciousness. Furthermore, inaction is an essential constituent of cosmic consciousness and also of God-consciousness, the highest state of human evolution. On the one hand inaction is the inertia of sleep, while on the other it becomes the basis of the living Reality of the whole cosmos. This is what the Lord means when He says: 'inaction should be understood as well'. This shows not only action but also inaction to be unfathomable. 'Indeed': by this word the Lord emphasizes the need for knowledge of action. Life means action, no one can escape activity. This being so, it is wise to know not only what one is going to do, but where, as a result, one is going to end up. It will be interesting to observe closely how the Lord, having admitted that the course of action is unfathomable and having emphasized that it has to be understood, manages to steer a fine course between these opposing facts. To justify His expression 'unfathomable', wisdom demanded that He did not enter upon an examination of the course of action. But the word 'indeed' demands that whatever way He adopts, whether He enters into detail or not, knowledge of action must be conveyed. The Lord adopts a mode of instruction whereby, without knowledge of the whole field of action, one can acquire every benefit that such knowledge could bestow. He brings to light the art of action whereby, without having to gain knowledge of action, one can enjoy the blessings which such knowledge would give. This art of action is like the art of a gardener who, by watering the root, makes the sap rise to every part of the tree without having to know anything about the mechanics of rising sap. Such is the marvel of perfection of this discourse The Lord has said that knowledge of action is necessary and yet, the course of action being unfathomable, knowledge of it must remain incomplete. He therefore brings to light a technique by which the effects of knowledge will be gained without the necessity for gaining the knowledge. This is because the Lord's teaching is not for the sake of knowledge as such; it is solely to produce a specific effect in Impractical life. What is important is the effect, not the knowledge. This is the discourse of Yoga Shastra, the most practical philosophy of Divine Union. Its purpose is to give the practical wisdom whereby any man may naturally gain the highest good through his activity. The following verses clarify this teaching, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.18 He who in action sees inaction and in inaction sees action is wise among men. He is unifed, he has accomplished all action. 'In action sees inaction': this means that while the mind is engaged with the senses and through them in the process of action, it is anchored to the silence of the inner Being. This anchorage provides the experience of silence in the midst of all activity. For the man who 'in action sees inaction', the permeation of the whole field of action by the non-active ever-silent Being is a living reality. Action for him does not overshadow the state of inaction, or Being, that underlies it. He lives the ever-silent Being that permeates all activities of senses, mind and body; he sees silence in activity and activity in silence. Here is a teaching which enables a man to enrich the liberation attained by the knowledge that 'it is the gunas which act upon the gunas'. It connects the active world of the three gunas with the silence of Being and thus, on the level of silence, establishes the co-existence of the ephemeral and the eternal. It confirms the ultimate teaching of the Upanishads: 'purnamadah, purnamidam', this manifested world of activity is full (purna), That life of absolute Being is full. Realization of this truth comes in the state of cosmic consciousness, but the teaching of this verse extends even to God-consciousness. The realization of complete Reality establishes a state of life lying beyond the Unity of the Absolute and the multiplicity of the relative and produces the wholeness of vision that holds this and That both together in the light of God, in God-consciousness. One who has achieved it is 'wise among men'. According to this phrase, 'men' are those who have realized either the truth of activity t or the truth of silence.' But 'wise' is he who has realized the truth of both, either in' the state of their separation in cosmic consciousness or in the state of their Union in God-consciousness. The definition of man given in this verse points to the conclusion that one who has not realized the truth of activity or the truth of silence does not deserve to be called a man It is therefore an essential feature of man's life that he should be established either on the path of knowledge or on the path of action. And if he wants to be 'wise', then he must also rise to embrace the goal of both. 'He has accomplished all action' means that in his individual life he has performed the whole range of activity, gross and subtle. Moreover, he has performed activity on the level of cosmic life as well. Activity on the individual level includes not only ordinary mental and physical activity but also the subtlest activity of transcending and gaining Union with divine Being. Activity on the cosmic level is of two types: first, activity in cosmic consciousness, which is fully in accordance with the process of evolution, and secondly, activity in God-consciousness, which is on the level of the ultimate Unity of life. 'He has accomplished all action' also means that he has attained perfection. Action is a way of fulfilling one's desires. To have 'accomplished all action' means to have accomplished all desires, indicating that one has gained fulfillment. It should be noted that the accomplishment of an action does not lie in gaining the fruit or action alone. It lies in gaining the fruit of action along with freedom from the binding influence of action and its results. The cognition of inaction in action and of action in inaction is the result of the fulfillment gained through the direct experience of absolute bliss, and of the eternal freedom from bondage that lies in the state of cosmic consciousness, where the Self is experienced as separate from activity. In this verse the sequence of expressions is highly important. In order to convey that 'he who in action sees inaction and in inaction sees action' is not insane, the Lord adds that such a man has better understanding than other people: he is 'wise among men'. Further, in order to indicate that this wise man is not just a theorizing man engaged in mere idealistic thinking, the Lord says: 'He is united', implying that he is a practical man, who has gained fulfillment in life. There are four expressions in this verse, each containing distinct and independent ideas : 1 In action sees inaction 2 In inaction sees action 3 Wise among men he is united 4 He has accomplished all action. It is interesting to observe that each of these thoughts is developed successively in the next five verses. The first thought of this verse is developed in the first thought of each of the other verses. The second, third and fourth thoughts of this verse likewise find their development in the corresponding second, third and fourth thoughts of the other five verses. The comparative study of these five verses presenting the science of action has been summarized at the end of the commentary on verse 23. The Lord gave Arjuna a vision of activity in inactivity and of inactivity in activity when, in verses 17 and 14, He referred to Himself as an example. That is why it is sufficient for this verse to make a statement of fact without entering into details and explanations. The following verses, however, discuss this point from the more concrete considerations of practical life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.19 He whose every undertaking is free from desire and the incentive thereof, whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge, him the knowers of Reality call wise. This verse presents the thought of the previous verse in a more developed form. In order to see inaction in action it is necessary to undertake action and yet to remain free from desire within oneself. A man's inner state 'free from desire' is a field of 'inaction'. This is how he 'whose every undertaking is free from desire' 'in action sees inaction' (verse 18). The Lord mentions the special qualities of the action of an enlightened man. The action must certainly have impetus and an effective start, but the 'wise' man is not motivated by personal attachment in beginning the action any more than during its process or at its completion. Nor does he depend upon its fruits. Thus through the whole range of action he is involved yet not involved. That is why the Lord says: 'whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge, him the knowers of Reality call wise'. The realized man does undertake activity but, by virtue of the knowledge that the Self is separate from activity, he remains free from the binding influence of action. This knowledge is compared here to a blazing fire which burns up all his action, in the sense that the action is set completely free from the binding influence of action or its fruits. 'Undertaking is free from desire': commonly a man begins an action only when he has become aware of the desire for it. The level at which a desire is appreciated differs according to the level of the conscious mind of the individual. Men of purer mind appreciate thought and desire at a much subtler level during the process of thinking. It should be understood that a thought starts from the deepest level of consciousness and develops into a desire when it reaches the conscious level of the mind. A man for whom the level of transcendental consciousness has become the level of the conscious mind appreciates the thought at its very start before it actually develops into a desire. His thought becomes transformed into action without expressing itself as a desire. This explains how, when a man succeeds in harmonizing his mind with transcendental consciousness, his 'every undertaking is free from desire'. This state of non-attachment is more advanced than that described in the previous verse, in which one sees inaction in action and action in inaction. As the practice of transcendental meditation advances, Being begins to become established in the nature of the mind and one begins to feel oneself as separate from activity. Activity is then found on the quiet level of inner awareness. This is how one naturally begins to appreciate silence and activity simultaneously. As the practice of meditation advances further, the silence of Being becomes appreciable even at the start of activity, so that a natural situation arises for every action to be 'free from desire and the incentive thereof'. It should be noted that the start of action engages the mind more deeply than action in progress. This is why the Self is first experienced as uninvolved during the process of action, and only when the practice is fairly well advanced does It begin to be appreciated as uninvolved at the start of action. Thus, with the growth of Being in the nature of the mind, a natural situation arises in which 'every undertaking' is on the level of the silence of Being, which in Its essential nature is bliss-consciousness. This bliss-consciousness provides a level of eternal contentment on the basis of which 'every undertaking is free from desire and the incentive thereof'. At this stage of the growth of Being into the nature of the mind, one feels unattached to the action both at its start and during its progress. But because every action is begun to accomplish some end, the purpose of an action engages the mind more deeply than does its start and progress; therefore non-attachment to the fruit of action demands a much fuller infusion of Being into the nature of the mind. By the time cosmic consciousness is gained, one has completely 'cast off attachment to the fruit of action' (verse 20). This, the most advanced state of non-attachment, eventually finds its fulfillment in God-consciousness, in which 'you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me' (verse 75). Every action depends upon the state of consciousness of the actor. Therefore if it is desired that all actions shall have a particular quality, it is necessary to produce a state of consciousness which will allow that quality of action to arise. The word 'every' is very important in this context. It includes the whole range of sensory and mental activity. It suggests that the state of man's consciousness should be such that any action undertaken by him at any time is naturally free from desire and its incentive. Such a state of consciousness is found in cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. A man for whom the level of transcendental consciousness has become the level of the conscious mind has gained cosmic consciousness, and in this state he experiences Being as separate from action. This experience creates a natural condition in which there is action on the surface and a state of inaction within. Desire is a link between the doer and the action. But when a natural state of separation is established between the doer and action, there exists no link between them. In such a situation between the doer and his action, desire has no place. This is how it is possible for 'every' undertaking to be free from desire. 'Free from. . the incentive thereof': in order to understand the incentive of desire, we must analyze the process of the formation of a desire. Experience results when the senses come in contact with their objects and an impression is left on the mind. The impulse of this new impression resonates with an impression of a similar past experience already present in the mind and associates itself with that impression. The coming together of the two gives rise to an impulse at the deepest level of consciousness, where the impressions of all experiences are stored This impulse develops and, rising to the conscious level of the mind, becomes appreciated as a thought. This thought, gaining the sympathy of the senses, creates a desire and stimulates the senses to action. In principle, the incentive of desire is due to the feeling of want. In the state of cosmic consciousness, where one finds eternal contentment within oneself and the field of activity is naturally separate from oneself, the Self is self-sufficient, It can have no want. In this state, therefore, every undertaking is free from the incentive of desire. The question may then be asked: What is responsible for initiating action in such a man? The answer is the almighty power of Nature, which is the cause of the vast and incessant activity of creation and evolution throughout the cosmos. Being forms the basis of nature When the mind comes into full unison with Being, it gains the very status of Being and thus itself becomes the basis of all activity in nature. Natural laws begin to support the impulses of such a mind: it becomes as if one with all the laws of nature. The desire of such a mind is then the need of nature, or, to put it in another way, the needs of nature are the motive of such activity. The Self has nothing to do with 'desire and the incentive thereof' This is how it becomes possible for 'every undertaking' to be naturally 'free from desire and the incentive thereof'. We must remember that the development of such a state of consciousness comes about through the presence of Being on the level of the conscious mind, the surface mind. There is no way to develop it through any process of thinking or understanding. The purpose of this verse is to give an explanation of this state; it does not describe the way to accomplish it. It would be quite wrong to imagine that by trying to eliminate desire and to reduce one's wants in order to lessen the incentive of desire, one could gain this natural state of non-attachment, which makes a man 'wise' in the eyes of the knowers of Reality. 'Fire of knowledge': awareness of Being as separate from the field of action. The actions of such an enlightened man are, therefore, not his actions; they are the actions of the three gunas (III, 28). He remains unattached, contented (IV, 20), his heart and mind disciplined (21), beyond the pairs of opposites (22) and liberated (23). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.20 Having cast off attachment to the fruit of action, ever contented, depending on nothing, even though fully engaged in action he does not act at all. In the commentary on the previous verse it was explained how, with the growth of cosmic consciousness, non-attachment becomes so profound that a man casts off even 'attachment to the fruit of action'. The present verse can be considered from another angle. When pure honey comes on the tongue, the taste of great sweetness surpasses in degree ail the sweet tastes experienced up to then. If the tongue continues to cherish the taste of honey, then there will be no chance for a previous sweet taste to recur. This is what happens when the mind lives permanently in the experience of transcendental bliss in the state of cosmic consciousness; there then remains no chance for impressions of past experiences to capture it. This is how the enlightened man has 'cast off attachment to the fruit of action' performed in the past. If one has the taste of concentrated sweetness on the tongue and then tastes other sweets, these tastes do not leave any significant impression. When a man, established in the bliss of the absolute Being, acts in the relative field of life, his experiences will not leave on the mind any deep impression which could give rise to future desires. In this way the cycle of action-impression-desire-action is broken. It is thus that, in an enlightened man, activity and experience in the world are debarred from sowing the seed of future action. This will be further clarified in the following verse. 'Even though fully engaged': his organs of action continue to perform their duties motivated by nature, and his senses of experience likewise remain engaged; in this way he is found acting. 'He does not act at all': his mind, established in the fullness of Being, remains uninvolved in activity. This is his state of life, outwardly engaged in activity, inwardly established in eternal silence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.21 Expecting nothing, his heart and mind disciplined, having relinquished all possessions, performing action by the body alone, he incurs no sin. 'Expecting nothing': the cause of anxiety and expectation is desire. The actions of the enlightened man have been declared to be 'free from desire and the incentive thereof' (verse 19). That is why he acts 'expecting nothing'. 'His heart and mind disciplined': see Chapter III, verse 43. 'Having relinquished all possessions' : this expression runs parallel with 'depending on nothing' (verse 20). The word 'possessions indicates all that one has gathered around oneself, everything other than one's own Self; relinquishing everything that is outside one's own Self means abandoning the whole field of relative existence, being 'without the three gunas'. 'Performing action by the body alone': it has been explained in the commentary on verse lg how the mind of the enlightened man remains unattached, even when he is performing actions on the level of the senses,' so that 'every undertaking is free from desire and the incentive thereof'. The mind of an enlightened man does not register deeply any impressions of actions performed by the body on the level of the senses; through all activities his mind remains ever fixed in Being. Established in the absolute purity of Being, he is out of the field of ignorance, out of the field of 'sin'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.22 Satisfied with whatever comes unasked, beyond the pairs of opposites, free from envy, balanced in success and failure, even acting he is not bound. This verse presents the picture of one who is liberated. 'Satisfied with whatever comes unasked': the enlightened man lives a life of fulfillment. His actions, being free from desire, serve only the need of the time. He has no personal interest to gain. He is engaged in fulfilling the cosmic purpose and therefore his actions are guided by nature. This is why he does not have to worry about his needs. His needs are the needs of nature, which takes care of their fulfillment, he being the instrument of the Divine. 'Beyond the pairs of opposites': beyond the three gunas. This expression applies equally to transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. Transcendental consciousness is absolute in nature, without any trace of duality. Cosmic consciousness accepts 'the pairs of opposites', but as completely separate from the Self. God-consciousness also accepts 'the pairs of opposites', but as inseparable from the Self, which in Its turn is inseparable from God. 'Free from envy': envy is a quality which disturbs one's equilibrium and allows one to be invaded by the dharma of a level of consciousness different from one's own. This is a great danger, for it is apt to throw a man off the path of his own evolution. One who is free from envy is free from this danger. Such a man is not tempted by anything, because he has risen to absolute freedom. To what more could he aspire? Having risen to the state of cosmic consciousness he could aspire to God-consciousness, and this might be thought to leave open a possibility for envy. But if a man of cosmic consciousness were to see a man of God-consciousness, he would be filled with love and devotion for him rather than envy his state. 'Balanced in success and failure': see Chapter II,verses 38, 48, 50. 'Even acting he is not bound': see Chapter III, verse 28. When the mind, through meditation, has become contented in the bliss of the Self, there is no possibility of discontent. Then there is evenness of mind both in pleasure and in pain. Such is the state of a liberated man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.23 He who is freed from attachment, liberated, whose mind is established in wisdom, who acts for the sake of yagya, his action is entirely dissolved. This verse demonstrates that when, through constant practice of meditation, a man has gained cosmic consciousness, when pure transcendental consciousness is grounded in the very nature of his mind, he becomes 'liberated' from the field of action and 'freed from attachment' In this state, every action produces life-supporting influences in creation and thus helps cosmic evolution; therefore every action is 'for the sake of yagya'. Thus the actions of one who practices transcendental meditation are worthy of being ranked as yagya. The four expressions of this verse conclude the development of the four expressions contained in each of the previous five verses. To illustrate this development, they are set out below: I. 'He who in action sees inaction' (18) 'He whose every undertaking is free from desire' (19) 'Having cast off attachment to the fruit of action' (20) 'Expecting nothing' (21) 'Satisfied with whatever comes unasked' (22) 'He who is freed from attachment' (23) II. 'In inaction sees action' (18) (He whose every undertaking is free from) 'the incentive thereof' (19) 'Ever contented' (20) 'His heart and mind disciplined' (21) 'Beyond the pairs of opposites, free from envy' (22) 'Liberated' (23) III. 'Is wise among men he is united' (18) 'Whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge' (19) 'Depending on nothing' (20) 'Having relinquished all possessions' (21) 'Balanced in success and failure' (22) 'Whose mind is established in wisdom' (23) IV. 'He has accomplished all action' (18) 'Him the knowers of Reality call wise' (19) 'Even though fully engaged in action he does not act at all' (20) 'Performing action by the body alone, he incurs no sin' (21) 'Even acting he is not bound' (22) 'Who acts for the sake of yagya, his action is entirely dissolved' (23). It is by reason of the teaching contained in these six verses that this fourth chapter is the chapter of wisdom, the wisdom of Karma Yoga and Sankhya at the same time. It reveals the state of a realized man on the level of action and behavior, thus presenting the practical aspect of the abstract metaphysical quest which confronts man on the path of his evolution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.24 Brahman is the act of offering. Brahman the oblation poured by Brahman into fire that is Brahman. To Brahman alone must he go who is fixed in Brahman through action. This verse does not teach that during the performance of ritualistic yagya, or any other type of action, one should hold in the Inind the idea that everything is Brahman. The teaching here concerns far deeper levels of life than the surface level of thinking and making moods. In the preceding verse it was said: 'who acts for the sake of yagya, his action is entirely dissolved'. These words are further explained in the present verse, which considers different aspects of action performed by the enlightened man. It speaks of that state of consciousness which realizes oneness of existence in all the diversity of action. In this verse and those following the Lord enumerates different aspects of the action of yagya and says thaf all aspects are Brahman. Certainly offering is offering, oblation is oblation, Fire is Fire and the performer is the performer, on the level of relative life duality prevails. Everything is Brahman only on the level of consciousness of the perFormer who is established in cosmic consciousness. What has been said in verses 19 to 23 leads to the conclusion that the enlightened man, established in bliss-consciousness at all times, irrespective of the engagement of the mind and senses in action, is intent on Brahman, while at the same time everything that action entails proceeds naturally at the level of the senses,t through the agency of the gunas. When the mind becomes infused with Being, then no thought, word or act can take the mind out of Being. This is the state of cosmic consciousness. The purpose of the present verse is to describe clearly the relationship of action to cosmic consciousness in which all actions form an integral part of that consciousness and are therefore appreciated as none other than that consciousness, none other than Brahman. The verse also implies that fixity in Brahman constitutes mastery over action and is at the same time the fulfillment of action. The Lord speaks of yagya in order to explain that the different parts of an action and the various modes of their performance do not leave any trace of bondage for the enlightened man. Ever established in the state of pure consciousness, or eternal Being, he is simply a silent and innocent witness of what is happening through him; he is a means through which nature fulfils its purpose of evolution. His actions are a response to the needs of the time. Quite naturally he performs actions which result in every kind of good. 'To Brahman alone must he go': Brahman is the Reality which embraces both the relative and absolute fields of life. Having gained the state of Brahman, a man has risen to the ultimate Reality of existence. In this state of enlightenment he has accomplished eternal liberation, and once a man has risen to this state there is no falling away from it. That is why the Lord says: 'To Brahman alone must he go who is fixed in Brahman through action'. The expression 'must he go' does not mean that on leaving the body he departs to some other place. The word 'go' here finds its meaning in the fact that, with the destruction of the body, the realized man is no longer found as an individual, and when someone is not to be found he is said to have gone. Where then has he gone? In order to explain his position in terms of going, it must be said that he has gone to Brahman; but in fact there is no question of going for him who is already 'fixed in Brahman', who has risen to the omnipresent Reality. He remains what he was, Brahman, but without the individual body. 'Who is fixed in Brahman through action': one rises to the state of Brahman in cosmic consciousness, where no activity, however vigorous, can take one out of Being. This state of fixity in Brahman is reached by the performance of activity after gaining the state of Being through the activity of meditation, the inward activity of meditation followed by the outward activity of daily life. Thus it is clear that it is 'through action' that one 'is fixed in Brahman'. This verse therefore not only describes the state of Brahman but also shows a direct way to its realization. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.25 Some yogis perform yagya merely by worshipping the gods, others by offering the yagya itself into the fire that is Brahman. 'Worshipping the gods' is said to be the performance of yagya. The Lord says that when this worship of the gods is offered to Brahman, such an offering is also performance of yagya. An analysis of how 'worshipping the gods' is offered to Brahman and how the offering to Brahman is the performance of yagya may make this clear. Cosmic consciousness is the state of Brahman. Since it is transcendental Self-consciousness that develops into cosmic consciousness, in order to achieve cosmic consciousness through worshipping, one has to transcend through worshipping. This necessitates entering into the subtle phases of the act of worship. And this is most successfully done in a systematic manner by taking the name or form of the god and experiencing it in its subtler states until the mind transcends the subtlest state and attains transcendental consciousness. Those who are highly emotional, however, may even transcend through an increasing feeling of love for the god during the process of making offerings. Transcending the act of worship is said to be the offering of the worship to Brahman. It has the advantage of receiving the blessings of the god and at the same time of helping to develop cosmic consciousness. By transcending, a worshipper arrives at the ultimate fulfillment of yagya and thereby develops cosmic consciousness, the state where his every action will prove to be yagya. All that concerns him will be helpful to evolution and, established in his Being, he will fulfill the purpose of life. That is why transcending the field of yagya to arrive at the state of Brahman also ranks as yagya. When a man has gained cosmic consciousness, all his actions assume the status of yagya. Because such action is performed in the state of Brahman, it is already on the level of Brahman. This is offering the yagya itself into the fire that is Brahman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.26 Some offer hearing and other senses in the fires of control; some offer sound and other objects of the senses in the fires of the senses. 'Fires': the plural is to indicate that there are different methods for controlling different senses. There are two types of people: those who keep their senses active, enjoying objects in the world, and those who practice different methods of control. The Lord refers to the second when he says the senses are offered in 'the fires of control'. The word 'control' has been interpreted by most commentators as implying restraint, and consequently they advocate forcible subjugation of the senses. But it is certainly not possible to put an end to the activities of the senses through the practice of refraining from feeding them. This has already been made clear by the Lord in verse 59 of the second chapter. Therefore it is obvious that the word 'control' means something other than restraint, something which will indeed have the strength to calm the senses. This is explained in two ways: first, as the proper use of the senses, which is the interpretation given in this verse; secondly, as the process of allowing all the senses to converge naturally upon one point and to remain there in the state of contentment. This second path is described in the next verse. 'Some offer sound and other objects of the senses in the fires of the senses': some people have their senses active in the outside world. this is using the senses rightly, for the experience of objects, excepting only those that are forbidden, is also considered to be the performance of yagya. Thus the meaning of this verse is clear Some turn their senses inwards through the practice of transcendental meditation and thus create a situation in which their senses automatically converge to Being, thereby naturally fulfilling the very purpose of control. Others do not meditate but keep their senses controlled by righteous action; by not allowing their senses to experience forbidden things, they too follow the path of yagya and evolve to reach the Supreme. This is a slow and difficult process; difficult because the basis of right action is pure consciousness. Right action without a proper basis is very hard, if not impossible. By transcendental meditation, however, it is easy to gain pure consciousness and thereby automatically to perform right action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.27 Others offer all the activities of the senses and of the life-breath in the fire of Yoga, which is self-control kindled by enlightenment. It is generally understood that the practice of self-control is necessary to bring enlightenment, this is clearly contrary to the Lord's teaching, which states specifically that 'self-control' is the result of the state of enlightenment. During the process of transcendental meditation, when the mind enters the subtler levels of experience, the activity of all the senses decreases and finally stops; the breath also becomes more refined and eventually comes to a standstill. This is the offering of 'all the activities of the senses and of the life-breath in the fire of Yoga'. 'Self-control kindled by enlightenment': self-control means the self remaining within itself without any deviation into the outer world. Control of the mind in its perfect state means the mind remaining within itself without any deviation into the outer world. A lesser degree of control of the mind would be deviation into the outer world in a desired direction. Similarly, control of the senses in its perfect state means the senses remaining in themselves without any deviation into the outer world. A lesser degree of sense-control would be deviation into the outer world in a desired direction. 'Self-control kindled by enlightenment' means a perfect state of control of the self, the mind and the senses. It means that in the state of enlightenment, or pure consciousness, in the state of Being, the mind and senses are set within themselves without any deviation into the outer world. This takes place in the transcendental state devoid of any activity. When, however, this transcendental state of consciousness becomes permanent and is transformed into cosmic consciousness, then the mind remains anchored to the state of Being and entertains activity in the outer world in the desired direction. This is how the mind, even while active, remains within the range of self-control. The senses always follow the pattern of the mind, so when the mind is in this state of self-control, the activity of the senses also remains quite spontaneously within the boundaries of self-control. This means that the senses automatically function in the right direction. This is how, by means of gaining the state of enlightenment, the 'activities of the senses and of the life-breath' are offered 'in the fire of Yoga' It is clear therefore that the 'fire of Yoga' has to be lit first, and only then the control follows. It should be noted that by virtue of this state of self-control on the cosmic level, the activity of the creation and evolution of cosmic life is spontaneously carried out by the nature of the three gunas, while cosmic Being, God, remains uninvolved with activity. This is a picture of the inner functioning of cosmic life; it shows with what spontaneity and precision, based on self-control, the activity of cosmic life is carried on. Here Yoga has been defined as the state of self-control spontaneously created by enlightenment, by the realization of the Self in transcendental consciousness, and therefore in the state of cosmic consciousness as well. God-consciousness is the supreme state of enlightenment. As this state is gained, self-control on the level of the individual life rises to self-control on the level of cosmic life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.28 Some likewise perform yagya by means of material possessions, by austerity and by the practice of Yoga; while other aspirants of rigid vows offer as yagya their scriptual learning and knowledge. Here the Lord describes material, bodily and mental methods of purification for the sake of evolution, for the sake of gaining freedom in cosmic consciousness and its fulfillment in God-consciousness. 'Yagya by means of material possessions' denotes giving away wealth to the deserving. It also means the performance of Vedic rituals by offering sacrificial fires. To perform yagya 'by austerity' means subjecting the body to heat, cold and other such sufferings for the sake of purification. 'By the practice of Yoga': see II, 45,50; III, 7. 'Offer as yagya their scriptural learning and know!edge': sit and meditate and transcend the field of learning; experience the transcendent Being, which is the goal of all learning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.29 Others again, who are devoted to breathing exercises, pour the inward into the outward breath and the outward into the inward, having restrained the course of inhalation and exhalation. Here the Lord explains to Arjuna that there is a class of seekers of Truth who try to realize through the process of breathing exercises. They induce 'the inward into the outward breath and the outward into the inward', thus restraining 'the course of inhalation and exhalation'. This practice results in the suspension of breathing, which brings the mind to stillness in the silence of bliss-consciousness, simultaneously culturing the nervous system to maintain this state of consciousness. That is why the practice of breathing exercises is included here as yagya. Transcendental meditation also fulfils the requirements of this verse, for during its practice the outgoing and ingoing breaths quite spontaneously begin to become more shallow. The flow of the outgoing breath becomes less, and the flow of the ingoing breath becomes less. This phenomenon of the simultaneous diminution of both has been described as the pouring of one into the other. This is how, through the practice of transcendental meditation, in a very easy manner, one pours 'the inward into the outward breath and the outward into the inward'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.30 Yet others, restricting their food, offer breaths into breaths. All these indeed are knowers of yagya, and through yagya their sins are cast away. When a man restricts his food, less oxygen is needed for metabolism, and therefore his breathing becomes more shallow. 'Restricting their food' means not feeding the senses with their objects, not engaging in the activity of action or even thought. This non-engagement in activity requires a reduction in metabolism, which in turn requires a reduction of respiratory activity. This, as has been explained in the previous verse, is what the Lord means by 'offer breaths into breaths'. All these are different ways of purifying oneself; that is why they are called yagya. Through their practice 'sins are cast away'. The Brahmabindu Upanishad declares that a huge mountain of sins extending for miles is destroyed by Union brought about through transcendental meditation, without which there is no way out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.31 Eating the remains of the yagya, which is nectar, they reach the eternal Brahman. This world, O best of Kurus, is not for him who offers no yagya, much less the world hereafter. Having described the various types of yagya in the previous verses (24-30) the Lord, in this verse, explains their result. Yagya is the process of purification. Every such process leaves the mind finer and thus more capable of transcending. When yagya is over,' the mind is purified and gains a higher level of consciousness. This eventually results in bliss-consciousness, which the Lord calls 'nectar'. The bliss remains,' as it were, when the yagya is over. Those who enjoy this bliss, says the Lord, 'reach the eternal Brahman', because it is this transcendental bliss-consciousness that, through continued practice, develops into cosmic consciousness and eventually into God-consciousness. The Lord says further that if a man does not perform yagya, he will be successful neither in this world nor hereafter. Unless the arrow is fully drawn back on the bow, it does not gain sufficient energy to shoot forward with great force; unless the mind is drawn inwards and brought to the extreme limit of its inward march, it does not become dynamic. And unless the mind becomes active and powerful, it certainly will not achieve success in the world. The Lord shows that the process of purification, or yagya, is necessary both for success in this world and to gain strength for success in the world hereafter. Of all the yagyas, the yagya of transcendental meditation is the most effective, for it is a direct means of bringing the mind to absolute purity and enabling it to contact the source of limitless life-energy and intelligence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.32 In this way yagyas of many kinds are set forth in the words of the Veda. Know them all as born of action. Thus knowing you will find release. The Vedas speak of various kinds of yagya which help the process of the evolution of man at different levels of life. The Lord means that the knowledge of the various yagyas, as found in the Vedas, is complete in itself; it has only to be adopted. To convey this, He says: 'Know them all as born of action'. Action is necessary to perform yagya: unless they are performed, yagyas will not yield any result. Theoretical knowledge of them has its value but does not in itself carry the fruits of yagya. The importance of action is emphasized here. The phrase: 'Know them all as born of action' suggests another point. The Lord wants to make it very clear to Arjuna that the knowledge of yagya, which He has been teaching in the previous verses and which has the authority of the Vedas is essential for success in this world and hereafter. But at the same time He indicates that this is not the final knowledge which will free him from bondage something more has to be known. While continuing in the activity of yagya, Arjuna should bear in mind that it is all in the field of activity and that Reality is transcendental. So one has not to remain permanently in the field of the activity of yagya. The knowledge that yagya is activity and that Reality is transcendental will certainly free a man. Here is an important point for the practice of transcendental meditation. The medium of attention must enable the mind to reach the Transcendent and realize the absolute state of Being. If the aspirant is not aware of this fact then, during his practice of meditation (yagya) when he finds that the medium of attention has disappeared, he will feel confused. To save him from such confusion, the Lord says that all the practices which bring enlightenment (yagyas) are in the field of activity, and that the goal is to transcend that field, to arrive at transcendental consciousness, gain cosmic consciousness and ultimately rise to the consummation of all action in the state of Unity in God-consciousness. The following verse throws more light on this point. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.33 Better than the yagya through material means is the yagya of knowledge, O scorcher of enemies. All action without exception, O Partha, culminates in knowledge. 'Yagya through material means': see verse 28. 'Yagya of knowledge' means action that leads to knowledge. Yagya of 'material means' is performed through material offerings, whereas yagya of knowledge is performed through mental activity mental activity leading to the state of transcendental consciousness, and also the mental activity of understanding of the Transcendent. Knowledge in its content is God-consciousness, which develops from the state of cosmic consciousness, which in its turn develops from the knowledge (understanding and experience) of transcendental consciousness. Action is a means of evolution, and evolution gains its highest peak when man has attained Unity with God, God-consciousness. In this state of fulfillment there is nothing that he need do. He has arrived at the goal of all actions. All means come to an end as a matter of course when the goal is reached. Any form of yagya aims at a certain degree of purification. When pure consciousness has been permanently achieved, when the Self has been realized as separate from activity, and when God-consciousness has been gained, then the extreme limit of purification has been achieved. Having achieved it, a man naturally feels fulfilled in eternal freedom. This state of fulfillment is the goal of all action, the goal of all yagya. That is why the Lord says that knowledge is a field towards which all actions converge and in which they finally become merged: 'All action without exception, O Partha, culminates in knowledge'. The Lord's discourse is an example of great psychological skill. Gradually (from verse 23 to this verse) He builds up the importance of yagya, the path to enlightenment. When He has established the greatness of it, He suddenly says that this is all in the field of action, thereby implying first that it is within the reach of every man, and secondly that no man should remain held up within the field of action, or yagya, for it is not the final goal of life. Having pointed this out, the Lord, in this verse, immediately concludes His account with the statement that knowledge is the goal of all actions. Yagya through material means can at best raise the level of consciousness in the relative field of life. Yagya of knowledge transforms the entire human mechanism into a means by which the Divine expresses Itself in the world. Because there could be no state of evolution greater than this, 'the yagya of knowledge', leading as it does to this state, is better than 'yagya through material means'. When the Lord lays stress on knowledge as against action, He addresses Arjuna as 'scorcher of enemies', as one engaged in vigorous activity. This is to show him that it is through knowledge that life can be made most dynamic. In the verse which follows, the Lord indicates a direct way to search for this 'knowledge'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.34 Know this: through homage, repeated inquiry and service, the men of knowledge who have experienced Reality will teach you knowledge. Here is the process of gaining enlightenment from the enlightened. By 'homage' is meant submission or surrender. This serves to produce a state of receptivity. In the state of submission, the heart and mind set aside their own ways of feeling and thinking; they become free from all that overshadows their potentiality and become fully receptive to the enlightened man, the embodiment of knowledge. Submission is a means of depriving the seeker quite naturally of his limited individuality and overcoming in him any resistance that prevents him from opening himself to the cosmic Being. In this verse the seeker of Truth is advised to submit to the enlightened man and not merely to have a sense of submission to cosmic Being. This is because submission to omnipresent Being, having no concrete point of focus, remains abstract and indefinite and does not crystallize into concrete results. Direct submission of the individual intellect to the cosmic intelligence takes place only in the state of transcendence. In the field of relativity, submission on the level of thinking and understanding demands a specific point of focus if it is to be valid and productive of results. The second point in the process of reaching enlightenment is that the intellect should be alert, so that discrimination, or the ability to understand different aspects of Reality, is sharp. This is necessary because the state of full enlightenment includes a clear understanding of Reality, and this again can only be accomplished by an intellect which is alert and sharp, discriminating and decisive. The state of intellectual alertness conflicts with the state of submission. This conflict is resolved by what the Lord calls 'service'. 'Service' means action in accordance with the desire of the master. A sense of service has little to do with the nature of the work itself, but is primarily concerned with the fulfillment of the master's desires; if the master is pleased, service is successful. If he is pleased by the accomplishment of the work, then the service is done and the work has accomplished its purpose. If, in the middle of the work, the master wants it undone, then the success of the service will demand obedience This art of service covers those states of submission anil. alertness of intellect which are necessary for enlightenment. A right sense of service trains the mind of the seeker to adiust itself to the status of the integrated mind of the enlightened man. In order to be successful in the art of service, one has to adiust one's mind, one's likes and dislikes, to bring them into accord with the mind of the master. One does something and then closely watches to see whether he is pleased or displeased. Then one adjusts one's actions accordingly. This does more than merely hold together submission and alertness of intellect. By adjusting itself to the likes and dislikes of the enlightened cosmic mind of the master, the ignorant mind of the seeker gradually gains that same status. Thus we find submission, questioning and service, all these three, are complementary and create a situation favorable to enlightenment. Commenting on this verse, Shankara says: 'Know by what means it is gained. Having approached the teachers humbly, fall down and prostrate yourself before them, paying them prolonged homage. Ask them what is bondage and what liberation, what is wisdom and what ignorance. Perform service for the master Pleased by these and other signs of reverence, the teachers, who know the Truth from the scriptures and have also realized It through direct personal experience, will declare to you this knowledge.' The result of this knowledge is shown in the next verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.35 Knowing this, O son of Pandu, you will no more fall into such delusion; for through this you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me. 'Knowing this': having gained the knowledge given in the preceding verses. 'You will no more fall into such delusion': here the Lord gives Arjuna the technique of rising above the possibility of delusion. The field of the duality of life alone can be the field of delusion. When, in the state of cosmic consciousness, one has realized the Self as separate from activity, and when this state has developed to the eternal Unity of God-consciousness, then you see 'all beings in your Self and also in Me'. In this state of oneness of life, oneness of God-consciousness, there is no trace of duality and therefore there is no possibility of any delusion. The teaching is: cultivate the state of Unity in God-consciousness; cultivate this state of knowledge so that you will no more fall into such delusion. The word 'such' is highly significant. It indicates a special state of delusion, Arjuna's delusion in particular delusion in the state of sattva. Thereby the Lord silently educates Arjuna in the philosophy of delusion: any delusion experienced in the state of tamas can be overcome with the increase of rajas; likewise, delusion experienced in the state of rajas can be overcome with the rise of sattva; but a delusion in the state of sattva, as in Arjuna's case, cannot be overcome unless one transcends the field of sattva and gains transcendental consciousness. Here the qualities of the heart and mind find a common goal, thereby dissolving the duality of their separate existences and rising above the possibility of delusion. It is not physically possible, however, to remain in the Transcendent at all times. Therefore it is necessary to make this transcendental consciousness permanent and to rise to the state of cosmic consciousness. In this state of cosmic consciousness one experiences one's Self as separate from activity. It might appear that in this state one was living a duality, the duality of Being and activity; but this type of duality, in which the Self remains detached from everything, is free from the possibility of delusion. But the Lord wishes Arjuna to rise above duality even of this nature. In order that he may do so, He emphasizes the importance of gaining knowledge of Unity in God-consciousness, which results from devotion in the state of cosmic consciousness. By the practice of the teaching in the previous verse, the heart and mind of the seeker are automatically refined to become capable of devotion; this devotion develops God-consciousness, in which Unity becomes a living reality of life, and the possibility of any kind of duality is completely eliminated. 'You will see all beings in your Self and also in Me': when one sees through green spectacles, then everything looks green. When, through knowledge, the Self is realized as separate from activity and Self-consciousness becomes permanent in the state of cosmic consciousness, then everything is naturally experienced in the awareness of the Self; and when this permanent state of Self-consciousness, or cosmic consciousness, has been transformed through devotion into God-consciousness, then everything is naturally experienced in the awareness of God, every experience is through God-consciousness, everything is experienced and understood in the light of God, in terms of God, in God. Seeing 'all beings' includes knowledge of the whole field of the universe constituted by the three gunas; and seeing 'Me' means seeing the Lord presiding over both the Absolute and the relative. Thus seeing 'all beings in your Self and also in Me' implies having a complete knowledge of both the absolute and relative fields, of the relationship between them and of God presiding over them both. Seeing all beings in the Self is the start of the transformation of cosmic consciousness into God-consciousness, and this transformation comes to completion when all beings are seen in God. First, all beings are seen in the Self, and then the Self is seen in God. That is why the Lord says: 'you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me ' The two ideas in one phrase not only describe the two states but also the sequence in which they develop. In the state of cosmic consciousness, the Self is experienced as separate from activity. This state of life in perfect non-attachment is based on bliss-consciousness, by virtue of which the qualities of the heart have gained their most complete development. Universal love then dominates the heart, which begins to overflow with the love of God; the silent ocean of bliss, the silent ocean of love, begins to rise in waves of devotion. The heart in its state of eternal contentment begins to move, and this begins to draw everything together and eliminate the gulf of separation between the Self and activity. The Union of all diversity in the Self begins to grow. The intensity of this Union cultures man's consciousness, which begins to find everything inseparable from the Self; and this is how, in the most natural manner, the Self, which held Its identity as separate from all activity in the state of cosmic consciousness, finds everything in Itself. This happens on the way to God-consciousness, which in its completeness absorbs even the Self, containing all things. Beings separate themselves from the supreme Being by means of prakriti, but this veil is removed when life is dominated by the light of knowledge, the light of the awareness of life's Unity in God-consciousness, which establishes eternity in the ephemeral world. This seeing of everything in God is not restricted to the limitations of vision; it is on the level of life as a whole; it is on that high level of life which corresponds to the Life of God Himself. Fortunate is man that he can rise to the Life of God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.36 Even if you were the most sinful of all sinners, you would cross over all evil by the raft of knowledge aIone. Having, in the preceding verse, extolled knowledge for its effectiveness in destroying delusion, the Lord now speaks of its effectiveness in destroying sin. The special value of this knowledge lies in the fact that it eliminates the necessity for gaining knowledge about wrong action. The silent teaching here is that knowledge of the Divine is necessary and not knowledge of action, wrong action and inaction as referred to in verse 17. This becomes all the more apparent in the light of the following verse, where the Lord explains that all actions are burned to ashes by the fire of knowledge. 'You would cross over all evil by the raft of knowledge alone': the word 'alone' indicates that nothing other than knowledge is necessary for a man to 'cross over all evil'. How one goes beyond evil in the state of enlightenment should be properly understood. It has been said in verse 35 that knowledge takes a man beyond delusion and moulds his life in the oneness of God-consciousness. In this state one's life is on the supreme level of existence, being united with the Lord of all. All the laws of nature respond favourably to such a life, for it is in tune with the almighty invincible force of Nature, which is working out the evolution of everything in creation. In such a state a man's every thought, word and action produce a life-supporting influence for himself and for the whole universe. This is a state of life where no wrong action is possible. In this state one has crossed over all evil by the raft of knowledge. 'Knowledge' is irresistible, for no one can resist himself. The state of knowledge at one level is the state of one's own Self, transcendental consciousness. At another, it is the state of the Self in the midst of activity, cosmic consciousness. At yet another, it is the state of God-consciousness. Enlightenment is irrespective of anything in the relative field; nothing can be an obstacle to enlightenment. However dense the darkness and however long it may have existed, one ray of the rising sun is enough to dispel the darkness, though it takes time to reach the brightness of the mid-day sun. Even a momentary flash of transcendental consciousness is enough to dispel the delusion of ignorance, though it takes time to gain full enlightenment in God-consciousness, where one has crossed over all evil by the raft of knowledge. This brings hope even to a man whose life may be full of wrong-doing. Sin produces coarseness in the nervous system, preventing it from functioning normally and obstructing its ability to give rise to pure consciousness. Such an impaired state of the nervous system prevents Being from directly influencing the field of activity. This is how, by attacking the physical structure of the nervous system and thus preventing pure consciousness from being lived in daily life, sin causes sorrow and suffering. Knowledge, in eliminating this possibility, at the same time roots out all possibility of sorrow and suffering. This verse recommends taking refuge in knowledge in order to rise above the possibility of any sin in life and promises redemption even to the worst sinner in the world. While in this verse the Lord promises release from the bondage of any wrong action through knowledge, in the following verse He promises the actual annihilation of all action in the fire of knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.37 As a blazing fire turns fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge turn all actions into ashes. 'Knowledge': that by which all 'sins are cast away' (verse 70)1 and that by which 'you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me' (verse 35). Knowledge means awareness, which in its nature is pure consciousness; this state of knowledge is devoid of any activity. That is why the Lord says that 'the fire of knowledge' turns 'all actions into ashes'. When this state has become permanently established in the nature of the mind, the Self is experienced as separate from activity and its fruits (verse lg). This is how the fire of knowledge, the fire of cosmic consciousness, turns 'all actions into ashes'. When this state of consciousness, the state of knowledge, reaches its consummation in God-consciousness, the separation of the Self from activity dissolves into oneness of the Self and activity. Thus in its supreme state also the fire of knowledge turns 'all actions into ashes'. When the Lord said in verse 33 that 'all action . . . . culminates in knowledge', He explained that once knowledge has been gained, actions have come to an end, they have fulfilled their final purpose. In this situation man has risen to a state of consciousness above the reach of activity; all activity, mental and physical, is carried out under the direct influence of the forces of nature, which are unconcerned with the consciousness of the doer. The doer finds himself established on a level of life which has nothing in common with the field of action. In this state, the action that is performed ceases to be, ceases to engage the consciousness of the actor. This is what the Lord means when He says that 'the fire of knowledge' turns 'all actions into ashes'. 'All actions': this expression has both a qualitative and a quantitative meaning and also includes the range of time, past, present and future. The impressions of past actions, which serve as the seed for future actions, become like roasted seeds, losing their potency. This is how the actions of the past are burnt in 'the fire of knowledge'. Actions performed in the present remain on the level of the mind and senses; they do not touch the depths of the mind anchored to Being, and therefore no deep impressions are created to be stored as the seed for future actions. This is how actions performed in the present are burnt in 'the fire of knowledge', completely eliminating the basis of future actions. This puts an end to the cycle of cause and effect in the field of action; and` this in turn puts an end to the cycle of birth and death, bringing eternal freedom to life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.38 Truly there is in this world nothing so purifying as knowledge; he who is perfected in Yoga, of himself in time finds this within himself. 'Nothing so purifying as knowledge': the work of a purifier is first to purify the different ingredients or components and then, having freed the components from impurities, to present the whole compound in its pure state. Knowledge is the purifier of life. It purifies life in the sense that it analyses the different aspects of existence and distinguishes and separates the eternal aspects from the transient It acts like a filter to clear the mud from muddy water The real nature of life is absolute bliss-consciousness; this crystal water of life has been polluted by becoming mixed with the activities of the three gunas. This has resulted in masking the eternity of life behind its transient and ever-changing aspects. The pure state of Being is realized by knowing the relative and the absolute components of life. This knowing comes to perfection when the knower gains perfect intimacy with Being and becomes fully aware of the basic activity of life, the activity of the three gunas as separate from Being. Perfect intimacy with Being is gained when the mind gains the transcendental state of consciousness. This is the absolute state of knowledge, which can be described as the state of knowingness. When knowledge becomes perfect, it arrives at the state of knowingness and brings life to perfect purity. In this way knowledge removes ignorance, which is the greatest impurity of life, and takes life out of the cycle of birth, death and suffering. The superficial aspect of knowledge is knowing and understanding; the real nature of knowledge is the state of knowingness, the state of pure consciousness, or Being. Considering knowledge in this way, we find that transcendental consciousness represents the real nature of knowledge. Another phase of knowledge is where transcendental consciousness co-exists with the activity of the waking state of consciousness. In this state, when transcendental consciousness becomes permanently established in the very nature of the mind, the absolute and relative phases of life begin to be appreciated simultaneously: the Self is experienced as separate from activity. There is yet another state of knowledge in which the separateness of the Self and activity dissolves into the Unity of God-consciousness, which is the most purified state of life, free from any stain of impurity. Such a life in absolute purity represents the supreme state of knowledge, about which the Lord says: 'he who is perfected in Yoga, of himself in time finds this within himself'. It may be added that only through transcendental meditation, which is the direct way to gain pure consciousness and rise finally to God-consciousness, can absolute purity be lived in daily life. When the state of Yoga, the state of transcendental consciousness, becomes permanent so that it maintains itself throughout all activity, one has reached the state of cosmic consciousness. Such perfect infusion of the Absolute into relativity takes place by degrees, through the regular practice of going to the Transcendent and coming back to the field of action in daily life. A balanced alternation of meditation and activity results in full realization. One analogy will make this clear: we dip a white cloth in a yellow dye and let it remain in the dye to be colored for a few minutes. Then we take it out and expose it to the sun till the colour begins to fade. We repeat the same process, again putting the cloth into the sunlight till the colour fades. Similarly, we meditate for about half an hour and follow this by coming out to act in practical life for about ten hours, by which time we begin to feel that we are out of the influence of the morning meditation. We meditate again in the same way and again let the influence fade by coming out into practical life; we keep repeating the process of gaining the state of universal Being in transcendence (samadhi) during meditation and of coming out to regain individuality in the field of relative existence. This allows more and more infusion of Being into the nature of the mind even when it is engaged in activity through the senses. When the full infusion of Being has been accomplished, then the state of cosmic consciousness has been gained. The state of cosmic consciousness provides the basis for the development of the state of perfected Yoga in God-consciousness. The development of cosmic consciousness into God-consciousness requires that the separation found to exist between the Self and activity be transformed into a fusion of these two separate identities, resulting in the eternal Unity of God-consciousness. This transformation of the state of separation takes place by virtue of the most refined activity of all, the activity of devotion to God. In order to analyze the way in which the act of devotion effects this transformation and produces the state of eternal Unity in God-consciousness, it is necessary to examine closely how, in the state of cosmic consciousness, the Self is experienced as separate from activity; how the eternal silence of transcendental Self-consciousness becomes compatible with the incessant activity of the waking state of consciousness. Those practising transcendental meditation experience a slowing down of the metabolism during the inward stroke of meditation; they experience that the nervous system comes to a state of restful alertness when the mind transcends thought and gains transcendental consciousness. Again, they experience that the nervous system becomes active when it engages itself in the activity of thought or action. Any state of consciousness is the expression of a corresponding state of the nervous system. Transcendental consciousness corresponds to a certain specific state of the nervous system which transcends any activity and is therefore completely different from that state of the nervous system which corresponds to the waking state of consciousness. Now, for transcendental consciousness to become permanent and to co-exist with the waking state of consciousness, it is necessary that the two states of the nervous system corresponding to these two states of consciousness should co-exist. This is brought about by the mind gaining alternately transcendental consciousness and the waking state of consciousness, passing from one to the other. This gradual and systematic culture of the physical nervous system creates a physiological situation in which the two states of consciousness exist together simultaneously. It is well known that there exist in the nervous system many autonomous levels of function, between which a system of co-ordination also exists. In the state of cosmic consciousness, two different levels of organization in the nervous system function simultaneously while maintaining their separate identities. By virtue of this anatomical separation of function, it becomes possible for transcendental consciousness to coexist with the waking state of consciousness and with the dreaming and sleeping states of consciousness. In the early stages of the practice of transcendental meditation, these two levels of function in the nervous system are unable to occur at the same time; the function of the one inhibits the function of the other. That is why, at this stage, either transcendental consciousness or the waking state of consciousness is experienced. The practice of the mind in passing from one to another gradually overcomes this physiological inhibition, and the two levels begin fo function perfectly at the same time, without inhibiting each other and still maintaining their separate identities. The function of each is independent of the other, and that is why this state of the nervous system corresponds to cosmic consciousness, in which Self-awareness exists as separate from activity. Silence is experienced with activity and yet as separate from it. In order to develop cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness, the nervous system needs to be cultured further so that these two levels, ;yhich function independently, come to function in an integrated manner. This will give rise to a state of consciousness in which the sense of separation between the Self and activity is dissolved, and this duality constituting cosmic consciousness is subsumed into the Unity of God-consciousness. This integration of functions on the physiological level is brought about by a mental activity of ultimate refinement. In order to define activity of this quality, we must analyze the whole range of activity. The activity of the organs of action is the most gross, the activity of the senses of perception is more refined, the mental activity of thought is finer still, and the activity of feeling and emotion is the finest of all. One could further classify different levels of quality in emotional activity, such as anger, fear, despair, happiness, reverence, service and love. The activity of devotion comprises the feelings of service, reverence and love, which are the most refined qualities of feeling. It is through the activity of devotion that cosmic consciousness develops into God-consciousness. When the nervous system is constantly exposed to this most refined activity of devotion, the physiological integration of functions that has been described takes place. And it is the permanent state of this condition of the nervous system that enables a man to live God-consciousness in his daily life; acting in the midst of all sorts of circumstances, fulfilling the purpose of cosmic life, he carries the totality of existence within himself and moves in the Unity of God. From this it is clear that to develop God-consciousness, which represents the supreme state of knowledge, it is necessary to culture the physical nervous system. This requires regular and sustained practice, which obviously needs time. That is why the Lord says 'in time finds'. 'Within himself': by this expression the Lord wishes it to be clearly understood that the supreme state of knowledge is not gained from outside It is gained within oneself, when one has lived for some time the perfected state of Yoga in God-consciousness. The element of time indicates here that during the early stages of God-consciousness life is full of such overwhelming experience of Unity in diversity that one lives deeply lost in it. Gradually as time passes one begins to appreciate this Unity in terms of other things and activities in the world. It is then that one has realized God, that one has the knowledge of God. Thus it becomes clear why the Lord speaks of the necessity for time in gaining supreme knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.39 He gains knowledge who is possessed of faith, is active of purpose and has subdued the senses. Having gained knowledge, swiftly he comes to the supreme peace. 'Knowledge': awareness of Unity in the midst of the diversity of life. When this awareness has become complete, it is said to be God-consciousness. To rise from the waking state of consciousness to God-consciousness, one has to pass through the states of transcendental consciousness and cosmic consciousness. In the sequence of development, one state leads to another in the order of waking, transcendental, cosmic and God-consciousness. They are as different one from another as spectacles of different colours through which the same view looks different. When the same object is cognized in different states of consciousness, its values are differently appreciated. Life is appreciated differently at each different level of consciousness. As the mind passes through all these states, it has to undergo various new experiences which, in the absence of faith, can easily be misunderstood at any step. That is whv the Lord names faith as a pre-requisite to knowledge. There are three fields of faith: faith in oneself, faith in the teacher and faith in God. Faith in oneself is necessary so that one does not begin to doubt one's own experience. Faith in the teacher enables one to accept the fundamentals of the teaching; if in the absence of faith the basic principles of the teaching are rejected, one can neither derive any benefit from it nor verify its truth, since the truth of the teaching can be verified only by personal experience which arises from the practice given by the teacher Faith in God protects man's heart and mind and ensures that steady progress which is so important in the life of a seeker. Faith provides an anchor in life, not only for the seeker of Truth but for any man. It is needed for any accomplishment in life; for greater accomplishment it is needed in greater measure; for ultimate fulfillment in God-consciousness the greatest faith is needed. Meditation is a process which provides increasing charm at every step on the way to the Transcendent. The experience of this charm causes faith to grow. Moreover, the regular practice of meditation brings the great blessings of harmony and joy to life; this too helps the heart and mind to grow in faith and keeps a man 'active of purpose' on the path to enlightenment, and thus stability is gained on the way. The activity of the senses also becomes balanced and natural. Thus, when a man begins the practice of transcendental meditation, he fulfils the conditions necessary for enlightenment. The first ray of the rising sun is enough to dispel the darkness of the night, and yet it takes some time for the sun to become fully risen. Through meditation, the mind reaches transcendental consciousness quickly and is enlightened by the first ray of the Divine; yet to allow this transcendental divine consciousness to shine forth through all circumstances, through waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep, regular practice of meditation is absolutely essential. Meditation takes the mind to transcendental Self-consciousness, and a natural and balanced activity infuses the transcendental divine nature into the mind, where it is not lost even when the mind is engaged in the field of activity. In this way, Self-consciousness grows to cosmic consciousness, Atmananda to Brahmananda, savi-kalpa samadhi to nirvikalpa, and eventually this state of Yoga, cosmic consciousness, attains its fulfillment in God-consciousness; the first ray of enlightenment reaches its full glory. This verse emphasizes the need for a man to be 'active of purpose' and to have a natural balanced activity of the senses and the mind in addition to faith. All these, combining harmoniously, help to produce devotion, that highest quality in a seeker by which he accomplishes the final stage of his evolution. These taken together create a situation for the unfolding of the supreme Reality in its all-embracing nature, raising the limited status of the individual to the unbounded status of cosmic consciousness and eventually to that Unity of life in God-consciousness which eternally satisfies the mind and heart. Having gained this, a man in time gains knowledge, through which he becomes free from any doubt or delusion. This is that state of 'supreme peace' where the heart rests in eternal contentment and the mind is filled with the Unity of life, where there is no trace of duality and therefore peace is abiding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.40 But the man who is without knowledge, without faith and of a doubting nature perishes. For the doubting mind there is neither this world nor another nor any happiness. The sequence of expressions is highly important in giving insight into the teaching. Lack of knowledge is the basis of lack of faith, which in turn is the basis of 'a doubting nature' Therefore it is lack of knowledge, or the state of ignorance,. which is at the root of all failure in material advancement and spiritual development. Ignorance is the source of all weakness and suffering in life. The teaching is that one must cast off ignorance and rise to the state of knowledge in order to win all happiness and progress in this world and hereafter. In view of what has been said about the preceding verse, the significance of this verse is obvious. Yet one must remember that it is the ignorant who become enlightened, for meditation is a process which reveals Reality to the ignorant. One thing may be added here: no man could ever be completely devoid of faith and completely full of doubt, and no man could be completely ignorant of Reality. Moreover, the practice of transcendental meditation is such that it can be started from whatever level of faith a man may have, for it brings faith to the faithless and dispels the doubts in the mind of the sceptic by providing direct experience of Reality. The previous verse demanded faith for the sake of gaining knowledge. This verse says that lack of faith results from ignorance. This apparent contradiction establishes the principle that faith and knowledge are interdependent from the most elementary to the most advanced stage, each deriving inspiration from the other while at the same time helping the other's growth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.41 He who has renounced action by virtue of Yoga, O winner of wealth, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, who is possessed of the Self, him actions do not bind. 'He who has renounced action by virtue of Yoga': 'he who in action sees inaction' (18); 'whose every undertaking is free from desire' (19); 'having cast off attachment to the fruit of action' (20); 'Expecting nothing' (21), 'satisfied with whatever comes unasked' (22); 'freed from attachment, liberated.. his action is entirely dissolved' (23). Here Yoga means Karma Yoga. When, by the practice of Karma Yoga, the practice of transcendental meditation supplemented by activity, one begins to live Being together with activity, one experiences it as separate from activity, and this experience of separation of one's Self from activity is called renunciation. Renunciation is thus gained automatically through the practice of Yoga. It may be noted that this state of renunciation is not limited to the mental level of thinking or the intellectual level of understanding: it is on the level of Being, on the level of life itself. It is a living reality for the realized man in cosmic consciousness. 'Whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge': 'he...is wise among men. . . he is united' (18); 'whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge' (19), 'ever contented' (20); 'his heart and mind disciplined' (21); 'balanced in success and failure' (22); whose mind is established in wisdom' (23); 'so does the fire of knowledge turn all actions into ashes' (37). Having stated that renunciation is achieved through the practice of Karma Yoga, the Lord here clarifies a very practical point on the path of enlightenment. As the practice of Karma Yoga advances, one begins to feel one's Self as separate from activity. This experience brings with it a feeling of confusion, One finds oneself active and yet inwardly one feels somewhat aloof from activity. Doubts begin to arise in the mind, and the intellect seeks for some explanation of the situation. Right understanding about the ultimate Reality is provided by the teaching of the preceding forty verses; when a man attains cosmic consciousness, the knowledge that Being is independent and separate from activity confirms that his experience is valid. It is this knowledge that removes all doubt about the nature of Reality. Without proper understanding, even the direct experience of eternal freedom may be found to create confusion and fear. The glory of knowledge is extolled here. 'Possessed of the Self': this is said of him 'who has renounced action by virtue of Yoga' and 'whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge'. Someone who experiences himself as uninvolved with activity but has no clear understanding of this experience remains confused by it; in this state he fails to live Being fully, fails to possess the Self in Its full glory and grace. 'Possessed of the Self' indicates fixity in the Self for all time, the state of cosmic consciousness. Of such a man the Lord says: 'him actions do not bind'; because he is no more involved with actions, he ceases to identify himself with his activity. He has identified himself: with eternal Being, he is 'possessed of the Self'. Various implications of the expression 'possessed of the Self' have been explained in previous verses of this chapter: 'he has accomplished all action' (18); 'him the knowers of Reality call wise' (19); 'depending on nothing' (20); performing action by the body alone' (21); 'balanced in success and failure' (22), 'who acts for the sake of yagya' (23). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$4.42 Therefore, having cut asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt of yours born of ignorance and rooted in the heart, resort to Yoga. Stand up, O Bharata! The state of Union is full even in transcendental consciousness. But it is not considered to be the mature state of Union unless transcendental consciousness has become permanent in the state of cosmic consciousness. Thus we find that the Union gained in the state of transcendental consciousness reaches maturity in cosmic consciousness, which in turn finds fulfillment in God-consciousness. 'Yoga' here again means Karma Yoga, which requires a man to gain transcendental consciousness and engage in activity. When samadhi, the state of Yoga, begins to be experienced, nothing more need be done for full enlightenment for cosmic consciousness, or jivan-mukti except regular practice of samadhi, alternating with normal activity in practical life. For this reason the Lord urges Arjuna to 'resort to Yoga', to gain transcendental consciousness and be engaged in action. This, He says, will free Arjuna from all doubts. The Lord brings home to him that all misery is due to ignorance of the state of separation of Being from activity. 'Sword of knowledge': as the sharp edge of a sword is capable of cutting whatever it meets, so the state of knowledge, the awareness of Being as separate from activity, cuts asunder all doubts about the true nature of life and activity. Until this knowledge dawns, doubts are certain to remain. All doubts are due to 'ignorance' of this Reality, says the Lord. 'Born of ignorance and rooted in the heart': the doubt born of ignorance should belong to the mind, but the Lord says: 'rooted in the heart'. The heart is concerned with experience and the mind with understanding. When the Lord speaks of doubt as 'rooted in the heart', He means that even though the doubt is in the mind, it has its roots in the heart, which is devoid of the experience of Being and of the experience of Being as separate from activity. The teaching is that it is necessary to experience Being and to understand clearly the separateness of Being from activity; thus enlightened, one should perform one's duty. It should be stressed that the state of renunciation is not exclusive to either Karma Yoga or Sankhya. It is a state that develops on both these paths. Whether one is following Karma Yoga, the practice of transcendental meditation supplemented by physical activity, or the path of Sankhya, the practice of transcendental meditation supplemented by the mental activity of contemplation, one is sure to arrive at the experience of the state of renunciation. Here is the essence of the teaching of this chapter: remove all doubts about Reality by means of the knowledge of Sankhya, and engage yourself in the practice of Karma Yoga. Thus ends the Yoga of Knowledge of Renunciation of Action. In the second chapter Lord Krishna enlightened Arjuna on the understanding of Sankhya and Yoga so that he might be clear about the perishable and imperishable aspects of life and thereby, casting off his ignorance about the nature of life and its relationship with the field of action, realize his true divine nature in eternal freedom. The Lord's inspiring words created in Arjuna's mind an urge to follow them. The third chapter brought to light the practice of Karma Yoga, action in the state of Union with the Divine, or action in order to make this Divine Union permanent, thus raising the dignity of both the doer and the action. Continuing the teaching in the fourth chapter, Lord Krishna gave Arjuna a deeper understanding of the relationship of one's self with the field of action, making. clear to him the state of separation that exists naturally between the inner Being and the outer phase of life in activity. This gave him insight into the reality of life and activity, and revealed to him that the inner Being is completely independent of action. Arjuna then perceived that activity does not belong to what life essentially is, Being in eternal freedom. The fourth chapter has been called 'The Yoga of Knowledge of Renunciation of Action'. The title is significant. It tells us that according to this teaching Yoga, or Union, is gained through the knowledge of renunciation, through the knowledge of the Self as completely detached from activity. It establishes that the state of renunciation is natural on the levels both of cosmic and of individual life: on the cosmic level God remains uninvolved with the activities of creation and evolution; on the level of individual life the Self remains uninvolved with activity. A natural state of renunciation is the true basis of all life, and proper knowledge of it brings freedom from bondage. This is the essential teaching of the fourth chapter. It might seem that the fourth chapter was challenging the doctrine of Karma Yoga taught in the third. But in fact this is not so. If thc chapter had proclaimed enlightenment through renunciation of action, then it would have been contrary to the principle of Karma Yoga. But it proclaims enlightenment through the knowledge of renunciation of action. This makes it clear that the principle of renunciation is only to be understood; it is not to be practiced. The state of renunciation is produced through Karma Yoga (IV,41); there is no way of practising renunciation. Knowledge of renunciation is extolled here, not the practice of renunciation. When we state that renunciation is not to be practiced we are aware of the recluse way of life. But the renunciation of the recluse is renunciation of external things and is relevant only to a particular way of living, it is not in itself a way to God. It is not the practice of renunciation but the knowledge of it that helps on the way to God. The knowledge of renunciation expounded in the fourth chapter is necessary for those on the path of Karma Yoga as well as for those on the path of Sankhya. The state of renunciation is experienced on both paths, and unless the intellect is clear about the significance of this experience, doubts will remain and will impede further progress. Karma Yoga and Sankhya each start on the common ground of transcendental meditation. This leads directly to transcendental Self-consciousness, where even the most refined field of thought has been renounced and the Self stands alone in Its pure state of Being (verse 2). This is a state of complete renunciation, but it is reached only during meditation; it is not permanent. Through the regular and continued practice of meditation, alternating with activity mental activity on the path of Sankhya and physical activity on the path of Karma Yoga transcendental Self-consciousness develops into cosmic consciousness, wherein one experiences the Self as separate from activity and lives the natural state of renunciation in daily life. The state of renunciation has become permanent. This state of cosmic consciousness develops further so that the separation between the Self and activity, which already presented the complete state of renunciation, dissolves into the ultimate Unity of God-consciousness. The state in which this separation has been resolved would seem to be beyond the range of renunciation, but it is, in fact, renunciation in its full perfection. Nothing now remains except pure life The fourth chapter brings out the principle of renunciation in each of these states : transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. The knowledge given in that chapter has enriched the teachings about the paths of Sankhya and Karma Yoga given in the second and third chapters. It has silently established the state of renunciation as common ground, a common milestone and the common goal on both paths. The fifth chapter, taking advantage of the knowledge given in the fourth, explicitly places Sankhya and Karma Yoga together, presenting them as equally useful in bringing eternal liberation in the midst of every activity. It establishes a philosophy of Yoga, or Divine Union, through renunciation of action. This might be expected to contradict the philosophy of Yoga through action, Karma Yoga. But the Lord's theme is so marvelous that, far from offering any sense of contradiction with Karma Yoga, it succeeds in drawing together Karma Yoga and Sankhya. Gloriously, it places them both on the same level of renunciation and, by showing the principles of these two paths to be in close proximity, it uses them both together to evolve a new philosophy of Yoga: the Yoga of renunciation. Renunciation as such is plainly a state of loss. Yoga of renunciation thus means Yoga of loss: Union through loss. It is the glory of the Lord's discourse that loss becomes a means to perfection renunciation comes forward to save life and bring fulfillment to it. Without the philosophy of renunciation, the philosophy of action will always remain incomplete, because the renunciation of action lies at the opposite extreme to the performance of action. Just as separation contrasts with Union, so renunciation of action contrasts with the Yoga of action Unless these two extremes, union and renunciation, are taken into account the philosophy will be incomplete. The philosophy of renunciation is not merely complementary to the philosophy of action, nor just an essential part of that philosophy. Indeed, it can be considered as a complete philosophy of action in itself. The philosophy of renunciation is so complete that by remaining strictly within the boundaries of renunciation, and without having to consider the field of action at all, it is capable of upholding the philosophy of action. The whole philosophy of Karma Yoga can be explained through this philosophy of renunciation, because the basis of Karma Yoga is transcendental consciousness. And as the way to transcendental consciousness is through the withdrawal of the mind from the field of outside experience, it does not matter whether we consider the process of gaining transcendental consciousness in terms of activity towards the Transcendent or in terms of activity away from the field of outside experience. The first would express the principle in terms of Karma Yoga, the second in terms of renunciation. But one should not lose sight of the fact that renunciation does not offer any practice. The practical aspect of the philosophy of renunciation is to be found in the techniques of Sankhya and Karma Yoga. The doctrine of renunciation does not provide an independent practice, and renunciation is therefore not a path in itself, it presents a theory based on the practices of other paths. The principle of action having been brought out in Chapter III, and knowledge of renunciation in Chapter IV, Chapter V now expounds the compatibility of these two. The marvel is that it does so from the standpoint of renunciation, which is abstract, rather than from that of action, which is concrete. While combining the two extremes of action and renunciation, it combines the two different paths of Yoga and Sankhya, and thus it gives expression to a complete philosophy of the integrated life. Here is a call to every man: Come by any path, and liberation will be yours. This is what makes the Bhagavad-Gita the Scripture of Divine Union. With ease it proclaims both the Yoga of action and the Yoga of renunciation of action. This is the perfection of the discourse from 'the lips of the Yogishvara, Krishna, the Lord of the Yogis of all time. The most extreme contradictions are harmonized and unified in this chapter. It presents the state of eternal freedom in divine consciousness on the level of action based on renunciation. Moreover, it establishes the necessity of gaining divine consciousness for the sake of successful activity in daily life, and at the same time emphasizes the need for activity to gain divine consciousness. By bringing into harmony the material and spiritual aspects of life, it opens a way both to success and to salvation for man, whether householder or recluse, in any age. It enables any man to glorify his world by the light of the Divine, and also to attain divine freedom in a most natural way through the daily activity of life. Inexhaustible wisdom is contained in the twenty-nine verses of this chapter. It stands as a beacon not only for those who are miserable and confused, but also for seekers, and even for those who are well advanced on the path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.1 Arjuna said: Thou praisest, O Krishna, renunciation of action and Yoga (of action) at the same time. Tell me decisively which is the better of these two. Here is the proof of what the Lord has said: 'Even the wise are bewildered' about the problem of action and inaction. Through all his utterances so far, Arjuna has shown himself to be wise, to have great foresight and to have knowledge of dharma. He will not act until he is sure of all the implications of his action. This is the third question,' in the same spirit, that Arjuna has asked about the best course of action to follow for his own good and that of others. These repeated questions arise from his sincere desire to know the Truth; they are in keeping with a character that is without blemish and spring naturally from the state of one who seeks the Truth and has surrendered himself to his master.tt If it had not been for these questions of Arjuna's, the great wisdom of this chapter and the next would not have been revealed, and the discourse of the Lord would not have been complete. For this reason those who seek the Truth will always be indebted to Arjuna. Commentators who have portrayed him as confused have missed the depth of his understanding. Arjuna asks profound questions again and again because, being a practical man of great intelligence, he does not wish to take anything for granted. He wants every detail of the plan to come from the Lord, because he knows that any small mistake on his part will prejudice the destinies of many generations to come. The Lord has said: 'unfathomable is the course of action'. When such is the nature of action, there can be numberless flaws in any exposition of it, there can be an unlimited number of viewpoints about any one situation. That is why, to resolve the riddle of action for all time, the Lord told Arjuna: 'I shali expound to you that action knowing which you will be freed from evil'. He then went on to expound that eternal wisdom which presents the solution to all problems of action and behavior for all men of every age. The Lord advocates the performance of action from that level of life where the mind is established in a state of freedom. This state can be lived without difficulty, but to describe it adequately in words is difficult. That is why the Lord asked Arjuna to 'be without the three gunas'. He would then actually come to experience the state of non-attachment described to him by the teaching of Sankhya.tt The aspirant can be shown the path to follow, but it is hard to give him a definite picture of that state because it lies in the field which transcends all speech. Because the very nature of action in freedom includes the states of action, inaction and renunciation of action simultaneously, the Lord, in His exposition, has to speak sometimes in terms of action and sometimes in terms of inaction, sometimes of the Yoga of action and sometimes of the renunciation of action. It is the need to clarify these opposing statements that has given rise to Arjuna's present question. It does not spring from any inadequacy of his understanding. The immediate reason for the question can be found in two expressions at the end of the fourth chapter: 'renounced action by virtue of Yoga' (verse 41) and 'resort to Yoga' (verse 42). The first presents Yoga as a means to renunciation, the second emphasizes the practice of Yoga after knowledge of renunciation has been gained. In one statement Yoga is the means and renunciation the goal; in the other renunciation is the means and Yoga the goal. Arjuna, noticing this apparent contradiction, raises the question which opens this chapter. His question is responsible for the flow of great wisdom from the Lord and not only presents the essence of the Lord's teaching so far, but also gives added momentum to the theme of the Lord's discourse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.2 The Blessed Lord said: Both renunciation and the Yoga of action lead to the supreme good. But of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action. 'The renunciation of action' (Sanyasa) may be interpreted in four ways: According to the first and more common understanding, a man detaches himself from all the activity of worldly life. According to the second, he takes to the practice of transcendental meditation in order to renounce even the most refined state of thought and thus reach Self-consciousness. This is the whole concern of Sanyasa the renunciation of everything in the field of relativity and detachment from all aspects of life, gross and subtle. According to the third, entertaining activity after gaining transcendental consciousness, he rises to cosmic consciousness, in which he experiences the Self as completely separate from activity. Thus he attains a state of life in perfect renunciation. According to the fourth, entertaining the activity of the finest quality, devotion, he rises to God-consciousness, where the state of renunciation experienced in cosmic consciousness as separation of the Self from activity is transformed into a living link to unite the Self and activity. The two merge in the Unity of God-consciousness. 'The Yoga of action' has been defined in the third chapter. When the mind has retired from the field of activity and has reached the state of transcendental Self-consciousness, it comes back again into the field of activity. As the mind returns, the Self-consciousness infused into its nature enables the transcendental absolute Being to become harmonized with the field of activity. This bringing of the Divine into the world is the purpose of Karma Yoga. It reaches maturity in the state of cosmic consciousness and finds its fulfillment in God-consciousness. In the state of cosmic consciousness the Self is realized as separate from activity, and this makes renunciation a living reality of daily life, bringing the blessings of eternal freedom. Thus we find that Sanyasa and Karma Yoga run parallel. The Lord says: 'of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action', because the process of renunciation is one of losing and the process of Yoga, or Union, is one of gaining; and gain is more acceptable to the mind than loss, all the more so when, in the process of Union, the mind experiences increasing charm at every moment. Thus it is clear that to engage in the process of gaining Divine Union is easier for the mind than to engage in the process of renunciation of the world. This is what makes Karma Yoga superior to Sanyasa. Moreover, the process of Karma Yoga automatically gives rise to the state of renunciation. When the mind proceeds towards the Transcendent, the state of Divine Union, it automatically recedes from the world, simultaneously producing the state of renunciation. Considered from this point of view, Karma Yoga is found to be the cause of renunciation. This in itself is a sufficient reason for the Lord to say that 'the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action' even though both, running parallel and simultaneously, 'lead to the supreme good'. The following verse considers the real sanyasi, the man who is established in the state of renunciation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.3 Know him to be ever a man of renunciation who neither hates nor desires; free from the pairs of opposites, he is easily released from bondage, O mighty-armed. In this verse, the Lord brings out the essential qualities of 'a man of renunciation', a sanyasi. He is free from desire while at the same time he rejects nothing; he takes life easily as it comes, creating no tensions. His life flows freely in harmony with the laws of nature governed by the Cosmic Law. Such a carefree state of life in freedom is only possible when a man is contented. And contentment is possible only when the mind is established in bliss-consciousness, the state of the transcendental Absolute, because in the relative field there is no happiness so intense that it could finally satisfy the thirst of the mind for joy. Having gained this state of transcendental consciousness permanently, a man is freed from bondage and lives a life in the eternal freedom of cosmic consciousness. In this state he lives eternal Being as completely separated from the field of activity. This is the state of perfect detachment, or Sanyasa, described by the Lord as freedom 'from the pairs of opposites'. Such freedom prevails in transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. The word 'easily' is of great significance. Freedom from bondage is 'easily' gained by rising above 'the pairs of opposites' to the state of Being, by rising to that state of Sanyasa, that state of separation which naturally exists between Being and activity. The state of freedom from bondage can be reached either through the wisdom of Sankhya or the practice of Yoga, as shown in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.4 The ignorant, and not the wise, speak of the path of knowledge (Sankhya) and the path of action (Yoga) as different. He who is properly established even in one gains the fruit of both. The teaching of Sankhya brings to light the separation that exists between the imperishable and perishable aspects of life, between Being and activity. The practice of Yoga, by bringing Being into direct experience, also brings to light the separation that exists between Being and activity. This is how Sankhya and Yoga both lead to freedom from bondage. The phrase 'properly established' is of importance for a true understanding of the teaching of this verse. In order to be 'properly established' in the teaching of Sankhya or Yoga, both understanding and experience are of vital importance. Sankhya and Yoga are each sufficient in themselves to bring liberation. Therefore it does not matter whether the one or the other is given first importance. 'The wise' are those who have risen to the state of freedom. They do not see Sankhya and Yoga as different, not only because both lead to the same goal, but also because the main feature of both is the same practice of transcendental meditation. The only difference is that on the path of Karma Yoga transcendental meditation alternates with activity on the level of the senses and on the path of Sankhya with mental activity. But for this small difference Sankhya and Yoga are the same. That is why the wise do not look upon them as different. This verse and the next present the whole purpose of the fifth chapter, which is to place Yoga and Sankhya on the same footing as far as their results are concerned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.5 The state attained by men on the path of knowledge is also reached by those on the path of action. He who sees Sankhya and Yoga to be one, verily he sees. This is the verse that promises liberation for both the ways of life, that of a householder and that of a recluse. It establishes the basic unity of Sankhya and Yoga. Eternal liberation is their common goal, and the seer of Truth sees it to be so. It is evident that the path of Sankhya does not apply to the life of the householder and that Karma Yoga does. But Lord Krishna says here that the difference between the two paths is resolved when the goal is reached. Only an undeveloped intellect dwells on the differences between them. The wise man sets out upon one or the other and reaches the goal. He does not waste his time and energy in a scrutiny of distinctions. The verse shows that Sankhya and Yoga are designed to satisfy different kinds of people. But so far as their goal is concerned, they are the same. This understanding of the matter finds further justification in verses 24 and 25, which describe the attainment of eternal liberation through Yoga and Sankhya respectively, and in verse 21, which speaks of the attainment of immeasurable happiness through both paths. Furthermore, by studying the details of the path of knowledge and that of action one finds that even the paths themselves are basically the same. The single process of transcendental meditation brings fulfillment to both. That is why 'he who sees Sankhya and Yoga to be one, verily he sees'. The two paths start from and proceed on the common ground of transcendental meditation, and as they advance both give rise to the same experience of renunciation in cosmic consciousness. But having reached a common milestone in this direct realization of the separateness of Being from activity, they still have not attained their final goal. For complete fulfillment they must proceed further to merge in one goal, in the great Unity in God-consciousness. Chapter V dwells mainly on the experience of renunciation common to both paths, Chapter VI will give details of their common practice of transcendental meditation, and Chapters VII to XII will unfold the nature of their ultimate goal God-consciousness, as well as the path to it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.6 Renunciation is indeed hard to attain without Yoga, O mighty-armed. The sage who is intent on Yoga comes to Brahman without long delay. This verse makes it quite clear that the state of renunciation 'is indeed hard to attain', that the separateness of Being from activity is hard to realize, unless the mind is firmly established in Being. Here the word Yoga does not mean either Karma Yoga or the practice of gaining transcendental consciousness; it means the state of Union itself, transcendental consciousness. The state of Brahman, which is the fullness of the relative and the Absolute both together, is best appreciated on the level of Union made permanent, transcendental consciousness made permanent. This state of cosmic consciousness gives the experience of Sanyasa, the separateness of the Self from activity; the separateness of the relative and the Absolute here becomes a living reality. The Lord is referring to this process of making the Union permanent when He says: 'without long delay'. This is because the state of Union, or transcendental consciousness, being blissful in its nature, is always inviting to the mind. The mind arrives at it drawn by its own nature, which is always to want to enjoy more. Thus the attainment of Union becomes easy, without resistance. The natural process of gaining this state need only be alternated with the natural activity of daily life to bring it to permanency. Thus it is clear that the whole process is a natural one; that is why it does not take a long time. A man who has attained cosmic consciousness is always established in the Self, even while engaged in activity. This state of consciousness is the mature state of Sanyasa, a state of complete non-attachment of the Self with activity, even while activity continues in the relative field of life. Such complete non-attachment is not possible unless the mind is established in eternal contentment. The constant practice of gaining Yoga, or Union with divine consciousness, brings the mind to the state which gives eternal contentment, thereby establishing a natural state of Sanyasa or renunciation. With growth towards cosmic consciousness, contentment grows, and with the growth of inner contentment, appreciation of the separation between Being and activity increases until the mind becomes rooted in the nature of Being. It has then achieved cosmic consciousness. By showing the difficulty of attaining renunciation without Yoga, the Lord indicates the simplicity of rising to a state where Yoga and Sanyasa will become the daily habit of life. This verse sings the glory of Union. It is the basis of true renunciation and gives rise to the state of Brahman in man's daily life. The next verse shows how, by means of this Union, a man rises above the binding influence of action and lives a life of eternal freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.7 Intent on Yoga, pure of spirit, he who has fully mastered himself and has conquered the senses, whose self has become the Self of all beings, he is not involved even while he acts. Here, as in the previous verse, the word Yoga does not mean either Karma Yoga or the practice of transcending; it is used in the sense of Unity of the mind with Being. 'Intent on Yoga': one who is never out of the Self, whether waking, dreaming or in the state of deep sleep. Such a man is established in himself, and no experience of relativity is able to overshadow his status of absolute Being. 'Pure of spirit': one who has reached the state of Being, absolute consciousness, which is ever the same in its eternal purity, and who has established that state in the very nature of his mind. Action is a veil which hides this essential nature of the Self. Meditation is a process of diving through all the subtle levels of activity; when the subtlest level is transcended, the mind gains the state of pure Being. When the mind, being That, comes out into the field of activity, then the Self is said to shine forth in Its purity. When, through constant practice, complete integration of the Self with the mind is achieved, the pure status of Being gained by the mind is not in any way overshadowed even though the mind occupies itself with activity in the relative field. This is the state of cosmic consciousness, where the Self has separated Itself completely from the field of activity. In this state, where absolute Being and the relative world of activity are lived simultaneously, the self is said to have been permanently freed from all stain; it has achieved absolute purity. 'He who has fully mastered himself'. Self has two connotations: lower self and higher Self. The lower self is that aspect of the personality which deals only with the relative aspect of existence. It comprises the mind that thinks, the intellect that decides, the ego that experiences. This lower self functions only in the relative states of existence, waking, dreaming and deep sleep. Remaining always within the field of relativity, it has no chance of experiencing the real freedom of absolute Being. That is why it is in the sphere of bondage. The higher Self is that aspect of the personality which never changes, absolute Being, which is the very basis of the entire field of relativity, including the lower self. A man who wants to master himself has to master the lower self first and then the higher Self. Mastering the lower self means taking the mind (mind, intellect, ego) from the gross fields of existence to the subtler fields, until the subtlest field of relative existence is transcended and transcendental absolute unmanifested Being is reached in divine consciousness. This robs the lower self of its individuality bound by time, space and causation and sets it free in the state of universal existence. When the lower self has been mastered by the higher Self in this way and the higher Self has accepted it completely, then the two become one. And then a state develops in which each is found intimately within the realm of the other in complete cohesion of existence. When the divine consciousness of transcendental absolute Being is found in co-existence with the mind in relative existence, in the field of time, space and causation, then the mastery of the higher Self is accomplished. The Absolute has been as it were brought out from the transcendental field of existence to serve and support the field of relativity. The never-changing is brought into the life of the ever-changing. The relative states of existence, waking, dreaming and sleeping are infused with the absolute state of Being. Eternal freedom has become infused into the field of bondage. The Unity of the divine nature is lived in the multiplicity of diversified creation. This enables a man to live a life of eternal freedom in a world of transitory existence. Thus the master of the Self, enjoying the whole field of relativity, lives the life of absolute Being in divine consciousness. It is interesting to discover how the process of transcendental meditation succeeds in mastering both the self and the Self. The inward stroke of meditation takes one to a state where the mind, freed from individuality, surrenders itself to the higher Self. This is the mastery of the lower self. The outward stroke of meditation brings the mind out infused with Being. As a result of constant practice, the mind then lives absolute Being in all fields of relative life This is mastery of the higher Self. Thus mastery of the self and of the Self is accomplished by means of the inward and outward strokes of a single technique of transcendental meditation. 'Has conquered the senses': has mastery over them. In actual fact the senses are always under the command of the mind. Everyone knows that the eyes will see only if and when a man wishes to see. If he does not wish to see, he will not do so even with open eyes. Therefore victory over the senses seems to have no obvious meaning. The inner meaning of this expression is that when Being first begins to be infused into the nature of the mind, the mind becomes as if intoxicated with a feeling of self-sufficiency. When the mind in this state acts through the senses, it behaves in a rather carefree manner, which may be thought of as akin to indifference. In a more advanced state of enlightenment this peculiar sense of indifference diminishes, and the behavior of the mind becomes more natural. Activity in the outer sphere of life becomes harmonized with the natural state of inner silence. Activity goes on as a result of the co-ordination between the mind and the organs of action. At the same time, co-ordination between the mind and the senses of perception enables the senses to register experience. With the infusion of Being into the mind, the senses of perception, while engaged in the process of experiencing, do not register deep impressions of experiences. The impressions they receive are just sufficient to enable them to experience, but are not deep enough to form the seed of future desires. This happens more and more effectively as the mind becomes more established in Being. Such, then, are the inner mechanics of mastering the senses. A real conquest is that where the enemy ceases to be an enemy; he is left free to do as he likes, but is not in a position to attack or do any harm. The conquest of the senses is so fully accomplished through the mastery of the Self that the senses are left free to function and, notwithstanding all the experiences of the relative field, life is firmly established in the eternal freedom of divine consciousness. Once the Self is experienced as separate from the senses and their activity, in the state of cosmic consciousness, a man sees within himself the state of unbounded Being on one side and involvement in the world of forms and phenomena on the other He sees every living being as supported by that Being which is his own Self. Thus he naturally experiences his Self as 'the Self of all beings', and in this state 'he is not involved even while he acts'. This non-involvement can also be understood from another point of view. The light of a lamp is invisible in the light of the sun. The glory of the drop has no effect on the glory of the ocean. The joy of an action leaves no lasting impression upon the bliss of cosmic consciousness. Therefore once a man is established in this state, he naturally enjoys so great a fullness of Being that he never feels he is out of It. For him action does not involve coming out of the Self; there is, indeed, never any chance of his doing so. That is why the Lord says that 'he is not involved even while he acts' He is firmly secured in cosmic existence which, though the very basis of all action, is without activity. For him it is as if everything were going by itself. This state is further described in the next two verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.8-9 One who is in Union with the Divine and who knows the Truth will maintain 'l do not act at all'. In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing, speaking, letting go, seizing and even in opening and closing the eyes, he holds simply that the senses act among the objects of sense. 'One who is in Union with the Divine': the divine nature is completely separate from the field of activity. When this has been realized, the Self is experienced as independent of activity. Then the teaching of this verse becomes a living reality of daily life. 'One . . who knows the Truth' is one who knows that life has two aspects, relative and absolute, and that the field of relative life is governed by the three gunas. He knows through understanding and experience that the Self is separate from the field of activity. This basic knowledge about the Self and the nature of activity creates a situation in the mind where the realized man is automatically established in the truth of the expression: 'I do not act at all'. It is not that he holds on to this thought artificially but that the very structure of his mind is based on this natural non-attachment. He lives this state. To him non-attachment is a living reality in daily life. He acts and experiences, making use of his senses, but within himself he is fixed in Being. He lives fullness of Being while fully engaged in the field of the senses. He lives twofold: the stability of changeless Being constitutes the inner core of his life, and on the periphery is found the activity of the sensory level, the senses engaged in the experience of their objects. This is what the Lord means when He says: 'the senses act among the objects of sense'. These two verses develop the idea expressed in the previous one. When, through the practice of transcendental meditation, cosmic consciousness has been gained, and the individual ego has expanded to cosmic status, the mind automatically functions from the level of its full potentiality and the senses, having reached their maximum development, function at their highest capacity. The objects of sense, however, remain in their unchanged state. That is why the senses, acting from their raised level, experience objects more completely, resulting in an even greater appreciation of the objects and thus providing experience of greater happiness on the sensory level. This creates a situation in which the objects of sense are enjoyed more thoroughly than before, but because `Being is more fully grounded in the very nature of the mind, the impressions of sensory experience fail to capture the mind. The enlightened man thus naturally remains in a state where the senses continue to experience their objects while he remains free. This is merely a comparative statement; it does not in any way imply that such a man becomes incapable of experience. It only means that, whereas before enlightenment experience in the world used to overshadow his Being, now his Being shines forth through all experience. Before enlightenment, if he saw a flower, the flower overwhelmed the mind so completely that only the flower remained and the experiencer was lost in the experience. The subject was as if annihilated by the object. Life in which objects predominate, where matter alone is found and the values of the spirit or soul are overshadowed, is called material life. After enlightenment, the flower is still seen, but the experience of the flower does not overshadow Being, because Being has been realized as separate from the field of activity, and thus the subject and the object are both separately maintained; both, so to speak, alive in their fullness. The flower fails to overshadow Being and at the same time the light of Being does not diminish the validity of the flower. Through the light of Being the flower is appreciated infinitely more, and this brings about the integration of spirit and matter. This is the glory of transcendental meditation: it brings enlightenment that integrates all the material values of life with the Divine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.10 He who acts giving over all actions to the universal Being, abandoning attachment, is untouched by sin as a lotus leaf by water. 'Universal Being': Brahman, the ultimate Reality, the Absolute and the relative together at the same time. The inward stroke of meditation leads the mind to Self-consciousness and infuses the state of Self-consciousness, Being, into the nature of the mind. The outward stroke of meditation brings such a mind into the field of action, where it acts with a certain degree of Being. This practice of meditation and the activity that follows it, morning and evening meditation and activity during the day develop a state in which the nature of the mind becomes transformed into the state of Being, while the ability to act in all fields of practical life is fully maintained. Only when the mind, thus established in the Self, acts from that state of universal Being, is it possible to act 'giving over all actions to the universal Being'; in that state one has gained cosmic consciousness, which is the level of universal Being. These words do not mean that a man should act while holding in his mind the thought of the universal Being. This verse does not teach an intellectually conceived surrender to the universal Being, or cherishing the thought of It, or making a mood of the Divine, or remembering God while working. It does not teach that any such attempts on the level of the mind or intellect can lead a man to a sinless state. All actions are given over naturally to the divine Being and all attachments are abandoned naturally when, through the practice of transcendental meditation, the mind rises to the level of divine consciousness and maintains it permanently. When the self has completely separated itself from activity, then a situation is created in which the authorship of action becomes automatically transferred to the universal Being. 'Untouched by sin' means free from any wrong; a life that is completely harmless, being in accordance with the laws of nature. This state is gained in cosmic consciousness, in which the Self is completely separate from activity. It is in this state that actions are motivated by the power of Nature responsible for all creation and evolution. That is why they all produce life-supporting effects and no wrong is possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.11 By means of the body, by the mind, by the intellect and even by the senses alone, yogis, abandoning attachment, perform action for self-purification. Here the Lord makes clear the necessity of action for self-purification. Towards what state of self-purification does a yogi aim when he performs action? Through the practice of samadhi,t does not a yogi already have a pure state of consciousness? Is not the practice of samadhi sufficient to purify the soul? It seems not, for here the Lord is clearly expressing the need for performance of action for that degree of self-purification which is not gained by samadhi alone. 'Yogis': they who are united with the Divine in transcendental consciousness, cosmic consciousness or God-consciousness. When a yogi has attained cosmic consciousness and has realized the Self as separate from the field of activity, he is able, by virtue of this realization, to entertain activity' while yet remaining in the eternal freedom of the Self. Because performance of action in this state of realization does not involve the Self, it naturally remains on the level of the 'body', 'mind', 'intellect' and 'senses' The word 'alone' in this context is highly significant. It establishes without doubt and with all possible emphasis the separateness of the Self from the field of activity in the life of a. realized man. Moreover, it also means that in this state of realization the body, the mind, the intellect and the senses are capable of acting quite independently.tt During the practice of transcendental meditation, as the mind gains transcendental consciousness, the metabolism of the body is reduced to a minimum and the entire nervous system gains a state of restful alertness.oo This is the physical condition corresponding to the state of Being. In this state, the mental and physical levels of the individual life come to the level of the cosmic life of omnipresent Being the individual mind is held by cosmic intelligence and individual physical existence sustained by cosmic existence, they become Its instrument and begin to respond to the cosmic need. When cosmic consciousness has been gained, this situation is made permanent. 'Body', 'mind', 'intellect' and 'senses' remain lhe instrument of the divine will, irrespective of their mode of activity. In this state the main motivating force of their activity is the divine will, the almighty cosmic intelligence, responsible for the creation and evolution of the entire cosmos. Just as everything in nature responds to the need of cosmic purpose, so man's body, mind, intellect and senses, brought to the level of cosmic intelligence, respond to the need of cosmic life. This is what the Lord means when He says: 'By means of the body, by the mind, by the intellect and even by the senses alone, yogis, abandoning attachment, perform action'. The significance of the expression 'abandoning attachment' in this context is that, in coming under the direct influence of the divine intelligence, the whole field of activity leaves the realm of the individual self, which then gains freedom from the binding influence of action Because a man has risen to the level of divine Being, 'abandoning attachment' automatically becomes a living reality of his daily life, without the need to cultivate non-attachment at any time. 'Self-purification': pure consciousness is the pure state of the Self; it is of transcendental nature. The mind arrives at it by transcending even the subtlest experience of the relative field. When this state is alternated with activity, the mind gains pure consciousness permanently. Pure consciousness is then naturally maintained in spite of engagement in activity. In this state, the duality of life becomes a living reality the two aspects of life, Self and non-Self, absolute and relative, become separated, and the Self is lived as pure Being unallied with anything. This experience of the complete separateness of the Self and activity should mean the culmination of the process of 'self-purification'. But still the process continues, finally to give rise to that state of Unity which does not accept activity even as separate from the Self Here the separateness responsible for giving rise to a sense of duality in the state of cosmic consciousness is transformed into the light of God, allowing the duality of the Self and activity to merge into the homogeneity of divine existence in the oneness of God-consciousness. This state of the eternal Unity of life is the real culmination of the process of 'self-purification'. The process of purification of the Self thus has three stages. First, from the waking state of consciousness to transcendental consciousness; second, from transcendental consciousness to cosmic consciousness; third, from cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness. In all three stages it is necessary to 'perform action for self-purification'. Performance of action on the subtler levels of life enables one to transcend the field of activity and gain transcendental consciousness. By the alternation of transcendental consciousness with the normal, natural activity of daily life, the mental activity of discrimination in the life of a recluse and physical activity in the life of a householder, transcendental consciousness becomes permanent and gains the status of cosmic consciousness. Again, cosmic consciousness develops into God-consciousness by virtue of the most highly refined type of activity, the activity of devotion. This is how the process of purification is carried on to its ultimate conclusion through the performance of action. This verse brings out a technique for the performance of action in the state of cosmic consciousness; for it says: 'By means of the body, by the mind, by the intellect and even by the senses alone, yogis . . . perform action'. It has already been shown, in explaining the significance of the word 'alone', that action on this level is action in the state of cosmic consciousness, and this helps to transform cosmic consciousness into God-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.12 He who is united with the Divine, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains to lasting peace. He who is not united with the Divine, who is spurred by desire, being attached to the fruit of action, is firmly bound. Gaining Unity with the Divine is the key to gaining freedom from the bondage of the fruits of action, and this in turn is the key to gaining lasting peace. Unity with the Divine is found in three states: in Self-consciousness, which is of transcendental nature; in cosmic consciousness, which includes both the absolute and relative states of consciousness simultaneously, transcendental Self-consciousness together with the consciousness of the waking, dreaming or sleeping state; and in God-consciousness, which holds together as one both the Self and the field of activity. 'Having abandoned the fruit of action': this expression runs parallel to the expression 'giving over all actions to the universal Being, abandoning attachment', In the state of lasting peace, the inner and outer phases of life both grow so strong that ultimately they become completely independent of each other. Inner Being is experienced as wholly separate from activity, while activity grows so strong as to become completely independent of Being. Being and activity both rise to their full stature. This is the state in which one lives in the Divine and in the world simultaneously, in which activity is carried on spurred by nature and without a spur of desire in the self, in which one enjoys freedom from the bondage of action. This is the ideal of Sanyasa life in complete detachment from the world of action. 'Who is spurred by desire': who is not firmly established in the Self, or the Divine. Because he lacks such firmness, he remains attached to the fruits of action and, because of this, 'firmly bound' to the whole process of action from beginning to end. The present verse not only describes the state of one who is united with the Divine, but also of one who is not so united. It points out the mechanics of bondage: when a man is not united with the Self, or the Divine, the attachment to the fruits of action caused by desire is responsible for binding together the self and activity. It should not be lost to sight that this bondage is not real; for the self in its essential nature being eternally free, can never be bound. Only so long as he has not t realized this eternally free status of the self, does a man feel attached to activity and therefore remain in bondage. How he can come out of the bondage of desire is explained in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.13 Having renounced all action by the mind, the dweller in the body rests in happiness, in the city of nine gates, neither acting nor causing action to be done. Mind is the link between the action and the actor, the self. As long as the mind is one-sided, subjected only to activity and without the direct influence of Being, it fails to be a successful mediator. It fails to safeguard the freedom of the self from the influence of action, and at the same time fails to safeguard action from the limitations of individuality, so that activity remains without the direct support of the almighty power of Nature. This verse explains how the mind can become a successful mediator and bring strength, grace and glory to action and freedom to life. The mind has to become as familiar with Being as it is with activity, and for this to happen it has first to come out of the field of activity and enter the sphere of Being. The present verse describes how, once out of the field of action, the mind finds itself as the Self, completely unattached to activity, ever remaining in the absolute state, 'in happiness', a silent witness (sakshi-kutastha) of all events, 'neither acting nor causing action to be done'. 'In happiness': happiness lies beyond the range of activity, where the 'self is untouched by external contacts'.' Once it has reached this state, the mind knows the truth of the relationship of the doer with his actions and with their fruits, which is proclaimed in the next verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.14 The Lord creates neither the authorship of action nor the action of beings; nor does He create the link between (the doer), the action and its fruit Nature carries this out. 'Nor the action of beings': this makes it clear that beings create their own actions. 'Nor does he create the link between the doer, the action and its fruit': the teaching is that the doer himself creates the link between himself and his action, while the link between the fruit of action and the doer is created by nature. 'Nature carries this out': the nature of the doer creates action, and the nature of action creates the quality of the fruit. The fruit of an action is linked with the doer by the nature of the doer and his action. This verse establishes emphatically the complete separateness of the inner divine Being and the outer field of action. It enlightens us about the state of perfect renunciation that naturally subsists between the inner and outer phases of life; for life is composed of activity on the outer surface together with the stability of Being within. In their essential nature there exists no t link between them. Just as a coconut has two different aspects, the outer hard cover and the inner milk within, one solid, the other liquid, without any link between them, so life has two aspects, one unchanging and eternal, the other ever-changing and relative, without any link between them. The previous verse explained how the dweller in the body is unaffected by action In the present verse, the Lord intends to convince Arjuna of the truth that action and the relation 'between the doer, the action and its fruit' belong solely to the relative field of life, they belong to Nature; they have no bearing on the absolute status of Being. The purpose of creation is the expansion of happiness. The three gunas, born of Nature, are responsible for creation and its evolution; they are responsible for all the various divisions, the doer, the action and the fruits. They alone underlie and are responsible for the creation, the maintenance and the dissolution of everything in the universe, the subjective aspects of the inner life and the objective aspect of the outer world. The authorship of action does not in reality belong to the 'I'. It is a mistake to understand that 'I' do this, 'I' experience this and 'I' know this. All this is basically untrue The 'I', in its essential nature, is uncreated; it belongs to the field of the Absolute Whereas action, its fruits and the relationship between the doer and his action belong to the relative field, to the field of the three gunas. Therefore all action is performed by the three gunas born of Nature. The attribution of authorship to the 'I' is only due to ignorance of the real nature of the 'I' and of action. The theme of the Lord's teaching about the knowledge of action is developed in a remarkable way. In Chapter II, verse 48, the teaching was to abandon attachment, and the glory of such abandonment was sung in verses 64 and 71. The idea of abandoning attachment led to the teaching of non-attachment in Chapter III, verse 7. In the same chapter, verses 17 and 18 explained that non-attachment is attained by realizing the Self. Verse 19 established the dignity of action in this state of non-attachment gained through realization of the Self Verse 25 gave a new turn to this theme by introducing the element of natural action. Verse 26 extolled natural action according to a man's level of evolution. Verse 27 explained that in reality all actions are performed by nature, and that only the deluded assume the authorship of action; the enlightened man knows that the gunas interact amongst themselves, that the whole field of activity belongs to the field of the gunas and that the Self remains uninvolved in their activity. Verse 30 introduced the element of God, to whom all actions of the three gunas may be surrendered as a means of separating the field of activity from the Self. Verse 33 refuted the need for control in bringing about such surrender of action to God and again extolled action according to a man's nature, free from any control Verse 39 introduced the idea that ignorance of the Self is responsible for bondage. Verse 43 raised the sword of knowledge to cut asunder this ignorance. The development of the teaching thus far led to the principle that action is necessary for coming out of the field of bondage. The fourth chapter began to expound the nature of the Lord as separate from the incessant activity of the universe. This introduced the exposition of the knowledge of the renunciation of action, which is developed throughout the fourth chapter and in the earlier verses of this chapter until the present verse proclaims that there exists absolutely no relationship 'between lhe doer, the action and its fruit'. This is true on both levels of life, the level of cosmic life and the level of individual life. The present verse puts the point clearly when it says that 'the Lord creates neither the authorship of action nor the action of beings', meaning that He does not create anything; He remains completely aloof from the incessant activity of creating. This is the situation on the cosmic level. The same situation is found on the level of individual life, because there exists no real link 'between the doer, the action and its fruit'. This eliminates all need for any doing, for any attempt at Self-realization. Abandoning all attempts at realization and living in the state of fulfillment is that high state, renunciation, which finds its consummation in the state of knowledge, in God-consciousness. This is the glory of renunciation. The most evolved state of life in eternal freedom is readily available in a most natural way to everyone. The sufferings and the joys of life come to man through the ignorance of this, says the next verse, and the glory of knowledge is extolled in the verse that follows it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.15 The all-pervading Intelligence does not accept the sin or even the merit of anyone. Wisdom is veiled by ignorance. Thereby creatures are deluded. 'The all-pervading Intelligence' is the absolute Being. Because It is all-pervading, It is of transcendental nature, and because It is transcendent, It lies out of the influence of action. It is the silent witness of the whole of relative life. The previous verse made it clear that the authorship of action truly belongs to the three gunas. Therefore no agency other than that of the three gunas is involved in creating good or bad results. The state of enlightenment is obscured by ignorance, and 'thereby creatures are deluded'. The knowledge of the Divine as uninvolved with the field of action, and the knowledge of one's own Self as divine Being, bring freedom to life; whereas ignorance of this truth is responsible for the delusion that it is the Divine which bestows the fruits of 'one's actions. Here the Lord intends to show that the unrealized state is the cause of the bondage of action and involvement in sin and virtue. Reality is known in two ways: with reference to the Absolute and with reference to the relative. The gunas are responsible for action and for everything in the field of relative existence, and the Lord, 'the all-pervading Intelligence', remains completely uninvolved. This is how It, the divine Intelligence, or He, the Lord, remains in eternal freedom Those who rise to this supreme knowledge gain eternal freedom, others remain in bondage. The following two verses throw more light on this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.16 But in those in whom that ignorance is destroyed by wisdom, wisdom, like the sun, illumines That which is transcendent. 'Ignorance': about the separateness of the inner and outer aspects of life, about Being as uninvolved with activity, about the real nature of the 'I' and the world, about the permanent and the everchanging aspects of life, about the nature of freedom and bondage. 'That ignorance': the use of the word 'that', and not 'this', conveys the idea that ignorance is away from oneself In its nature it is foreign to the Self. In depicting wisdom as destroying ignorance, this verse shows that the destruction of ignorance and the illumination of the transcendent Being by wisdom go hand in hand. The sun removes the darkness and spreads the light at the same time. This indicates that when ignorance has been destroyed by wisdom, nothing more need be done to realize the Transcendent. It is omnipresent, veiled only by ignorance, and when this veil has been destroyed by knowledge, It shines forth in Its own light. That is why wisdom is attributed to the nature of the Absolute, the transcendent Being, wisdom is the Absolute; as the Upanishads have proclaimed: 'pragyanam brahma'. This verse makes it clear that ignorance is destroyed by gaining knowledge, and not that knowledge is gained by destroying ignorance. Therefore the seeker has not to try to come out of ignorance; rather, he should try to gain knowledge through direct experience. It may be interesting to mention here that life, held as one by ignorance, is torn apart by the analysis of Sankhya into two different components, the changing and the unchanging.' These are cognized as two different fields of life by direct experience through Yoga. The understanding gained through Sankhya is confirmed by Yoga: when, in cosmic consciousness, one begins to live life in a state where the Self remains uninvolved with activity then the truth of the teaching of Sankhya becomes significant in practical life. This enables man to live in the awareness that the two phases of life, relative and absolute, are separate from one another, and that even in the relative field, sin and virtue, which result in suffering and joy, each arise from attachment of the self to activity, which in turn arises from lack of knowledge. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.17 Their intellect rooted in That, their being established in That, intent on That, wholly devoted to That, cleansed of all impurities by wisdom, they attain to a state from which there is no return. This verse unites Yoga and Sankhya in their common goal of absolute purity and eternal liberation. It supports the truth of verses 4 and 5, which proclaim the theme of this chapter. The words 'intellect' and 'being' are of great significance, and so is the sequence in which they are used. It teaches that when the intellect is rooted in That, the whole of one's being also becomes 'established in That'. Moreover, when, during meditation, the intellect becomes 'rooted in That', on coming out of the Transcendent it remains 'intent on That'. When the intellect becomes 'intent on That', one's being becomes 'wholly devoted to That'. The word 'being' has been chosen here to translate the Sanskrit word 'atman', which is variously used to mean the Self, the intellect, the mind, the breath and the body. Therefore the expression 'being' becomes 'wholly devoted to That' means that the mind, the breath and the body all become orientated towards 'That'. The Lord shows that unless the intellect and the whole of one's being are established in the transcendent Reality, they are not pure; they remain in the realm of temporary existence, unconnected with the state of eternal freedom whence 'there is no return'. Unless the transcendent absolute phase of life is realized, the scope of the individual phase of life remains insignificant and its purpose is not fulfilled; bondage continues and the cycle of birth and death meets no end. This verse makes it clear that purity of life, which is the basis of all success in the world and at the same time the basis of eternal freedom, is gained by wisdom, realization of the Transcendent. It also states the principle that unless a man has stabilized this absolute state of purity in his life by rising to the state of cosmic consciousness, there may always be the possibility of his stepping down to a lower level of life. This means that as long as transcendental consciousness has not become permanent, the effect of morning meditation does not persist in its full intensity throughout the day. As the hours go by, the intensity of the effect diminishes, and with this the level of purity in life falls, until the evening meditation restores it. 'Be without the three gunas', as explained by the Lord in the 45th verse of the second chapter, is the key to realizing the teaching of this verse in daily life. Life finds its goal in the state of the eternal freedom of the Transcendent, spoken of here as 'That'; Knowledge Itself. The use of the word 'That' makes it clear that the goal of life does not lie in the sphere of phenomenal existence; it lies beyond it. The real life is not this which is commonly referred to as life; beyond this is That Reality of life. This is a teaching of life from the standpoint of renunciation. The Upanishads declare: 'Tat tvam asi, That thou art', implying that this obvious phase of phenomenal existence, which you take as your self, is not your real nature, you, in fact, are That transcendent Reality. 'Cleansed of all impurities by wisdom': refer to verses 35 to 78 of Chapter IV. 'From which there is no return': as long as the self: is not embedded in the eternity of life, as long as the mind has not permanently gained absolute purity in transcendental consciousness, life remains within the relative field of existence. In this situation the cycle of birth and death continues within the various strata of the evolution of life. When one has gained cosmic consciousness, life goes beyond the sphere of birth and death. For being eternal it is changeless, it cannot partake of change. It should be clearly noted that this situation can only be created during man's life on earth. It is as a man that one rises to that 'state from which there is no return' The way to it lies in the principle described in the 45th verse of Chapter II. The following verse also is concerned with transcending the diversity of form in creation, and it portrays the oneness of life everywhere. It continues the teaching of the renunciation of this to find That. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.18 In a brahmin endowed with learning and humility, in a cow, in an elephant, in a dog and even in one who has lost his caste, the enlightened perceive the Same. This verse provides a criterion of vision in the state of enlightenment. Those who have realized the Reality of life 'perceive the same' oneness through all the diversity of experience. 'Brahmin': a man born in a brahmin family, whose life is dedicated to the study of the Veda and spiritual learning. The use of this word in conjunction with cow, elephant and dog indicates that the Lord wants to emphasize that the Being of an evolved man and that of the animals is the same; and that, established in the oneness of Being, and having realized the Unity of the Transcendent underlying all diversity, he gains evenness of vision. 'Learning and humility': wisdom brings humility. Just as the wise man sees the distinctions and differences in creation as only temporary, with one ultimate Reality underlying them all, so he does not insist that things should happen in any particular way. He takes things lightly, for he knows they all have their common end. This natural quality of Being in the wise is interpreted as humility. Indeed, humility is the criterion of wisdom, arising as it does out of the increased sense of the oneness of life, of the basic Unity of all beings. Humility is commonly understood to be the honest recognition of one's personal limitations, one's ignorance and insignificance; but true humility lies in the quality of Being and not in any attitude of mind. The mind of the realized man is fully infused with the state of Being, the oneness of life, and such a mind naturally has oneness of vision irrespective of what it sees. The apparent distinctions of relative existence fail to create division in its view. This does not mean that such a man fails lo see a cow or is unable to distinguish it from a dog. Certainly he sees a cow as a cow and a dog as a dog, but the form of the cow and the form of the dog fail to blind him to the oneness of the Self, which is the same in both. Although he sees a cow and a dog, his Self is established in the Being of the cow and the Being of the dog, which is his own Being. The Lord stresses that the enlightened man, while beholding and acting in the whole of diversified creation, does not fall from his steadfast Unity of life, with which his mind is saturated and which remains indelibly infused into his vision. 'A brahmin endowed with learning and humility' represents all that is dominated by the influence of sattva. 'A cow' represents all that is dominated by the mixed influence of rajas and sattva. 'A dog' represents all that is dominated by rajas and tamas. 'An elephant' represents all that is dominated by the influence of tamas. 'One who has lost his caste' represents the lowest in human life, a man living in complete ignorance, who has lost the path of his evolution. The meaning is that one who has realized the Self as separate from the field of relative existence is steadfast in himself and quite untouched by the influence of sattva, rajas or tamas and tendencies that arise from them. He has evenness of vision everywhere. The following verse shows the primary importance of such oneness of vision. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.19 Even here, in this life, the universe is conquered by those whose mind is established in equanimity. FIawless, indeed, and equally present everywhere is Brahman. Therefore they are established in Brahman. When the mind, through the practice of transcendental meditation, rises to the state of cosmic consciousness, absolute Being becomes permanently established in the nature of the mind, and it attains the state of Brahman, the universal Being. Then the mind finds itself on a level of life from which all the gross and subtle levels of creation can be stimulated, controlled and commanded. It is like a gardener who knows how to work at the level of the sap and can influence the whole tree in any way he likes. Someone who is acquainted with the atomic or sub-atomic level of an object, by working on that level could easily bring about a desired change in any stratum of the object's existence. This is what the Lord means when He says: 'Even here, in this life, the universe is conquered by those whose mind is established in equanimity', in the serenity, the calmness, which is the ultimate level of life. This verse reveals the status of the established intellect, described here as the state in which 'the universe is conquered'. Contentment, power, wisdom and the ability to support all things are obvious qualities of a conqueror of the world. These qualities, and many more besides, are found in the nature of a man who, while living in the world, has gained equanimity of mind. That stable state of evenness of mind in the eternal oneness of Reality belongs to the field of pure consciousness, or omnipresent Being, which is the very source of life-energy, the reservoir of eternal wisdom, the origin of all power in nature and the fountain-head of all success in the world. As long as the mind has not risen permanently to the state of Being and cognized the field of activity as separate from itself, so long does it continue to be involved with activity. Indeed, it is like a slave to activity, a slave to the universe. But when it gains stability in Being and acquires a natural state of equanimity, then it finds the universe as separate from itself, responding quite automatically, like a servant, to its every need. This state of separateness of Being from activity, which is the basis of equanimity of mind, is gained through both Yoga t and Sankhya. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.20 He who neither greatly rejoices on obtaining what is dear to him, nor grieves much on obtaining what is unpleasant, whose intellect is steady, who is free from delusion, he is a knower of Brahman, established in Brahman. This verse describes the nature of the enlightened man's mind. He stands for full Reality, the relative and the Absolute together. Such a man certainly has his own likes and dislikes, he has his own joys and sorrows in the relative field, but they do not take him out of himself; this meaning is clear from the words 'greatly', qualifying 'rejoices', and 'much', qualifying 'grieves'. It shows that a realized man, even though established in divine consciousness, keeps his feet on the ground. Remaining on the human level, he is divine. When the mind is deeply rooted in the bliss-consciousness of the Self, it naturally remains unaffected by the attachment or aversion present in the objects of the senses. This is the reason why the enlightened man neither 'rejoices' nor 'grieves'. It is a common experience even in worldly life that when the mind is deeply rooted in one thing it fails to register deeply experiences of other matters. If the idea of catching an aeroplane on time engages the mind fully, none of the many objects that are seen and sounds that are heard while one is driving through the streets will deflect the mind from the air terminal. In such circumstances the experience of the other things remains on the surface level of sensory perception and makes only a very faint impression on the mind. If this can happen within the waking state of consciousness, how much more so when another state of consciousness overtakes the mind. The mind of an enlightened man is active in the manifested world, but fails to register deeply the experience of that world. His intellect is steady in its own inner light, the light of the Self. He is awake in himself and yet is awake in the outer world. He lives the Divine in the world; he lives the Absolute and the relative together. Therefore 'he is a knower of Brahman, established in Brahman'. Consider a man in the waking state of consciousness, engaged in the experience of the outside world, while at the same time he carries the experience of the dreaming state of consciousness in his mind. For him the experiences of the waking state are certainly more concrete than those of the dreaming state, but the two types of experience co-exist. This makes it clear that it is possible for a man to be in one state of consciousness and yet accept the experience of another state of consciousness at the same time. When, through meditation, one gains transcendental consciousness, its self-sufficiency is so overwhelming that even in the waking state of consciousness one maintains within oneself the influence of Being. Moreover, when the maintenance of Being in the active mind becomes full and permanent, the entire activity of the waking state is found only on the very surface of the mind. This is the state of cosmic consciousness, in which activity is experienced as separate from Being. It will be noticed that the Lord describes two conditions that have to be fulfilled if a man is to become realized. The first is that he should be a 'knower of Brahman', that is, he should have a clear intellectual understanding of Reality. This condition belongs to the sphere of Sankhya. The second condition is that he should be 'established in Brahman', that is, he should have direct experience of divine nature so that his daily life becomes its expression. This condition belongs to the field of Yoga. Therefore this verse too upholds the teaching of verses 4 and 5 of the present chapter and also that of the last verse of Chapter IV in that it satisfies both Sankhya and Yoga on the level of renunciation. It describes the inner state of renunciation of a realized man, whether he has realized through Yoga or through Sankhya. Because he has realized the independent nature of the Self, such a man is without delusion about his own identity, this makes the intellect steady. This steadiness of intellect is the state of life in which he 'neither greatly rejoices on obtaining what is dear to him, nor grieves much on obtaining what is unpleasant'. The present verse brings to light the natural state of renunciation in the life of a realized man, who does not rejoice in anything external. The following verse explains the reason for his renunciation: he is fixed in the bliss of his own Being. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.21 He whose self is untouched by externaI contacts knows that happiness which is in the Self. His self joined in Union with Brahman, he enjoys eternal happiness. 'Self is untouched by external contacts': in order to gain the experience of the inner Self in the transcendental state of consciousness, the experience of outside objects has to be eliminated. Through constant experience, the Self becomes so familiar to the mind that the very nature of the mind is transformed into the nature of the Self Then transcendental consciousness is maintained together with the waking state of consciousness, which continues to support all activity as it did before. By virtue of the permanent maintenance of transcendental consciousness, the Self is always experienced as Self. And simultaneously, by virtue of the waking state of consciousness, activity continues to be experienced. This is how the Self is experienced as separate from activity. In this state the self is lost for ever; it has become the Self. With the loss of the self, the contact of the self with objects through the agency of the mind and senses, which was responsible for giving rise to experience, becomes non-existent. What remains is the Self in Its pure nature of bliss-consciousness, devoid of any contact with the objects that were held by the self. This is what the Lord means when He says: 'He whose self is untouched by external contacts'. Now that the Self is for ever established in Its own essential nature, bliss-consciousness has become permanent. When this bliss-consciousness comes in contact with objects, it produces a state described by the expression 'self ioined in Union with Brahman'. This is because Brahman is the state of cosmic consciousness, which embraces activity and bliss-consciousness. 'Joined in Union with Brahman': this expression, together with 'self is untouched by external contacts', presents a criterion whereby a seeker can know when he has gained 'Brahmi-sthiti', or the state of Brahman, cosmic consciousness. While the mind is experiencing objects through the senses, he is awake in the awareness of his self as separate from the field of experience and action. This then is the state of cosmic consciousness, in which he is awake in the world and awake in himself. Many commentators have done great injustice to the teaching of this verse by suggesting that it describes a technique of enjoying the bliss of the Self by means of constructing a mood of remaining unaffected while experiencing joy through the objects of the senses. Many translations have treated the original text in a way which, while consistent with the grammar of the verse, presents a false picture of its teaching and is contrary to the essential principle of action and of renunciation. It is the permanency of bliss-consciousness gained through the Yoga of action, and again it is the state of renunciation gained through the Yoga of renunciation based on bliss-consciousness that keep the Self unaffected during the experience of joy; it is not the intellectual practice of trying to hold the mind back and keep it unaffected during the process of experience that brings one to bliss-consciousness and to the state of renunciation, where the Self is experienced as separate from activity. It is because the Self is joined in Union with Brahman that a man enjoys eternal happiness. The reason why the joys of the senses cannot make a deep impression on the enlightened man is that his self has become Self, which is wholly blissful in nature. Being wide awake in cosmic intelligence, his natural stand is at the fountain-head of all the joys of all the senses. Being permanently established in absolute bliss, the temporary joys of relative existence fail to fascinate his self Even when sensory objects come into contact with his senses, the joys of such contacts are not so powerful as to distract the self from its natural state of bliss-consciousness. This is why his self remains unaffected while his senses are fully in contact with their objects. The expressions 'self is untouched by external contacts', 'knows that happiness which is in the Self' and 'his self ioined in Union with Brahman' place Sankhya and Yoga on a common basis, thus upholding verses 4 and 5, which contain the essence of the teaching of this chapter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.22 All pleasures born of contact are only sources of sorrow; they have a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti. The enlightened man does not rejoice in them. This verse contrasts with the previous one in that it explains the principle of the unattached state of the Self, and at the same time complements it by clarifying the principle of happiness and suffering. 'Contact': as in the previous verse, this means contact of the self with the field of activity or experience. It depicts the state in which the self does not remain untouched, the state in which the self remains involved with the field of experience and joys of the senses. Such joys are 'sources of sorrow' by virtue of the self being involved with them. If, however, the Self remains untouched, then the joys of the senses are not sources of sorrow, for in that state the Self is established in eternal happiness. When the mind begins to take delight in the objects of the senses, this shows that its delight is not within; the mind is not anchored to the bliss of the Self, it is absorbed in the outer direction away from bliss. If the mind no longer faces in the direction of bliss, and if it is not neutral, then it is obviously turned towardS sorrow. Therefore when the mind is absorbed in outer joys, then it is absorbed in the field of sorrow. Anything that leads the mind in an outward direction becomes a source of sorrow. This truth about the enjoyments of the world is valid when considered from the level of cosmic consciousness and from that of God-consciousness, the ultimate Reality of life. Seen from the ordinary level of the consciousness of man, to say that the 'pleasures born of contact are only sources of sorrow' seems absurd. Yet even on this level of consciousness the same principle applies: they 'are only sources of sorrow', the reason being that 'they have a beginning and an end'. 'The enlightened man does not rejoice in them': established in the state of eternal happiness, in Brahmi-sthiti, and experiencing the Self as separate from activity, he has by nature risen above the phenomenal phase of life, above the fleeting joys of the relative field, and so he is not in a state where he can rejoice in temporary joys. When a retailer becomes a wholesale merchant he no longer deals in the retail field, which requires more effort and produces less profit. The experience of the objects of the senses in the waking state differs from that in the state of cosmic consciousness. It may be likened to the experience of objects through glasses of different colours, whereby the same object is experienced differently. The enlightened man is simply not in a position to 'rejoice in them' as he did before realization, because of the difference in his state of consciousness. 'Sources of sorrow': the intensity of happiness that one can enjoy depends on the level of one's consciousness. At every level of consciousness there is a corresponding intensity of happiness. This principle applies also to intelligence and power. The difference between the consciousness of the enlightened man and that of the unenlightened is as great as that between the Absolute and the relative, between light and darkness. For this reason the joys of the senses, which delight the ignorant, are looked upon as sources of sorrow by the wise In comparison with the eternal bliss of the Absolute, in which the enlightened are naturally established, the fleeting joys of the world 'are only sources of sorrow'. When the Lord uses these words, it is to express the truth and at the same time strike hard at the minds of those who are engrossed in such joys and whose vision is thus blinded. If the self delights in the experience of objects, since the objects are changing, the delight will soon be lost. This loss of pleasure will give rise to suffering. That is why the Lord says: 'they have a beginning and an end... The enlightened man does not rejoice in them' He who lacks contact with inner Being becomes engrossed in external pleasures. 'They have a beginning and an end': this expression presents a contrast with 'eternal happiness' in the previous verse. When one joy comes to an end, the self is subjected to a state without joy which, in contrast with the experience of joy, is suffering. But if the Self has gained a state of perpetual happiness, then It is left with no possibility of suffering. Absence of bliss-consciousness is the source of sorrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.23 He who is able, even here, before liberation from the body, to resist the excitement born of desire and anger, is united with the Divine. He is a happy man. 'Even here': remaining within the limitations of the relative field of daily life in the world. The ability 'to resist the excitement born of desire and anger' has its basis in the state of supreme contentment which results from Union with the Divine and from the knowledge of the Self as separate from the field of activity in the state of cosmic consciousness, which is the result of such Union. In this state of lasting: contentment there is no possibility of any excitement. Excitement can only arise in a discontented mind ever seeking something more. 'Desire and anger' belong to the realm of the mind. For any mental activity to take place there must of necessity be a corresponding activity in the physical structure of the nervous system. The mental activity of desire and anger produces very powerful 'excitement' in the nervous system. It is this physical excitement that stirs the nervous system to activity. In the case of a non-realized man this excitement is immediately expressed as speech and action; but in the case of a realized man, it is anchored to eternal silence as a ship is anchored to the sea-bed. His nervous system permanently maintains that state of restful alertness which correspond's to pure awareness of the Self, and this state of restful alertness prevents the stir of desire and anger in the nervous system. This is how the state of his nervous system does not allow excitement to arise in a realized man. Self-awareness acts as a shock-absorber on the mental level, while the state of restful alertness of the nervous system acts as a shock-absorber on the physical level. This is the natural state of life in cosmic consciousness. Life flows through desire. As long as desire is present, the possibility of anger will always exist, and therefore the stir produced by desire and anger is an essential feature of life. This is why the Lord does not advocate the elimination of desire, but only says that it is necessary to create a situation in which 'the excitement born of desire and anger' is automatically resisted in the sense that it does not overpower life. This situation is created by culturing both the mental and physical aspects of life through the practice of transcendental meditation, which produces the necessary refinement in the mind and the nervous system simultaneously. In the state of cosmic consciousness, which is the state described by 'united with the Divine', this refinement is such that it does not allow the excitement of desire and anger to arise. But the Lord says: 'before liberation', before gaining cosmic consciousness. This is because the knowledge that the Self is divine in Its nature and is completely unattached to the field of activity grows as the practice of gaining transcendental consciousness advances, so that long before a man has actually gained cosmic consciousness the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind becomes intense enough to give him the ability to resist 'the excitement born of desire and anger'. The need for resisting this excitement arises only when there is a chance for the excitement to arise. This happens only before cosmic consciousness is actually gained. Nevertheless, it is clear from this teaching that the ability to resist excitement should be considered as one criterion of being united with the Divine This is because there is no direct way of measuring the degree of infusion of Being into the mind and ascertaining whether or not full and final infusion of Being has taken place. The second criterion that the Lord gives is: 'He is a happy man'; he is free from the 'sources of sorrow', as shown in the previous verse. 'Before liberation from the body': this expression shows that the present teaching is for an aspirant engaged in the practice of gaining the state of Unity with the Divine. It means before having gained release from the binding influence of action, before having gained the state of cosmic consciousness, in which the Self is permanently experienced as separate from activity, before identification of the self with the body is dissolved, before the state of renunciation has been achieved. This verse has been generally misunderstood to mean that resisting desire is a way to Union with the Divine, and this has given rise to all sorts of ascetic practices and exhortations to abandon desire for the sake of coming to Union It is wrong to suppose that this verse offers a path to Union through attempting to resist desire It merely places Union with the Divine parallel to the natural ability to resist desire. This ability in the relative field is the expression of the Union in the absolute field. Of the two, Union with the Divine is easier to attain. It forms the basis of the ability to resist. Having declared in this verse that the mind of a yogi remains unshakeable in the field of activity, the Lord, in the following verse, goes on to describe the inner state of such a mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.24 He whose happiness is within, whose contentment is within, whose sight is all within, that yogi, being one with Brahman, attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness. This verse is the crest of the teaching of this chapter on renunciation. It presents a state in which life is wholly converged upon its innermost aspect, and declares that state to be eternal freedom. Furthermore, it brings to light the sequence of stages on the way to realization: as the practice of transcendental meditation advances inner happiness grows; with this, contentment grows, and at the same time the experience of Being becomes clearer, the inner light grows. With this, inner awareness grows, and with it the ability spontaneously to maintain Being during activity. When one naturally begins to maintain the state of Being in all states of waking, dreaming and deep sleep, then one has attained eternal freedom in divine consciousness. 'He whose happiness is within': this expression is a development of the argument in the two preceding verses. First, 'All pleasures born of contact are only sources of sorrow . . . The enlightened man does not rejoice in them' (verse 22). This implies that the outside world is not the field of happiness for a realized man. Second, 'He is a happy man' (verse 23). If his happiness does not lie in the outside world and yet he is happy, his happiness can only be within himself. The mind wanders in search of happiness but when, through Union with the Divine, the mind is transformed into bliss-consciousness, it finds the goal of its search within itself. By virtue of bliss-consciousness, even the relative aspect of man's existence is wholly permeated by bliss. So, experiencing the relative field of happiness outside and absolute bliss within, his whole life is naturally anchored to inner happiness, and therefore to 'contentment' also. 'Whose light is all within': who dwells in the light of the Self, whose inner being is illumined by the light of the inner Divine. The word 'all' is important: it means that he is totally absorbed in the inner light, that his whole life is permeated by the light of inner Being. He is awake within himself and remains so in spite of any activity in the outside world. He is established on that absolute level of existence which is deep within everything, that field of unbounded bliss-consciousness which is self-sufficient and self-illuminating. This does not mean that he is not active in outer life. It simply means that even though his mind, intellect, ego, senses and body are functioning on their respective levels, and he has the whole phenomenal world around him, his Self remains completely unattached. It is only superficially affected by this outer field of life. This is that integrated state of existence in which every level of life is self-sufficient and all the different levels progressively function together in harmony. 'Eternal freedom in divine consciousness': this translates the Sanskrit, 'Brahmanirvana', the freedom born of the state of Brahman. The present verse speaks of 'that yogi' who does not require anything in the outside world to make him happy. Nothing in the outside world attracts him. He does not need an external light, for he is awake in his own light. Established in the freedom of cosmic consciousness, he is always free. The experience of variety in the world in no way takes him out of his liberation; no external light, or knowledge of the relative world, can in any way deprive him of his state. Once Self-consciousness is established in the nature of the mind, the mind cherishes it in all conditions. The Lord is saying that nothing in the world will be able to overshadow the perpetual freedom of a yogi in this resolute state. While he acts in the relative field of life, he is yet established in his own Self. Divine consciousness is not opposed to life in the world, nor is consciousness of the relative world opposed to the divine consciousness of absolute existence. The following verse brings out other features of the state of enlightenment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.25 The seers, whose sins are destroyed, whose doubts are dispelled, who are self-controlled and take delight in doing good to all creatures, attain eternal freedom in divine consciousness. It should be noted that when the Lord presents the state of eternal freedom through the principle of renunciation, as He does in the previous verse, He does not lose a moment before adding that in such a state a man takes 'delight in doing good to all creatures'. In the state of renunciation a man becomes devoted to all creatures and capable of doing good not only to himself but to all other beings. It is this teaching that places the philosophy of renunciation parallel to that of the Yoga of action. 'Seers': the knowers of Reality, established in the realization of the Self: as separate from activity, who see life as the drama of the Divine while themselves remaining uninvolved. 'Whose sins are destroyed': sins are destroyed by both Yoga and Sankhya. 'Doubts are dispelled' by both Yoga o and Sankhya. 'Self-controlled': this state is gained by both Yoga and Sankhya. 'Delight in doing good to all creatures': this state is reached by both Yoga and Sankhya. The Lord here describes certain pre-requisites for one who is to 'attain eternal freedom in divine consciousness'. It is fortunate for aspirants that all these conditions are fulfilled quite naturally and automatically through the teaching of Sankhya, which is inclusive of the method described by the Lord in the 45th verse of the second chapter: 'Be without the three gunas'. The simple technique of achieving this state 'without the three gunas' is the practice of transcendental meditation, for it readily brings the mind from the field of gross experience to the state of transcendental consciousness. When the mind transcends during meditation, it reaches the state of pure consciousness, free from all diversity. Once it becomes permanently established in Being, knowledge becomes complete and all its doubts,t whatever they may be, quite naturally disappear. Having risen above the egocentricity and selfishness of individuality, abiding in bliss-consciousness and fully connected with the source of energy, a man can but move about compassionately doing good to all beings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.26 Disciplined men, freed from desire and anger, who have disciplined their thoughts and have realized the Self, find eternal freedom in divine consciousness everywhere. It should be noticed that verse 24 promises eternal liberation through Yoga, that verse 25 promises it through Sankhya, and that this verse translates the same promise of eternal liberation into terms of renunciation. The sequence of these three verses mirrors the sequence of the theme of Chapters III, IV and V Thus the Lord brings completeness to the philosophy of renunciation. This verse describes a man in eternal freedom. He is 'disciplined' because he is established in the knowledge of Reality, which gives him a clear understanding of the state of renunciation, or the separation that lies between the Self and activity. By gaining that state he is freed from desire and anger and has disciplined his thoughts. He has 'realized the Self', for he is permanently established in the pure state of Being, or Self-consciousness, he has gained cosmic consciousness. Thus established in divine consciousness he finds eternal freedom everywhere. The state described in this verse is higher than that described in verse 23, for it has arisen out of the destruction of sins and the dispelling of doubts specified in verse 25. Verse 23 presented a happy man in Union with the Divine as one 'who is able.. to resist the excitement born of desire and anger'. This implies that it is still possible for the excitement of desire and anger to bubble up in such a happy man united with the Divine, but that he will be able to resist this excitement. The present verse shows that those 'who have disciplined their thoughts and have realized the Self' are freed from any possibility of the excitement of desire and anger arising in them. Such men of fulfillment live eternal freedom in divine consciousness. 'Who have disciplined their thoughts': a disciplined thought is that which is in harmony with the process of evolution of the thinker and of everything around him. It is in accordance with all the laws of nature. When, during meditation, the mind gains the state of transcendental divine consciousness, it becomes the basis of all the laws of nature that govern the process of evolution on every level of creation. On coming out into the field of relative life, its thoughts naturally receive the support of all the laws of nature. Therefore 'have disciplined their thoughts' means living the Being in daily life; it does not mean controlling thoughts. 'Everywhere' means during life here on earth and hereafter. Arjuna is shown that, to become liberated, it is not necessary to die or to leave the body. If one has known the Self and the mind is inseparably established in It, if the Self is appreciated as separate from activity, then whatever desires or anger arise, the Self remains completely uninvolved and therefore free from them. This is how, when the mind is disciplined in terms of the Self, it remains unconcerned with all activity, even the activity of desire or anger. Naturally, in such a state a man is liberated during his lifetime here on earth and subsequently after death. It may be recalled that a disciplined life, freedom from desire and anger,t discipline of thoughts' and realization of the Self are achieved by both Yoga and Sankhya.oo Therefore it may be inferred from this verse that Yoga and Sankhya are the same so far as these results are concerned. This inference is in keeping with verses 4 and 5, which present the purpose of this chapter. This verse, together with the three previous verses, establishes the possibility of divine life in the world either through the practice of Yoga or the wisdom of Sankhya. In the following verse, the Lord begins a precise description of the practice which leads a man to achieve that state of cosmic consciousness (jivan-mukti) during his lifetime. This will complete the teaching of the chapter and will provide a sound basis for the wisdom of Chapter VI. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.27 Having left external contacts outside; with the vision within the eyebrows; having balanced the ingoing and outgoing breaths that flow through the nostrils, The first point is that the attention has to shift away from the external field of sensory perception. 'Having left external contacts outside' means closing the gates of the senses to any outside experience and at the same time not thinking about objects of sensory impression. The second point is that the vision is 'within the eyebrows'. This means that vision is directed outwards from within the eyebrows, it is directed from behind the eyebrows, and this is done with closed eyes. It is the most relaxed and effortless state of the ocular muscles. It is soothing to the entire system and also has the simultaneous effect of leaving 'external contacts outside' and balancing 'the ingoing and outgoing breaths'. This point has been widely misunderstood and the verse misinterpreted as advocating concentration of the vision between the eyebrows. Such a practice may have its value in other systems which depend on effort. Concentrating the vision in this manner involves great strain even with the eyes closed; such a practice has no place in the Bhagavad-Gita, which teaches a simple and effortless method. The third point is that a state of balance should be established between the outward and inward breaths. This balance means that they should flow evenly, and should cease flowing, in alternating directions, finally coming to a state of suspension. There are many ways of accomplishing these three aims. In some practices, control of the senses predominates, in others control of thought, in others control of breath. But the practice to which the Lord refers in this verse is one which works on all these aspects simultaneously and results in the state described in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.28 The sage, whose senses, mind and intellect are controlled whose aim is liberation, from whom desire, fear and anger have departed, is indeed for ever free. 'The sage' (muni): see II, 56, 59. 'Senses, mind and intellect are controlled' by 'having known him who is beyond the intellect' (III, 43). 'Whose aim is liberation' means that all his efforts are directed one-pointedly towards liberation. He follows unswervingly the sure path trodden by 'the ancient seekers of liberation' (IV, 15). The whole routine of his life is dedicated to the practice of meditation and balanced activity.' As a result of this constant practice, he becomes quite naturally free from desire, fear and anger. 'From whom desire, fear and anger have departed' indicates that he has not done anything to drive them away, they have of themselves departed from him. The present verse describes an even more perfect state of realization than that portrayed in verse 26 There the expression 'freed from desire and anger' indicates that a man has abandoned them; the expression in the present verse, 'from whom desire, fear and anger have departed', indicates that they have abandoned him. The reason is that he has arrived at a state where the Self is experienced as separate from activity, and thus he finds himself 'indeed for ever free' This is the state of perfect renunciation that is gained in cosmic consciousness. Here is the fulfillment of the philosophy of renunciation, everything has been separated from the Self, which has gained in liberation a perfect state of non-attachment. This apparently marks the peak of renunciation. But the question arises: Is this all that the philosophy of renunciation can offer? If it is, then the philosophy is not complete, because an existence aloof from everything could not possibly be the fulfillment of life. This anxious enquiry is answered in the next verse, which provides for the desired fulfillment of life and shows that fulfillment to be the real pinnacle of the philosophy of renunciation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$5.29 Having known Me as the enjoyer of yagyas and austerities, as the great Lord of all the world, as the friend of all beings, he attains to peace. Here is the real glory of renunciation. It discovers the great 'enjoyer': it develops into Union with God. 'Me': whose birth and actions are divine (IV, 9); who am the refuge of those freed from attachment, fear and anger, unto whose Being have come those purified by the austerity of wisdom (IV, 10); who show men favour in the same manner as they approach Me (IV, 11); who am the author of the fourfold order of creation, yet remain the non-doer, immutable (IV, 13); whom actions do not involve and who am without longing for the fruit of action; knowledge of whom liberates men from the bondage of action (IV, 14). 'Yagyas': actions supporting life and evolution. These have been dealt with in detail in Chapter IV, verses 24-33. 'Austerities': means of purification. The performance of yagya is also considered to be austerity. Verse lo Of Chapter IV describes wisdom in terms of austerity, purified by which one participates in the consciousness of the Supreme. 'Having known Me as the enjoyer of yagyas and austerities': he sees Me as accepting his yagya and austerity; having separated himself from the field of activity, his activity has been given over to Nature, which is the Lord's. This is why the Lord says: 'Having known Me as the enjoyer of yagyas and austerities'. 'Having known me.. as the great Lord of all the world': having raised his consciousness to the level of My consciousness; that is, having attained God-consciousness. Knowledge of God is possible only' when one has reached the state of God-consciousness. This has been made clear in the commentary on verse 38 of Chapter IV. 'As the friend of all beings': a friend is a source of joy. He brings life-supporting happiness. The purpose of the Lord's creation is the expansion of happiness. Men enjoy His love expressed in creation, each at his own level of consciousness. This is how 'the great Lord of all the world' is also the life-supporting friend, the bestower of happiness on all beings. One who knows Him thus and finds himself close to Him, gains fulfillment: 'he attains to peace', says the Lord. So that Arjuna's mind may not escape from the present realities of life to an abstract conception of a far-distant friend of all beings, so that he can see the great Lord of all the world close at hand, speaking to him, Lord Krishna shows that He Himself is that Lord. It is only because of Arjuna's complete surrender. that He reveals Himself so completely. This chapter, which lays open the wisdom of the renunciation of action, ends with an exposition of the divine nature of Lord Krishna, so full, friendly and peaceful. This is the glory of the wisdom of renunciation that is uniquely the Bhagavad-Gita's. It does not leave a man in dry detachment, barren and without support. It carries renunciation to the direct realization of the supreme authority, the supreme good, the supreme happiness that are found in rising to the level of the Godhead, to direct communion with God. This humanly inconceivable accomplishment in man's life is the blessing of renunciation. Here is the Lord's invitation to humankind: Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven through the path of action or through the path of renunciation of action. Make your choice. Thus ends the Yoga of Action and Renunciation of Action, Karma-Sanyasa Yoga. This chapter stands as the keystone in the arch of the Bhagavad-Gita. It explains in detail what may be called the Royal Yoga of Lord Krishna, which readily brings enlightenment to any man in any age. The greatness of the theme of these six chapters lies first in the explanation of life in its manifold aspects and then in the synthesis of all these aspects in the Unity of God-consciousness. It is a divine theme expounding Reality, which assumes newer and newer meanings as man's consciousness grows. It gives significance to life at every level of consciousness and brings fulfillment at every step of man's evolution until eternal fulfillment is gained. The first chapter showed a great hero overcome by a profound state of suspension, which rendered him unable to act. I'resenting this extreme case, it silently demanded a master-cure for all sufferings and sorrows in man's life at any time. Chapter II gave the vision of the full life by bringing to light the relative and the absolute phases of existence. It suggested a practice by which all problems in the relative phase of life could be solved by adding the value of absolute consciousness to the consciousness of the relative state. Chapter III expounded the validity of action to make permanent the state of Union experienced in the state of absolute consciousness gained in the transcendental state. Chapter IV brought knowledge of the state of non-attachment, or renunciation, experienced when the state of Union becomes permanent. Chapter V showed this state of non-attachment to be common to the paths of both Sankhya and Karma Yoga. Chapter VI describes the practice that brings about this state of non-attachment, thus fulfilling the teachings on action and on renunciation contained in the third and fifth chapters. This sixth chapter serves as a commentary on the 45th verse of Chapter II, which contains the central teaching of the Bhagavad-Gita: 'Be without the three gunas'. It develops a simple technique of transcendental meditation leading to a state of consciousness which at all times spontaneously maintains Being and thereby equanimity of mind and behavior in the field of activity. This technique provides the practical basis for both Sankhya and Yoga and for the very different ways of life associated with these paths, that of the recluse and that of the householder. They virtually cease to be two different paths. But even if they are regarded as different, it can still be said that they develop on a common ground and arrive at a common goal. This is the glory of the practical teaching of the sixth chapter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.1 The Blessed Lord said: He who performs action that ought to be done, without depending on the fruit of action, he is a sanyasi and he is a yogi; not he who is without fire and without activity. The first two expressions of this verse, 'performs action that ought to be done' and 'without depending on the fruit of action', summarize the teaching of the whole discourse thus far. At the same time they indicate that the practice which is going to be explained in this chapter will enable man to live the teachings they contain. This practice will enable all men to cultivate that high state of divine consciousness which should be normal to man and which forms the basis of the life of a sanyasi and of a yogi. It is obvious from the theme of the discourse that what brings fulfillment to life is not a specific way of life, either that of a recluse or of a householder, but experience of Reality and knowledge about It. This again is obvious from the expressions in the present verse, which describe the state of consciousness common to a yogi and a sanyasi: 'He who performs action that ought to be done, without depending on the fruit of action'. This verse is a continuation of Lord Krishna's answer to Arjuna's question, in the first verse of Chapter V, about the relationship of renunciation of action to the Yoga of action. In the early stages of His answer, the Lord showed that both ways have an identical end in the state of liberation, that in their aim they are the same. He then made clear the supremacy of the Yoga of action (Karma Yoga) over the renunciation of action (Sanyasa), and this brought out the fact that the two are distinct paths. In the present verse, the Lord establishes that, while there may be certain points of difference between the path of a sanyasi and that of a karma yogi, there is at least one common factor which brings them together: the unattached state of the mind in relation to the fruits of action during activity. The Lord holds this to be the criterion both of a sanyasi and of a yogi, both of the state of renunciation and of the state of Union. To say that the state of Union is equivalent to the state of renunciation may sound contradictory, but the truth of this statement becomes clear in the state of cosmic consciousness. In this state the mind's Union with Being, Self-consciousness, has become permanent; this is the state of perfect Union. In this state also the Self is experienced as separate from activity; this is the state of perfect renunciation. This is how renunciation and Union co-exist in the same state of life. The state of mind which is unattached to the fruits of action is a result of the experience of the Self as separate from activity. This in turn results from the Union that comes from the practice of gaining transcendental bliss-consciousness through the method which the Lord has already given to Arjuna in the 45th verse of Chapter II. The Lord says to Arjuna: 'action that ought to be done'. By this He intends to save from misinterpretation His teaching about action in the light of non-attachment. Otherwise a misguided man might commit murder or theft and claim that he acted without attachment to the fruits of action. The doctrine of Karma Yoga is not based on the manner in which a man thinks. It is based upon a state of consciousness, the state of Being. Its purpose is to allow the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind and to make It permanent there. Then It becomes permanent in the whole field of thought, speech and action, in the whole field of man's life. This is brought about very naturally by the practice of transcendental meditation followed by activity that is unforced and without strain. The purpose of both Karma Yoga and Sanyasa is to establish a man in the state of complete integration of life. Non-attachment to the fruits of action, described here as characteristic both of a sanyasi and of a yogi, is a particular state of mind, not on the level of thought but on the level of Being. It would be a mistake to make a mood of non-attachment to the fruits of action during activity. It would be sheer hypocrisy to try to hold intellectually, on the level of thought or by mood-making, the idea or feeling: 'I am doing this action for the sake of God, or for the sake of duty, and have no desire for its fruits; I am indeed doing the action, but actually I am not doing it; I am Brahman, and action is also Brahman, and the fruit of action is also Brahman, so even the fruit is nothing but my own Self, and that Self I am already. What need, therefore, to think about the fruit of action?' This way of thinking has nothing to do with the doctrine of non-attachment in Karma Yoga or Sanyasa, and anyone who tries to live non-attachment on the basis of such thinking is only deluding himself. Yet for many centuries the doctrines of Karma Yoga and Sanyasa have been misunderstood in iust this way. Sanyasa and Karma Yoga are neither of them based on any manner of thinking, nor on making moods at the conscious level of the mind; they are based on the inner stability of the mind in the state of enlightenment. The way to this is through transcendental meditation. Without right meditation and the attainment of the state of transcendental consciousness, and eventually of cosmic consciousness, one's actions will always be a means of bondage; no amount of thinking will help to free a man from the binding influence of action. It is a matter for regret that at the present time a man who is active in the world, but without having gained transcendental consciousness, should consider himself a karma yogi simply because he leads a life of activity. performing certain kinds of action and thinking about them in terms of God or in some other special way. To be a karma yogi, one has first to be a yogi. It is the state of transcendental pure consciousness going hand in hand with activity that constitutes Karma Yoga. Through the practice of transcendental meditation the mind is so steeped in pure consciousness, or Being, that this cannot be overshadowed, however numerous a man's actions, however intense his experience in life. The state of Being together with activity makes him a karma yogi. The experience of Being is the first pre-requisite of Karma Yoga, as it is of Sanyasa. So far as the state of consciousness is concerned, Sanyasa and Karma Yoga are the same. 'Without fire': fire cooks food. By tradition, a sanyasi is not expected to cook food lest it bind him to the needs of the body. Therefore being without fire symbolizes the life of a sanyasi. Again, fire is that which destroys. What destroys the eternal calmness of the ocean? A wind that sets up waves. Eternal unmanifested Being appears as waves of individual life through the instrumentality of desire. That is why desire is considered to be fire for one who chooses the life of silence. In this verse, the Lord pictures the life of a sanyasi not in terms of non-attachment or desirelessness, but in terms of activity in freedom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.2 That which they call Sanyasa, know it to be Yoga, O son of Pandu, for no one becomes a yogi who has not relinquished the incentive of desire. 'Incentive of desire' translates the Sanskrit word 'sankalpa', which conveys the idea of a seed which sprouts into desire. Lord Krishna here makes a most essential point for the student of Yoga: sankalpa has to be rooted out in order that one may become a yogi. The Lord has already established Sanyasa and Karma Yoga on an equal footing with regard to their results: 'Both renunciation and the Yoga of action lead to the supreme good' (V, l); 'He who is properly established even in one gains the fruit of both' (V, 4). In this, as in the preceding verse, He puts the two paths themselves on the same basis, and He does so with great emphasis: 'That which they call Sanyasa, know it to be Yoga'. The Lord proves this by bringing to light the single quality which makes a man a sanyasi or a karma yogi. He says: 'no one becomes a yogi who has not relinquished the incentive of desire' A yogi is he whose mind is united with the Divine, and in that state of transcendental consciousness the incentive of desire is rooted out. The question arises: If abandonment of sankalpa is necessary before a man can become a yogi and is also the characteristic of a sanyasi, how in practice is it possible for anyone to become a sanyasi or a yogi? For life, whether lived in the household or in seclusion, is full of sankalpa and desires. The answer is that a man has to create a state of mind in which there is no sankalpa; and seeing that the Lord's discourse is for the man in the world, it must be possible for everyone to create such a state of mind. The principle of the technique to make the mind free from sankalpa was given to Arjuna by the Lord in the 45th verse of Chapter II and will be further expounded in this chapter. During meditation, the mind goes through states of experience which become progressively finer until the finest is transcended. In this way the mind is led to the state of transcendental consciousness and comes completely out of the realm of sankalpa. This is the state of Yoga. It is also the state of Sanyasa, where the mind has renounced everything and is left alone by itself. Thus the technique of transcendental meditation, which helps the mind to transcend sankalpa, is the technique of becoming a yogi or a sanyasi. As the practice advances, transcendental consciousness becomes permanent in the state of cosmic consciousness, and in this state one has permanently relinquished the incentive of desire. The following verse considers the activity of an aspirant and the serenity of an accomplished yogi in relation to the state of mind without sankalpa. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.3 Action is said to be the means for the man of thought wishing to ascend to Yoga; for the man who has ascended to Yoga, and for him alone, calmness is said to be the means. 'Means': course, path, way. 'Man of thought': this translates the Sanskrit 'muni'. A muni is one whose path of fulfillment is through thought. His practice is in the field of the mind as opposed to the field of bodily activity. In order to make this clear, it must be explained that for the mind to register any experience a corresponding activity in the nervous system is necessary. It follows from this relationship of the mind with the nervous system that any experience can be stimulated either by the one or by the other. Hatha Yoga is an approach to realization which trains the physical nervous system and thereby conditions the mind to gain the state of transcendental consciousness and eventually to gain cosmic consciousness. On the other hand, the practice of meditation, referred to in these verses, is an approach to realization which trains the mind and thereby conditions the nervous system to give rise to the state of transcendental consciousness and eventually to cosmic consciousness. This mental approach is the way of the muni. By using the word 'muni', the Lord wants to make it clear that action is not the means for a man of action only, but also for the man whose way of approach is through knowledge. 'Wishing to ascend to Yoga' means that he has not yet attained the state of mind without sankalpa, described in the previous verse. 'Action is said to be the means': action is the means of cultivating the state of mind without sankalpa, This appears to be a paradox similar to the one in verse 18 of Chapter IV. The Lord said there: 'who in action sees inaction'. Here He seems to be saying: Create calmness through action. There is deep meaning in the Lord's expression: 'Action is said to be the means'. It reveals the whole secret of the path of Yoga, the way to create the state of mind without sankalpa. This expression may be considered on different levels. First, it means that the Lord wants the aspirant to perform right action according to his dharma, thus purifying himself and, through the increase of purity, maintaining steadiness of mind. This consideration belongs to the surface of life and should be valued for the inspiration which it gives to a righteous way of living. The consideration which follows reveals a deeper meaning of the Lord's words. He wants the aspirant to involve himself in subtler forms of activity; He wants him to bring the mind from more gross levels of activity on the common sensory level of action and experience to the finer levels of thinking and, eventually transcending the finest level of thinking, to arrive at transcendental consciousness, the state of mind without sankalpa, the state where one 'has ascended to Yoga'. Thus it is through activity that transcendental consciousness is gained. Moreover, the mind, travelling as it were on the ladder of activity from the relative state of waking consciousness to the silence of the transcendental field of absolute consciousness, and again from there to the activity of the waking state, establishes eternal harmony between the silence of the Absolute and the activity of the relative. This is cosmic consciousness, in which transcendental consciousness, the state where one 'has ascended to Yoga', becomes permanent. This expression of the Lord's also has its meaning therefore on the level of cosmic consciousness. Cosmic consciousness in turn forms the basis for the supreme state of Yoga in God-consciousness, where the eternal Unity of life prevails in the light of God. One who has reached this state has ascended to Yoga in the highest sense of the expression. Having defined activity as the means of ascending to Yoga, the Lord turns to the importance of that 'calmness' which serves as a means when one has 'ascended to Yoga'. 'The man who has ascended to Yoga': a man whose mind has risen from the waking state of consciousness to the transcendental state of consciousness, in which his mind is in full Union with the Divine. This state of Yoga in transcendental consciousness becomes permanent in cosmic consciousness through increase of calmness, or the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind. That is why rhe Lord says that calmness is the means when ascent to Yoga in transcendental consciousness has been gained. Again, calmness is the means of ascent from Yoga in cosmic consciousness to Yoga in God-consciousness. In the state of cosmic consciousness, calmness gives the experience of the Self as separate from activity. In God-consciousness, this calmness is transformed into the light of God, in which the experience of the duality of the Self and activity is dissolved. This eternal silence of God-consciousness is the advanced stage of the silence experienced in the state of cosmic consciousness. It is the living silence of that Unity of life which forms the basis of cosmic activity and at the same time completely separates God from cosmic activity. The silence which is experienced in cosmic consciousness, and which separates rhe Self from activity, is on an infinitely smaller scale, for it is on the level of individual existence. The one forms the basis of the activity of the whole of creation, the other the basis of individual activity. The essential difference between the two lies in this: in cosmic consciousness silence and activity co-exist on the same level; whereas the level of God-consciousness is completely free from duality; it is all the living silence of eternal life, and Unity pervades all activity as water every wave. God-consciousness is pure awareness in the oneness of Being. When the awareness of the Self in cosmic consciousness develops into the awareness of God in God-consciousness, it develops on the level of silence; the whole process is one of the transformation of silence. At every step of development the quality of the silence changes. This is the reason why the Lord says: 'for the man who has ascended to Yoga, and for him alone, calmness is said to be the means'. Thus there are three states of silence: in transcendental consciousness, in cosmic consciousness and in God-consciousness. In transcendental consciousness, silence is devoid of any trace of activity. In cosmic consciousness, the silence of Self-awareness coexists with activity. In God-consciousness, the co-existence of activity and silence is transformed into oneness of awareness of God. This silence of God-consciousness is the most highly developed state of silence It is all life on the almighty level of existence It is the omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient silence of Godhead. It is a completely different state of silence, which has nothing in common with the silence of cosmic consciousness or transcendental consciousness. Any achievement by an accomplished yogi, established in cosmic consciousness or God-consciousness, is brought about by the power of silence, the eternal silence of absolute Being, which is the source of all the innumerable laws of nature creating and maintaining life in the cosmos. The individual life of a yogi being one with That, he finds that that omnipresent silence works out everything for him. By using the phrase, 'for him alone', the Lord makes it clear that everything will happen without doing , silence will work as a means for him 'who has ascended to Yoga', but only for him and for none other. When a man gains transcendental consciousness, his nervous system gains the state of restful alertness which corresponds with, and is able to reflect, life eternal on the level of that silence of the Omnipresent. That is why, in this state, the divine intelligence does everything for him. When transcendental consciousness becomes permanent and gains the state of cosmic consciousness, the nervous system permanently remains the instrument of the Divine: Self-awareness is permanently established throughout life. This blessed state exists in a much deeper sense in God-consciousness. In the next verse, the Lord further explains the expression: 'Action is said to be the means'. He shows how the state of non-action is gained through the means of action. Then, in the verse which follows, He explains the expression: 'calmness is said to be the means', showing that the elevation of the self by the Self is brought about by 'calmness'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.4 Only when a man does not cling to the objects of the senses or to actions, only when he has relinquished all incentive of desire, is he said to have ascended to Yoga. Here the Lord describes to Arjuna the state of the mind established in Yoga, the state of Divine Union. When, during meditation, the mind retires from the field of sensory perception, it becomes disconnected with the outside world. It is turned inwards, away from the field of 'the objects of the senses', away from the sphere of 'actions'. As the mind advances in an inward direction, so it retreats further from the field of gross experience. It continues through increasingly subtle fields of thinking, until it eventually transcends even the subtlest state of thought and reaches the transcendental state of Being. Here it does not in any way 'cling to the objects of the senses or to actions'. The state of Being is one of pure consciousness, completely out of the field of relativity; there is no world of the senses or of objects, no trace of sensory activity, no trace of mental activity. There is no trinity of thinker, thinking process and thought, doer, process of doing and action; experiencer, process of experiencing and object of experience. The state of transcendental Unity of life, or pure consciousness, the state of Yoga, is completely free from all trace of duality. In this state of transcendental consciousness a man is 'said to have ascended to Yoga'. Here the Self stands by Itself, Self-illuminant, Self-sufficient, in the fullness of Being. Here one 'has relinquished all incentives of desire', for where there is no duality there cannot be even the seed of desire But the state of Yoga in transcendental consciousness is not permanent. When the mind comes out of meditation, it will once more cling to the objects of the senses and to actions, even if not so firmly as before, and the incentive of desire will once more play its part. Only when a man has reached the state of cosmic consciousness, where he is ever contented and for ever firmly established in the Self, will the conditions which this verse sets for one who has 'ascended to Yoga' be permanently fulfilled. Naturally these conditions are also satisfied in God-consciousness, which is the fulfillment of cosmic consciousness. Thus, as the previous verse has already shown, the expression, 'is . . . said to have ascended to Yoga', applies not only to transcendental consciousness but also to cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.5 Let a man raise his self by his Self, let him not debase his Self; he alone, indeed, is his own friend, he alone his own enemy. Here is a single teaching to show the basic principle of development in any sphere of life, spiritual, mental or material. Every individual is responsible for his own development in any field. In the previous verse Arjuna was shown the meaning of realization; now the Lord commands him to reach that state. 'Raise his self': the word used in the original Sanskrit is 'uddharet'. It means to raise, uplift, elevate, glorify, to free from bondage. By using this word, the Lord inspires Arjuna to raise himself from the level of sensory perception and the field of thought and activity to the state of Self-realization. He not only inspires Arjuna to cultivate the state of transcendental Self-consciousness, but instructs him in the direct way of doing so: 'raise his self by his Self'. No help from outside is required. A man has in himself everything he needs to rise to any height of perfection. Nothing of the world is needed to elevate the self; no method is to be adopted, no means to be sought. The self: is elevated by the Self alone. The question may then arise: How can a man 'debase his Self' when he has been declared as beyond the reach of anything outside himself? Do not verses 17 to 70 of Chapter II pronounce the dweller in the body as beyond any influence of time and space? To understand this one must recall the previous verse. When the mind attains to transcendental consciousness, it is in the state of perfect purity; it achieves cosmic status. In the present verse, the Lord encourages Arjuna to rise to that state, and at the same time wants him not to fall from it once it has been achieved. For w'hen the mind comes out of the transcendental state to experience once more the objects of the senses in the world, it regains its limited individual status and falls from that height of universal existence In order to warn him against this, the Lord says: 'let him not debase his Self', meaning that, once having attained the state of Self-consciousness, he should go on to rise to the state of cosmic consciousness, as explained in the commentaries on verses 3 and 4. The expression, 'he alone, indeed, is his own friend', indicates that only in its pure state of transcendental consciousness is the mind helpful to itself. When it comes out of that state of Being, it acts as its own enemy to deprive itself of its cosmic status; but when it continues the practice and rises to cosmic consciousness, then it acts as its own friend to maintain that cosmic status. This teaching illuminates the whole area of the search for Truth. Nothing in the outside world is relevant to this search. For, the Lord says, there is no friend of the self other than the Self. No particular culture or way of life is especially conducive to Self-realization; no sense of detachment or attachment is conducive or opposed to Self-realization. Renunciation of the world, or a recluse way of life, is not especially helpful to the unfolding of the Self, for It unfolds Itself by Itself to Itself Through meditation a situation is created where the Self is found uncovered, unfolded in Its pure and essential nature with no shadow cast upon It by anything. Meditation does not unfold the Self, the Self, it must be repeated, unfolds Itself by Itself to Itself. The wind does nothing to the sun; it only clears away the clouds and the sun is found shining by its own light. The sun of the Self is self-effulgent. Meditation only takes the mind out of the clouds of relativity. The absolute state of the Self ever shines in Its own glory. The Lord's teaching in this verse applies to every level of evolution. This is obvious from the two preceding and the two following verses. It may be interesting to note at this point that the fullest development of the self is through three stages: from the waking state of consciousness to transcendental consciousness, from transcendental consciousness to cosmic consciousness and from cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness. The teaching of this verse is equally applicable to all these stages of one's development. In the first stage, the, self evolves by means of the activity of transcendental meditation and realizes the Self. In the second stage, from transcendental consciousness to cosmic consciousness, the state of Self is supplemented by the activity of the self in order to maintain the Self in Its true nature even in the midst of activity. In the third and final stage, from cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness, the Self has to go all by Itself and on the level of silence devoid of any activity. That is why the Lord said in the third verse: 'calmness is said to be the means'. And in the present verse, He says: 'Let a man raise his self by his Self'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.6 He who has conquered his self by his Self aIone is himself his own friend; but the Self of him who has not conquered his seIf will behave with enmity like a foe. The acquisition by the mind (the self in its relative aspect) of the state of Self-realization, or transcendental consciousness, is described here as a conquest: the lower self has conquered the higher Self. Through this conquest, the individual mind has gained the status of cosmic mind, or pure consciousness. This cosmic intelligence then becomes the basis of the whole of practical life; it supports and gives strength to all fields of relativity. The mind, during meditation, reaches the state of transcendental Being and, coming out of the Transcendent into the field of relative life, remains saturated with Being. With constant practice of transcendental meditation, there comes a point where the saturation of the mind with Being becomes permanent and continues without interruption throughout all experiences in the relative world, with the result that the Self is experienced as separate from activity, and the binding influence of action is neutralized. The conscious mind of man, acting in the world, then acts in freedom, supported and protected by Being. This is how the Self, having been conquered by the self, befriends the self. The lower self and the higher Self belong to the one indivisible Reality, which is inclusive of both the transcendental and relative aspects of life. Like brothers bound by the natural affinity of blood, they support each other in every way. This is one aspect of their relationship. But there is another: when a difference arises between brothers, they can become deadly enemies. This happens when the self has not conquered the Self. If a man has not begun to meditate and has not consciously realized the Self, if his mind has not reached the realm of transcendental Being, then it will not have attained the status of cosmic intelligence either temporarily or permanently. This means that his lower self is not familiar with the higher Self, and there is no co-ordination between the two. The one has not accepted the other. They stand opposed to each other in their essential nature, for one is relative and the other transcendental. In the field of relativity they exist as enemies. The lower self is always acting through the senses, encouraging them and enjoying the variety of objective experience, thus preventing the higher Self from being effective in the relative field of existence and allowing It to remain as it were confined in the field of the Transcendent. In return, the higher Self also behaves as an enemy to the lower self It does not save the self from the fast grip of the ever-changing life of relative existence, but allows it to remain within the cycle of birth and death. The higher Self does not provide the unlimited energy, wisdom, creativity and happiness which alone will give peace and abundance to the lower self. Conquest of the self by the Self and conquest of the Self by the self amounts to the same thing. It can be understood in either way so long as the conquest denotes the Union of the two, or merger of the one into the other The merger of the self into the Self takes place in the state of transcendental consciousness and becomes permanent in cosmic consciousness. The self finds itself one with the Self. This is that state where the self and the Self support each other so intimately that they do not exist independently of each other. The next verse elaborates the inner and outer condition of the realized man, of one who has 'conquered'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.7 For him who has conquered his self, who is deep in peace, the transcendent Self is steadfast in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, in honor and disgrace. In verse 4 of this chapter, the Lord made a distinction between the realm of worldly activity and that of Being. In verses 5 and 6, He showed the way to establish co-ordination between the two. In the present verse, He describes the condition of the mind in this state, how one feels within when co-ordination between outer life and inner Being is established. The Lord says that one feels eternally peaceful, being immersed in the glory of the Supreme. In this state the whole of life, with all its pairs of opposites, is permeated with the glory of the transcendent Being. This state of eternal peace in bliss-consciousness cannot be shaken by anything whatsoever. This verse emphasizes the resolute nature of the established intellect. In the following verse, the idea is developed and is elaborated into a description of the yogi who is united. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.8 That yogi is said to be united who is contented in knowledge and experience, unshakeable, master of the senses, who is balanced in experiencing earth, stone or gold. The Lord brings out the two aspects of realization, the two aspects of becoming a yogi. The first is that of gaining a clear intellectual conception of the Truth through a proper understanding of Reality reached by listening, thinking, contemplating and discriminating intellectually between Its various aspects. This, however, satisfies only the mind. The other aspect is that of knowing Reality by direct experience, which satisfies the heart. This is gained through transcendental meditation. The Lord says that when the mind is satisfied by a completely clear intellectual conception of Reality, an'd the heart is satisfied by the direct experience of Its blissful and eternal nature, then a man gains eternal contentment. Then only does he become firm in his own state of life Such an 'unshakeable' nature always behaves in the field of the senses as a 'master of the senses' and never as their slave. He 'is said to be united', and he is a yogi whose life is marked by a balanced state of mind throughout all experience in the field of diversity. This idea of balance in life will recur many times during the discourse. The repetition of this principle at short intervals indicates not only its intrinsic importance, but its relevance to Arjuna's situation. At the same time it brings home to him that, whatever method the mind adopts in order to become established in Reality -- be it the path of action or that of renunciation, once it becomes established, the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind is the same and brings with it the same balanced vision. Although they may differ in mode of life and manner of activity, those who are realized have this in common: they always possess balanced understanding and vision. Having spoken of the realized man's inner state of mind and of his nature during experience of the outer world, the Lord, in the following verse, describes his behavior towards others in society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.9 Distinguished is he who is of even intellect among well-wishers, friends and foes, among the indifferent and the impartial, among hatefuI persons and among kinsmen, among the saints as well as the sinful. 'Even intellect': because of this inner state of eternal contentment, the mind of a yogi abides in silence. Based on this silence, his intellect is even. This does not mean that he behaves to everyone in like manner. A yogi does not create confusion in the various fields of relationship by failing to recognize due differences. But among all the variety of relationships his understanding, based on the oneness of life, does not waver He remains 'of even intellect'. A man who has balanced vision while experiencing objects has been declared a yogi in the previous verse. The balanced vision described in that verse belongs 'to a yogi, whether he has reached his state through the path of Sankhya or Karma Yoga. The present verse sets the standard for a yogi who is 'distinguished'. Having so far devoted this chapter to describing all that the practice of meditation can accomplish for man, the Lord, in the following verses, explains the details of the practice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.10 Let the yogi always collect himself remaining in seclusion, alone, his mind and body subdued, expecting nothing, without possessions, 'Collect himself' means meditate. The manner in which the yogi collects himself is mentioned in verse 27 of Chapter V and is detailed in the following five verses of the present chapter. 'Yogi' does not here mean an accomplished yogi. An accomplished yogi no longer has any need to continue the practices necessary for reaching the higher state, for he has already attained it. Because the necessity of practice is being explained, 'yogi' in this context means an aspirant to Yoga. At the same time the word 'yogi' indicates one who has reached a state of Union. The word, therefore, is best understood here as referring to a man who has realized the state of Self-consciousness, or samadhi, but has not yet attained cosmic consciousness, nitya samadhi, or jivan-mukti. Such a yogi has to be intent on practice so that Self-consciousness may become continuous and established in the nature of the mind to such a degree that even when the mind is out in the field of relative experience it is never out of the state of Being. This is the state of cosmic consciousness, the state of an accomplished yogi. To arrive at cosmic consciousness, the yogi has to meditate in silence and then come out into activity. In the present verse, the Lord wants to emphasize that when a yogi meditates he should always do so under the following conditions: 1. remaining in seclusion 2. alone 3. his mind and body subdued 4. expecting nothing 5. without possessions. 'Seclusion' is essential because the process of transcendental meditation, which is a direct way for the mind to arrive at transcendental bliss-consciousness, is a delicate one. It must be allowed to go its way unhindered. If the place of meditation is not secluded, there is more possibility of disturbance. During meditation the mind engages itself in the deeper levels of the thought-process, if it is disturbed and suddenly made to come out into the gross levels of sensory perception, it will experience a great contrast between the subtle and the gross fields of perception. This sudden contrast will damage the mind's serenity and will upset the nervous system. 'Alone': if a man does not meditate alone, then the feeling of someone being around him or watching him will impede the smoothness of the process of transcending. Any such influence, slowing down the march of the mind towards bliss-consciousness, will bring undue strain to the mind and produce a corresponding stress in the nervous system. 'Mind and body subdued': the word 'subdued' is of special interest. The mind is 'subdued' by the experience of happiness, As the mind, during meditation, experiences ever subtler states of thought, it experiences increasing charm at every step. This increasing happiness keeps the mind unwaveringly on the process of meditation. When the mind is subdued in this manner, the nervous system, following the pattern of the mind, remains unwavering. This is how 'his mind and body' are 'subdued' in a most natural manner. It would be wrong to conclude here that the yogi has to make constant and strenuous efforts of control in order to have 'his mind and body subdued'. 'Expecting nothing': when the Lord says that the aspirant should 'always collect himself remaining in seclusion', He wants at the same time to warn him against any tendency to expect. This process of collecting oneself should not contain any element of expectation of some further step in the process or, indeed, of any particular experience. It should be free from any expectation of success in arriving at the goal. This expression brings out the meaning of verse 47 of Chapter II as applied to meditation: 'You have control over action alone, never over its fruits'. The warning against 'expecting' is very significant. When, during meditation, the mind is engaged in experiencing subtler states of the thought-process on the way to transcending, it is set on the path of increasing charm. Any tendency to expect or hope only serves to pull the mind away from this path. The mind, by nature, does not cherish this deviation from the path of increasing happiness and is put to strain. 'Expecting', therefore, will only tend to make the mind miserable, with the result that the body too will be strained. That is why the principle of 'expecting nothing't during meditation is brought out here. 'Without possessions':o meditation is a process which takes the mind from the consciousness of possessions to the consciousness of Being. In terms of possessions, it is a process of becoming possessionless: the Self is left by Itself. The mind loses consciousness of the surroundings and the body, leaving the yogi quite naturally without any consciousness of possessions. The Lord speaks of being 'without possessions' to indicate that nothing is helpful for meditation, because it proceeds on the basis of the mind's natural tendency to go to a field of greater happiness, and that at the same time the process leaves one in a state where everything is abandoned of itself. This expression also conveys that one should sit in meditation prepared to lose everything. When consciousness of outside objects begins to be lost, one should not begin to mourn its loss. The yogi, when he starts his meditation, should not try to hang on to anything. With a free mind he should go to Being and be, awake in himself and lost to the world. As a result, he will be possessed of the Self in the midst of the possessions of the world. The phrase, 'without possessions', expresses the state of Being. When the Lord says: 'expecting nothing, without possessions', it is to show Arjuna what actually happens to the mind during meditation. It would be wrong to try not to have any expectations or desires, not to long for possessions when one sits in meditation; for while trying, the mind would be engaged in the thought of possessions and other objects of desire in order to forget them. Trying to forget amounts to remembering what one aims to forget. This should not be done because the process of meditation does not advance on the basis of forgetting the gross material objective world of possessions, but on the basis of entertaining finer fields of experience. The attempt to forget is based on hatred and condemnation, whereas the spontaneous experience of finer fields of thought during meditation is based on that willing acceptance which is the natural tendency of the mind on the way to greater happiness, on the path of God-realization. This verse brings out the essentials of meditation, the practice which easily leads the mind to transcendental consciousness and from there, through the spontaneous infusion of Being into activity, to cosmic consciousness. It must not be mistaken as teaching a mode of conduct for life as a whole. This verse does not advocate a monkish withdrawal from life for a yogi. It should not be understood as teaching that a yogi must always remain away from society, by himself, aspiring to nothing and possessing nothing. If the distinction is not made between the time of meditation itself and the time spent out of meditation, then this verse and the succeding ones may well be misunderstood. The following verses give further details of the practice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.11 In a clean place, having set his seat firm, neither very high nor very low, having placed sacred grass, deerskin and cloth one upon the other. 'A clean place' means either that the place is naturally clean or has been made clean and free from dust and insects; that it is, if possible, in surroundings that are pleasant, or at least not unsightly and unpleasant. Both the place and the seat should be conducive to meditation. The meditator should feel comfortable and pleasant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.12 Seated there on the seat, having made the mind one-pointed, with the activity of the senses and thought subdued, let him practice Yoga for seIf-purification. The first point the Lord wants to make clear is that meditation should be performed in the sitting position and not lying down or standing. Lying down makes the mind dull; standing produces a fear of falling when the mind is drawn deep within. A normal state of mind is needed for starting meditation. The mind should neither be dull nor very active. When it is dull, tending to sleepiness, it loses the capacity for experience. When it is very active, it remains in the field of gross experience and, as it were, refuses to enter into the field of subtle experience, just as someone very active on the surface of the water does not sink. To meditate is to let the mind sink into the Self. The process of sinking does not start if the mind is too active, as it has to be when the body is standing. The Lord therefore tells Arjuna that he should sit in order to start meditation. 'Having made the mind one-pointed': one-pointedness is most effectively brought about by allowing the mind to become drawn to more and more subtle states of the thought-process. 'With the activity of the. senses and thought subdued': all experience arises out of the association of the mind with the objects of experience through the senses. During meditation the mind begins to associate itself with the subtler realms of the sense;s and in this way goes on experiencing more and more subtle aspects of the object of experience until eventually, associating itself with the subtlest level of the senses, it perceives the subtlest state of the object and then, transcending it, becomes established in the state (4f Being. In this way the activities of the mind and senses are gradually subdued. In the state of absolute consciousness, the mind is free from all modes of the relative order and thus gains its most purified state. This is the state of Yoga. The Lord says: 'practice Yoga for self-purification'. Thereby He means that the practice of gaining this state is a means of gaining purification of body, mind and spirit. When the mind experiences subtle states of the object of meditation, it becomes very sharp and refined. At the same time the breath becomes correspondingly refined, and this soft fine breathing tends to return the nervous system to its normal functioning order; any abnormal functioning is restored to normality. When the mind gains transcendental consciousness, it reaches its most purified state. At the same time the whole nervous system gains a state of restful alertness. In this state the body becomes a living instrument tuned to the divine nature. This is the most purified state of the body. As for the purification of the spirit, or self, the pure state of the spirit is Being, which is unbounded universal pure consciousness. When, through the practice of meditation, the mind reaches this consciousness, the individual spirit bound by time, space and causation, finds its unbounded cosmic nature With practice, this state becomes permanent and the Self is experienced as completely separate from activity. This is the most purified state of the self, or the spirit. This is how the practice of Yoga that is, transcendental meditation, results in self-purification. It is interesting to notice that in verse ll Of Chapter V the effect of self-purification was attributed to action performed by a yogi. This teaching becomes significant through the practice of Yoga. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.13 Steady, keeping body, head and neck upright and still, having directed his gaze to the front of his nose, without looking in any direction, The art of being steady is described here. When the neck and head are upright, in line with the spine, the path of the breath is clear, inhalation and exhalation are smooth and unrestricted. This eliminates the possibility of any unnatural movement of the body. Having shown the method of stilling the body, the Lord explains how to still the senses. Sight is the most active of the senses, and if this is stilled the other senses will quite naturally follow it. The sense of sight, like all the senses, functions through the mind. Activity of the mind involves breath. So in order to co-ordinate the mind, the senses and the breath, the attention is brought 'to the front of his nose', the point where the breath and the normal line of vision meet. The effect of this is to establish co-ordination between the activities of the mind, the senses and the breath and to remove any abnormalities of these functions. It calms the mind and makes it one-pointed; it quietens the senses and refines the breath. 'Having directed his gaze' means directing it and releasing it, not continuing to gaze. 'Without looking in any direction' means first, not looking here and there; and secondly, not fixing one's look sharply even in the direction of the front of the nose; and thirdly, closing the eyes. The teaching given here is generally misunderstood in terms of concentration on the tip of the nose. Shankara says that if fixing the gaze on the tip of the nose were meant here, the mind would be left with the nose but without God. The posture described is free from any strain on the body, mind, senses or breath. This verse prepares the platform from which the mind plunges into Being. It gives a technique whereby one gathers the attention from the multiplicity of the outside world to a calm and quiet state, while yet remaining in the field of outside experience. From here the process of meditation leads the mind inwards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.14 With his being deep in peace, freed from fear, settled in the vow of chastity, with mind subdued and thought given over to Me, let him sit united realizing Me as the Transcendent. 'With his being deep in peace' means that the mind is set on the path of increasing charm, bringing greater contentment at every step and filling one's being with ever deeper silence and peace. This is a state where there is no disturbing element. It is not the state of deep sleep because there the sense of being is lost. It is a state where peace is profound and the sense of being is not lost It is a state of pure awareness. The mind has shifted from the field of sensory experience to the state of the Self, the state of profound peace. 'Freed from fear': on the path of increasing happiness during meditation there is no chance of fear. The Upanishads declare that fear comes with the sense of duality. Freed from fear means freed from the field of duality. The previous verse has seen the mind collected from the field of diversity; in this verse, it is gaining freedom from the sense of duality. The mind, during the inward stroke of meditation, begins to lose the sense of duality, begins to move away from the field of fear. Once begun, this process puts an end to duality and gives rise to transcendental consciousness, in which there is no possibility of fear. 'Settled in the vow of chastity': this does not mean that the practice here prescribed is only for those who have taken a vow of chastity. In the present context, the Lord is not dwelling on any gross aspect of the aspirant's way of life, on whether or not he may have taken any vow of chastity. Every expression in this verse gives deep insight into the state of the mind during the inward stroke of meditation, and it is in this sense that the words 'settled in the vow of chastity' should be understood. All the energies of a man who has taken a vow of chastity are ever directed upwards, the whole stream of body, mind and senses being channelled towards the higher levels of evolution, with no chance for his energy to flow downwards. Likewise, when the mind of the meditator goes deep within, this too has the effect of directing upwards the life-energy in the different spheres of his body, senses and mind towards the highest level of evolution, at the same time allowing no chance of a downward flow of any mental, sensory or bodily energy. Every aspect of his individuality converges upon universal consciousness in the transcendental field of Being. Because transcendental meditation brings with it a continuous rise of the mind towards the consciousness of eternal Being, it may be compared to the vow of chastity, by virtue of which the whole life-stream of a celibate ever rises towards this supreme consciousness. It is not, therefore, the act of taking a vow that is emphasized here; rather, it is the secure and safeguarded upward flow of one's energies on the road of the divine quest. This takes place during the process of transcendental meditation and also in the life of a celibate, one becomes 'urdhvaretas', meaning that one's energies flow only in an upward direction. 'With mind subdued': having-brought the mind under the influence of eternal Being. This happens in transcendental consciousness and therefore also in cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness. This is the central point of the present verse; all its other expressions follow from this one. The expression, 'with mind subdued', does not mean that the mind has to be controlled against its natural inclination and forced to go in the direction of the Transcendent. To discipline the mind by trying to control it is not the way to establish the mind in the Self. This verse gives a simple method for the realization of Truth and does not make it in any way complicated or difficult. 'Mind subdued' here signifies both the mind's natural state of calmness in transcendental consciousness and its natural tendency to flow freely in the single channel leading to transcendent bliss because it experiences greater charm at every inward step during meditation. The mind becomes subdued quite naturally, drawn to the Transcendent by increasing charm and not forced by will, pressure of discipline or control. 'Thought given over to Me' means thought surrendered to Me, who am the supreme Lord of all creation. 'Thought given over to Me' does not mean thinking of 'Me'. It means surrendering one's authorship of thoughts. This in turn does not mean that one stops thinking. It means entertaining thoughts in the state of non-attachment, where the Self remains unattached to the process of thinking, remains in Its eternal freedom, while all activity is naturally given over to God, who is the basis of the entire life of the cosmos. In the present context, however, 'thought given over to Me' is best seen as referring to the time of meditation. The Lord's words indicate that when thoughts appear one should not fight them, should not try to control the mind against them or try to run away from them; one should deal with them innocently. Let it be according to the will of God. Proceed on your meditation in a relaxed way and unconcerned with thoughts, as though you had already given them over to God. During meditation one should not make a mood of surrendering thoughts to God, one should treat them as though they had already been surrendered to Him and did not belong to one any more; one remains completely indifferent to them. 'Let him sit united': let him be in transcendental consciousness, or let his mind be firmly established in cosmic consciousness or in God-consciousness. The expression 'sit united' has no reference to activity or inactivity; it only means that in the states of transcendental consciousness and cosmic consciousness, the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind is so complete that the mind is totally fixed and embedded in it, and that in the state of God-consciousness, the mind is completely taken over by the Unity of life. In the states of cosmic consciousness and God-consciousness, this Union remains the same whether the mind is active or inactive. 'Realizing Me as the Transcendent': this expression makes clear the whole meaning of the present verse, for it brings to light the state of surrender Surrender has to be on the level of pure consciousness, on the level of life itself, on the level of Being, not on the level of thinking, feeling or understanding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.15 Ever thus collecting himself, the yogi of disciplined mind attains to peace, the supreme liberation that abides in Me. 'Ever thus collecting himself': this expression refers 'to the practice explained in the four preceding verses. When the yogi sits to meditate, he continues to collect his mind, that is, he leads it back to the 'subdued' state described in the previous verse. The Lord's use of the words 'collecting himself', rather than 'collecting the mind', is significant. 'Collecting himself' means collecting all aspects of his being: body, breath, senses, mind. This happens when the mind enters the realm of subtler experience on the way to gaining pure consciousness. All the senses begin to converge and collect themselves in the silent ocean of Being, the activity of the body's inner mechanism begins to sink into that silence, and the breath collects itself on that silent level of cosmic breath. All the different constituents of oneself begin to lie together on that level of pure Being. This comes about automatically and simultaneously for mind, senses, breath and body. The expression 'collecting himself' thus indicates the process of transcendental meditation, which results directly in the state referred to in the Lord's command: 'Be without the three gunas'. 'Ever' means that the yogi's only concern during meditation is to remain collected or engaged in the process of collecting himself. Either he remains collected in the state of pure Being mentioned in the previous verse, or if at any moment the whole structure of collectedness loosens, he has to collect himself again. He has always to be engaged in this manner. The significance of the word 'ever' is restricted to the time of meditation. It does not extend to the whole twenty-four hours of the yogi's day. 'The yogi of disciplined mind' : this expression placed immediately after 'collecting himself' gives insight into the technique of 'collecting'. How does a yogi collect himself when he loses the state of collectedness during meditation ? By the 'disciplined mind', by a mind which is orderly, smooth and harmonious in its functioning, so that its actions are easy and quiet. The mind is easy and naturally disciplined between 'collecting' and collectedness and again between the state of collectedness and 'collecting'. This means that when the mind goes off the path of meditation, the yogi quietly brings it back without any jerk, without causing strain. The practice, during meditation, of handling all situations in a delicate manner develops discipline in the mind, which then ceases to wander unreasonably and unnecessarily in the outer field of activity. 'Attains to peace': when, during meditation, the mind is collected, it enters into the experience of subtler states of thought. Experiencing increasing charm at every step, it becomes more and more contented, and this brings peace to the mind. 'The supreme liberation': having used the word 'peace', the Lord wants to make clear the nature of this peace in order to distinguish it from such peace as a man may gain through sleep, when the burden of thought has been lifted for a while, or through satisfaction in the various fields of life. He therefore adds that this peace is the supreme liberation. One who begins meditation in the right manner, under the guidance of a qualified ' person, certainly develops in himself the state of abiding peace and eternal liberation while leading an active life in the world. 'That abides in Me': the supreme liberation does not lie in any sovereign power, or power of nature, but in Me, the great Lord of all creation. By virtue of My Being, this mighty universe of huge and contrasting elements eternally and spontaneously exists, while I remain uninvolved. This is 'the supreme liberation that abides in Me', says the Lord, and this uninvolved state of mind is developed by the 'disciplined mind' as it grows in 'peace' and attains God-consciousness. It may be noted that this verse declares the result of practice to be peace and liberation, whereas verse 28 declares it to be infinite joy. Here no reference is made to this joy because, as verse 28 will show, it is the outcome of a life 'freed from blemish', and this comes about through the practice described in the present verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.16 Yoga, indeed, is not for him who eats too much nor for him who does not eat at all, O Arjuna; it is not for him who is too much given to sleep nor yet for him who keeps awake. 'Eats' and 'eat': these words indicate feeding the senses with their objects. The senses should not be provided with the objects of their enjoyment so excessively as to overfeed them, nor should they be completely deprived of their experience. 'Sleep' means a state where the senses of experience are not active, while 'awake' denotes the opposite state. It is implied here that if a man is 'too much given to sleep' or too much given to keeping awake, then he will find it difficult to rise above the states of waking and sleeping; and rising above them is absolutely essential for Yoga. It is a common axiom that anything in excess is bad. Even food, which is the source of energy, creates dullness and inefficiency when too much or too little of it is taken. Here the Lord cautions against excess in either direction. In both cases the mind becomes dull and fails to reach finer states of experience during meditation. Remaining in the field of gross experience, it tends to passivity. This is a waste of precious human existence, which is meant for the expansion of happiness and the realization of an integrated state of life, the state of supreme liberation referred to in the previous verse. The present verse advocates a normal and comfortable routine in daily life for success in the practice of Yoga. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.17 For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate of effort in actions, moderate in sleep and waking, for him is the Yoga which destroys sorrow. Here is the broad principle to be followed by one who wishes to live a life of inner peace and happiness integrated with successful activity in the outside world. The body should be given the rest it needs, and one should engage in activity, but not to a state of exhaustion. Recreation should be taken in due proportion, so that it is neither too little nor too much. The Lord means that life should flow in a regular way, with a proper measure of activity and with each thing given its just value. One should avoid excess in all things and be regular in meditation, for this will result in the state of inner peace and freedom from bondage described in the 15th verse. 'Yoga', Union, is not only a state where the mind is fixed in divine consciousness. It is at the same time a state of individual life where every aspect of being is in perfect harmony with divine life and with life in nature This state can only become permanent when the physical nervous system is sufficiently cultured to maintain it. The mind, as stated in the commentary to verse 15 is in tune with the cosmic mind, or intelligence of God, while the functioning of the body sets itself in tune with the functioning of cosmic nature. The senses rise to the full height of their capability, in order to experience and enjoy objects on the level of the divine play. But for body, organs and senses to function in their most natural way, in full accord with the laws of nature, it is absolutely essential that the routine of life be moderate, that everything connected with food and activity remain within the limits of moderation, that the happy medium be maintained. 'Moderate in sleep and waking': in its higher sense this expression indicates that one is only moderately involved in the states of sleeping and waking. This means that the waking state, the state of knowing and experiencing the objective world, is primarily maintained by the senses, while the mind is primarily held in Being. And in the sleeping state, the body and the senses are completely withdrawn from activity but the mind is not overtaken by sleep: although detached from all activity it is awake in its awareness. Thus one is 'moderate in sleep and waking' in the sense of not being wholly engrossed in them. 'Moderate in food': in order to be moderate in food it is necessary to keep the whole system functioning normally. With regular meditation morning and evening, the functioning of the inner mechanisms is maintained in a normal condition,' and one becomes by nature 'moderate in food and recreation'. 'Recreation' means re-creation of the normal functioning of the entire system so that it is capable of operating to its maximum capacity. When certain mechanisms of the body have been put to one specific type of activity, they become tired and a man loses efficiency in that activity. When he engages in another type of activity, other mechanisms become active and the tired ones take rest, thereby regaining their efficiency. This is said to be re-creation. Those forms of recreation which are based on a change of activity in the outer field of life do not re-create the whole system at one time and therefore do not renew efficiency to the maximum extent. Transcendental meditation re-creates, in that it produces a state of restful alertness for the entire system and rejuvenates it, thus fulfilling the purpose of recreation. 'Moderate of effort in actions' means that one has not to over-exert when working. This implies first, that one should be strong enough not to get tired, in other words, one should be energetic, alert and free from laziness; and secondly, that the undertaking should be in accordance with one's own dharma,t consistent with the laws of nature,o otherwise nature offers its silent protest against the effort, and one is compelled to make unduly great 'effort in actions'. The regular practice of transcendental meditation fulfils both these needs because it provides greater energy and produces harmony in nature. It should not be understood that being 'moderate of effort in actions' is a pre-requisite for Yoga. This quality grows as the practice advances. It is not something which can be achieved without transforming the very nature of the man and his surroundings. As the practice of meditation advances, it effortlessly transforms both his inner nature and the influence of his surroundings. This automatically makes him 'moderate of effort in actions'. Each condition given in this verse lays emphasis on moderation, which is most effectively brought about through the regular practice of transcendental meditation. Therefore transcendental meditation can be regarded.as the most effective form of recreation. 'Yoga which destroys sorrow': it has been said earlier that the transcendental state of consciousness is the state of Yoga. This is undoubtedly a state of bliss, but how does the bliss that lies in the transcendental state help to end sorrow and suffering in the relative field of life? By taking the transcendental bliss and bringing it back to the field of relative existence, bliss begins to dominate the sphere in which sorrows and suffering prevailed. The expression 'Yoga which destroys sorrow', makes it clear that the different points which this verse brings out regarding conduct form an essential part of the practice designed to transform transcendental pure consciousness into cosmic consciousness. The present verse explains the general mode of conduct which alone will allow the bliss experienced in meditation to be infused into the relative phase of existence Its entire purpose is to warn the aspirant against laying too much importance on any one aspect of relative life If only he takes things in their due proportion, every aspect of his life will remain without strain. It is this harmonious level of existence which provides the basis on which the divine Being can be lived in the world. This is further explained by the word 'united' in the following verse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.18 When his mind, completely settled, is established in the Self alone, when he is free from craving for any pleasure, then is he said to be united. This is a description of the state of mind reached through the practice described in the previous verses. 'His mind completely settled': this refers to transcendental consciousness, where the mind has become an unlimited and silent ocean of pure consciousness without a single wave of thought. It may also be said to refer to cosmic consciousness, where the calm of the ocean is not disturbed in spite of waves of thought and experience. It may be argued that it is the very nature of the mind to become completely settled in any object of experience, for was it not said in the 67th verse of Chapter II that a man's intellect is carried away by the senses 'as a ship by the wind on water'? This being the case, does not the mind, drawn by the force of the senses, become completely settled at the contact of the senses with their objects and enjoy the happiness to be derived therefrom In order to give no room for such arguments and to avoid misunderstanding, the Lord says: 'established in the Self alone'. This expression has its meaning on two levels: on the level of transcendental consciousness and on that of cosmic consciousness. On the transcendental level there is nothing but the Self alone. The nature of the Self is pure consciousness, cosmic intelligence, cosmic existence, cosmic life, eternal Being, absolute bliss. It is transcendent, ever the same, imperishable. It is 'smaller than the smallest'. It is the silence. The word 'Self' expresses the inexpressible transcendental Truth of life. The mind, coming to this field, loses its individuality and gains its true nature as pure Being. On the level of cosmic consciousness, the expression 'established in the Self alone' means that in the midst of all behavior, in the activity or the silence of the waking, dreaming and sleeping states, a man realizes the Self as completely separate from the field of activity and thus remains established in the Self alone. The varied experiences of life fail t6 overshadow this state of cosmic existence and complete fulfillment which the mind has gained. Having explained the steadfast and unshakeable character of the mind in the state of eternal contentment, the Lord turns to the practical value of such a state of mind; for a principle or a state of mind which has no practical use in daily life is of little importance in the world. The Lord has told Arjuna that the Yoga which He is expounding here was given to the first rulers of the world, thereby placing it on a very practical level. Moreover, throughout the discourse, at the end of any exposition of a highly spiritual and abstract nature, the Lord says something to tie it down to practical life. Here He says: 'free from craving for any pleasure'. 'Free from craving for any pleasure' means fulfilled. Craving for pleasure arises from lack of contentment, which may be due to the objects of the senses not being available, or to the inability of the senses to experience the joy that is available. But once a man is established in the state described in this verse, he is eternally contented, and this state of lasting contentment leaves no room for any craving for pleasures. This state of freedom 'from craving for any pleasure' is on the level of that complete fulfillment of life where the individual being is one with the cosmic Being. It is on the level of 'eternal freedom in divine consciousness'; on the level of 'maintaining your consciousness in the Self'; tt on the level of Union and knowledge.oo It fulfils the aspirations expressed by verse 55 of Chapter II and verse 78 of Chapter IV, and satisfies the level of attainment given in verse 8 of Chapter V. This state is on the level where the paths of Sankhya and Karma Yoga meet to find fulfillment in a common goal, as brought out by verse 5 of Chapter V. 'United': in verse 8, this word was used to denote evenness of vision; here, as in verse 141 it is given a much wider meaning. It is used in terms of the whole being, encompassing the entire field of the mind, its silence and its desires and activities, the whole field of life that lies between the two extremes of bondage and eternal freedom, between the individual man and the cosmic Divine. It denotes life in cosmic consciousness, which is inclusive of the relative and the Absolute. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.19 A lamp which does not flicker in a windless pIace, to such is compared the yogi of subdued thought practising Union with the Self. This verse may be compared with verse 69 of Chapter II, which says that in the night of all beings the self-controlled man is awake. But the simile in the present verse is more profound, for whereas the expression in the second chapter is in the context of the senses and their control, the lamp in the windless place represents 'thought', standing by itself, freed from the influence of the senses. This illustrates the reason for the difference between the discourses of enlightened men at different times. When such men come out to explain the Truth, their manner of expression and depth of thought depend upon the time and surrounding circumstances. Their discourse depends upon the purity of consciousness of those listening to it At this stage, Arjuna's consciousness has become pure enough to understand with exactness the state of 'the yogi of subdued thought practising Union with the Self'. It may be noted that any objective experience is due to the mind's association with the object through the senses. For example, if one is meditating on a thought, the experience of the gross and subtle states of that thought are due to the mind's association with the sense of speech. During meditation the object of experience continues to be perceived in its diminishing states, but when the subtlest state of experience has been transcended, then the mind is free from the influence both of the object and of the sense through which it has been experiencing. As long as the mind is influenced by the senses and their objects, so long is it like a lamp flickering in the wind, but once out of their influence it becomes steady, like 'a lamp which does not flicker in a windless place'. As long as the mind is associated with the object, so long is it the experiencing mind; but when the object of experience has diminished to the point where it has disappeared, the mind ceases to be the experiencing mind. Conscious mind becomes consciousness. But during this process of transformation, it first gains the pure state of its own individuality. It is interesting to see that the verse does not speak of the mind but of 'thought' as being steady. The Sanskrit word used is 'chitta', which signifies that aspect of mind which is a quiet and silent collection of impressions, or seeds of desires. Chitta is like water without ripples. It is called 'manas', or mind, when ripples arise. When the mind gains this state of chitta, or 'thought', then it stands steady, like 'a lamp which does not flicker in a windless place'. It holds its individuality in the void, the abstract fullness around it, because there is nothing for it to experience. It remains undisturbed, awake in itself. Imagine a silent wave on a silent ocean, ready to expand and merge into the silence of the deep. The state of the pure individuality of the mind, the pure individuality of the 'I', expressed by this verse, directly merges into transcendental Self-consciousness; this is expressed by the Lord as 'Union with the Self': the mind is united with divine Being. This state of Divine Union, or Yoga, is defined in its different aspects in the four following verses, after which six verses are devoted to the transformation of transcendental consciousness into cosmic consciousness. Then three verses bring to light the essence of the path from cosmic consciousness to God-consciousness, in which a yogi reaches the pinnacle of achievement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.20 That (state) in which thought, settled through the practice of Yoga, retires, in which, seeing the Self by the Self alone, he finds contentment in the Self; This verse describes a further step in the practice. The previous verses have taken the mind to the state where thought the resolute intellect, stands by itself, steady and unmoved. The present verse says that when, with continued practice, this steady intellect gains a clear experience of its individuality, it begins to retire The process of retiring begins with the expansion of individuality, and when this happens the intellect, losing its individuality, begins to gain universality, begins to gain the unbounded status of Being. While merging into Being, it cognizes Being as its own Self and gains bliss-consciousness, the yogi 'finds contentment in the Self'. The Self, as was said in the commentary on verse lS, i5 Of transcendental nature; until the mind transcends all experience, it does not realize the Self. In the process of transcending all experience, the mind retires from the experience of multiplicity and gains the experience of Unity in its own individual nature. Then, transcending its individual status, it expands into cosmic Being. This state of Being, the state of transcendental consciousness, is referred to by the words, 'seeing the Self by the Self alone'. The word 'alone' is significant, for it emphasizes that the transcendental Self Itself forms the content of Its Being and that nothing which is of relative existence can possibly cognize It. Its purity, eternal and supreme, is such that even the finest aspect of individual life, the resolute intellect, is foreign to It and is denied entry into It. The intellect has to surrender its existence in order to find its place in the eternal Being of the Self. This is the glory of the nature of the Self. Having come back home, the traveller finds peace. The intensity of happiness is beyond the superlative. The bliss of this state eliminates the possibility of any sorrow, great or small. Into the bright light of the sun no darkness can penetrate; no sorrow can enter bliss-consciousness, nor can bliss-consciousness know any gain greater than itself. This state of self-sufficiency leaves one steadfast in oneself, fulfilled in eternal contentment. The present verse forms the beginning of a long sentence that culminates in verse 27. Nowhere else in the Bhagavad-Gita do we find a sentence of this extended nature. This is because these four verses present Yoga, the state of Divine Union, in its complete glory. The present verse brings to light the state of Divine Union in transcendental consciousness. The following verse depicts it in cosmic consciousness, the third in terms of the supreme gain that is God-consciousness, and the fourth in terms of the elimination of suffering. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.21 Knowing that which is infinite joy and which, lying beyond the senses, is gained by the intellect, and wherein established, truly he does waver; In order to know why the senses cannot experience 'infinite joy', it is necessary to understand the origin of the senses and their objects. Creation begins with prakriti, or Nature, which expresses itself in the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas. As the process of creation continues, the three gunas manifest as 'mahat tattva', the principle of intellect. This further manifests as 'aham tattva', the principle of mind, which in its turn manifests as the five 'tanmatras', from which arise the five senses. Then, as the process of manifestation continues, the five tanmatras manifest into the five elements, which combine to constitute the entire objective creation. The range of sensory experience is limited to the field of creation resulting from these five elements. The senses only enable one to experience the joys of the objective world. The bliss of eternal life lies far beyond the senses and immediately beyond the intellect. It can be appreciated by the intellect but cannot be appreciated by the senses. The Lord says that infinite joy is of transcendental nature; it is known only when the subtlest aspect of relativity, the intellect, surrenders itself to the transcendental Self, as was explained in the previous verse. Once it is known, one is so captivated by it that one can never again be completely out of its influence. 'Gained by the intellect': although infinite joy comes with the surrender of the intellect, it is even then said to be 'gained by the intellect'. When the crown prince becomes king, the crown prince ceases to exist, but even then it can be said that the crown prince has 'gained' kingship. It is in this sense that the state of transcendental Self is 'gained by the intellect'. 'Does not waver': in the state of transcendental consciousness there is no possibility of activity, but continued practice of transcending the field of relativity cultures the mind so that it remains established in bliss, unwavering, even in the field of activity. This verse brings out the essential characteristic of Yoga in cosmic consciousness: 'infinite joy', 'lying beyond the senses', 'gained by the intellect', 'wherein established, truly he does not waver'. Details of this state are given in verses 24 to 29. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.22 Having gained which he counts no other gain as higher, established in which he is not moved even by great sorrow; This is the glory of the supreme state of Yoga , the supreme state of Divine Union in God-consciousness, the blessed oneness of life in which 'he counts no other gain as higher'. This is that state in which the separation of the Self from activity, as experienced in cosmic consciousness, finds its consummation in Unity of life, in the light of God, which knows no duality. Life becomes so at home with this state that 'he is not moved' by all the sorrows and sufferings that go on in the relative aspect of life. The glory of this discourse of the Lord is found in the words, 'established in which he is not moved even by great sorrow'. Even when the Lord here presents the supreme state of life, 'having gained which he counts no other gain as higher', He keeps it within the range of the human heart, which is exposed to sorrow. Indeed, he extends the very definition of this most blessed state of Divine Union, or Yoga, to the level of human suffering. This is to indicate how even those phases of life in most extreme contrast to Divinity are intimately embraced by this blessed state of Divine Union. The following verse develops this point. The details of the state of God-consciousness are dealt with in verses 30 to 32. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.23 Let that disunion of the union with sorrow be known by the name of Yoga (Union). This Yoga shouId be practiced with firm resolve and heart undismayed. This verse brings out the splrltual teaching of the Lord in terms of Union in 'disunion'. He shows that Yoga is universal; it is found even in the field of 'disunion' He says that even the disunion of the mind with sorrow is Union, and that this Union (Yoga) must be practiced with determination and firmness of mind. The Lord wants everyone to practice this: those who can practice it in the name of Union should do so; those who cannot should do so in the name of disunion. The word Union is for those who can conceive of absolute bliss and wish to possess it even to the extent of being it. The word disunion is for those who cannot conceive of this bliss, or cannot think themselves capable of aspiring to it. But these latter are certainly familiar in their lives with sorrow and will wish to come out of its reach. Let them therefore begin this practice in order to put an end to sorrow. The mind must be taken out of the realm of suffering, for there is no need to suffer in life when there is this centre of happiness within oneself. How one may continue to practice this Yoga which puts an end to all one's suffering is explained in the five verses that follow. Verses 20 to 23 have been devoted to the definition of Yoga The purpose of defining Yoga in four verses is to show that Yoga is sufficient to fulfill all the four aims of life prescribed by the Hindu scriptures. These declare the purpose of life to be the fulfillment of 1. dharma, 2. artha, 3. kama and 4. moksha. 1 Dharma is one's natural duty, which includes all moral goodness, right action, freedom, justice and lawfulness, all the principles that uphold and support life. All these are completely satisfied once a man has realized himself. For in the knowledge and experience of the Self, a man attains a level of life which is the basis of all morality, virtue and right action, and from which he is able to fulfill the laws of nature and do justice to all creation. Verse 20, describing the Unity of the mind and Being, shows all aspirations of dharma fulfilled. 2. Artha is fulfilled in verse 21. Artha means wealth, business, advantage, utility, reward and gain. With the experience of eternal bliss, all such aspirations are completely satisfied, for to store more and more means of happiness is the only purpose of artha in all its aspects. 3. Kama is desire. Desire naturally aims at happiness and the removal of suffering. All aspirations on this level are satisfied when man realizes the eternal bliss of the Self. When one seeks no more and desires no greater happiness, then one is fulfilled from the point of view of kama. Describing such fulfillment, verse 22 presents the summit of the realization of kama. It provides security even against great sorrow and offers supreme happiness. 4. Moksha is liberation. Verse 23 proclaims liberation from all pain and sorrow through Yoga, or Union with the Supreme, as described in verse 20. These verses, 20 t0 23, form the four pillars of the edifice of Yoga. They stand to remind men of every generation that it is not necessary to suffer in life, that life's goal is easy to attain and that all aspirations are easy to fulfill. The way is by the inward march of the mind, by quietly locating the hidden universal Being, a ray of whose eternal light is sufficient to dispel all the darkness of ignorance and shower down the blessings of almighty God. These verses, in giving the definition of Yoga, provide a royal road to fulfillment at every level of human life. Fortunate are those who take this highway, who practice transcendental meditation. It must be made quite clear at this point that the purpose of Yoga does not end in realizing the Self in the transcendental state (verse zo). Although this is the final attainment of the inward stroke of meditation and although it gives a full meaning to Yoga in that it brings complete Union with divine consciousness, it is not complete. The overall purpose of Yoga is not yet satisfied. Unless the divine consciousness, gained in the transcendental state, continues to maintain itself at all times, in a natural manner, irrespective of the different states of waking, dreaming or sleeping, and irrespective of the mind's engagement in activity or in silence, the purpose of Yoga is not fulfilled. Yoga, or Divine Union, attained in the state of Self-consciousness, or Atmananda, has to develop into cosmic consciousness, or Brahmananda, which again is a state of Yoga. This eventually gives rise to God-consciousness, the pinnacle of Yoga, where there is no trace of sorrow or suffering. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.24 Abandoning without reserve all desires from which the incentive (to action) is born, controlling the village of the senses on every side by the mind alone. Having thus far defined three states of Yoga, the Lord, in this and the following four verses, describes how the state of Yoga in transcendental consciousness is transformed into the state of Yoga in cosmic consciousness. Such is the marvel of the Lord's expression that in each of these five verses in sequence He is able to develop not only the theme of gaining transcendental consciousness, but side by side with this a second theme: that of the development of cosmic consciousness when transcendental consciousness has already been gained. The parallel presentation of these two themes is a teaching in itself. It shows first that the path to cosmic consciousness comprehends the path to transcendental consciousness, and secondly that cosmic consciousness develops simultaneously with the growth of transcendental consciousness in the mind. 'The incentive (to action)': the stimulus that a desire produces in the nervous system, bringing into action the senses of perception and the organs of action. This stimulus is opposed to the process of gaining that state of restful alertness of the nervous system which corresponds with transcendental consciousness. That is why, when the Lord is explaining the whole process of making transcendental consciousness permanent, He emphasizes the need for preventing the opposing process from interfering. It should be borne in mind, however, that even though the Lord gives this caution, He is not advocating a practice of controlling desire. He states as a principle that desires are not helpfull on the path because they stimulate the nervous system to external activity and this is opposed to its internal activity, which gives experience of subtle states of thought as the mind proceeds towards the state of transcendental consciousness. When the Lord says: 'Abandoning without reserve all desires from which the incentive (to action) is born, controlling the village of the senses on every side by the mind alone', He means engage the mind in the process of transcendental meditation and let it enter into the experience of subtle fields of thinking. Having become familiar with bliss-consciousness in the field of the Transcendent, the mind is very naturally and automatically drawn in that direction if allowed to proceed without distraction. The Lord says: 'by the mind .alone', meaning that one does not use any austerity or forcible control to close the gates of the senses. The senses will automatically set themselves quietly to follow the mind as it proceeds to the Transcendent. In the quiet inward stroke of the mind during meditation, desires are automatically abandoned. Here the Lord is only saying that one should let the mind follow its familiar path to the Transcendent in the most natural and normal manner. 'The village of the senses': the place where the senses are housed. This is the structure of the nervous system. The whole nervous system is the village, the individual senses are the villagers and the mind the landlord. Thus, when the Lord says: 'controlling the village of the senses on every side by the mind alone', the principle He wants to bring out is this: control the landlord to influence the villagers, in order to re-orientate the village so that all its activity, the activity of the nervous system, proceeds in accordance with the laws of nature, while the awareness of the Self maintains its natural state in eternal Being. This places the whole of life in its most natural state: absolute Being and the relative field of activity remain separate and yet integrated in the individual life in the state of cosmic consciousness. The practice is entirely mental, but it directly influences the whole nervous system, through which the senses function. It should be noted that who the Lord begins the teaching about gaining cosmic consciousness, He speaks of the nervous system, the physical aspect of life, and emphasizes the need for its re-orientation. But the human nervous system is of such extreme complexity and refinement that it is not possible to re-orientate it through a physical approach. This difficulty is solved by the emphasis that the Lord places on the words, 'the mind alone'. Thereby He warns the aspirant against making any attempt to control the senses directly, or to influence the nervous system by any physical means. The re-orientation of the nervous system is essential in order to make permanent the state of transcendental consciousness, but it must be brought about by a mental process. If the aspirant tries to control the senses on their own level, or if he attempts to control them by a mental process which goes against their natural tendencies, the result will be strain. The practice taught in this verse is absolutely free from any possibility of strain. 'Controlling the village of the senses on every side': this expression indicates the technique of controlling all the senses at one and the same time, without offering them any resistance individually on the level of the senses themselves, and without attacking their natural tendency to lead the mind towards their objects. This aspect of the teaching is of the utmost value. When the senses are turned inwards during the inward stroke of meditation, and outwards during the outward stroke of meditation, then they are becoming re-orientated in a most natural way so that their every activity is spontaneously in accordance with the laws of nature. This process of re-orientation will be strained if the senses are restricted. Only if a situation is created in which the senses have a free inward and outward activity motivated by their own nature to enjoy, is it possible for man to realize that the greater intensity of happiness lies in the inward direction. And with this realization, the habit of remaining under the influence of the bliss of Being is built up, to give rise to cosmic consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.25 Let him gradually retire through the intellect: possessed of patience; having established the mind in the Self, let him not think at all. This verse clarifies the words 'retires' (verse 20) and 'abandoning' (verse 24). It emphasizes that the process of retiring should be gradual and adds 'possessed of patience' to make quite clear that nothing should be done to hasten or modify this process. Once begun, it should be allowed to proceed by itself. The points about patience and gradualness are highly important. If a man becomes impatient and tries to push the mind into the Transcendent, then many disadvantages arise. The intensity of thought is very great at that subtle level of thinking where the mind is slipping out of thought and is about to lose the experience of the relative field. If the process is not disturbed and is allowed to go by itself in a very innocent manner, then the mind slips into the Self. If, on the other hand, pressure or force is applied in any way to check the mind or to control the process, the mind will be thrown off the course on which it is naturally set and off balance into agitation and a feeling of discomfort. That is why the process has to be allowed to take place quietly and patiently, without any anxiety or hurry. One must not exert oneself in order to transcend. Exertion of any kind only retards the process of transcending. The mind naturally proceeds towards the Self because in that direction it is attracted by ever-increasing happiness. So the Lord says it should be allowed to come in that direction naturally and innocently. 'Intellect possessed of patience' has an inner meaning, apart from the obvious one of advocating patience on the part of the intellect. It is that the intellect should not function during the process. What is happening should not be watched and analysed or scrutinized by the intellect. No critical scrutiny of the process is needed. The intellect only needs to be receptive and appreciative and not in any way discriminative or on its guard. It has only to accept experience as it comes. 'Let him gradually retire': so that the mind, as it fathoms the deeper levels of the thought-process, may simultaneously become refined in order to experience further subtler states and may proceed onward in an innocent manner. If a man standing in bright light suddenly rushes into a dark cave, his eyes may not be able to see what is there inside the cave; but if he enters slowly, his eyes become used to the lesser intensity of light, and then he is able to see. The mind, when it retires deep within, goes from the more gross to the subtler levels of experience. Therefore it is essential for the mind not to rush in suddenly but to go gradually and patiently. Again, when the individuality of the intellect begins to gain the state of Being, it is absolutely necessary that the process be slow. Only then will the bliss be within the range of experience. 'Let him not think at all': the Lord says that when the mind is established in the Self one should not try to think, because the transcendental state of consciousness lies beyond the mind's ability to think. Any attempt to think in that state will not succeed. This is the state where one just enjoys being there. It is not on a level where thought can find a place. The Lord informs the aspirant of its nature so that he may not expect some good thoughts to come in that state. The Lord says: Do not think at all. This state of not thinking is a natural consequence of the mind's being established in the Self; and it holds good only during meditation. It does not mean that a man should not think of anything when he is out of meditation, for a habit of not thinking will make his life dull and useless. The mind, coming out of the Self, out of the state of transcendence during meditation, alights on a thought, what is then to be done is explained in the following verse. 'Let him gradually retire through the intellect possessed of patience': this expression also presents a teaching which is important on the way to cosmic consciousness when transcendental consciousness has already been gained. When, through the practice of transcendental meditation, the mind gains familiarity with the state of Being, one begins to feel as if uninvolved while engaged in activity. This experience of non-attachment grows in intensity with practice. This is what the Lord means by 'gradually retire', in the context of gaining cosmic consciousness. He adds that during this process the intellect should be 'possessed of patience' so that it may not hurriedly and wrongly interpret the experience. It should be noted that when this sense of non-attachment is appreciated by the intellect, activity becomes much more effective and fruitful in the outer world. In the absence of a proper interpretation of this expression of non-attachment, one might become bewildered, and this great blessing of life might become a liability. 'Having established the mind in the Self, let him not think at all': when the mind has permanently gained transcendental Self-consciousness, then it is no longer required to embark upon any mental activity, the necessity of which was implied by the previous verse. When the mind is permanently established in the Self, the purpose of the teaching of the previous verse has been accomplished: cosmic consciousness has been gained. The expression, 'let him not think at all', brings out the essential features of cosmic consciousness. First, this state of life is not maintained on the basis of thinking or feeling: it is lived naturally on the level of Being. Secondly, the Self in this state has separated Itself so completely from the field of activity that, even when the mind entertains thoughts, the Self remains completely free from the process of thinking. This is that state of life referred to in verse 7: 'for the man who has ascended to Yoga, and for him alone, calmness is said to be the means'. The previous verse described the value of mental activity during the inward stroke of meditation. The following verse shows how to direct mental activity when the mind comes out of the transcendental state of consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.26 Whatever makes the fickle and unsteady mind wander forth, from that withdrawn, let him bring it under the sway of the Self aIone. 'Withdrawn': the word in the text is 'niyamya', which means having regulated or disciplined. Here it means having turned back to the Self. This is the art of successful meditation. It is natural that when the mind has taken a dive into the Self and comes out to the relative field again, it should be brought back to the medium of meditation in order to begin a second dive In the early stages of meditation, however, it is generally found that with the outward stroke of meditation the mind comes on to some thought. The Lord therefore says that the mind should be brought back from a foreign thought to the medium of meditation, so that if comes once more to the established channel and, experiencing the finer states of the medium in a natural way, comes again to the Transcendent. The Lord says: Turn the mind towards the Self This in no way suggests difficulty. Unfortunately for the student of the Bhagavad-Gita, commentators have stated that the mind needs to be controlled and disciplined, which implies that the whole approach is strenuous and difficult. There is, however, no idea of control or discipline of the mind in the Lord's teaching. True, He has used two adjectives to qualify 'mind': 'fickle' and 'unsteady'. But we have to remember that the Lord is here describing the process of leading the mind to the Self, whereas these adjectives apply to the mind when it is subjected to the outward stroke of meditation. It is quite right for the mind to enter a wavering state when it comes out of the field of transcendental Unity, like waves beginning to appear on the still surface of the ocean. So when at times the mind is found on a foreign thought during meditation, this should be regarded, if the process of meditation is a right one, as the outward stroke of meditation. It should not be taken as evidence that the mind is by nature 'fickle' and 'unsteady', though commentators have supposed it to be so. If one notices that the mind is going out into thoughts even when it has not reached the transcendental Being but is only on the way to It during the inward stroke of meditation, this again should not be ascribed to the innate weakness of the mind. It may be due to the nervous system being under strain, or it may be due to lack of proper guidance. It can be the result of inefficiency either on the part of the teacher or of the pupil, but usually the ir,adequacy is found to be on the path of the teacher. The Lord, then, teaches that if it happens that the mind is distracted by something external, one should quietly bring it back to the channel which leads to the Self. It is the nature of the mind to go to a field of greater happiness. When, during meditation, the mind begins to experience the finer states of the object of attention, it begins to experience increasing charm at every step. There is then no chance for it to go anywhere except in the direction which leads to the Transcendent. This is true of the system of transcendental meditation, which is the main concern of these verses. The significance of this verse in relation to cosmic consciousness lies in its emphasis on the necessity of alternating the inward and outward march of the mind. This is to allow the infusion of Being into the nature of the mind so that all its activity may become supported and enriched by divine value, and so that finally the whole of life may become divine in cosmic consciousness. The following verse brings to light the nature of cosmic consciousness in terms of supreme happiness and summarizes the essential features of the way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.27 For supreme happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is deep in peace, in whom the spur to activity is stilled, who is without blemish and has become one with Brahman. The Lord made a similar statement about supreme happiness in the 21st verse; but from the 24th verse He has been intent upon describing the method by which supreme happiness is to be attained. During meditation the mind, as it experiences the finer aspects of the object of meditation, eventually transcends even the subtlest experience, and then there is no activity. This is what the Lord means when He says that the 'spur to activity' (rajas) 'is stilled'. This is the field of the Transcendent, the state of pure consciousness, stainless, sinless. Here the individual mind ceases to be; it gains the status of divine intelligence. Having gone beyond the limits of an individual mind's wanting and desiring, it is fully established in deep peace and attains supreme happiness. The faculty of experience becomes extinct when the mind loses its individuality. The state of Being knows no knowing; it is a state that transcends all knowing or experiencing. But if this is so, how can it be said that the mind experiences supreme happiness? First, it should be noted that the Lord uses the word 'upniti', which means 'comes to'; the word 'experiences' is not used. However, even if the word 'experiences' were used, it could be regarded as valid. The mind does have the ability to experience When it is on the verge of transcending, at the junction of relativity and the Absolute It is at this point that the mind experiences the nature of absolute bliss-consciousness. This has been brought out in the Upanishads, where it is stated specifically that Reality is experienced by the mind alone. Experience of Reality by the mind is always at the junction-point: while it is about to transcend at the end of the inward stroke of meditation, and while coming out of transcendence at the start of the outward stroke of meditation. 'Deep in peace': see verses 7, 14 and 15 of this chapter and verses 70 and 71 of Chapter II. The Lord. means peace that is not overshadowed even by activity, the eternal peace that is gained when one 'sees inaction in action' (IV, 18); 'the supreme peace' (IV, 39); 'lasting peace' (V, 12). The nature of the 'spur to activity' (rajas) was explained in the commentary on verse 45 of Chapter II 'Who is without blemish': who is established in the absolute purity of Being, completely separate from the field of activity. His actions being completely in accordance with the laws of nature,' they are free from blemish. 'Has become one with Brahman': has gained cosmic consciousness. It is interesting to see how this one verse describes both the state of cosmic consciousness itself and the path by which it is reached. It makes clear that supreme happiness is gained in cosmic consciousness and that there are three pre-requisites to gaining it: the mind must be 'deep in peace', 'the spur to activity' must be 'stilled' and one must be 'without blemish'. The teachings of the three previous verses, which have defined in detail the nature of the path to cosmic consciousness, are represented by individual phrases in this verse. 'Mind is deep in peace' refers to verse 24; 'in whom the spur to activity is stilled' refers to verse 25; 'who is without blemish' refers to verse 26. The flower of divine wisdom of this verse comes to full bloom in the following five verses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.28 Ever thus collecting himself, the yogi, freed from blemish, with ease attains contact with Brahman, which is infinite joy. Here the Lord brings out quite clearly that realization of cosmic consciousness is not at all difficult. It is easily attained. 'Ever thus collecting himself' gives expression to the points brought out in the previous four verses. 'Ever' here does not slgnify continuity of time It means regularly, as part of the daily routine. It is directly connected with 'thus', which indicates that whenever the yogi collects himself he should do so in this particular manner. 'Freed from blemish': for any experience there must be a corresponding state of the nervous system. The most normal state of the human nervous system is thaf which can support 'contact with Brahman', the omnipresent Reality. It must necessarily be a state of extreme refinement and flexibility, and this is possible only when the nervous system is entirely pure. Such purity demands that the functioning of the nervous system should be in no way contradictory to the laws of nature. The influence that it produces should support all life, fulfilling the cosmic purpose. It is interesting to note that the first half of verse 15 has the same text as the present verse, except that the yogi is 'of disciplined mind', whereas here he is 'freed from blemish'. This important difference brings correspondingly different results: in the earlier instance the outcome is 'peace' and 'liberation'; in the present it is 'infinite joy'. It is clear from this comparison that if the nervous system is not freed from blemish, even though it may give the experience of peace and freedom it cannot give rise to infinite joy. The repeated practice of 'collecting' oneself and arriving at transcendental consciousness continues to refine the nervous system until it becomes so pure that it is capable of giving rise to a state of consciousness described as 'contact with Brahman . 'With ease attains': because the practice is easy and the way of life that is prescribed is also easy and comfortable. The practice is easy because it represents the movement of the mind in a direction which it follows quite automatically, that is, towards bliss. This teaching of a way that is easy both recalls and supplements the teaching in verse 40 of Chapter II, where the Lord declared this method to be free from any resistance. It has been made clear that the practice of transcendental meditation, by leading the mind to transcendental consciousness, also brings purity to all aspects of life and sets it in tune with nature. One practice accomplishes all this. The practice itself is in accordance with the very nature of the mind, and this is what makes 'contact with Brahman' easy. 'Contact with Brahman': it was stated in the commentary on verse 20 that in the transcendental state of consciousness the mind becomes Being. When Being is retained in a natural manner even while the mind is out in the relative field, then 'contact with Brahman' is realized. Such contact means harmony between the absolute and the relative states of consciousness. With the practice described ill the previous verses, and with an easy manner of life, this highly developed state of consciousness, says the Lord, is attained 'with ease' The result is 'infinite joy'. It should be noted that it is the 'contact' that is infinite joy, and not Brahman Itself. Brahman, which is an all-pervading mass of bliss, does not exhibit any quality of bliss. It may be likened to a mass of energy, matter, which does not exhibit any quality of energy. This verse emphasizes the glory of 'contact'; it does not set forth the nature of Brahman. Brahman is that which cannot be expressed in words, even though the Upanishads use words to educate us about Its nature In the field of speech, Brahman lies between two contrary statements, It is absolute and relative at 'the same time. It is the eternal imperishable even while It is ever-changing. it is said to be both this and That. It is spoken of as Sat-Chit-Ananda but includes what is not Sat, what is not Chit and what is not Ananda. It is beyond speech and thought, yet the whole range of thought and speech lie within It. 'Within It' and 'without It' are just expressions, and like any other expressions about Brahman they do justice neither to Brahman nor to the speaker nor 'to the listener. Brahman is lived by man with ease but cannot be spoken of, in the sense that words are inadequate to encompass That which is the unlimited fullness of transcendental Being and the fullness of active life at the same time. Verse 29 of Chapter II speaks of It as a 'wonder', for it is not anything that can be conceived of intellectually; it is not anything that can be appreciated by emotion. This verse and its expression 'with ease' give added meaning to earlier verses about Brahman: 'This is the state of Brahman, O Partha. Having attained it, a man is not deluded. Established in that, even at the last moment, he attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness'; 'his self ioined in Union with Brahman, he enjoys eternal happiness'; 'being one with Brahman attains eternal freedom'. Brahman is the value of our life, and the truth about It is that It is lived 'with ease'. The glory of this verse is also the glory of the Bhagavad-Gita. The eternal glory of the goal of human endeavor is that one 'with ease attains contact with Brahman, which is infinite joy'. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.29 He whose self is established in Yoga, whose vision everywhere is even, sees the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self. This verse portrays the state of Brahman and at the same time gives a practical meaning to the 'contact' of which the previous verse speaks. The nature of Brahman is expressed in two phrases placed together: 'Self in all beings' and 'all beings in the Self', the Absolute and the relative, one within the other This makes Brahman seem incomprehensible. Even taken separately, the relative and the Absolute, the diversity of creation and the Unity underlying it, are each too much for the mind to grasp; how much more so when they are found integrated in Brahman! It is the glory of the Lord's discourse that we are enabled to comprehend the incomprehensible so clearly and are shown how to live it 'with ease'. The quality of experience depends upon the state of one's consciousness. If the mind is cheerful, everything is found to be cheerful; if the mind is sad and miserable, one's outlook is gloomy. When the state of Being becomes infused into the nature of the mind during meditation, then this infusion makes the mind divine And when this infusion becomes permanent, the mind begins to live Unity throughout the whole field of diversity. The whole field of diversity is then appreciated in the light of the inner divine Unity. When the mind becomes filled with divine Being, the vision is naturally full and even. It is steady and undistorted by the diversity of life in the world. This is the vision of a man who has gained 'contact' with Brahman. It must not be lost to sight thaf evenness of vision is the result of 'contact with Brahman'. It should not be regarded as a path to realization of Brahman. If an unrealized man tries to cultivate evenness of vision in life, he will only create confusion for himself and for others. Such attempts result in strange moods and stranger behavior. And responsibility for this lies with those commentators who have deduced from this verse the value of mood-making in the name of understanding the Reality and living It. The glory of this verse is beyond description. Most lucidly, it expresses the inexpressible Brahman and at the same time lays It open to the level of human vision. It is this that has made the Bhagavad-Gita the 'milk' of the Upanishads. The following three verses take this blessed vision to its consummation in God-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.30 He who sees Me everywhere, and sees everything in Me, I am not lost to him nor is he lost to Me. When a man has gained the oneness of vision described in the previous verse, when the fullness of Being overflows through the mind into the fields of perception, when splrltual Unity prevails even on the level of the senses, when the oneness of God overtakes life, then is that state attained where perception of anything whatsoever is perception of the Being made manifest. Then his consciousness finds a direct relationship with the Lord, with Being made manifest, who becomes a living Reality for him on that supremely divine level of consciousness. Then he and his Lord are not lost to one another. This direct relationship of man with God is first established on the level of Being and then comes to be on the level of feeling; from there it enters the field of thinking and then finds its way on to the sensory level of experience. God thus overtakes all the levels of man's life. Man lives in the sanctuary of God. His life is in love, in bliss, in wisdom, in God-consciousness. He lives in the realm of universal existence. He moves on earth and he lives in the land of God, in the divine ground of Being far above human vision and far beyond human thought. The way to cultivate this blessed state is to transcend thought. Continuing to think about it has its own value, it fills the mind with a pleasant thought but fails to create the desired state. Transcending thought is infinitely more valuable than thinking. Therefore let the mind transcend thought and enter that realm of absolute purity which is the abode of God. Thinking about it is wasting time on the surface of life A thought keeps the mind away from that blessed realm. A thought of bread neither gives the taste of bread nor fills the stomach. If you want bread, go to the kitchen and get it instead of sitting outside thinking about it We remain thinking of God, or trying to feel Him, only so long as we lack knowledge of Him, so long as we do not know how to break through the phenomenal field of experience and enter the realm of transcendental bliss, the pure kingdom of the Almighty. The records that history has brought us of the direct communion of saints and sages with God reveal their blessed lives, but the secret of the success of such lives lay in their transcending the fields of thought, emotion and experience. The secret of God-realization lies in transcending the thought of God. Thought that remains thought obscures God-consciousness. Emotions likewise hide the blessed bliss. The thought of God finds fulfillment in its own extinction. And emotion too has to cease in order to let the heart be full in the unbounded love of God. The state of consciousness that knows the glory of the great Lord of all beings is divine. It is developed through constant and regular practice of meditation and the experience of transcendental Being, which eventually brings cosmic consciousness, the state in which the heart and mind are fully matured. This full development of the capacities of heart and mind enables a man to understand and live the divine Being. The relationship that exists between the unmanifested Absolute and the manifested Being unfolds itself. The personal God comes to be experienced on the sensory level. He becomes the living Reality of daily life. Every object in creation reflects the light of God in terms of one's own Self. Philosophers call this a mystical experience, but it is no more mysterious than is the working of a clock for a child On one level of consciousness it is normal, on another it is mysterious, and again on another it is impossible. The intensity of God-realization in its personal and its impersonal aspects depends upon the level of Being, or the purity of consciousness (verse 28). It is not possible to conceive of God-consciousness through any state of consciousness that is not God-consciousness itself; but it is possible for everyone, at any level of human consciousness, to rise to the realization of God-consciousness through the practice of transcendental meditation, which is a simple and direct way of developing pure consciousness. The overpowering sweetness of the Lord's assurance in this verse gives expression to the glory of life. It has been, it is and it will continue to be the source of inspiration and the guiding light to many an ardent seeker of Truth, to many an ardent devotee of God. It is given to such men to enjoy the love of the Almighty and the protection that He offers. This is their good fortune; they share their life with God. The oneness that they live from moment to moment is the Union of the oneness of the Absolute, the oneness of eternal life in the multiplicity of creation, the great oneness symbolized in the Divine made manifest, the almighty personal God. The Lord's assurance in this verse is restated in the following verses with even deeper truth and greater glory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.31 Established in Unity, he who worships Me abiding in all beings, in whatever way he lives, that yogi lives in Me. To live through the various phases of man's life on earth while abiding in the worship of God is the character of a particular level of consciousness. in order to make clear that its basis is not thought about God, the Lord says: 'in whatever way he lives'. This is that fullness of life in God which knows no variation, however the mind or senses may be engaged, whatever the different modes of activity. When a man looks at things through green spectacles, no matter what he sees the green is there. For a devotee, no matter what he is doing God is there in his consciousness; He is there in his vision and in his being. The word 'worships' is of great significance. It expresses devotion, dedication, dependence and surrender. From the ordinary level of consciousness this is hard to understand, and to explain the nature of God-consciousness is still harder. But some idea may be gained by making clear the difference between levels of consciousness. A child takes delight in toys; his consciousness grows and books take their place; as he develops farther his career in the world begins to interest him. As his consciousness grows, so does he rise to different levels of interest and understanding. Similarly, when a man's consciousness has grown to cosmic status, the supreme level of creation becomes his normal field of interest. God, the manifested Being on the supreme level of creation, begins to draw him to Himself; he begins to rise to God-consciousness. Remaining in the world of his fellow men, he begins to live in the world of God. And when he is permanently established in this blessed state, he is included within this loving expression of the Lord's: 'in whatever way he lives, that yogi lives in Me'. In order to make clear the nature of worship, the Lord adds to the words 'worships Me' the phrase 'abiding in all beings'. The sense of worship holds the devotee to his God; it expresses a personal relationship. That is impersonal and universal from the point of view of ordinary human consciousness becomes intimate and personal in this state of consciousness; for it is at the level of harmony between the unmanifested Absolute and the manifested Being, the Lord of all creation. It would be wrong to understand from the Lord's words here that the yogi tries to see the personal God in all things. This would not only be impractical but would result in strain, to say the least The divine Being is worshipped through the most natural way of living, based on God-consciousness. Trying to see one's God here, there and everywhere is an act of the imagination which is far from the truth of this verse, and farther still from the practicalities of life. When the individual consciousness has developed into cosmic consciousness, then this state of fullness of divine consciousness develops into God-consciousness. It is in this established state of God-consciousness that the Lord is worshipped 'abiding in all beings'. Every thought is then a flower at the feet of God, every word a prayer and every action an offering to Him. The scriptures sing the glory of God in the glory of such a devotee, of whom the Lord says he 'lives in Me'. Having shown that the realized man attains His level of existence, the Lord, in the following verse, establishes the evenness of such a man's vision in life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.32 He who sees everything with an even vision by comparison with the Self, be it pleasure or pain, he is deemed the highest yogi, O Arjuna. This verse brings out the practical value of God-consciousness and extends the dignity of this enlightenment to everything around the realized man. Verse 29 expressed the state of realization in terms of impersonal Being; verse 30 expressed it in terms of the personal. Verse 31 brought the personal God into intimate contact with the realized man and kept alive the bond of devotion in order to maintain that blessed state of Union with Him. The present verse dissolves the bond of devotion, for this can no longer exist when intimacy becomes complete. While devotion served as a link to maintain Union, this remained in some degree on the level of formality. The formality of worship is a pleasure which overtakes the devotee's heart and his whole being, which gives meaning to his life and glorifies it on all levels; but the joy of such devotion is the joy of Union at a distance. As the Union grows more complete, the link of worship, of adoration and devotion, finds fulfillment in its own extinction, leaving worshipper and worshipped together in perfect oneness, in the oneness of absolute Unity. Then he and his God are one in himself. Then himself has become Himself; his vision is in terms of Himself, his pleasure and pain are in terms of Himself. 'By comparison with the Self': in terms of his own Self. In the state described in the previous verse, the Unity of the devotee with God has reached such fullness that his life is the life of God. Everywhere and in everything he lives Cod. He sees everything in terms of God. This exalted state of Union with God becomes yet more glorious in the present verse, where the Lord says: 'with an even vision by comparison with the Self' Here the difference between the devotee and God, which was alive in the state described by the previous verse, is found no more. His Union with God, which was of an order that still permitted worship of Him, has become a Union of much greater intensity. Now his God is one with himself; the supreme divine Unity prevails in him. In his individuality, the eternal glory of the Divine shines brightly and in such fullness that It exists not only on the level of his Being but is infused into his feeling, his thinking, his vision, his whole field of experience. His vision, which before was colored by his devotion to the Lord, now stands clear in terms of his own Self, permeated by his own eternal Being; in that Being the glory of God resides, sustaining It and maintaining the eternal freedom that His beloved devotee has gained in Him. In that perfect liberation he leads the life of fullness and abundance His vision is such that it quite naturally holds alike all things in the likeness of his own Self, because he himself and the vision that he has are the expression of the Self. The Lord uses the words 'pleasure or pain' to show that the pairs of opposites, and indeed the whole diversity of creation which his individuality offers him, fail to present their differences to the yogi's vision. His is a vision of life in totality. The pairs of opposites, such as pleasure and pain, which present great contrasts on the lower levels of evolution, fail to divide the evenness of his vision. To make such a vision more comprehensible to the ordinary level of consciousness, it may be compared to a father's even vision towards a variety of toys which, to the vision of his child's undeveloped consciousness, will present great differences. This verse shows the height of realization, which is to realize the supreme oneness of life in terms of one's own Self No diversity of life is able to detract from this state of supreme Unity. One who has reached It is the supporter of all and everything, for he is life eternal. He bridges the gulf between the relative and the Absolute. The eternal Absolute is in him at the level of the perishable phenomenal world. He lives to give meaning to the paean of the Upanishads: 'purnamadah purnamidam' That Absolute is full, this relative is full. One who lives this supreme Reality in his daily life 'is deemed the highest yogi', says the Lord. Yoga in this state has reached its perfection, there is no level of Union higher than this that he has gained. He stands established on the ultimate level of consciousness. It may be of interest to those who like to dwell on the metaphysics of Union with God that two states of Union have been clearly portrayed in the present context. That described in this verse is only a more advanced state of Union than that of the preceding verse. The Union where the devotee still holds to the supremacy of his God passes very naturally into a much more intimate Union with Him. The principle of Union is not affected. This is not a matter which can be decided by metaphysical speculation or theological understanding. Unless one's consciousness is actually raised to that level of God-consciousness, any description or understanding of the difference between the two states of Union will always fall far short of truth for, as has already been said, the truth about a more advanced state of consciousness cannot be rightly evaluated from a lower level. Fortunate are they who live life in Union with God. They are man's guides on earth, furthering the evolution of all creation. They are above the limitations of religion or race. Whether they play with God or hold Him as one with their own Being is a point to be settled between them and God. They live as devotees of God or they become united, become one with their Beloved, it is a matter between them. Let it be decided on that level of Union. One view need not exclude the other It is a sin against God to raise differences over the principle of Union. Let the followers of both schools of thought aspire to achieve their respective goals and then find in that consciousness that the other standpoint is also right at its own level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.33 Arjuna said: This Yoga described by Thee as characterized by evenness, O Madhusudnna, I do not see its steady endurance, because of wavering. Arjuna has understood the Lord's teaching concerning the cultivation of God-consciousness. Now he brings up a point which arises out of the Lord's exhortation in verse 26 about 'the fickle and unsteady mind' The question is that if the mind is indeed 'fickle and unsteady', as the Lord Himself has said, then how is it possible to maintain 'an even vision' in the oneness of God-consciousness? Arjuna's question does not imply any doubt about the possibility of cultivating God-consciousness, even with a wavering mind. What he doubts is its steady endurance when the mind is wavering. That has been the story of many seers and devotees of God. Having felt occasional flashes of divine radiance, they become miserable because it is not there all the time. But they miss it when their attention wavers only because they have cultivated it on the level of attention. It is wrong to think that the steady endurance of God-consciousness is based on attention. If it does not endure, this is only due to lack of Being. For the basis of God-consciousness is that oneness of life which develops on the solid foundation of cosmic consciousness. This the Lord is going to explain in answer to Arjuna's question. The following verse completes that question. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.34 For wavering is the mind, O Krishna, turbulent, powerful and unyielding; I consider it as difficult to control as the wind. The nature of the senses has already been accepted by the Lord in Chapter II as 'wavering', 'turbulent', 'powerful and unyielding'. It is in the nature of things that the mind, on the level of the senses, is never steady. Arjuna reminds the Lord of this fact. There is no reason to think that Arjuna missed the Lord's essential teaching that it is easy to cultivate God-consciousness, irrespective of the wanderings of the mind in the field of the senses and regardless of the dragging influence of the senses on the mind. He is only afraid of losing it when the mind is drawn by the senses. So he wants to know some method which can bring the mind under control and thus enable him to cultivate and enjoy evenness of mind in God-consciousness. His question is really about the control of the mind on the level of the senses, and it is in regard to this level that the Lord's answer is given. Arjuna's question in these two verses has been widely misundertood to mean that God-consciousness is difficult of attainment because of the wavering nature of the mind. This has resulted either in restraining enthusiasm for cultivating God-consciousness or in leading seekers to practice strenuous methods of controlling the mind and steadying the attention. This pitiable state of affairs in the exalted field of God-realization has come about only because one essential principle has been missed: that God-consciousness is based on the level of Being in cosmic consciousness and not on any thinking, understanding or fixity and continuity of attention. It should be noted that when the Lord, in answer to Arjuna's question, emphasizes the need for practice, such practice is for the purpose of developing transcendental consciousness into cosmic consciousness and then into God-consciousness, and not at all for gaining the ability to maintain the attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.35 The Blessed Lord said: No doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind is hard to controI, it is wavering, but by practice and non-attachment it is held, O son of Kunti. The Lord accepts the difficulty of controlling the mind on the level of its wandering, because the nature of life is such that the mind has to attend to a variety of things. If the mind is channelled only in one direction, other phases of life will suffer. It wanders of necessity, and this is what makes it difficult for the mind to remain steady at any one place. It is unnatural to try to keep it steady. Steadiness does not belong to the relative field of life. That is why the Lord accepts that 'the mind is hard to control'. It should not be lost to sight, however, that even when the mind is wavering and wandering, 'it is held' by the experience of happiness. This fact about the nature of the mind enables the Lord to show Arjuna a way of keeping the mind 'held' wherever it may be, to show him something which will give the mind steadiness even when it continues to waver. By saying that the mind 'is held' through practice and non-attachment, the Lord does not mean that the mind will cease its wandering and will always remain fixed and steady, for this would be impractical in daily life He only means that practice and non-attachment will provide a steady field of omnipresent Being, by virtue of which the mind will be permanently held in the bliss of its own essential nature. 'Practice and non-attachment' means regular practice of transcendental meditation and an easy comfortable routine of daily life after meditation. Practice is not recommended for gaining tile ability to keep the mind fixed and steady. It is for cultivating Being. The state of non-attachment helps Being to be infused into the nature of the mind. 'Non-attachment' signifies a simple, easy and unstrained way of life with a proper sense of values, giving no undue importance to anything; for attachment restricts life by laying stress on one particular aspect. Non-attachment does not mean refraining from the responsibilities of life, but rather giving all aspects of practical life their due, while spontaneously maintaining the Self as separate from activity. This happens as transcendental consciousness grows into cosmic consciousness. The state of non-attachment is meant here and not the practice of gaining that state. 'Practice' brings the mind in contact with transcendental Being, while the unstrained life of 'non-attachment' helps Being to be lived in the field of activity, eventually giving to God-consciousness that steady endurance which was Arjuna's main concern in verse 37 and which is the goal of all Yoga. Cosmic consciousness is the complete state of non-attachment. Practice has to be continued in that state of non-attachment in order to gain and maintain God-consciousness. Practice at this stage means devotion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.36 For an undisciplined man, Yoga is hard to achieve, so I consider; but it can be gained through proper means by the man of endeavor who is disciplined. 'Yoga' in this verse refers to the state of Yoga in God-consciousness, for Arjuna's question, here answered by the Lord, concerns this state. 'An undisciplined man' in this context is he who has not disciplined himself according to the teaching of verses 24 and 25; he who has not gained cosmic consciousness. The Lord here names three pre-requisites for success in Yoga: 'proper means', 'endeavour't and a 'disciplined'o life. 'Through proper means' refers to 'practice and non-attachment' in the previous verse. The expression 'man of endeavor' indicates that the state of Yoga in God-consciousness is not for dull and lazy people: it is for men of responsibility and of a dynamic nature. Thereby the Lord dismisses Arjuna's fear of losing God-consciousness when the mind is engaged in different fields of life (verse 33). 'Who is disciplined': this means a man who has a proper sense of values, who does not confuse the activity of relative life with the Self, or absolute Being. It means the man who has realized cosmic consciousness. It should not be thought that one has to strain in order to keep life disciplined. There are two ways of disciplining a dog. One way is difficult, the other easy. Run after the dog, try to catch it and then tie it down at the door, this is one way of controlling the dog. Do not run after it, do not try to catch it, do not try to tie it at the door; rather, leave the dog quite free to go anywhere it wants, only put some food outside the door, iust what the dog likes to eat The dog will be found always at the door and as often as you wish. This is a simple way of gaining control over the dog without controlling it. We want to discipline the mind, and the easy way is not to try to put restraint upon it. It is attracted by fields of greater happiness, then lead it towards some field of greater happiness in life and it will be found to stay there through its own desire to enjoy that happiness. The practice of transcendental meditation, bringing contentment through the experience of Being, naturally establishes cosmic consciousness and thus gives a disciplined pattern to life. This is the simple way of gaining a disciplined state of mind. In this verse, the Lord is not advocating any particular way, either simple or difficult; He is only bringing out the principle of success in Yoga: the need for discipline in life. The principle which the Lord sets out is indisputable: 'for an undisciplined man, Yoga is hard to achieve'. The mind is undisciplined when it is not contented and at the same time has the whole field of the senses laid open for it to explore. It becomes disciplined when it gains contentment through the permanent experience of transcendent absolute bliss in cosmic consciousness. The word 'disciplined' indicates that, even if the mind associates itself with the senses to enjoy their objects, it does not lose the equanimity which has become permanent through the realization of the Self as separate from activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.37 Arjuna said: What goal does he reach, O Krishna, who is not perfected in Yoga, being endowed with faith, yet lacking effort, his mind strayed from Yoga? The roots of this question lie in the Lord's teaching in verses 24 to 28, which proclaim attainment of cosmic consciousness through practice, through 'effort'. The immediate stimulus to the question, however, is given by the words of the previous verse: 'it can be gained through proper means by the man of endeavor who is disciplined'. The three conditions thus set out for gaining supremely divine evenness of mind make it seem to Arjuna as if he had a long way to go. The Lord has told him earlier that 'in this Yoga no effort is lost and no obstacle exists. Even a little of this dharma delivers from great fear'. So when He now puts three conditions upon it, Arjuna wants to make sure whether or not there will be any advantage in starting on this path, bearing in mind that one may not be able to arrive at the soal in this life. There is yet another implication in this verse. When Arjuna hears about the three pre-requisites for the attainment of the state of Yoga in God-consciousness, he wants to know if there is any short cut. He wants to know how far faith can help a man on this path, for he probably thinks that it may be easier to succeed in God-realization through faith alone Such a question from Arjuna, a very practical man, comes as no surprise. It does not arise from any wish on his part to avoid effort: it arises from the very practical quality of his understanding. Wise are those who understand the nature of a path from beginning to end before they enter upon it, and wiser still are they who take a short cut to accomplish the soal. Arjuna's question reflects his seriousness and the great alertness with which he is following the Lord's discourse. Arjuna asks: 'What goal does he reach?' What is his destiny, where does he go? His concern with this problem springs from his knowledge of the universe. His statements at the beginning of the discourse about dharma, about his ancestors, about hell and heaven, and about the structure of society have revealed his precise knowledge about lift and the world. A man of such learning will naturally be anxious to understand the goal of an aspirant on the path of Yoga. And he has all the more reason to ask because the Lord is speaking to him about attainments in those abstract regions of consciousness which seem very far removed from practical everyday life in the world, or the urgency of a battlefield. In the following verse he makes his question clearer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.38 Deluded on the path to Brahman, O mighty-armed, without foothold and fallen from both, does he not perish like a broken cloud? 'Deluded on the path to Brahman' means fallen from the regular practice of transcendental meditation, which develops cosmic consciousness. The question is about a man who starts the practice ' but who for various reasons is unable to continue it. The word 'deluded' indicates that the reason for giving up the practice lies with the aspirant. There exists nothing on the side of God or on the path to Him that might encourage or impel the aspirant to stop his practice. If he does so, it can only be as a result of his own delusion. This, in turn, may be due to lack of knowledge about the goal or to doubt about his own ability to reach it; or it may be due to lack of proper estimation of its worth. All this may be due to lack of proper guidance. Whatever the cause, if a man stops the practice it can only be because he is deluded. Arjuna's use here of the word 'deluded' reveals the depth of his understanding of the Lord's teaching. Even though he is asking a question about the man who falls from practice, he wishes to show that he already regards such a man as deluded. 'Without foothold': Arjuna is aware of different levels of consciousness and of the different states of life that correspond to them. He is also aware that when a man's consciousness evolves from one level to another, the life of the previous level becomes useless to him. His question is about one who, as the result of a certain amount of practice, has risen above the level of ordinary human consciousness but who has not yet attained cosmic consciousness, which ensures liberation and is the foundation of God-consciousness. Such a man has lost ground on the human level but has as yet no foothold on the divine level. He is neither here nor there. This is what Arjuna expresses with the words 'fallen from both', and he thereupon presents a terrible picture of destruction with the words 'perish like a broken cloud'. Arjuna wants to understand the destiny of the deluded man who has fallen from practice. The question sounds simple but is, in fact, extremely complex, because there can be innumerable levels of consciousness between that of the ignorant and that of a fully liberated, realized man. As Arjuna recognizes in the next verse, the precise answer can come only from Him who knows the whole range of life and all the possibilities that exist between ignorance and the realized state of consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.39 Thou art able to dispel this doubt of mine completely, O Krishna. Truly, there is none save Thee who can dispel this doubt. Having listened to the Lord, Arjuna is by now convinced of the immeasurable depth of His wisdom. The words 'there is none save Thee' indicate that Arjuna, even while raising the question, feels that this is not the right moment for it, the battlefield being no place for metaphysical discussion. But he justifies his question by pointing out that il he does not ask it now, he may never have another chance, since no one else can answer it. It appears that the discourse in verses 28 to 32 has convinced Arjuna of the limitless wisdom that lies at the feet of Lord Krishna. When the disciple expresses appreciation of the wisdom of the master, then the wisdom flows from the master in a more delicate atmosphere of kindness and love. This is clear from the first word of Lord Krishna's answer in the following verse and from the great flood of knowledge that He pours out in response to this question of Arjuna's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.40 The Blessed Lord said: O Partha, there is no destruction for him in this world or hereafter; for none who acts uprightly, My son, goes the way of misfortune. If someone has begun to wash a cloth and for some reason can rinse it only once, he has at least succeeded in removing some of the dirt, even though the cloth is not completely clean. Certainly he has not made it more dirty. A man begins the practice of meditation and, even if he meditates only a few times and transcends only once or twice, whatever purity the mind has gained thereby is his. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.41 Having attained the worlds of the righteous and dwelt there for countless years, he that strayed from Yoga is born in the house of the pure and illustrious. 'He that strayed from Yoga' means either he who could not complete the practice of meditation during his lifetime and has therefore not been able to attain cosmic consciousness, which ensures liberation, or he who has lost interest and has abandoned the practice of Yoga after some time. Purity follows from meditation in proportion to practice. Increased purity leads to a better and happier level of consciousness here, which continues hereafter. During meditation the mind reaches the state of transcendental consciousness and becomes free from any shadow of relativity. It attains to its real status of cosmic existence, unstained by any shadow of ignorance. This is the purified state of the mind, which is completely free from the influence of sin. Having attained it, the mind gains the status of universal Being so perfectly that, on returning to the field of relativity, it brings contentment into the whole realm of thought, speech and action. This quite naturally makes a man's behavior righteous in every aspect of life, and as a result he attains to the worlds of the righteous, which are said to comprise different planes of existence above the human. When righteous people who have not been able to gain cosmic consciousness die, they enter one or other of these planes, for human life is regarded as the gateway to them all. Here life is longer and very much happier because these planes correspond to higher levels of consciousness. The highest level of consciousness is absolute Being, which has eternal life. At the other end of the scale, where purity is least, life is infinitely short. The level of purity determines the span of life on each plane and also the degree of happiness. The Taittiriya Upanishad describes the various degrees of happiness enjoyed by the different beings in creation. All the different planes of life are gained in accordance with the principle of action and its results. The degree of righteousness in this world is the criterion for determining which of these higher planes of life is reached. The worlds of the righteous are therefore the worlds of greater happiness, where beings enjoy much greater harmony and freedom than man enjoys on earth. But they no longer engage in the practice of Yoga. For that they have to come back to earth. Coming back here they are born 'in the house of the pure and illustrious', which provides a congenial atmosphere for Yoga. They resume their practice and attain final liberation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.42 Or he is born in an actual family of yogis endowed with wisdom, though such a birth as this on earth is more difficult to attain. The Lord wishes to impress upon Arjuna that to be 'born in the house of the pure and illustrious' is easier than to be born into a 'family of yogis endowed with wisdom'. There are two reasons for this: not only are such families of yogis scarce in the world, but one also needs to attain a great degree of purity before one can be born into the holy atmosphere of a yogi's family. For having been born into that atmosphere one gains a chance of quickly realizing God-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.43 There he regains that level of Union reached by the intellect in his former body, and by virtue of this, O joy of the Kurus, he strives yet more for perfection. 'There': in the atmosphere of the 'family of yogis endowed with wisdom' (verse 42), or 'in the house of the pure and illustrious' (verse 41). 'He regains': he starts his life from 'that level of Union reached by the intellect in his former body'. This may be understood from an example. Suppose that a cloth needs dipping a hundred times in dye before it is fully colored, and that after it has been dipped ten times the factory closes. The cloth will then be taken to another factory. The second factory can only start from the eleventh dipping. Thus, even though the cloth could not be fully colored by a continuous process in one factory, the degree of colour attained in the first factory determines the starting-point in the second. When a man begins to meditate, Being begins to grow into the nature of his mind. If, after a certain degree of infusion, he stops the practice in this life, or if his body perishes, whenever he again resumes his practice he will do so at that level of purity of consciousness which he had obtained through his former practice. The degree of purity gained in this life is not lost because of the death of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.44 By that former practice itself he is irresistibly borne on. Even the aspirant to Yoga passes beyond the Veda. 'By that former practice itself': by the practice of meditation in the-life that is past. The word 'itself' indicates that the strength of that former practice is in itself sufficient to set a man on this path of Yoga. Nature becomes favorable to him, and circumstances mould themselves in favour of his resuming the practice. 'Irresistibly borne on' means that, whether he makes a conscious effort to start the practice or is unconsciously drawn by the accumulated effect of the practice performed in his previous life, he resumes meditation. The Lord means that no temptation held out by any other aspect of life is able to keep him from resuming his path. He is not held back by anything, not even by the promise of various gains through Vedic rites and rituals. One-pointedly he sets himself on the path of Yoga and, being intent on it, quickly attains the goal. 'Passes beyond the Veda': transcends the field of relativity and arrives at transcendental consciousness. The Lord means that even 'the aspirant', the beginner in Yoga, transcends the field of relative life because, as has already been brought out in verse 40 of Chapter II, there is no difficulty for the mind in reaching absolute transcendental consciousness. Here is a great hope for the student of Yoga, whether learned or otherwise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.45 But the yogi who strives with zeal, purified of all sin and perfected through many births, thereupon reaches the transcendent goal. The present verse has been the cause of great misunderstanding and discouragement, for many people have inferred that the Lord here enunciates the principle that attainment requires many lifetimes. This comes from a failure to understand the true meaning of the word 'birth'. Birth means taking a new body. If we analyze what happens when the individual mind gains cosmic status in transcendental consciousness, we find that the individual ceases to exist, he becomes pure Existence. On coming out from the Transcendent, individual life is regained. Birth means this regaining of individual existence. Failure to understand the language of the Scripture of Yoga is due to lack of experience of the state of Yoga and to lack of knowledge of the details concerning the practice of Yoga. In this situation misinterpretations are bound to arise. Three states of Yoga have already been referred to: Yoga in transcendental consciousness, in cosmic consciousness and in God-consciousness. The expression 'perfected' shows that the present verse refers to God-consciousness. The Lord says : 'perfected through many births'. By this He means perfected through the continued practice of repeatedly gaining transcendental consciousness and thus being re-born to the world many, many times until cosmic consciousness is gained. This state of cosmic consciousness, which the Lord says is attained 'with ease',o forms the solid foundation upon which God-consciousness grows. Of this growth of God-consciousness from the state of cosmic consciousness, the Lord says: 'in time finds this within himself'. It should be noticed that the Lord's expression 'in time' contains no suggestion whatever of many lifetimes. Thus there is absolutely no reason to suppose that the expression 'many births' means many lifetimes. The teaching is that by the practice of transcendentaI meditation one readily gains transcendental consciousness, and that through constant practice of gaining transcendental consciousness, one rises to cosmic consciousness 'without long delay' and then to God-consciousness. We may interpret 'many births' in the superficiaI sense of the expression as many lives, but it is clear that this meaning will apply only to those who are 'not perfected in Yoga' in this life through 'lacking effort:' and because their 'mind strayed from Yoga'.' Even they, the Lord says, attaln the transcendent goal by gradually purifying themselves through practice in many lives. This is the glory of Yoga, that once it has been started it will have its effect. If it does not bring complete fulfillment in this life, owing to lack of practice, then it will have its influence in future lives, bringing a man back to its practice and eventually to liberation. 'Transcendent goal': the goal of transcendental consciousness. When transcendental consciousness becomes permanent in cosmic consciousness, the goal that lies ahead is God-consciousness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.46 A yogi is superior to the austere; he is deemed superior even to men of knowledge. A yogi is superior to men of action. Therefore be a yogi, O Arjuna. In this verse the Lord denies the value of all doing, of all straining and of all effort for the sake of enlightenment. The man of austerity strains both body and mind. The practice of Yoga refines the nervous system in a gentle way and, removing all strain, leads to transcendental consciousness. Therefore austerity is inferior to Yoga from every point of view. The man of knowledge in this context is one who has theoretical knowledge about the three gunas, the Self and God, but has not directly experienced them. Certainly he is inferior to the yogi, who knows their nature through direct experience. The path through activity is taken by one who strives for purification of the body, mind and soul by the ritualistic performance of righteous action, by charity and by the exercise of a proper sense of duty, by any kind of action aimed at refining his mind and reaching enlightenment. This path again is inferior to Yoga, which enlightens the mind in an easy and direct way. It is certainly true that all such practices have a purifying effect, thus helping the mind to grow in sattva. Becoming more pure in this way, the mind will eventually reach the status of the Self. The theory of all these paths is right, but they are inferior to Yoga. Not only do they take a very long time, but they are confined within the field of which the Lord has said 'action is... the means' Whereas the yogi is established in the field of which the Lord has said 'calmness is . . . the means'. This is a very much more advanced state of life. The superiority of a yogi lies not only in his realizing the Supreme quickly and easily but also in his realization of Its fullest glory, the glory of the manifested Being in the absolute existence of God. This is the glory of God-consciousness in man's life, a glory beyond the excellence reached through austerity or knowledge or action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;$6.47 And of all yogis, I hold him most fully united who worships Me with faith, his inmost Self absorbed in Me. Here is an exposition of the highest state of evolution. The Lord says: 'of all yogis'. By this He means that there are various types of yogi, the hatha yogi, gyana yogi, karma yogi, and so on All these have four levels of attainment: the first is realization of Self-consciousness (verses 10 to 18); the second realization of cosmic consciousness (verses 24 to 29); the realization of God-consciousness (verses 30 to 32), and the fourth, realization of all creation in God-consciousness (verse 32). When the Lord says: 'of all yogis . . . his inmost Self absorbed in Me', He is referring to the man who has established within himself a natural and permanent bond of Union with the Lord of all beings and with the whole creation. This happens on the level where devotion is fulfilled. Infusion of the state of Being into the nature of the mind, in such fullness and so permanently that no experience of relativity can overshadow it, characterizes cosmic consciousness. One who has reached this state is ever contented in himself, But though this contentment is positive and actual, it is wholly abstract in its essential nature, for it is, after all, a sign of the infusion of transcendental Being into the nature of the mind. This infusion does not cause Being to be experienced on the level of the senses. The eyes cannot see Being, the tongue cannot taste It, the ears cannot hear nor the hands touch It. It is the process of devotion in faith which brings this about. Devotion is always on a personal level So when the Lord says: 'of all yogis' he 'who worships Me with faith', He means one who, established in cosmic consciousness, attaches himself to the manifest expression of cosmic existence, to cosmic existence made individual in God, for the sake of devotion and worship. Then the eyes enjoy the abstract eternal Being made manifest, all the senses enjoy It as their object of experience. This is the way of devotion which glorifies even one who has gained cosmic consciousness and enables him to enjoy the Transcendent, the Supreme, on the level of the senses. Religious history records individuals, men like Shukadeva, King Janaka and others --.who, established in Reality, were devoted to the Lord and enjoyed Him by every means of experience, by the senses, by the mind, by the intellect and by the soul. Such fortunate beings, the Lord says, are 'most fully united'. This is the verse which puts an end to any misunderstanding about the highest state of Union. The Lord shows that in Him rests 'absorbed' the 'inmost Self' of the highest yogi. This is an explanation from His side, but the expression which He gives to that state from the side of the devotee is different: the devotee worships Him 'with faith'. This is the glory of Union with the Lord. The Lord embraces the devotee and makes him one with Himself, and the devotee holds fast to the Lord in worship. This is the state of oneness where each upholds the other. This is the duality and the Unity in the Great Union. Thus ends the Yoga of Meditation, Dhyana Yoga. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The following verse records the cherished names of the great masters of the holy tradition of Vedic wisdom: Narayanam Padmabhavam Vashishtham Shaktim cha tatputra Parasharam cha Vyasam Shukam Gaudapadam mahantam Govinda Yogindra mathasya shishyam Shri Shankaracharya mathasya Padma- Padam cha Hastamalakam cha shishyam Tam Trotakam Vartikakaram-anyan Asmad Gurun santat mantosmi.

Likewise, when the conscious mind expands to embrace deeper levels of thinking, the thought-wave becomes more powerful. The expanded capacity of the conscious mind increases the power of the mind and results in added energy and intelligence. Man, who generally uses only a small portion of the total mind that he possesses, begins to make use of his full mental potential. The technique may be defined as turning the attention inwards towards the subtler levels of a thought until the mind transcends the experience of the subtlest state of the thought and arrives at the source of the thought. This expands the conscious mind and at the same time brings it in contact with the creative intelligence that gives rise to every thought. A thought-impulse starts from the silent creative centre within, as a bubble starts from the bottom of the sea. As it rises, it becomes larger; arriving at the conscious level of the mind, it becomes large enough to be appreciated as a thought, and from there it develops into speech and action. Turning the attention inwards takes the mind from the experience of a thought at the conscious level (B) to the finer states of the thought until the mind arrives at the source of thought (A). This inward march of the mind results in the expansion of the conscious mind (from W1 to W2). The technique is described as transcendental meditation. Its practice is simple. There are no pre-requisites for beginning the practice, other than receiving instructions personally from a qualified teacher. It should be noted that transcendental meditation is neither a matter of contemplation nor of concentration. The processes of contemplation and concentration both hold the mind on the conscious thinking level, whereas transcendental meditation systematically takes the mind to the source of thought, the pure field of creative intelligence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;COSMIC LAW, THE BASIC LAW OF CREATION 

The ever-changing creation of infinite variety seems to be grounded on some stable plane of existence. The rhythm of nature seems to conform to a definite pattern. The infinite number of the galaxies in the vast structure of cosmic space seem to move according to a definite plan. The creation, evolution and dissolution of all things seems to follow a definite procedure. Things change, but the incessant change itself seems to have some unchanging basis. Hydrogen and oxygen are gases. They combine to form water, H2O. The qualities of gas change to the qualities of water, but hydrogen and oxygen remain H and O. Again, when water freezes and is transformed into ice, the qualities of water change t'o those of ice, but hydrogen and oxygen, the essential constituents, remain the same. This means that, while there are certain laws responsible for changing the qualities of gas to water and water to ice, there is some force, some law, which maintains the integrity of hydrogen and oxygen. The law that does not allow hydrogen and oxygen to change into anything else is itself the unchanging basis of the laws responsible for changing gas into liquid and liquid into solid. The cosmic law is that law which maintains the integrity of the essential and ultimate constituent of creation, absolute Being. Being remains Being by virtue of the cosmic law, which gives rise to different laws responsible for different strata of creation. Although these varied laws of nature are directly responsible for the maintenance and evolution of the universe, their basis is the eternal cosmic law at the plane of Being. When, during transcendental meditation, the mind transcends the subtlest state of thought and attains the state of Self-consciousness, or pure Being, it attains the level of cosmic law. Coming out of that state, its position is like that of a man entering the office of the President and coming out endowed with his goodwill, all the subordinates begin to be in sympathy with him and give him their full support by directing his activities towards a successful end. When the mind comes out from the field of Being, the plane of cosmic law, into the relative field of activity, which is under the influence of innumerable laws of nature, it automatically enjoys the support of the cosmic law, and this makes possible the accomplishment of any aspiration and the ultimate fulfillment of life. This is how the life of a man who has risen to cosmic consciousness is eternally established on the level of cosmic law and receives spontaneous support from all the laws of nature. 

THE SIX SYSTEMS OF INDIAN PHILOSOPHY

Knowledge is true only when it is acceptable in the light of each of the six systems of Indian philosophy. The truth of every statement in the Bhagavad-Gita can be tested and proved in this way. The second verse of Chapter I is analysed below to illustrate this perfection of Vyasa's exposition. The systems are presented in their classical sequence. 

The first system, Nyaya, analyses the correctness of the procedure of gaining knowledge. Having arrived correctly at the object of investigation through Nyaya, one turns to the second system, Vaisheshika, which sets forth the criteria for analyzing the special qualities which differentiate the object from other objects. When Vaisheshika has identified the object of enquiry beyond any doubt,the third system, Sankhya, enumerates the different components of the object. Yoga, the fourth system, then offers a way for the direct cognition of the object. Knowledge of the modes of activity of the object and of its components is provided by the fifth system, Karma Mimansa. These five systems having analysed the different aspects of the object of enquiry from the point of view of relative existence, the sixth system, Vedanta, shows that the ultimate Reality of the object, which underlies all its different phases, is absolute in nature Thus it is clear that the six systems taken together make knowledge complete by considering every possible aspect of the object. 

It should be noted that each system is so thorough in itself that it appears to be sufficient to give complete knowledge for liberation. Many scholars have thus been dazzled by one particular system and blinded to the value of the others. It therefore seems that the very perfection of each system has robbed Indian philosophy of its wholeness and made it weak. In order to be complete, knowledge requires the support of all six systems. 

The following analysis illustrates how the various words of the second verse of Chapter I give expression to each of the six systems in detail. The first verse presents a question. The truth of a question does not need to be verified as does the truth of a statement which presents the answer. That is why the first verse has not been analysed here. The answer begins from the second verse and its validity is open to verification in the light of the six systems of Indian philosophy. 

It will be recalled that the verse runs as follows: 

''Then Duryodhnna, the prince, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, approached his master and spoke these words ''

NYAYA 

Nyaya, the science of reasoning expounded by Gautama, presents sixteen points by which to test the procedure of gaining knowledge: 

1. THE MEANS OF VALID KNOWLEDGE (PRAMANA) 

There are four means of valid knowledge: 

i. Perception(pratyaksha). The lesson on perception is given by the word 'seeing'. &lt;br&gt;
ii. Inference (anumana). 'Seeing... battle array': seeing the army in battle array, Duryodhana inferred that it was time to fight, and this made him approach his master. &lt;br&gt;
iii. Comparision (upamana). This is a means of gaining knowledge of something by comparing it with another well-known object. Here the word 'prince' is used with reference to Duryodhana. &lt;br&gt;
iv. Verbal testimony (shabda). 'These words': the words of a prince are authentic. 

2. THE OBJECT OF VALID KNOWLEDGE (PRAMEYA) 

The object of knowledge is that about which the enquiry is made, or that which is approached, in this case the 'master'. A point to be noted here is that when Vyasa teaches the lesson of prameya, he presents as the object of knowledge the master, who is the source of all knowledge. 

3. DOUBT (SAMSHAYA) 

The 'approach' to a 'master' is made in order to remove doubts and gain clarity. 

4. PURPOSE (PRAYOJANA) 

The words 'drawn up in battle array' demonstrate the purpose of the army. 

5. EXAMPLE (DRISHTANTA) 

'Duryodhana' gives the lesson on drishtanta. In the previous verse, Dhritarashtra asked about the actions of his sons. Duryodhana being the eldest, his actions may be taken to exemplify the actions of all the hundred sons of Dhritarashtra. 

6. ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE (SIDDHANTA) 

It is an established principle that the master is always approached by the disciple. Duryodhana 'approached his master'. 

7. PARTS OF A LOGICAL ARGUMENT (AVAYAVA) 

'Seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. 

8. THE PROCESS OF REASONING (TARKA) 

Duryodhana 'approached his master' in order to gain an authoritative decision which would leave no possibility of error or supposition. The lesson on reasoning given here is highly practical. 

9. THE ART OF DRAWING CONCLUSIONS (NIRNAYA) 

Seeing the army, Duryodhana judged the situation and immediately acted upon the conclusion he had drawn: he 'approached his master'. 

10. DISCUSSION (VADA) 

Discussion consists of the interplay of two opposing sides for the purpose of arriving at a decisive conclusion. The lesson on discussion taught by this verse is of a very perfect nature. One man seeing both sides 'approached' the 'master', the knower of Reality, to find a solution. In teaching the lesson of discussion, of the interplay of two opposing sides, this verse at the same time teaches the lesson of harmony. 

11. POLEMICS (JALPA) 

Polemics is argument for the sake of victory, as opposed to discussion for the sake of arriving at the truth. In the present verse, the lesson on polemics is given by 'spoke these words'. The battlefield is the place for action, but instead of taking action Duryodhana engages in speech. Further, the opposing army is silent, and against that silence Duryodhana 'spoke these words'. Therefore in this verse action is pitted against speech and speech challenges silence. Here is a lesson on polemics in its most extreme form. 

12. CAVIL (VITANDA) This verse places 'the army' on one side and 'words' on the other and thereby lowers the dignity of the army. This is the purpose of cavil, to lower the dignity of the other side. It is the beauty of this verse that it teaches a lesson on cavil without using the language of cavil. 13. FALLACIES (HETVABHASA) Fallacies are of five types: i. The inconcIusive (savyabhichara), reasoning from which more than one conclusion can be drawn. This verse leaves us in uncertainty about what Duryodhana said, even though it uses the word 'these', which indicates definiteness. ii. The contradictory (viruddha) where the reasoning contradicts the proposition to be established. In the face of 'the army of the Pandavas . . in battle array', the reasonable thing to be established by Duryodhana was that the fighting should begin. But instead of starting to fight, Duryodhana 'approached his master'. iii. The equivalent to the question (praknranasama), where the reasoning is such that it provokes the very question that it is designed to answer. The lesson on this fallacy is found in 'these words'. The word 'these' is definite in its character, but here its use is such that it provokes a question about the definiteness of the 'words'. iv. The unprovem (sadhyasama) where the reason given in order to establish a conclusion is not different from what is to be proved and itself stands in need of proof. The reason for Duryodhana's approach to his master needs proof or justification, because at the time of battle Duryodhana could have had a reason for going to the commander-in-chief but not for going to his master. v. The belated (kalatifa) where the reason is advanced when the time for it is past. The master is consulted in order that he may give his judgment on the correctness of an action. The reasonable thing would have been for Duryodhana to approach his master before coming on the battlefield. 14. EQUIVOCATION (CHALA) Equivocation is of three types: i. Verbal (vakchala) assuming a word to have a meaning other than that intended by the speaker. The sequence of words in the original text is such that the word 'prince' (raja) can also be taken to qualify 'words'. It would then mean that Duryodhana spoke princely words, that he spoke like a king, implying that he was not a king but spoke like one. This use of 'prince' with reference to 'words' gives the teaching on verbal equivocation. ii. Generalizing (samanyacchaIa) challenging the possibility of a statement because of the impossibility of the whole situation. Duryodhana's words had never been as responsible as those of a prince, so the use of the word 'prince' could be taken ironically. It would then mean that Duryodhana is being ridiculed here. This is a teaching on the second type of equivocation. iii. Figurative (upnracchaIa) misinterpreting a word which is used figuratively by taking it literally. As Duryodhana was not a true ruler, the use of the word 'prince' (raja) with reference to him may be regarded as figurative. When it is taken literally, it gives a lesson on this type of equivocation. 15. FUTILE ARGUMENT (JATI) This means argument based merely on similar and dissimilar characteristics. There is similarity of nature between 'Duryodhana' and 'prince'. There is dissimilarity of nature between 'the Pandavas' and their 'army . . . in battle array', because the Pandavas are by nature peaceful. 16. DISAGREEMENT ON FIRST PRINCIPLES (NIGRAHASTHANA) This arises from mistaken ideas or from a complete lack of understanding. A master is approached when one needs some clarification, and clarification is needed to eliminate error or misunderstanding. The lesson with regard to disagreement on first principles is exemplified by the 'master', in whom all disagreements are dissolved. This is the perfection of the teaching of Gautama's Nyaya in the Bhagavad-Gita: even the lesson on disharmony is taught from the centre of all harmony, so that the student of Nyaya is not left on the dry plains of reason. VAISHESHIKA Vaisheshika, the system expounded by Kanada, analyses the special qualities (vishesha) which distinguish an object from other objects. In the present verse, the word 'prince' brings out a special quality which distinguishes Duryodhana from other men. 'His' specifying 'master' and 'these' specifying 'words' serve a similar purpose. Here we have a general lesson on the Vaisheshika philosophy. According to Vaisheshika, there are nine substances which form the basis of all creation. The special qualities of these substances are responsible for the varying qualities of the multidude of objects in creation. The nine ultimate. substances are: earth (prithivi), water (apas), fire (tejas), air (vayu), space (akasha), time (kala), direction in space (dik), soul (atman), mind (manas). The first four ultimate substances are distinguished from one another by the special qualities of their paramanus, or atoms. There are four such special qualities: odour (gandha), taste (rasa), form (rupa), touch (sparsha). Earth possesses all four of these qualities; water possesses flavour, form and touch; fire possesses form and touch; air possesses touch only. 1. EARTH (PRITHIVI) The lesson on the earth element is given by the word 'Duryodhana'. As odour is inseparable from earth, so a princely fragrance is inseparable from Duryodhana, the prince, or master of the earth. 2. WATER (APAS) Taste is the essential quality of the water element. The sense of taste dwells in the tongue, which is also the organ of speech. Therefore the word 'spoke' may be said to give the lesson on the water element . 3. FIRE (TEJAS) 'Seeing' gives the lesson on the fire element, because the sense of sight relates to the fire element. 4. AIR (VAYU) 'Approached' gives the lesson on the air element, because touch is the inseparable quality of the air element. The process of approaching culminates in touch. 5. SPACE (AKASHA) The fifth ultimate substance, space, is characterized by sound. Therefore the lesson on space is given by 'words'. 6. TIME (KALA) Time is indicated by such concepts as sequence, simultaneity, speed and slowness. 'Seeing . . . approached . . . spoke' gives a lesson on all these concepts. 7. DIRECTION IN SPACE (DIK) Direction in space is indicated by expressions such as here, there, far, near, above, below. The lesson on direction in space is given by 'army . in battle array' and 'approached'. 8. SOUL (ATMAN) According to the Vaisheshika Sutra, the existence of the eighth ultimate substance, soul, is indicated by the ascending life-breath (prana) , the descending life-breath (apana), the closing of the eyelids (nimesha), the opening of the eyelids (unmesha), life (jivana), mental activity (manogati), the inner changes in the field of the senses (in driyantara-vikara), pleasure (sukha), pain (duhkha), desire (iccha) and effort (prayatna) . The lesson on soul is given by: i The ascending and descending life-breaths join to bring forth speech: 'spoke these words'. ii The closing and opening of the eyelids relate to vision: 'seeing'. iii. Life is indicated in Duryodhana by the words 'seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. iv. Mental activity is inherent in the sequence of 'seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. v Pleasure is inherent in 'approached his master'. vi. Pain is inherent in 'seeing the army of the Pandavas . . . in battle array'. The lesson on pain is taught without recourse to any obvious reference to pain. vii. Duryodhana's desire is indicated by the word 'these'. Vyasa, in giving a lesson on desire, uses an expression which indicates the principle of desire without specifying any particular desire lest the mind be drawn away from the central point under consideration. Here is an example of Vyasa's great precision of language in his teaching on the different systems of Indian philosophy. viii. The lesson on effort is given by the word 'approached'. For any man the process of approaching involves effort, all the more so for a prince, who wields the power to summon anyone at any time. It is clear that in order to verify the special qualities of the soul, the soul must be 'approached'. In the verse under consideration, 'approached' is the result of some mental activity following upon the sensory activity of 'seeing'. Likewise, in order to approach the soul, it is necessary to go from the experience of the field of sensory activity to that of mental activity until, transcending the subtlest mental activity, one approaches the field of pure Being, which is pure consciousness, the basis of all activity. Only through this process, known as transcendental meditation, can the mind realize intimately the subtle fields of relative existence, which Kanada indicates as constituting the special qualities of the soul, and this fulfils the purpose of the Vaisheshika teaching. 9. MIND (MANAS) The ninth ultimate substance, mind, is the faculty responsible for giving knowledge to the soul upon the soul's contact with the senses and their objects. The lesson on mind is given by the thought that lies between 'seeing' and 'approached' and 'spoke'. SANKHYA Sankhya means pertaining to number. This system of philosophy, expounded by Kapila, holds that knowledge of an object will not be complete without the knowledge of its components. In its analysis of life and creation, Sankhya establishes twenty-five categories as lying at the basis of the entire creation and of the process of cosmic evolution. The teaching concerning these categories can be verified by direct experience through the practice of transcendental meditation, in which the mind travels through all the gross and subtle levels of creation to the state of pure transcendental consciousness. l.PURUSHA Purusha, or Cosmic Spirit, is the transcendental Reality which comes into direct experience during transcendental meditation at the point where even the subtlest level of creation is transcended and pure transcendental consciousness alone remains. Purusha forms the basis of the subjective aspect of life. He is the eternal silent witness of all that was, is and will be. In the verse under consideration, the teaching about Purusha is found in the word 'Pandavas'. The expression 'army of the Pandavas' indicates that while the army belongs to the Pandavas, the Pandavas themselves may not necessarily form a part of the army; they may remain, as it were, uninvolved. Even though the whole of nature functions under His will, Purusha remains a silent witness to its activity. 2. PRAKRITI Prakriti, or Nature, is the Drimal substance out of which the entire creation arises. Its constituents are the three gunas, sattva, rajas and tamas. They are responsible for all change and form the basis of evolution. Whereas in the present verse 'the Pandavas' represent Purusha, 'the army' represents prakriti. Furthermore, the phrase 'army...drawn up in battle array' represents prakriti laid out in its different constituents, ready to be active. Without specifically mentioning the three gunas, Vyasa fully conveys the nature of prakriti. As long as the three gunas are in equilibrium, they do not present themselves as three, they do not demonstrate any activity, and there is no process of creation and evolution; when they have begun to be active, they appear in a whole multitude of permutations and combinations. 3.MAHAT Mahat is that first state of evolution where the previously undifferentiated primal substance, prakriti, begins to move towards manifestation, begins to take a specific direction. It is the cosmic will in operation, satisfying the urge for manifestation that has been created by the disturbance of the perfect equilibrium of the three gunas. The lesson on mahat is given by the word 'approached', which depicts the first stir in the situation presented by the verse, a movement in a specific direction. 4. AHAMKARA Ahamkara is the principle responsible for the individuation of mahat. The teaching on ahamkara is to be found in the word 'his', which presents an example of the principle of individuation, the individuation of the general term 'master'. 5. MANAS Manas is the cosmic mind which provides the object for the. individuating principle, ahamkara. In the state of manas, the urge of prakriti towards manifestation becomes clearly defined. The lesson on manas is given by the phrase 'these words', which gives definite shape to the situation created by the first stir, mahat, indicated by the word 'approached'. 6-15. THE INDRIYAS The next ten principles are called indriyas, or senses: five senses of perception (gyanendriya) and five organs of action (karmendriya). They connect the mind with the manifested world of objects. The lesson on the senses of perception is given by the word 'seeing', taking the sense of sight as representative of the five senses of perception. The lesson on the organs of action is given by the word 'spoke', the organ of speech being taken as representative of the five organs of action. 16--20. THE TANMATRAS The tanmatras constitute the five basic realities. or essences. of the objects of the five senses of perception. They express themselves in the five elements which go to make up the objects of the senses and which provide the material basis of the entire objective universe. Thus the essence of sound (shabda tanmatra) expresses itself in space, the essence of touch (sparsha tanmatra) in air, the essence of form (rupa tanmatra) in fire, the essence of taste (rasa tanmatra) in water, and the essence of smell (gandha tanmatra) in earth. The lesson on the tanmatras is provided by the Sanskrit word 'tu', omitted in the translation, meaning 'only after' seeing. This expression draws a dividing line in the sequence of events. Likewise the tanmatras mark the dividing line between the subjective and objective creation. In the process of evolution, as the influence of tamas increases, the subjective creation comes to an end and the objective creation begins. The tanmatras, forming as they do the basis of the five elements, lie in the grossest field of the subjective aspect of creation. 21-25. THE MAHABHUTAS The five mahabhutas, or elements out of which material creation is constituted, are space (akasha), air (vayu), fire (tejas), water (apas) and earth (prithivi). The lesson on the mahabhutas has already been made clear while dealing with Vaisheshika. It may be noted that the whole teaching of Kapila's Sankhya can be verified by direct experience through transcendental meditation, because in order to reach the state of transcendental consciousness the mind has to traverse all the gross and subtle levels of creation. YOGA The purpose of Yoga is to gain knowledge by direct perception. Yoga is a practical science of life which lays open to direct experience not only the field of absolute Being but all the different levels of relative creation as well. The very first word of the verse in the original text, 'drishtva' (literally 'having seen'), gives a lesson both on the purpose of Yoga and the way to its fulfilment. Patanjali, in his exposition of Yoga, divides life into eight spheres in order to deal thoroughly and completely with the subject of Yoga : 1 The entire field of creation lying outside the individual but constantly influenced by his thoughts and actions. The state of Yoga, or perfect harmony, is found established in this field when man's life is naturally upheld by the five qualities of observance (yama): i. Truthfulness (satya). ii. Non-violence (ahimsa). iii. Non-covetousness (asteya). iv. Celibacy (brahmacharya). v. Non-acceptance of others' possessions (aparigraha). These qualities are represented by 'the Pandavas', the five virtuous sons of Pandu. 1. The physical structure of the individual body and nervous system. The state of Yoga is found established in the field of the body and nervous system when man's life is naturally upheld by the five rules of life (niyama): i. Purification (shaucha). ii. Contentment (santosha). iii. Austerity (tapas). iv. Study (svadhaya). v. Devotion to God (Ishvara-pranidhana). These five qualities again are represented by 'the Pandavas'. 3. The different limbs of the body, the sphere of posture (asana). The state of Yoga is found established in the sphere of the limbs of the body when there is a perfect functioning of all the limbs in good co-ordination with each other. In this state, the body is capable of remaining in a steady posture for any length of time. The lesson on asana is given by 'drawn up', for in the state of Yoga, the state of transcendental consciousness, all the limbs of the body are in perfect accord with each other, fully alert, but not yet set in action. 4. The sphere of the individual breath, the sphere of breathing exercises (pranayama). In the state of Yoga, the activity of breath comes automatically to rest. The lesson on pranayama is given by 'the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array'. 'The Pandavas', or five sons of Pandu, represent the five breaths, prana, apana, vyana, udana and samana, functioning in different parts of the body. 'The army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array' represents the steadiness of all the five breaths in the state of Yoga. 5. The sphere of life which lies between the senses and their objects. The state of Yoga in this sphere is marked by complete self-sufficiency on the part of the senses so that they are no longer projected outwards towards their objects. Yoga here means retirement from the field of the objects of the senses. The lesson on the turning away of the senses from their objects (pratyahara) is given by the word 'seeing' (literally 'having seen'), which shows that Duryodhana's vision, having fallen on the army of the Pandavas, was thereupon withdrawn. 6. The sphere of life that lies between the senses and the mind. The state of Yoga in this sphere is marked by the withdrawal of the mind from the realm of the senses. The lesson on steadiness of mind (dharana) is given by the expression 'drawn up', which indicates that the mind is steady, that it is no longer associated with the senses. 7. The sphere of life that lies between the mind and Being. The state of Yoga in this sphere is marked by the refining of the mental impulses until the most refined state of mental activity is transcended and the mind gains the state of pure consciousness, absolute existence, or eternal Being. The lesson on this process of meditation (dhyana) is given by the words 'approached his master', the master representing the state of Being. A close scrutiny of Patanjali's exposition of Yoga reveals that the actual process of attaining the state of Yoga belongs not only to dhyana, or meditation, which alone appears to result directly in samadhi, or transcendental consciousness, but also to all the other limbs of his eightfold Yoga. Each limb presents the principle underlying the practices that bring about the state of Yoga in the sphere of life pertaining to that limb. For hundreds of years these different limbs of Yoga have been mistakenly regarded as different steps in the development of the state of Yoga, whereas in truth each limb is designed to create the state of Yoga in the sphere of life to which it relates. With the continuous practice of all these limbs, or means, simultaneously, the state of Yoga grows simultaneously in all the eight spheres of life, eventually to become permanent. It seems necessary to point out here that even samadhi, which is already the state of Yoga in the sense of transcendental consciousness, serves as a means to the ultimate state of Yoga, cosmic consciousness. In the state of cosmic consciousness, transcendental consciousness has become permanently grounded in the nature of the mind or, to speak in Indian terms, kshanika (momentarY) samadhi has become nitya (perpetual) samadhi. It is in this sense that Maharishi Patanjali has placed samadhi along with the other seven limbs, or means, of Yoga. In order to connect the principle of dhyana with practice it may be mentioned that the most valuable practice in the sphere of dhyana is the simple system of transcendental meditation. Transcendental meditation belongs to the sphere of dhyana, but at the same time transcends that sphere and gives rise to the state of transcendental consciousness, samadhi. After this state has been gained the attention returns to the sphere of dhyana, which is a sphere of activity. This regular passing of the attention from one sphere to the other enables transcendental consciousness to be maintained even during activity, first at a very subtle level and later in the gross activity of daily life, so that it may eventually become permanent. In this way the simple system known as transcendental meditation, which is a specific type of practice, forms the most effective working tool of these two spheres of life, dhyana and samadhi. 8. The sphere of absolute Being, the state of transcendental consciousness (samadhi). The lesson on samadhi is given by the word 'Pandavas' In this verse, the use of the word 'Pandavas' indicates that the Pandavas possess the army and, as its masters, are separate from it. Similarly, in the state of samadhi the self is experienced as the Transcendent, uninvolved with anything. 

KARMA MIMANSA 

Mimansa means investigation, close consideration. Karma Mimansa is concerned with the close study of action, because action forms the basis of the existence and evolution of the individual. The very first sutra of Jaimini's Karma Mimansa begins with an enquiry into dharma, the invincible force of nature which upholds the entire creation. The main quest of Karma Mimansa is for that action which will be spontaneously in accord with dharma. The influence of every action is so far-reaching as to be beyond human understanding. Therefore the criterion by which the rightness of an action should be judged can be no other than the verbal testimony (shabda) of the Vedas. 

Jaimini establishes the eternal nature of shabda by logical argument and removes all doubts concerning it. The lesson on this is given by the expression 'approached his master', because the master is approached to remove all doubts. 

Having established the eternity of shabda, it was necessary for Jaimini to establish that the Veda is divine revelation at the time of creation. The lesson on this is found in the word 'then', at the time of creation. 

Jaimini also proves that the words of the Veda, even though impulses of the Divine, are not meaningless notes or rhythms. They have a meaning and therefore a specific purpose just like any spoken sound (word) in any language. Every word and every phrase of the verse under consideration offers a lesson on this point. 

Because he held the Veda to be the final authority on dharma, it was necessary for Jaimini to devise a definite method of investigation of the Vedic text. This he did by analyzing the contents of the Vedas as follows: 

1. VIDHI (PRECEPTS OR INJUNCTIONS) 

The lesson on this is given by the sequence 'seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. 

2. MANTRA (KEY-WORDS) 

Mantras are key-words which help one to remember the different steps of the yagyas. 

The 'master' (acharya) is the custodian of the knowledge of the mantras and is there to answer all objections raised against them. The mantras exist to help the performance of the yagya: there is a different mantra at every step. During the process of the yagya, the master speaks the mantra, and in accordance with that others perform actions. Duryodhana 'approached his master' in order to receive the right word (mantra) of action from him. 

3. NAMADHEYA (PROPER NOUNS) 

The lesson on namadheya is given by 'Duryodhana' and 'Pandavas'. 

4. NISHEDHA (PROHIBITIONS) 

Nishedha is the opposite of vidhi. 

The lesson on nishedha is given by 'approached his master' and 'spoke these words'. The procedure in accordance with precept (vidhi) is that after approaching the master one should at once prostrate oneself. But instead of prostrating himself, Duryodhana began to speak. 

5. ARTHAVADA (EXPLANATORY PASSAGES) 

'The prince' gives a lesson on arthavada. 

The Mimansakas, following the Sanskrit grammarians, divide Vedic substantives into three types: 

1. Rudhi, a simple non-compound word with a conventional acceptation which we learn from a teacher or other authority. &lt;br&gt;
The lesson on rudhi is given by 'words'. 

2. Yallgika, a compound word made up of two or more words, each of which has its independent meaning and contributes to the meaning of the whole. &lt;br&gt;
The lesson on yaugika is given by 'army of the Pandavas' (pandava-anikam) . 

3. Yogarudhi, a word which, though compound, has its own conventional meaning. &lt;br&gt;
The lesson on this is given by the word 'Duryodhana' (Dur-yodhana) . 

Jaimini points out that substantives are not self-sufficient but require a verb to convey the purpose of speech. Verbs introduce the element of action, which is classified by Jaimini according to whether its effects are mainly visible or invisible. Those actions with mainly invisible effects (apurva) are called principal (pradhana), and those with mainly visible effects are called secondary (gauna). 

The lesson on actions which are pradhana is given by the word 'spoke', because the effects of Duryodhana's speech are not visible in this verse. The lesson on actions which are gauna is given by the word 'seeing', because the effect of seeing is immediately apparent in 'approached his master and spoke these words'. 

In order to permit a thorough scrutiny of the Vedic texts in accordance with the principles of interpretation laid out above, the Vedas are considered in two sections: 1. The Samhitas, those parts which deal with the mantras; 2. The Brahmanas, those parts which deal with ritualistic performances and explanatory passages. 

1. THE SAMHITAS 

These are divided into three sections: 

i. Rik, verses collected in a group and marked by their metrical arrangement. The lesson on this is given by the metrical quality of the present verse. &lt;br&gt;
ii. Sama, verses sung at the conclusion of the yagya. The lesson on sama is given by the word 'then' This word places the situation portrayed in the verse at the end of some other happening. &lt;br&gt;
iii. Yajus mantras in prose. They are of two types: &lt;br&gt;
a. those which are spoken aloud (nigada) The lesson on this type of mantra is given by all the words of this verse since they are spoken aloud. &lt;br&gt;
b. those which are pronounced silently (upamshu). 'These words' refers to words that are not pronounced in this verse. This gives a lesson on the mantras which are pronounced silently. 

2. THE BRAHMANAS 

Shabara, in his commentary on the Mimansa Sutra, mentions ten ways of analyzing the Brahmanas: &lt;br&gt;
i. Hetu, motive. The lesson on this is given by the word 'seeing'. It was 'seeing' which caused Duryodhana to ;approach his master and speak. &lt;br&gt;
ii. Nirvachana, explanation of expression. The lesson on this is given by 'drawn up in battle array', an expression which explains what is seen. &lt;br&gt;
iii. Ninda, deprecation. The lesson on deprecation is taught by the fact that the word 'Pandavas' remains unqualified, whereas Duryodhana is called a prince. &lt;br&gt;
iv. Prashansa, praise. The lesson on this is taught by the phrase 'drawn up in battle array', which expresses the dignity of the army. &lt;br&gt;
v. Samshaya, doubt. 'Approached his master' gives a lesson on doubt, because the master is always approached in order to remove doubt. &lt;br&gt;
vi. Vidhi, precept. As explained earlier, the lesson on this is given by 'seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. &lt;br&gt;
vii. Parakriya the action of an individual. The whole verse is concerned with Duryodhana's action: 'seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. &lt;br&gt;
viii. Purakalpa, past events. The lesson on this is given by drawn up in battle array'. &lt;br&gt;
ix. Vyavadharana kalpana, meaning according to context. The word 'then' teaches this lesson. &lt;br&gt;
x. Upamana-comparison. This helps to gain knowledge of a thing by comparison with another well-known object. The lesson on upamana is given by the word 'prince', used with reference to Duryodhana. 

It is important to note that the practice of Transcendental Meditation spontaneously fulfils the quest of Karma Mimansa for action in accordance with dharma. Transcendental Meditation brings the mind to the state of Being. Being is eternal; It forms the basis of creation and therefore upholds the entire universe. When the mind gains the state of Being, it simultaneously gains the level of dhanna. Therefore action by a mind held in Being is automatically in accordance with dharma. Transcendental meditation thus brings fulfillment to the teaching of Karma Mimansa. 

VEDANTA 

Vedanta means end of the Veda, final knowledge of the Veda. The system of Vedanta is also known as Uttara Mimansa, meaning that it is an investigation into the last chapter of the Veda, the Upanishads. Whereas Jaimini's Karma Mimansa, or Purva (earlier) Mimansa as it is sometimes known, considers that portion of the Veda which is concerned with action, Vyasa's Uttara (later) Mimansa, or Vedanta, considers that portion of the Veda which is concerned with knowledge. The main purpose of Vedanta is to educate man in the truth that complete knowledge of life is no other than life itself as it is lived naturally on the level of Being. 

From a cosmic standpoint, Vedanta explains the relationship of the unmanifested absolute Reality (Brahman) with the manifested relative aspect of life by introducing the principle of maya. The word maya means literally that which is not, that which does not exist. This brings to light the character of maya: it is not anything substantial. Its presence is inferred from the effects that it produces. The influence of maya may be understood by the example of sap appearing as a tree. Every fibre of the tree is nothing but the sap. Sap, while remaining sap, appears as the tree. Likewise, through the influence of maya, Brahman, remaining Brahman, appears as the manifested world. 

On the individual level, Vedanta explains the relationship of the absolute Self (Atman) and the relative aspect of individual life by the principle of avidya. Avidya, or ignorance, is nothing but maya in a coarser form. If maya can be likened to clear water, then muddy water is avidya. 

Under the influence of maya, Brahman appears as Ishvara, the personal God, who exists on the celestial level of life in the subtlest field of creation. In a similar way, under the influence of avidya, Atman appears as jiva, or individual soul. 

The lesson on Brahman is given by the word 'master' The master, possessing the whole wisdom of life, is established in brahmi-sthiti, the state of Brahman, or cosmic consciousness. 

The lesson on maya is given in this verse by the word which means 'prince' or 'king'. A rightful king Duryodhana was not. 

The lesson on Ishvara also is given by the word 'raja', or king. The king wields the highest authority on the human level. 

The lesson on Atman is given by the word 'Pandavas' The phrase 'army of the Pandavas' expresses that the Pandavas are not necessarily part of the army even though they are the masters of it. Likewise, Atman is separate from and not involved with the world of activity. 

The lesson on avidya is given by 'seeing . . . approached . . . spoke'. Avidya, or ignorance, is at the basis of all the activity of individual life. 

The lesson on jiva is taught by 'Duryodhana', of whom it is said that he saw, approached and spoke. It is the jiva which participates in activity. 

The exposition of knowledge about life in Vedanta is so perfect that the ordinary level of human intelligence is unable to comprehend it. Therefore, as a necessary pre-requisite for gaining knowledge of Vedanta, the level of consciousness must be raised. In order to become capable of understanding Vedanta, one's life must be lived on the level of the four qualities: 

1. VIVEKA (DISCRIMINATION) 

The lesson on this is taught by 'seeing the army' and 'approached his master'. It was through the power of discrimination that Duryodhana, on seeing the army, decided to approach the master and present to him the situation before finally plunging into battle. 

2. VAIRAGYA (NON-ATTACHMENT) 

The lesson on this is found in the word 'Pandavas' The Pandavas were on the battlefield, yet the expression 'army of the Pandavas' depicts them as separate from the army, as though uninvolved with it. This makes it clear that the teaching of vairagya, according to this verse, does not involve abandonment of the activities and responsibilities of life. It is enough to remain uninvolved with one's possessions. Abandonment of possessions is no criterion of non-attachment. 

3. SHATSAMPATTI (THE SIX TREASURES) 

i. Shama, control of mind. The lesson on this is given by 'seeing the army' and 'approached his master'. Had Duryodhana not possessed this quality of shama, he could not have had the presence of mind to approach and consult his master. &lt;br&gt;
ii. Dama, control of senses. The lesson on this is given by the expression 'army . . . drawn up in battle array'. The army of the senses is drawn up, capable of functioning but not yet active. This indicates that the alertness of the senses does not discredit the principle of control of the senses. &lt;br&gt;
iii. Uparati abstinence. 'Approached his master' gives a lesson on abstinence. It suggests that the path to the state of enlightenment is true abstinence, abstinence from ignorance and bondage. This word has commonly been misunderstood to mean abstinence from activity. &lt;br&gt;
The practical aspect of abstinence is transcendental meditation, because this practice is a direct way to transcendental consciousness, the state of enlightenment. After gaining transcendental consciousness by the inward stroke of meditation, the mind comes out to engage in activity. This process of repeatedly gaining transcendental consciousness and then engaging in activity results in making permanent the state of enlightenment. It is therefore clear that the teaching on uparati, or abstinence, in no way involves falling into inactivity or abandoning activity altogether. &lt;br&gt;
iv. Titiksha, endurance. The lesson on this is given by 'army . . . drawn up in battle array'. The army, whose function it is to fight, endures non-activity. The essence of endurance is to take all things as they come. &lt;br&gt;
v. Shraddha, faith. The lesson on faith is given by 'approached his master'. &lt;br&gt;
vi. Samadhana, mental equilibrium. The unmoved state of the 'master' presented in this verse gives a lesson on mental equilibrium. 

4. MUMUKSHUTVA (DESIRE FOR LIBERATION) 

The lesson on this is taught by 'approached his master'. 

This analysis of the second verse of Chapter I serves as an illustration showing that every verse of the Bhagavad-Gita is valid and its truth verifiable in the light of the six systems of Indian philosophy. At the same time it has been shown that the aims of each system are fulfilled through the practice of transcendental meditation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Interest Calculations =

Interest calculations are the relationship between time and money.
For example, what's the difference between having $1,000,000 (1 million) now, versus having it a year later? If the money could have been received earlier and invested at 10%, then you would have had an additional 100,000 dollars the next year. 

In a loan situation, you are taking money from the bank. This is money that you can spend now, so you are in effect, paying (paying the interest) to have this money on hand immediately. Conversely, when you invest, you are granting immediate money to another party, and they are paying you for this money, through interest.

In this section, we will be covering interest in depth and the different ways that interest can compound, and how it's calculated. In later sections we will cover cash flows such as payments in geometric and linear patterns.

== Terminology ==

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Principal'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The initial money amount received in a loan or spent in an investments.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Interest Rate'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The interest rate is the &quot;cost&quot; of the money, it is a percentage per period of time.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Interest Period'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;A measurement of the frequency that interest rate is applied to the current loan/investment. Typically ''Annually'', ''Semi Annually'', ''Quarterly'' or ''Monthly''.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Annually'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Interest is calculated once a year; Interest is usually calculated at the end of the year.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Semi Annually'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The interest is calculated twice a year; Typically the interest will be calculated half-way through the year, and at the end of the year.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Quarterly'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;The interest is calculated 4 times a year, or every three months.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;'''Monthly'''&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Interest is applied at the end of every month.&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

== Converting Interest Rates to different Interest Periods ==

Typically loans are given with a certain Annual interest rate, regardless of whether or not interest is calculated annually or not. 

To convert from an interest period where interest is applied once, to a semi annually (were it's applied twice), the annual interest rate is converted to a semi annual interest rate.

This is best explained with an example. Suppose the annual interest rate is 10% and is to be applied semi-annually on a loan amount of $1000, then the interest is calculated as below:

The annual interest rate: 10%
Number of semi-annual time periods in an year = 2
Therefore, semi-annual interest rate = 10/2 = 5%

Amount due at the end of the first half year = 1000*(1.05) = 1050

Amount due at the end of the second half year = 1050*(1.05) = 1102.50

Effectively you are halving the interest rate but multiplying it to to the amount twice.

Similarly, if the interest was to be applied on a quarterly basis then you would divide the annual interest rate by 4, but also multiply it to the amount 4 times.

In other words, if R is the annual interest rate, n is the number of time periods at which interest is applied then the effective rate E is given by

&lt;math&gt;E = \left(1+\frac{R}{n}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;


Bond equivenent yields (also called APR on most consumer loan documents) add these sub period rates to get an annual rate.  The actual or effective rate compounds the interest according to the periods specified in the loan documents (normally continuous, daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually).  To calc the effective rate you would add one to each of the period rates and multiply them together, then subtract one.  If all your period rates are the same length and carry the same rate you can simplify the function to the form &lt;math&gt;I=P*\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)^n-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

As an example for a quarterly 12% APR you have four compounding periods (each with 3% interest per period).  Your effective rate is (1+0.03)^4-1 or 12.55% (rounded to two decimal places). As your n approaches infinity the formula changes to P*e^r where e is a constant that is approximatly 2.71828 (it is irrational).

By convention different security types use different month and year assumptions.  A few common assumtions are actual number of months/actual days in year, 30 day months/360 day year, 30 day months/365 day year.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simple Interest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Simple interest is where interest is calculated only of the ''principal''. This will mean that the added amount of interest added during the interest period is constant throughout the duration of the transaction. 

For example if I were to take a loan of 1000 dollars at 10% interest annually. At the end of each year I would owe an addition $100 dollars, regardless of however much the loan has shrunk.

Under simple interest the final amount due can be easily calculated

&lt;math&gt;
I = (iP)N
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where&lt;br&gt;
'''I''' is the total interest due.&lt;br&gt;
'''P''' is the Principal.&lt;br&gt;
'''i''' is the interest rate.&lt;br&gt;
'''N''' is the number of times interest is applied. ie Number of Interest periods per year times number of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Final value of the transaction can be easily calculated under simple interest. Since the final value is the Principal plus the interest you get the following formula.

&lt;math&gt;
F = P + I = P + iPN = P(1 + iN)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where&lt;br&gt;
'''F''' is the final value.&lt;br&gt;
'''I''' is the total interest due.&lt;br&gt;
'''P''' is the Principal.&lt;br&gt;
'''i''' is the interest rate.&lt;br&gt;
'''N''' is the number of times interest is applied. ie Number of Interest periods per year times number of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
P = $1000&lt;BR&gt;
i = 10%&lt;BR&gt;
N = 1 year&lt;BR&gt;

Calculation Simple Interest Formula&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
F = P (1 + iN)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
F = 1000 * (1 + (10/100) * 1)
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
F = 1000 * 1.1
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
F = $1100
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Simple interest is less common than compound interest and is occasionally found in add-on loans or bonds.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Economic tablet Susa Louvre Sb3047.jpg|600x320px|Economic tablet with numeric signs and Proto-Elamite script. Clay accounting tokens, Uruk period. From the Tell of the Acropolis in Susa.]]&lt;/center&gt;{{clear}}
When we think about economics, we often think about people on the floor of the stock exchange, trading millions of dollars' worth of shares each day. Or we think of board room meetings, where rich old men (and a lot fewer women) make decisions which end up making them richer. While it is true that this plays an important part in economics, it is not its most fundamental aspect. Economics is the study of how societies meet their needs, the most basic of which are food, clothing, and shelter; the elements necessary for survival. Once a society has met these needs, it can then look towards more luxurious items, education, health care, sports cars, personal aircraft; the list is mind-boggling.

To understand the highly complex economy in which we live at the moment, we first must see how it developed through the ages. It has been said that technology has driven economic development; indeed, a certain type of technology can be linked with new economic age. Human societies have a tendency to organise the way in which it runs, and meeting its own needs is no exception. Even in a household, there is usually some kind of system as to which chores are performed by which members of the household, which member(s) provide for the resources (in terms of income to buy food, clothing and shelter), and how much of that is saved or invested.

==Hunter Gatherer Societies==
The very first human societies were hunter-gatherers, that is, they hunted for and gathered their food. Clothing was obtained in the same way, and shelter was whatever people could find; caves and trees, perhaps. It should be noted though, even in such a primitive &quot;economy&quot;, technology is necessary; basic stone-age tools such as clubs and spears allowed humans to hunt. Fire allowed humans to cook food which would otherwise be too difficult to eat, and also to ward off predators. In this society, there were really only three &quot;occupations&quot;: hunters, carers and dependents. The hunters were mostly men, and were responsible for providing the food for the society, however some women were also gatherers; picking fruits and berries. Most of the women were carers; they looked after the fire and the society in making clothes, cooking, and caring for the dependents. Dependents were almost only children; people who could be neither hunters nor carers. Very few people lived to old age to require caring for, and those with disabilities were often left to die.

==Agrarian Economy==
The technological revolution which gave rise to the Agrarian Economy was domestication and farming. Until then, people could not decide what food they consumed; they had to eat whatever they could find. With farming, societies learned to control the types of products they would consume in a much more efficient way. Domesticating animals meant that meat; a food normally very difficult to come by; could now be obtained much more easily. As people no longer needed to roam about, they could afford to invest more resources into their dwellings; and correspondingly, houses became more sophisticated. Farming also brought humans closer together, and with the higher numbers of people, more needed to be organized. A very primitive form of ''labor division'' had begun; whereby people specialized in producing one commodity. Whereas before, a hunter was a hunter and a carer was a carer, now one could afford to grow only wheat, because he could trade it with someone else for meat, and so on. In some of these economies, a system of [[w:currency|currency]] began to develop, however the most widespread method of trade was through [[w:barter|barter]].

==Gift Economy==
In the traditional form of commerce, goods are exchanged for goods deemed of equal value by the parties involved in the trade.  In a gift economy, actors bestow lavish gifts upon others, not for a specific material return, but for the goodwill generated or status earned as a result.  

==Slave Labour==
Slave labour was a key element in the development of many countries. It can be considered an economic system because it fulfills the needs of the society. However, the standard assumption of self ownership (see information on John Locke and others) is violated leading most to reject this system from principle.  The slave-owners want to produce a certain commodity, and they do it through the cheapest way they can. They buy slaves and use them to produce their commodity, giving them no more than is necessary to protect their investment.  When prices of slaves are cheap relative to the output from gang labor, this can amount to just enough to survive (food, clothing and shelter). In this way, slavery is profitable to the owners while the slaves live on less than they would demand if exchange were voluntary. It helped the investors to look for new forms of investing options. As they do not need to worry about the needs of the slaves. The positive effect of it is that it framed for the collectivity of wealth and for ideals of economic principles like mass production and reusability.

== Feudalism ==
Feudalism is yet another economic system which is historically significant; in that it was the primary state of economy in much of the world for many hundreds of years. Feudalism is a hierarchical system where the majority of the labour power is dedicated to producing food; that being the peasants or serfs. A proportion of that produce is taken by the local nobility, that controls and governs by heritage the land and any peasants residing in it ([[w:Feudalism|Feudalism]]), or at times in a smaller scale to the lord of the manor usually holding his position in return for undertakings offered to a higher lord ([[w:Manorialism|Manorialism]]). These in return, provides the serfs with land to live on, shelter, and defense against external dangers. It is still an unjust system in that there is a highly wealthy class living next to an extremely poor class, but it was the standard way of life for many people throughout the Middle Ages.

==Mercantilism==
Mercantilism is an ideology that dominated post-Feudalism Europe, especially the colonial period. It was heavily based on protectionism, and promoted the acquiring of captive markets. This lead to the colonial powers (England, Spain, France, etc.) that dominated the world stage for hundreds of years.

==Industrial Economy==
A direct result from the industrial revolution, that not only permitted the mass production of goods but the reduction of costs in the consumption of most goods that previously had to be hand crafted and limited in numbers. Most handcrafted production moved to luxury goods and the industrialization opened way to production many production methodology, the economy of scale, the production in series, to the just in time consumption in production resources. 

A side result of industrialization was that labor also became less specialized and therefore less costly, as a trade-off energy prices and consumption increased and easy portable and accessible fuel gained importance.

Waste management and ecological considerations can also be seen as factors to consider when talking about industrial economy, as they have become a new factor in establishing cost when establishing an industrial economy.

==Communist Economy==
When the word &quot;[[w:Communism|Communist]]&quot; is used, it is often shrouded in fear and mystery and misunderstanding, especially in countries involved in the [[w:Cold War|Cold War]] in particularly in the United States, that still is the primarily example for [[w:Capitalism|Capitalism]]. Put simply, it is an economic system where supposedly, economic decisions are made by the community as a whole; that is the entire community. However, most interpretations of the word or attempts to establish communism have ended up creating state-driven authoritarian economies and regimes which benefit single party political élite who are not accountable to the people at all.

Command Planned Economy

An economy characterized by Command Planning is notable for several distinguishing features. These are:

1. Collective or State Ownership of Capital:

Capital resources such as money, property and other physical assets are owned by the State. There is none (or very little) private ownership;

2. Inputs and Outputs are Determined by the State:

Typically, in a Command Planning economic system, the state has an elaborate planning mechanism in place which determines the level and proportions of inputs to be devoted to producing goods and services. Local planning authorities are handed 1 year, 5 year, 10 year or, in the case of China, up to 25 year plans. The local authorities then implement these plans by meeting with State Owned Enterprises, whereby, further plans are developed specific to the business. Inputs are allocated according to the plans, and, output targets are set;

3. Labor is allocated according to State Plans:

In a command planning economy there is no choice in whom you work for. From a very early age, when a child is in school, a streaming system allocates people into designated industries. If you test well at a young age you may be able to score a good job in an intellectual area, such as working in academia, or working for the bureaucracy - which in a command planning economy is massive as enormous organizational resources are needed to research, design and implement plans. If you are unlucky enough to test poorly when you are a young child, you may be streamed into working in an industry that is not to your liking, such as dull factory work, or basket weaving. 

In this respect command planning differs substantially from free-market capitalism, such as countries like the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand (amongst others) experience. In such countries, there is no legal compulsion or government direction regarding a person's choice of employment. Irrespective of any government policy or directive, workers in free-market capitalist countries are free to compete with and against each other for jobs that are given based on the merits of the applicant.  Additionally in this type of market, if a worker is unhappy with the particular line of work they are in, they are free to look elsewhere for employment.  Workers are free to plan their own careers, switch jobs and careers as necessary to fulfill personal needs or goals, often using adult education to re-train for different careers.

4. Private Ownership is Not Possible:

Command Planning economies do not have any form of private ownership. Therefore, under a command planning system an individual cannot own shares, own real estate, or any other form of physical or non-physical asset. People are allocated residences by the State, and, this is usually done considering where and for whom you will be working for. 

5. Prices and Paying for Goods and Services:

Prices are regulated entirely by the State, generally having only passing regard for the actual costs of production, but usually instead, having no regard for cost. Often a currency does not exist in a command planning economy, and, when it does its main purpose is for accounting.

Instead of paying for goods and services, as and when you need to buy them, you are allocated goods and services. This is often also called rationing.

In western democratic and capitalist societies the price mechanism is a fundamental operator in allocating resources. The laws of demand and supply interact, with the price of goods and services sending signals to producers and consumers alike as to what should be produced and in what quantities, and, what will be demanded and in what quantities. 

The law of demand states that the higher the price of a good or service the less the amount of that good or service will be consumed. In other words, the quantity of a good or service demanded, rises when the price falls and, falls when the price increases.

Similarly, and in consequential opposition to the law of demand, the law of supply states that the higher the price of a good or service the greater the amount of that good or service, will be supplied to the market by a producer. In other words, a higher price attracts more producers to supply a greater amount to market.

This interaction occurs without any government intervention, and, in western democratic societies in which this system has operated for hundreds of years, it has been shown that the less government intervention, the greater the allocative efficiency of resources in the economy. This is not withstanding the need to enforce contracts in a functional legal system, uphold human and individual rights, and the provision of services and goods where the private market is unwilling or unable to supply, or, it simply isn't logical to supply in any other way.

6. Incentive Effects:

In a command planning economy there are none, if any, incentive effects to work harder, improve production techniques, and increase productivity and efficiency. In capitalist economic systems, it is this incentive to do well for ourselves, that generates harder work, creative solutions, enterprise, efficiency and productivity improvement. 

It is not, therefore, incidental that it is this incentive effect that is responsible for the economic growth of the western world in the post world war II era, and the tremendous increase in standards of living that have been enjoyed by most of us in the western world.

Examples of the Types of Command Planning Economies:

The best example which springs to mind when thinking of command planning economic systems is the former USSR, known as the Soviet Union. North Korea in the present, modern-day era is perhaps another example, although this is a not-quite good enough case, as North Korea is heavily supported by the rest of the world - in particular China. China itself, used to be considered a Command Economy, however, in the 70s and 80s, and more dramatically in the 90's, China is generally considered to be Market Socialist in terms of its Economic Classification. They still have Socialist policies, but, markets do operate - apparently successfully enough to generate a surplus balance of trade with virtually every western country. 

It is now generally thought that China's turn towards capitalism will make it the sole economic powerhouse of this century. This is happening because, unlike western economies, China is producing hundreds of thousands of very highly educated people in areas such as science, engineering and technology.

==Service Economy==
[[File:Societal development.png|700x320px|center|thumb|This is a diagram of societal development that encapsulates the stage of human development: hunter/gatherer, pastoralist/horticulturalist, agrarian, industrial, and post-industrial. It also ties those stage of development to the important consequences of societal development, namely: surplus, denser populations, specialization, and inequality.]]

==Cyber-Economy==
As internet access spread into homes and businesses, more people communicated with each other around the world. These new interactions promoted new businesses and commercial relationships, and soon many existing businesses created their own spaces (webpages) online to advertise their products and services. Banking functions increased as security measures improved. Banks and businesses collaborated with software engineers to establish secure electronic commercial tools such as checkout systems, shopping carts, and auctions that offered safer online commerce. The amount and nature of business transactions expanded, and today this activity is called &quot;e-commerce&quot; or the &quot;cyber economy&quot;.

==Experience Economy==


==Economic Models for the Future?==


=== The Creative Economy ===

The post-information age is giving rise to the creative economy, in which intrinsic human talents that cannot yet be duplicated by machines begin to dominate.  In such an economy, the value of human labor lies in its creative output, rather than purely its productive output.

=== The Relationship Economy ===

An economic system in which one's personal connectivity and integrity determine their wealth, prosperity and success.  Such a system is made possible by the internet and populism as a means of building a globally-connected consciousness and series of values.

''For supreme happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is deep in peace, in whom the spur to activity is stilled, who is without blemish and has become one with Brahman.'' &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt; 
''Đểcho hạnhphúc tốithượng đến với người yogi whose mind is deep in peace, in whom the spur to activity is stilled, who is without blemish and has become one with Brahman.'' &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
# The Lord made a similar statement about supreme happiness in the 21st verse; but from the 24th verse He has been intent upon describing the method by which supreme happiness is to be attained. During meditation the mind, as it experiences the finer aspects of the object of meditation, eventually transcends even the subtlest experience, and then there is no activity. This is what the Lord means when He says that the 'spur to activity' (rajas) 'is stilled'. This is the field of the Transcendent, the state of pure consciousness, stainless, sinless. Here the individual mind ceases to be; it gains the status of divine intelligence. Having gone beyond the limits of an individual mind's wanting and desiring, it is fully established in deep peace and attains supreme happiness. 
# The faculty of experience becomes extinct when the mind loses its individuality. The state of Being knows no knowing; it is a state that transcends all knowing or experiencing. But if this is so, how can it be said that the mind experiences supreme happiness? First, it should be noted that the Lord uses the word 'upaiti', which means 'comes to'; the word 'experiences' is not used. However, even if the word 'experiences' were used, it could be regarded as valid. The mind does have the ability to experience When it is on the verge of transcending, at the junction of relativity and the Absolute It is at this point that the mind experiences the nature of absolute bliss-consciousness. This has been brought out in the Upanishads, where it is stated specifically that Reality is experienced by the mind alone. Experience of Reality by the mind is always at the junction-point: while it is about to transcend at the end of the inward stroke of meditation, and while coming out of transcendence at the start of the outward stroke of meditation. 
# 'Deep in peace': see verses 7, 14 and 15 of this chapter and verses 70 and 71 of Chapter II. The Lord means peace that is not overshadowed even by activity, the eternal peace that is gained when one 'sees inaction in action' (IV, 18); 'the supreme peace' (IV, 39); 'lasting peace' (V, 12). 
# The nature of the 'spur to activity' (rajas) was explained in the commentary on verse 45 of Chapter II 
# 'Who is without blemish': who is established in the absolute purity of Being, completely separate from the field of activity. His actions being completely in accordance with the laws of nature,' they are free from blemish. 
# 'Has become one with Brahman': has gained cosmic consciousness. 
# It is interesting to see how this one verse describes both the state of cosmic consciousness itself and the path by which it is reached. It makes clear that supreme happiness is gained in cosmic consciousness and that there are three pre-requisites to gaining it: the mind must be 'deep in peace', 'the spur to activity' must be 'stilled' and one must be 'without blemish'. 
# The teachings of the three previous verses, which have defined in detail the nature of the path to cosmic consciousness, are represented by individual phrases in this verse. 'Mind is deep in peace' refers to verse 24; 'in whom the spur to activity is stilled' refers to verse 25; 'who is without blemish' refers to verse 26.

      <text xml:space="preserve">PREFACE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a book of revival for the age. If the golden era is ever to dawn on human society, if peace and harmony are to reign on earth, The Science of Being and Art of Living will provide a free way for it to come. A new humanity will be born, fuller in conception and richer in experience and accomplishments in all fields. Joy of life will belong to every man, love will dominate human society, truth and virtue will reign in the world peace on earth will be permanent and all will live in fulfilment, in fullness of life in God-consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is the exception that disproves the rule spelled out in the
familiar line: East is East and West is West and never the twain shall
meet. For this book furnishes not only a meeting ground - a point
of entry for the mutual understanding: of two heritages and cultures,
it formulates a method for each to enter into, complement and enrich
the other, to the immediate and practical benefit of both and to the
ultimate enrichment of all mankind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this sounds an extraordinary statement, it is only because the
subject matter itself is extraordinary. The West has long accepted as
a fact the spiritual wisdom of the East, but pretty much on faith and
without any wide understanding of the true meaning of this wisdom.
Even by those scholars whose studies have brought them a degree
of familiarity, the East's spiritual wisdom has been largely acknowledged 
as the province of the monkish ascetic, the holy scholar, who
lives apart and shuns all but the most necessary contact with the everyday 
world. Thus the West has been apt to regard eastern religious
and mystical teaching as something which, while undoubtedly
profound, authentic, perhaps even close to the root answers to questions 
posed by all men, was still essentially a museum piece to be
viewed under glass and of little practical worth to westem man who
has to live in the world deal with its problems and meet the responsibilities 
which it thrust upon him. For westerners teachings which
counselled withdrawal from the world and its temptations might
be studied as curiosities, but they offered no real possibility of application 
as a creed to be lived or followed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here lies the distinction and significance of this work. It contains
the essence of Indian spiritual learning, teaching and wisdom: the
heritage of India's imperishable tradition of Masters. It formulates
a method by which any man - all men - may enter this same heritage,
discover its riches and harvest its rewards. The method requires no
departure from westem living or ways, but promises enhancement
of the individual's capacity to know, to achieve, to live and to worship
at the altar of his own chosen faith. The teaching of this book is not
limited to any one faith, it deals with the essential truth which underlies 
all faiths and its message may be lived by Men of all creeds, for
its teaching is inconsistent with none.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was written to fill a void - the need of men everywhere - and
as the result of increasing insistence by those who had come into
contact with the wisdom of His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
The full sweep of his teaching is disclosed by the book's title: The
Science of Being and Art of Living. The choice of words is deliberate
and provocative, for one seldom equates science with spiritual teaching. 
Yet the system on which Maharishi's teaching is based - a
simple method of transcendental meditation (a much misunderstood
word in the West, but one which implies simply a means of communication 
with the infinite) - is indeed systematic and produces
measurable and predictable results and is therefore scientific But the
product of this science is realisation and fulfilment in the art of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key to this knowledge has long been held by the Masters
in India and it was long supposed to be their exclusive perhaps
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;obscure province. Surely not, however. Surely God's teaching is
for all who will hear it. So says Maharishi Mahesh Yogi; and his
book is addressed to all who will read and act on it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To know Maharishi and to be in his presence is to realise at once
that here is a man who stands apart from other men, one who truly
knows God and lives the earthly personification of highest human
attainment. In this he is the direct heir of the tradition of India's
great Masters. He was the close and favoured disciple of a Master
possessing extraordinary human qualities, His Divinity Swami
Brahmananda Saraswati, the most illustrious of the Jagadguru
Shankaracharyas of India. Dr. Rhadakrishnan, the world-famous
philosopher who is now President of India, addressed him as Vedanta
Incarnate, and poets spoke of him as personified Divinity. It was at the
feet of this great Master that Maharishi spent thirteen years acquiring
the wisdom that he now freely gives to the world.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was in Madras, in 1958, that Maharishi founded the spiritual
Regeneration Movement with the aim of spiritually regenerating
every man in the world. Since then, in this short time, he has become
known and revered throughout Asia, Europe and North America.
He has chosen the ancient pilgrimage town of Rishikesh, on the Ganges 
River at the foot of the Himalayas, as the site of the academy of
Meditation and the world headquarters of the Spiritual Regeneration
Movement. There, each spring for three months, Maharishi trains
people from all parts of the world to be teachers of his system of
meditation. Also each year, in secluded places in Europe, North
America and India, groups of people gather with Maharishi for
intensive training in the art of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maharishi's plan of action and aim embrace the whole world.
It is his stated objective to redirect the course of humanity by means
of the widest possible propagation of the knowledge and practice
of transcendental meditation. To this end, centres of meditation have
been established in the major cities of most countries of the world.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world has known its share of conquerors by force of anger.
Relatively few have conquered with love, bringing to the conquered
peace and plenty rather than the suffering and privation which follow
in the wake of war. Maharishi is a man of peace, but one whose
dynamic teaching may well overpower the possibility of conquest
by physical force. For Maharishi brings to all those who desire it a
direct way to reach the peace which lies within all men; to each man
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;path by which to find the kingdom within himself which Christ
and every great prophet knew and described. A man who has discovered 
this path and who walks it, radiates this peace; it fills the atmosphere 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;around him and communicates itself to all who come in
contact with him. A nation or society which discovers and treads this
same path would radiate this to the world. Then truly would man
have found the golden age he has long and painfully sought.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That we are on the threshold of just such a possibility, even probability 
- is the electrifying implication of this book and the (divine
hope that it offers to us. For those who are fortunate enough to read
this book, to take up its challenge and experience this path through
the subtle technique of transcendental meditation, the hope will
flower into reality the only and eternal reality.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CHARLES F. LUTES
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Science of Being and Art of Living is the summation of the
practical wisdom of integrated life advanced by the Vedic Rishis of
ancient India, understood in the light of scientific thinking in the present 
day western world.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It presents a philosophy of life in fulfilment and offers a practice
suitable for all men everywhere to glorify all aspects of their day-to-day 
life. It deals with the fundamentals of all problems of life and
suggests one solution to eradicate all suffering.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book presents a practical thesis to satisfy man's search for
truth through science, religion and metaphysical thought. It offers the
principle of a practical technique to enable all men to harmonise their
inner spiritual content with the glories of the outer material life and
to find their God within themselves.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science explores the actuality of forms and phenomena. All the
branches of science are the various ways to realise the truth of existence.
Each of them starts from the obvious known and aims at investigating 
the hidden unknown. The ultimate truth of life is being
approached from all directions. All the sciences are exploring the various
strata of creation. from the gross to the subtle fields of existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science of being, like every other science, starts its investigation 
into the truth of existence from the gross, obvious level of life
and enters into the subtle regions of experience. The science of being,
however, eventually transcends these subtle regions and arrives at
the direct experience of the transcendental field of eternal Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science of being is a deep and practical philosophy of life. It
is a systematic investigation into the true nature of the ultimate reality.
Although, like any other science, it is theoretical in its nature, its applied
aspects, however, reach much farther horizons of the supreme reality
of life than those of abstract metaphysical speculations.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is divided into four parts : Science of Being, Life,
The Art of Living, and Fulfilment. The last three parts of the book present 
the most practical wisdom of day-to-day life, and this practical
wisdom is based on the deep philosophical significance contained
in the first section on the science of being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science of being: provides a sound basis for the art of living
As a matter of fact, the art of living is the applied science of being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To those who have never had any interest in metaphysical study,
the section The Science of Being may at first appears to be highly abstract. 
But when they come to read the section Life and The Art of
Living and have completed Fulfilment, they will find that without
dwelling on the abstract features of the science of being the whole
wisdom of the book world have no practical basis.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gardener has to have a knowledge of the unseen root of the
tree before he can supply proper nourishment at different stages of
its growth. Likewise a man in the practical field of life must frrst be
given a good understanding of the fundamental reality that lies in the
field of abstract Being in order that he may glorify the whole of the
rest of life. That is why The Science of Being is placed frrst in this
book, and the parts of practical value follow.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word science comes from the Latin root scire, to know. It
means knowledge; systematised knowledge is science. The science
of being means systematised knowledge of Being, systematised
knowledge of existence or the actualitY of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The field of Being, or absolute existence, was for many centuries
considered in terms of mysticism. The present scientific age hesitates
to assign value to anything shrouded in the garb of mysticism, and
that is why the study of Being, the absolute field of creation, has not
been a part of any branch of science until now.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The growth of scientific thinking in the present generation has
brought Being to the level of scientific study and scrutiny. The present 
work is the frrst of its kind in the long history of human thought.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A systematic method has been developed that enables an individual 
to experience directly the pure state of Being. It is done by Consciously 
entering into the experience of the subtle strata of a thought
eventually arriving at the direct experience of the subtlest state of the
thought and then arriving at the very source of thought. Then the
conscious mind attains the pure state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science of being which gives rise to the practical art of living
is a science which is much more valuable for human life than all the
sciences known so far. For up to now the basis of all the sciences has
been the human mind functioning from a limited field of consciousness, 
or limited potential the conscious mind. The science of being
embodies the principle of transcendental meditation to enlarge the
conscious capacity of the mind to the maximum, and thereby provides 
not only the basis for great expansion of knowledge in every
field of science, but also a direct way to fulfilment in any sphere of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For all this knowledge my indebtedness is to my Master, His
Divinity Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, Jagadguru Bhagwan Shankaracharya, 
the main source of inspiration and the guiding light of
all my activities.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This writing has many pleasant memories associated with it.
Henry Nyburg, head of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in
Europe, long ago expressed the need for such a book. And Charles
F. Lutes, President of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in the
United States, made it possible for me to have a few weeks of silence,
away from the incessant activity of public life, so that I could at
least speak my thoughts on to tapes.The recordings were transcribed
and put into the form of this book. For this reason it may read more
as the spoken word than as a written composition.

SCIENTIFIC REALITY
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physical sciences inform us that the whole of creation is built up
of layers of energy, one inside the other. The subtlest constitutes the
innermost stratum of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a time when physics was governed by two fundamental
laws: conservation of energy and conservation of matter. Neither
energy nor matter could be created or destroyed the total amounts
were separately conserved. At that time the atom was considered
to be the smallest particle of matter, basically unchangeable and
indestructible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The advent of the theory of relativity brought about a profound
change in these ideas. Matter was just another form of energy and
not separately conserved. Matter could be created out of the energy
of radiation and matter could again be 'destroyed' and transformed
into energy of radiation, but the total amount of energy in all forms
always remained the same. Thus the whole creation was built up
out of indestructible energy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the idea of indivisible atoms had to be further revised. 
Nuclear physicists found that all atoms were made up of
just a few elementary particles, the stable proton and electron and the
unstable neutron. These particles represent a more subtle, elemental
level than the atom.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last few years our knowledge of the number of elementary
particles has increased rapidly; more and more unstable particles have
been discovered. Physics now faces the situation when even these
particles can no longer be considered elementary. Instead, the physicists
are on the search for even more subtle states of matter, which in turn
are the constituents of the present day elementary particles. Thus, the
search of physics is directed toward ever subtler states of matter or
energy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the physical world, which we shall call the relative or the relative 
field of existence, several forms of energy are known. These
forms are eternally changing into one another, according to the laws
of physics.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The search of physics leads the scientists to think that there might
exist some fundamental form of energy, which is absolutely stable
and more subtle than any other form of energy. The relative would
then arise as perturbations of this absolute energy, and all forms of
physical energy would be manifestations of this absolute state of
unmanifested energy. This is the source of all matter and energy.
It may be found to be too subtle to be known by physics. Even
thought-energy is too subtle to be measured by present-day physics.
Clearly, every thought has a process involving energy. The existence
of long-distance thought transmission, although not an ordinary
phenomenon, confirms the concept of thought-energy
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basis of thought-energy we call the state of Being. Thus,
Being and the Absolute are synonymous.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing knowledge of physics in the subtle strata of creation has
advanced man's ability far beyond his imagination of a few decades
ago.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As our knowledge of the fine strata of matter and energy increases
through the discoveries of the physical sciences, we gain all the advantages 
of that knowledge. Our life becomes more comprehensive,
more powerful, more useful, our aspirations also increase, and we
become more creative and more fulfilled. With the knowledge of the
ultimate basis of creation the absolute energy, man's civilisation on
earth will reach unthought of glory.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As physics continues to explore the finer strata of these finer particles 
it is bound to strike against the unmanifested aspect of existence
which lies beyond the subtlest aspect of an energy particle - the field
of Being. This is how science is certain to declare Being a scientific
reality. It is only a matter of time. But however long it may be before 
physicists of some future generation declare Being to lie at the
extreme limit of science, man should not remain deprived of the direct
experience of that reality of existence which forms the very basis of
life and whose realisation glorifies life in all its aspects.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHAT IS BEING?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Underneath the subtlest layer of all that exists in the relative field
is the abstract, absolute field of pure Being, which is unmanifested
and transcendental. It is neither matter nor energy. It is pure Being,
the state of pure existence. This state of pure existence underlies all
that exists. Everything is the expression of this pure existence Or
absolute Being which is the essential constituent of all relative life.
The one eternal, unmanifested, absolute Being manifests itself in
many forms of lives and existences in creation.
BEING, THE ULTIMATE REALITY OF CREATION
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question arises, then, how can we understand Being in terms
of all the different aspects of life with which we are familiar? How
can we know Being in terms of the world, and what its relationship is
with the world of forms and phenomena in which we live?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How can we distinguish existence from that which exists?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Existence is abstract, that which exists is concrete.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may say that existence is life itself, while that which exists
is the ever-changing phenomenal phase of the never-changing reality
of existence. Existence is the abstract basis of life on which is built
the concrete structure of life, which encompasses all aspects of the individual 
body, mind thinking, speaking, acting, behaving, experiencing 
and influencing surroundings, and all aspects of cosmic existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life expresses itself in different modes of living. That which is
lived is the expression of life ; that which exists is the expression of
existence. That which is, is the expression of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Existence, life or Being is the unmanifested reality of all that exists,
lives or is. Being is the ultimate reality of all that was, is or will be.
It is eternal and unbounded, the basis of all the phenomenal existence
of cosmic life. It is the source of all time, space and causation. It is the
be-all and end-all of existence, the all-pervading eternal field of the
almighty creative intelligence. I am That eternal Being, thou art
That and all this is in its essential nature That eternal Being .
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is life, It is existence.To be is to live, to exist. Being, or existence,
finds expression in the different aspects of living : thinking, speaking,
doing, experiencing, feeling. All aspects of life have their basis in Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The knowledge of Being as the ultimate and essential constituent
of creation raises all aspects of life to the unbounded status of absolute 
existence. Relative life gains more of the absolute status and as
a result, stability and permanence increase in the relative field.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Energy, intelligence and creativity rise to their limitless value,
and the limited individual life gains the status of unlimited cosmic
existence. This is the glory of the knowledge that Being is the ultimate 
reality of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience shows that Being is bliss-consciousness, the source of
all thinking, of all existing creation. It lies beyond relative existence,
where the experiencer or mind is left awake in full awareness of
itself without the experience of any object. The conscious mind reaches
the state of pure consciousness, which is the source of all thinking.
The almighty creative intelligence of the Absolute is the source of all
intelligence. Being is the source of all power. It is the source of all
nature and of the natural laws which maintain the different forms and
phenomena in creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The essential nature of Being is absolute bliss-consciousness '.
Without knowledge of its basis , absolute bliss-consciousness, life is like a building without a foundation. All relative life without the conscious basis of Being is like a ship without a rudder, ever at the mercy of the tossing sea. It is like a dry leaf on the ground left to the mercy of the wind, drifting aimlessly any direction in which the wind takes it. The life of the individual without the realisation of Being is baseless meaningless and fruitless.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is the basis of life, that which gives it meaning and makes it fruitful. Being is the living: presence of God, the reality of life. It is
eternal truth. It is the Absolute in eternal freedom.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE OMNIPRESENCE OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been said that Being is the ultimate reality of creation and
that It is present in all strata of creation. It is present in all forms,
words, smells, tastes and objects of touch, in everything experienced,
in the senses of perception and organs of action, in all phenomena;
in the doer and the work done, in all directions - north, south, east
and west; in all times - past, present and future; It is uniformly present. 
It is present in front of man, behind him to the left and right of
him, above him, below him and in him. Everywhere and in all
circumstances Being, the essential constituent of creation, permeates
everything. It is the omnipresent God for those who know and understand 
It, feel It and live It in their lives.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The whole of creation is the field of consciousness in different forms
and phenomena. Consciousness is the radiation from the centre of
pure Being. For example, electric current reaches the bulb and radiates 
as a beam of light. As the beam proceeds further from its source,
its intensity diminishes until it reaches a point where the light may
be said to be nil. Likewise, from the inexhaustible battery of Being,
bliss-consciousness radiates and as it proceeds further from its source
its intenslty diminishes. In this way bliss-consciousness appears in all
the subtle and gross forms of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those whose hearts and minds are not cultured, whose vision is
held by what is gross, only see the surface value of life. They only find
qualities of matter and energy. They do not find the innocent, everpresent, omnipresent Being, the soft presence of which is beyond
any relative degree of softness. They do not enjoy almighty Being
in Its innocent, never-changing status which lies beyond the obvious
phase of the forms and phenomena of matter and energy, mind and
individuality
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pure Being is of transcendental nature because of Its status as the
essential constituent of the universe. It is finer than the finest in creation. 
It is not Its nature to be exposed to the senses, which are formed
primarily to give experience only of the manifested reality of life.
And It is not obviously exposed to the perception of the mind, because 
the mind is for the most part connected with the senses. The
constitution of the mind is such that for any experience it has to associate 
itself with the senses and contact the outer world of forms and
phenomena.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience shows that Being is the essential, basic nature of the
mind. But since the mind ordinarily remains attuned to the senses,
projecting outwards towards the manifested realms of creation, it
misses or fails to appreciate its own essential nature, just as the eyes
are unable to see themselves. Everything but the eyes themselves can
be seen through the eyes. Similarly, everything is based on the essential 
nature of the mind which is omnipresent Being; and yet, while
the mind is engaged in the projected field of manifested diversity,
Being is not appreciated by the mind, although It is its very basis and
essential constituent. Being is at the root of everything, yet it is as if
It supports the existence of life and creation without exposing Itself.
The great dignity the great splendour of Its innocent, almighty,
omnipresent nature is present in man as the basis of ego, intellect,
mind, senses, body and surroundings. But It is not obvious even though
It underlies all creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is like a powerful businessman who is rarely found in the actual
place of business, who remains unseen and yet effectively controls
everything. To see him it is necessary to meet him in seclusion, far
from the main activity of the business scene. Likewise the Controller of the universe, influencing everything, remaining at the basis of all universal activity and phenomenal life, dwells in the silent chamber of the heart of everyone and everything.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the omnipresence of Being which is responsible for hiding Its nature in seclusion, away from the market place of the world. It is the omnipresence of Being which is responsible for hiding Being behind the scenes and giving It the status of the omniscient, omnipotent,
supreme Lord of the universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lord of the universe dwells kindly in the heart of everyone to see that no one suffers. To maintain the flow of unlimited love, happiness and evolution of everyone, the omnipresent Lord of the universe is so kind that He abides naturally in everything. No one Can possibly remove himself from Him. It is the omnipresence of Being which is life eternal, the essence of eternal life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEING, THE FIELD OF ETERNAL LIFE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the omnipresent, essential constituent of creation , Being lies
at the root of everything, beyond all relative existence, beyond all
forms and phenomena. Because It has Its pure and full status in the
Transcendent, It lies beyond the realm of time, space and causation,
the boundaries of the ever-changing, phenomenal field of creation.
Being enjoys, always has and always will enjoy the status of Its absolute 
purity. It enjoys the status which knOWS nO change, the status
of eternal life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolute Being and Its relationship with the relative universe Can
be understood by an example. Being is like the limitless ocean, silent
and ever the same. The different aspects of creation all forms and
phenomena and the ever-changing states of life in the world are aS
ripples and waves, having their basis in this vast OCean.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eternal ocean of Being can be conceived of in this way with
the difference that the pure status of the ocean of Being lies beyond
all relative existence. It is the unlimited vastness of pure existence or
pure consciousness, the essential constituent and content of life. It is
the field of the unlimited, the unbounded, eternity, pure intelligence,
pure existence, the Absolute.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In concluding that Being is the field of eternal life, it is significant 
to mention here that the ever-changing, phenomenal phases of daily
life can be supplemented with the unlimited power of the eternal life
of Being. This practical aspect is dealt with in later chapters.
BEING, THE BASIS OF LIVING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Living comprises our day-to-day activity. Being, which is the
essential constituent of creation at the basis of all activity, lies in the
field of the Absolute. Being forms the basic source of all individual
activity, and in It and by It activity is sustained in all the complex
and diversified fields of day-to-day life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know that our life starts with breathing and thinking, and
we shall see in later chapters how unmanifested, transcendental Being
manifests Itself first in the form of prana2 and mind3 (breathing and
thinking)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activity depends upon thinking. We must think first before doing
anything. We rarely consider, however, upon what our thinking
depends. Thinking is the basis of doing; what is the basis of thinking:'
To think, we have at least to be. Being is the basis of thinking, and
thinking is the basis of doing. Being is the basis of all living. Just as
without sap there would be no root and no tree, so also without Being
there would be no thinking and no doing. There would be no living
without Being. If we take care of the sap the whole tree will flourish.
Similarly, if we take care of Being the whole field of thinking and
doing will flourish. The whole field of life can be glorified by consciously 
taking care of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore we find Being at the basis of all activity, behaviour and
the various ways and forms Of living. Being is the most glorious,
most precious and most laudable basis of all living. Being is the plane
of cosmic law, the basis of all the laws of nature, which lies at the root
of all creation and evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is possible to glorify all fields of life and living by consciously
infusing the nature of Being into all the different fields of activity and
behaviour.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unbounded field of Being ranges from the unmanifested, absolute
eternal state to the gross, relative, ever-changing states of
phenomenal life in the same way as the ocean ranges from eternal
silence at its bottom to the great activity of perpetually moving waves
on the surface. One extremity is eternally silent, never-changing in its
nature, the other is active and ever-changing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both these states, the relative and the absolute, are the states of
Being. Being is eternal, never-changing in Its absolute state and eternally
ever-changing in Its relative states. Remaining ever in Its omnipresent,
absolute status, It is found to be in the ever-changing phases
of phenomenal existence and relative creation. The entire field of
life, from the individual to the cosmos, is nothing but the expression
of eternal, absolute, never-changing, omnipresent Being in the relative,
ever-changing phases of existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An example will illustrate the nature of Being in a more comprehensive
manner. An oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom in one state
show the properties of gas, in another they combine and exhibit the
properties of water, and in yet another they have the properties of
solid ice. The essential content of gas, water and ice is the same but it
changes in its properties. Even though the properties of gas, water and
ice are quite dissimilar, the essential constituents H and O are always
the same.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the oxygen and hydrogen, remaining in their never-changing
states, are found exhibiting different qualities, so also Being, remaining
in Its never-changing, eternal, absolute character, is found expressing
Itself in the different forms and phenomena of diverse creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is a statement which, to some scientifically minded people,
might seem to contradict the established theories of physical science.
Albert Einstein propounded the theory of relativity and said that
everything in the universe is relative and the existence of different
worlds and forms and phenomena can only be accounted for in terms
of relativity. But here we have made a statement which says that the
Absolute, remaining the never-changing Absolute, expresses Itself
in the ever-changing, relative states of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are these two statements consistent? Yes. When Einstein says that
all that exists in the universe can be understood only in terms of relativity, 
he is right, since his theory of relativity concerns itself only
with the manifested field of creation, which is the realm of physical
science.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his attempts to establish scientifically the unified field theory,
Einstein seems to have been clearly aware of the possibility of one
basis for all diversity, one common denominator for all the multiplicity 
of creation. He was at least trying to establish one constant as
the basis of all relative existence. If physical science should arrive at
that conclusion which Einstein was trying to pinpoint with his unified
field theory, one constant would be established as the basis of all relative 
creation. With the rapid pace of development in nuclear physics, 
the day does not seem far off when some theoretical physicist
will succeed in establishing a unified field theory. It may be given a
different name, but the content will establish the principle of unity
in the midst of diversity, the basic unity of material existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery of this one basis of material existence will mark the
ultimate achievement in the history of the development of physical
science. This will assist in turning the world of physical science towards 
the science of mental phenomena. Theories of mind and Being
will supersede the findings of physical science. At the extreme limit
of investigation into the nature of reality in the field of the mind
will be found the state of pure consciousness, that field of transcendental
nature lying beyond all the relative existence of material and
mental values. The ultimate field of Being lies beyond the field of
mental phenomena and is the truth of life in all its phases, relative and
absolute. The science of Being is the transcendental science of mind.
The science of Being transcends the science of mind which, in its
turn, transcends the material sciences which deal with the diversity
of material existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is the ultimate reality of all that exists; It is absolute in nature.
Everything in the universe is of a relative order, but eternal
Being, the ultimate life principle of unmanifested nature, expresses
Itself in different forms and maintains the status quo of all that exists,
at the same time maintaining the perpetual process of change and
evolution in creation. Absolute and relative existence are the two
aspects of eternal Being, which is both absolute and relative. The
Upanishads describe it as Purnamadah Purnamidam - that unmanifested 
Absolute is full and this manifested relative is full.
BEING, THE ETERNAL AND ULTIMATE REALITY
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The glory of Being can be experienced directly and recognised as
ultimate reality. By experiencing the subtle states of a sound or a
thought, the mind can be led systematically to the subtlest limit of
experience and then, transcending this subtlest experience of relative
order, can reach the field of the Ultimate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Upanishads show Being as the ultimate reality which is
imperishable and eternal. The hymns of the Vedas and the Bhagavad-Gita 
sing of the glory of the imperishable Self, Being, ultimate Reality,
the Brahman which is the supreme, ultimate Absolute. They say:
Water cannot wet It nor can fire burn It. Wind cannot dry It and
weapons cannot slay It. It is in front, It is behind, It is above and
below. It is to the right and the left. It is all-pervading, the omnipresent, 
divine Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Upanishads explain the Being in terms of Ananda, or bliss,
and locate It at the source of creation in the transcendental region of
life, permeating everything - all time, past, present and future, all
space and all aspects of causation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Upanishads explore Being as Brahman in the regions of
cosmic prana and locate It within man himself. The great words of
enlightenment found in the Vedas express Being as the ultimate
reality and they find It within man as his own inseparable Self. They
reveal the truth in the expression: I am That, thou art That, all this
is That, That alone is, and there is nothing else but That. In these
expressions and many like them, which have been a source of inspiration 
and enlightenment to millions of people from time immemorial, 
Indian philosophy expounds the oneness of life as the ultimate
reality, absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea of Being as the ultimate reality is contained in the oldest
records of Indian thought. The eternal texts of the Vedas, crowned
with the philosophy of the Upanishads, reveal the relative and the
Absolute as two aspects of the one reality, Brahman, absolute Being,
which, although unmanifest in Its essential nature, manifests as relative
creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is nothing but Being in all Its phases of absolute and relative
existence; oneness of Being is the diversity of life, imperishable Being
is the ever-changing, perishable universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thesis of Being as the eternal, ultimate reality of life is founded
on the certainty of a direct and practical way in which every man can
experience It. The Bhagavad-Gita gives a very clear exposition of
the path of enlightenment, transcendental meditation, and claims that
there is no obstacle to it, no hurdle on the way: A little practice will
relieve a man of great fears.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This practical message of the direct experience of Being as the ultimate 
reality glorifies all aspects of life. It is unique in establishing Being
as the absolute and ultimate reality of all the relative phases of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being as the ultimate is of transcendental nature. Therefore the
field of Being can only be said to be abstract and not concrete. The
words abstract and concrete are relative, and neither truthfully expresses 
the nature of Being. But if, for the sake of understanding, we
have to use a word to convey the nature of Being, we can only say
It is abstract and not concrete, even though the experience of It is
far more concrete than anything in relative life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of Its abstract nature, the study of Being has been shrouded
in mysticism, and in consequence, for countless generations, the ordinary
man has been deprived of the great advantages of experiencing Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that a systematic way is available to experience directly the
ultimate Being, it is not only divested of mysticism but, in entering
the field of modern science, it will show man how to use his increasing
knowledge for his evolution instead of his destruction.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The revelation of Being as the eternal and ultimate reality makes
it possible to augment individual life with the eternal life of the Absolute. 
The ever-changing phases of individual life have to be foundedin
on the basis of never-changing Being, the eternal and ultimate reality.
Prana connects by a delicate link the never-changing field of eternal
Being with the ever-changing phases of relative life.
BEING, THE PLANE OF COSMIC LAW
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Law means a rule of procedure. Cosmic law means the rule of
procedure for cosmic life, the rule which governs the purpose of
cosmic existence and evolution. Cosmic law means the rule of procedure 
for cosmic creative intelligence, which creates, maintains and
dissolves the universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cosmic means all-inclusive; it means belonging to the entire
universe. All that there is in nature, either in its static state of existence
or in its dynamic state of life, is included when we say cosmic.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we find in the universe is progression of life. Something is
created, it grows, develops to its fullest extent and then begins to
decay. It decays only to become transformed again. The phenomenon
of change underlies creation. It is this change of life-pattern which
gives to the universe its status and sustains evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We find that things are changing in the universe. But besides
change there is maintenance. Life maintains itself and evolves at the
same time. The aspect of maintenance is one of stability; the aspect of
evolution is one of change.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The maintenance of something created is its stable phase. But when
it changes, it either evolves to a higher state or degrades to a lower
state. This is called the changeable phase. When we think of cosmic
law, therefore, we have to consider these two factors: the factor of
stability and the factor of change in the universe. And we see that
they are found existing simultaneously.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the law of creation, the law of maintenance, the law of
evolution. Something is created, it is maintained, and while it is
maintained it evolves, reaches the height of evolution and then
dissolves. This cycle of creation, maintenance, evolution and dissolution 
continues and in this continuity the life of the universe flows on.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we consider universal law we have to consider all the different 
features of the universe: the creating of life and the creation of
things, their maintenance, their evolution and eventually their dissolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To have a clear picture of the nature of cosmic law, let us take an
example: hydrogen is a gas, oxygen is a gas; they combine to make
water, H2O. Their properties as gas have changed to the properties of
liquid but H and O, hydrogen and oxygen, remain H and O. Again,
the water freezes and is transformed into ice. The properties of the
water have changed into the properties of ice, but hydrogen and
oxygen, the essential constituents, remain the same. That they remain
the same indicates that there is some force, some law or system, which
maintains the integrity of hydrogen and oxygen. Yet there are certain 
laws which change the properties of gas into water and water
into ice.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a law which does not allow the essential nature of oxygen
and hydrogen to change. Even while allowing hydrogen and oxygen
to go through different stages of creation, it maintains their integrity
as hydrogen and oxygen.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That law is the law which maintains the status quo of the essential
constituent; but at different levels of creation this law gives rise to
other laws which transform the duality of this plane into that plane,
transform the properties of gas into liquid and liquid into solid.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Different levels of creation in different forms keep evolving. The
appearance of new qualities is due to new laws coming into play
while the eternal law continues in its unchanging state. All the changes
take place on the unchanging platform of the essential constituent.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is one law of the universe which is the basis of the innumerable 
laws responsible for all the changes in creation. This law upholds
the integrity of the ultimate, essential constituent of creation, yet it
continues to bring forth more and more new laws at different strata
of nature. This results in the different stages of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The essential and ultimate constituent of creation is the absolute
state of Being, or the state of pure consciousness. This absolute state
of pure consciousness is of unmanifested nature, which is ever maintained 
by cosmic law. Pure consciousness, pure Being, is maintained
always as pure consciousness and pure Being, and yet It is transformed 
into all the different forms and phenomena. Here is the cosmic
law: one law which never allows absolute Being to change. Absolute
Being remains absolute Being throughout, although it is found in
changed forms at every level.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cosmic law is that absolute state of pure consciousness which
knows no change. It is the basis of all the laws of nature and through
them maintains the status quo of the different strata of creation, at
the same time evolving every strata and thereby maintaining the
strength of evolution in conformity with the cosmic purpose. Thus,
although the maintenance and evolution of creation is directly carried 
on by different laws, the basis of all these laws is the eternal cosmic 
law at the level of Being, the basis of all creation. This gives a
clear picture of cosmic law.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cosmic law functions from a level between the absolute and relative 
planes of life. It harmonises the unmanifested eternal Being and
the manifested field of diverse relative existence. It is the power of
cosmic law which maintains eternal Being in the absolute state and
at the same time maintains the ever-changing phenomenal creation
in relative states of life. The unity of life in absolute Being and the
diversity of multiple creation are both maintained in their proper
spheres. This is the mysterious and all-powerful nature of cosmic
law which has its eternal status on the plane of Being.
PRANA AND BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prana is the expression of manifesting Being. It is the tendency
of the unmanifested to manifest. It can be said to be the impulse of
abstract, absolute Being. Being is the absolute existence of unmanifested 
nature. Its tendency to vibrate and become manifest is referred
to as prana. Being vibrates, prana vibrates, and creation begins to be
manifested. Assuming a subjective nature, Being becomes mind;
assuming an objective nature, It becomes matter. Remaining innocent,
It serves as a link between subject and object and, creating a subject-object 
relationship, the divine Being starts Its play in the great
variety of multiple creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we find that prana is the power of Being which is latent in
its unmanifested state and which comes into play in the process of
manifestation when Being assumes the role of subjective and objective 
creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question may then arise: What makes prana assume subjective
and objective qualities?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The cosmic intelligence or creative power, which is the very nature
of Being, generates prana from itself, from within the absolute Being.
Prana comes forth from the fountain-head of unmanifested Being,
absolute Being assuming the role of prana. This is how the very nature
of Being begins the processes of creation and evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is responsible for this?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The very nature of Being is responsible. It is as if the Absolute
wants to become creative and relative.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One may ask: Why?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of its own nature; or perhaps for the full of variety !
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expansion of happiness is the purpose of creation. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being, the state of eternal unity, without undergoing any change
in Itself, assumes the role of the multiplicity of creation, the diversity
of Being. The Absolute assuming the role of relativity, or unity
appearing as multiplicity, is nothing but the very nature of absolute
Being appearing in different manifestations. This is why, while the
Absolute is eternal in Its never-changing status, the relative diversity
of creation is eternal in its ever-changing nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This resolves the enigma of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unity of unmanifested, absolute Being is also the diversity and
variety of manifested creation in all its relative phases of existence.
The Absolute and relative together present the whole truth of life.
One hundred percent of the Absolute and one hundred percent
of relative existence combine to form one hundred percent of life in
creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be borne in mind that manifested creation and unmanifested 
Being, although appearing to be different, in reality are one
and the same.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reality of duality is unity. Even while they are different in
their characteristics, absolute Being and relative creation together
form one reality. The whole process of what we understand as creation
and evolution is simply the state of Being in prana, and the change
belongs to the very nature of Being. Creativity lies in the nature of
absolute Being, creation is Its role, and evolution is expansion of Its
beingness. Being remains Being, and from this follows creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prana is of the nature of Being; it is the motive force of creation
and the basic force of the mind.
MIND AND BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind can be likened to a wave on the ocean of Being. Unmanifested, 
absolute Being, stimulated by Its own nature, prana, appears as
mind, even as an ocean stimulated by the wind appears as waves.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That which acts like the force of wind to produce a wave of mind
on the ocean of unmanifested Being is karma. So it may be said
that prana, supplemented by the influence of karma, is the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This statement suggests that if there were no influence of karma,
mind would not exist. The question arises whether karma has to
exist first so that the mind may exist.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we examine karma we find that without mind (the doer),
karma, or action, cannot be produced. This demonstrates the interdependence 
of mind and karma, and it thus seems difficult to decide
whether karma is produced by mind or mind produced by karma.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The answer to the riddle is that mind is born of karma and creates
karma, and karma is born of mind and creates mind. The seed produces 
the tree and the tree produces the seed. It cannot be said which
gave rise to which in the beginning. It can only be said that the seed
is the cause of the tree and the tree is the cause of the seed. But which
one began the cycle cannot be determined.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Metaphysics is silent on this point and simply accepts that the
cycle of the seed and the tree has existed and continues to exist. Similarly, 
there is no evidence to prove whether prana gives rise to mind
or mind gives rise to prana. To all intents and purposes we are left
with the principle of the interdependence of mind and prana.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This can be understood in terms of karma. Karma from a past life is
responsible for the mind's identity in the present life; the level of evolution 
gained by the mind in a past life gives it its status in the present
life and, on the basis of past karma, the mind begins its present life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without the life force of prana, karma remains inert. This inert
karma, supplemented by the life force, prana, gives rise to the mind.
Thus mind is a composite of prana and karma, and through prana is
connected with unmanifested Being. Thus it can be said that mind is
the second stage in the process of manifestation or creation, while
prana is the first.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This clarifies the position of mind in the field of creation and its
relationship with Being, which is the Ultimate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prana is the first expression of cosmic intelligence. Reflected upon
by karma, prana gains individuality and appears as individual mind.
Thus the individual mind is found to be a limited reflection of the
unlimited cosmic mind or pure intelligence. Just as prana is the manifestation 
of the eternal ocean of unmanifested Being, so mind is the
reflection of cosmic intelligence on karma.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This shows that before the creation of the mind there existed in
principle the agency of karma. This leads us to conclude that there
was creation before creation. There existed a day before this day and
a night before this night. The cycle of creation and dissolution is the
eternal cycle in the eternity of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the process of creation, mind comes to exist because there has
previously been a mind which has created some karma. This influence 
of karma continues to exist as the basis of the present mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we can conceive of two realities at the root of creation. One is
the eternal reality of absolute Being, and the other is the reality of
karma which, although lying in the ever-changing field of relative existence, 
finds its eternal status in the ever-continuing cycle of action, experience 
and impression. The impression of an experience on the mind
of the doer is the finest influence of karma. It maintains its existence at
the finest level of mind, almost at the meeting-point of mind and prana.
It is just on this plane - where Being becomes mind - that creation begins, 
and by virtue of this finest impression of karma, prana assumes the
role of mind. It could be said in principle that the next step in creation
is produced almost simultaneously through the mechanics of the senses
of perception, which enable the mind to function and materialise the
reality of mind and senses. Matter comes into being to form the physical
machinery through which the five senses of perception find their expression 
and to justify the validity of their creation to exist and act as
the agents of mind in the process of evolution and creation. By this
process are formed the senses, nervous system and body.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This clarifies the subtle mechanics of creation and illustrates the
principles underlying the creation of mind, senses, nervous system
and body and their relationship with Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is the unbounded eternal ocean of absolute life. Since It is
of transcendental nature, It is without any attribute. Certainly It is
experienced, but this experience is always in Its own field of transcendental 
existence or pure consciousness, where the mind transcends 
all the fields of relative experience and becomes one with
Being and, gaining the status of Being, is no longer conscious mind.
This state of attributeless, absolute existence lies completely beyond
the imagination, beyond any intellectual conception or understanding.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naturally the human mind tries to understand ultimate reality
and to stand at the shore of the limitless ocean of the wisdom of the
Absolute. In its attempt to fathom the unfathomable and to understand 
the Transcendent, it takes the course of understanding the subtler
fields of creation in the hope that if and when the subtlest is understood, 
it will become possible to understand the real nature of the
supreme ultimate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help such intellectual enquiries into the nature of Being and Its
relationship with the subtler fields of subjective and objective creation,
we will discuss briefly the status of Being and the successive creation
of prana, mind, senses, nervous system and body.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been made clear that it is not Being which manifests (because
of Its transcendental and attributeless nature, Being is not in a position 
to manifest or to resist manifesting) but that the instrumentality
of karma reflects upon Being, or accepts the reflection of Being and
becomes the tendency to create, thereby gaining the attribute of prana.
From that point, based on that reflection, the whole creation begins
to separate from Being, which remains unchanged in Its eternal
status of the Absolute. Thus, nothing happens to absolute Being, and
creation begins in the multifarious forms and phenomena, based on
the instrumentality of karma, propelled by prana and carried out by
the mind, leaving Being untouched.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because Being is omnipresent, It pervades all the multiplicity of
creation. Nothing is without It, everything is It. Thus, the status of
creation is distinct from Being, and Being is at the same time the whole
of creation. Mind is distinct from Being, and at the same time its
essential nature is Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wheel of karma keeps creating, evolving and dissolving phenomenal 
creation in cycles of existence and non-existence of the whole
cosmos, and the individual finds himself a part of it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We find that in essence life is eternal and absolute. In reality there
is nothing but the Absolute. All the ever-changing relative forms and
phenomena and the entire cosmic existence have their life in eternal
Being, while at the same time their phenomenal phase of existence
is based on the plane of karma, which has no absolute status in itself.
The relative phase finds everlasting status in the cycles of creation and
dissolution. This suggests that there are two foundations of life absolute 
Being and karma. The question arises: Can there be two
ultimate realities?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, this would leave the quest for ultimate reality unfulfilled and
the seeker of truth in uncertainty.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certainly there cannot be two ultimate realities - Being and karma.
Obviously there can only be one. It remains to be discovered which
is the ultimate, Being or karma.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been seen that Being is in Its essential nature absolute existence 
and that that alone can be accepted as the ultimate reality of
life. But we have also seen that because this ultimate reality, Being, is
absolute It is without attribute and therefore unable to create. It has
been said that creation comes from the seed of karma, latent in Being,
which holds together the instrumentality of prana, karma and mind.
Creation comes when karma, by virtue of itself, assumes the role
of prana, the vital force of life and creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that karma assumes the role of prana to begin creation
in the omnipresence of eternal Being brings hope to the seeker and
justifies his quest for one ultimate reality.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The omnipresent nature of Being does not allow karma to be
given an independent status as the ultimate. Karma finds itself latent
in the very nature of Being, and creation finds its source in It. Thus
Being stands as the one supreme reality and has the instrumentality
of karma latent in Its own nature for the purpose of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The realisation that eternal Being is the one ultimate, supreme
reality of existence shows that the cause of creation, or almighty
creativity, is latent in the very nature of Being and that It expresses
Itself in the form of creation. So we find that absolute, attributeless,
eternal Being is the ultimate reality of existence, and that by virtue
of Its own nature the process of creation, evolution and dissolution
continues eternally without affecting the absolute status of eternal
Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a complete picture of absolute, eternal Being in relation
to Its own almighty, creative intelligence, or universal mind, as well
as to the individual mind.
KARMA AND BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karma means action or activity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen in the previous section the nature of the relationship
that exists between Being and karma and have found that karma in its
manifested form is opposed to the essential nature of Being. Being is
absolute existence, while karma is the instrument through which the
cycle of creation, evolution and dissolution is continuously kept going.
Thus we see that the essential nature of karma is certainly not in
conformity with the essential nature of Being, which is just to be.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No karma can ever reach the state of Being. By the process of
karma, all creation must move continuously through the eternal cycle
of birth and death, creation, evolution and dissolution. Since karma
is opposed to the state of Being, any process which brings karma to
all end will result in the state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that the state of Being is forever the same omnipresent, 
transcendental, absolute existence. It is forever there. But the
life of the individual, moving in the wheel of karma, always remains
in the field of relative existence, thereby missing the glory of Being.
As we have already seen, the life of the individual and that of the
cosmos is created, maintained and dissolved by the force of karma.
That is why every individual and all beings in the world are subject
to the force of karma. The force of karma maintains life in the relative 
field, and this results in the individual remaining out of the
realm of pure Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there were a way to avoid the grip of karma, that would be the
way to attain the state of eternal Being. In the next chapter we shall
see that through a technique for minimising the activity of experience
and eventually transcending the subtlest field of activity, one arrives
at the state of Being, the field of eternal life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This truth, that the nature of Being and the nature of karma are
incompatible, has been radically misinterpreted by those who do not
know this technique for minimising the force of karma and rising
above its influence to attain the state of Being. When such people
of incomplete vision read in metaphysical books that absolute bliss-consciousness 
is opposed to the nature of karma, they evolve theories
of their own to uphold their conviction that a life of activity in the
world is opposed to the state of absolute bliss-consciousness. This
misunderstandmg has created the gulf which has existed for many
centuries between spiritual and material values.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the nature of the Absolute and that of the relative, of
Being and karma, are incompatible, there exists a technique by which
it is possible to glorify the field of karma by the light of Being. This
is the point which countless generations have missed, this fine point
of knowledge: that only skill in action is needed to accomplish the
glorification of karma. This misunderstanding has been the main
reason for the growth of suffering, miscry, tension and increasing
negativeness in all fields of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is high time for this misapprehension to be corrected and for
people to realise that through the system of transcendental meditation
it is possible for every mind to go beyond the relative state of experience 
and attain the state of Being. Having been in that state, the
mind is infused with the value of Being because, in the Transcendent,
it is outside the field of karma, ceases to be individual mind and becomes 
one with absolute, eternal Being. When the mind is drawn
out again into the relative field of activity by the force of karma, it
realises that the state of transcendental Being, in its unlimited aspect
of absolute bliss, is far better than the relative state of transitory happiness 
in the field of activity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bliss-consciousness of the Transcendent makes an immediate
impression upon the nature of the mind. Returning into the relative
field where time, space and causation hold everything between narrow 
boundaries, the mind begins to retain some of this unbounded
status. And with repeated practice it becomes more and more familiar 
with the Transcendent.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The continued practice of transcendental meditation results in such
a strong infusion of Being into the nature of the mind that the mind,
while continuing to behave and experience in the field of relative
existence, begins to live the nature of eternal Being. This has tremendous 
practical value for the mind engaged in day-to-day activities.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What has been lacking is the skill with which to harmonise the
value of Being with the value of activity in the field of karma. This
is not difficult to understand. Skill in action lies in bringing the mind
back to its source and in beginning conscious activity from the very
source of thought. This is the skill in action which infuses the power
of Being into the field of karma through the agency of the mind.
This glorifies activity at all levels and yet leaves the mind free from
the bondage of karma. This freedom of the mind is due to its being
established in eternal bliss-consciousness. Just as in bright sunlight
candlelight loses its relative significance, so also in the eternal light of
absolute bliss do the relative joys of life lose their fast grip on the mind.
Thus the mind is freed from the binding influence of karma through
the experience of the absolute bliss of eternal Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;skill in action requires that activity should first be reduced to nil
and from that point action should be started. It can be compared
with drawing back an arrow on the bow in order to shoot it ahead.
The skill lies in pulling back the arrow on the bow as far as possible
until a state of no activity is reached. From that point the arrow is
shot without effort by simply releasing the hold. Skill in action is
only a matter of pulling back the arrow and releasing it. Then it
will shoot ahead naturally with the minimum effort and maximum
force.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, by bringing the activity of the mind to a state of stillness
and from that point starting action, the minimum of energy will be
required. The action will be performed easily and will yield maximum
results. The doer will act while established in eternal freedom of
Being and will therefore not be under the binding influence of karma.
This is skill in action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may thus conclude that, although the nature of karma and
the nature of Being are incompatible, it is possible to glorify karma by
the bliss of Being. It is possible for a man to live in the field of action
and yet to live simultaneously a life of eternal freedom in bliss-consciousness 
of absolute Being. It is possible for a man to act with
full interest in the world and yet to live simultaneously in God-consciousness, 
thereby uniting the values of absolute and relative
existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reveal this to man is the purpose of this book.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It must be borne in mind that while the science of being is complete
in its theory, it is essentially a practical science in which results depend
on the practice of transcendental meditation. Every one of us can
experience this state of Being and create in our lives a state of eternal
freedom while bringing greater success to all fields of activity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOW TO CONTACT BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The science of being not only affirms the theory of one absolute
element at the basis of the entire creation but also provides a systematic
way whereby any man may experience directly the essential nature
of transcendental, absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First we shall consider from a theoretical point of view the possibility 
of directly experiencing the Absolute, and then we shall
consider the practical results of such an experience in day-to-day
life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that Being lies in the transcendental field of absolute
existence beyond the subtlest stratum of creation. To experience this
transcendental reality it is necessary for our attention to be led through
all the subtle strata of creation; arriving at the subtlest level, it will
transcend that experience and come to the field of transcendental
Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do we find on the gross level of creation? We find gross
things to see with the eyes, gross words or sounds to hear with the
ears, gross odours to smell with the nose, varieties of sensations to
feel with the sense of touch and varieties of flavours to taste with the
tongue. We think, and normally the process of thinking seems to
have no connection with these senses of perception. But the process
of thinking does include one or many of these senses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our experience in the field of perception shows that we experience
gross and subtle things. We use our eyes to see, our ears to hear and
so on; but we know there is a limit to what the eyes can see, the ears
hear and the tongue taste. This marks the limit of the experience of
gross creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The eyes can see forms as long as the forms do not become refined
beyond a certain point. The ears can hear sounds within a certain
frequency range. The nose can smell odors as long as they are gross
enough. This is the case with all the senses of perception. They are
only able to experience gross objects.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we understand that our experience is ordinarily limited to
the gross field of creation. The subtle fields are beyond our ordinary
range of experience. We know that there are forms much finer than
those which the eyes can see and that these may be observed through
the microscope. We know that there are sounds which the ears cannot
hear but which may be heard with the help of amplifiers. This
shows that there exist subtle strata of creation with which we are not
familiar because our ordinary capacity for experience is limited to the
gross. Therefore to experience transcendental Being it is necessary
to develop the faculty of experience.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we could develop our faculty of experience through any of the
senses, or develop our ability to experience thought before it reaches
the conscious level of the mind, and if this ability to experience thought
could be so developed that it reached the source of thought, then,
having transcended the source, it would be possible to reach the
transcendental state of pure Being. In this way, by progressively
experiencing finer states of creation through any one of the senses until
the finest experience is transcended, the state of Being is reached.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Being is by nature transcendental, It does not belong to the
range of any of the senses of perception. Only when sensory perception 
has come to an end can the transcendental field of Being be
reached. As long as we experience through the senses we are in the
relative field. Therefore Being cannot be experienced through any
of the senses. This shows that through whichever sense of experience
we proceed we must first reach the ultimate limit of experience
through that sense. Then, transcending that, we will reach a state
of consciousness in which the experiencer no longer experiences.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word experiencer implies a relative state; it is a relative word.
For the experiencer to exist there has to be an object of experience.
The experiencer and the object of experience are both relative. When
we have transcended the experience of the subtlest object, the experiencer 
is left by himself without an experience, without an object
of experience and without the process of experiencing. When the
subject is left without an object of experience, having transcended the
subtlest state of the object, he steps out of the process of experiencing 
and arrives at the state of Being. The mind is then found in the
state of Being which is beyond the relative field.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The state of Being is neither a state of objective nor of subjective existence, 
because both these states belong to the relative field of life. When
the subtlest state of objective experience has been transcended, then the
individual's subjectivity merges into the Transcendent. This state of
consciousness is known as pure existence, the state of absolute Being
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is how, by bringing the attention to the field of the Transcendent, 
it is possible to contact and experience Being. It cannot be
experienced on the level of thinking because, as far as thinking goes,
this is still a field of relative existence; the whole field of sensory
perception lies within relative existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The transcendental state of Being lies beyond all seeing, hearing,
touching, smelling and tasting - beyond all thinking and beyond all
feeling. This state of the unmanifested, absolute, pure consciousness of
Being is the ultimate state in life. It is easily experienced through the
system of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The process of bringing the attention to the level of transcendental
Being is known as the system of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the practice of transcendental meditation a suitable thought is
selected, and the technique for experiencing it in its initial stages of
development enables the conscious mind to arrive systematically at
the source of thought, the field of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE MAIN PRINCIPLE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that Being is the state of eternal and absolute existence 
and that the way to experience Being is to experience from the
gross to the subtle states of creation until the mind arrives at the
Transcendent.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that we could proceed through any sense of perception. 
For example, through the sense of sight we could gradually
experience increasingly subtle forms until eventually our eyes
reached a point where they were unable to perceive a form beyond a
certain degree of subtlety. If we close our eyes and train the inner
eye - the eye of the mind - to perceive the object at the point where
we failed to perceive it through our open eyes, we would have a
mental image of the object. If there were a way to experience the
finer states of that mental image, to experience its finest state and
transcend it, we would then reach the state of Being. Likewise, through
any sense of perception we could begin to experience an object and
eventually arrive at the transcendental state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the experience of a thought we can experience the subtle
states of thinking and, transcending them, are certain to arrive at the
transcendental state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinking is, in itself, the subtle state of speech. When we speak
our words are audible, but if we do not speak, the words do not
become perceptible. Thus we find that thought is a subtle form of
sound.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The process of thinking starts from the deepest, most refined level
of consciousness and becomes grosser as it develops. Eventually it
becomes gross enough to be perceived on the surface level of consciousness, 
the ordinary level of thinking. An analogy will clarify
this principle.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought starts from the deepest level of consciousness, from the
deepest level of the ocean of mind, as a bubble starts at the bottom
of the sea. As the bubble rises, it gradually becomes bigger. When it
comes to the surface of the water it is perceived as a bubble.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind is like an ocean. The surface layers of the mind function
actively while the deeper levels remain silent. The functioning surface 
level of the ocean of mind is called the conscious mind. Any
thought at the surface level is consciously cognized, and it is at this
level that thoughts are appreciated as thoughts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought starts from the deepest level of consciousness and rises
through the whole depth of the ocean of mind until it finally appears
as a conscious thought at the surface. Thus we find that every thought
stirs the whole range of the depth of consciousness but is consciously
appreciated only when it reaches the conscious level; all its earlier
stages of development are not appreciated. That is why we say that,
for all practical purposes, the deeper levels of the ocean of consciousness 
are as though silent.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Referring to the illustration, the bubble of thought rising from
level A grows in size. By the time it reaches the surface level B, it
has developed sufficiently to be appreciated as a thought. This is
the level of conscious mind. The subtle states of the thought-bubble
below this conscious level are not appreciated.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the thought-bubble could be consciously appreciated at the
level below B, and at all levels of subtlety from B to A, it would then
be possible to bring the level A within the range of the conscious mind.
In this way the depth of the conscious mind (represented by Wl)
would become greater (as represented by W2), and the power of
the conscious mind would be increased enormously. This expansion
of the conscious capacity of the mind happens automatically on the
march towards Being. It is as if the waves on the surface of the ocean
have communicated with the deeper levels of water so that each wave
is mightier than the wave before. The full mental potential is thus unfolded 
and the conscious capacity of the mind is increased to the
maximum extent.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE TECHNIQUE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bubbles of thought are produced in a stream, one after another,
and the mind is trained to experience the oncoming bubble at an
earlier and earlier stage of its development (see illustration). When
the attention reaches level A, it has traversed the whole depth of the
mind and reached the source of creative intelligence in man.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This source of thought thus comes within the scope of the conscious
mind. When the conscious mind transcends the subtlest level of thought,
it transcends the subtlest state of relative experience and arrives at the
transcendental Being, the state of pure consciousness or self-awareness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is how, in a systematic matter, the conscious mind is led,
step by step, to the direct experience of transcendental, absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;INCREASING CHARM ON THE PATH OF TRANSCENDING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To go to a field of greater happiness is the natural tendency of the
mind. Because in the practice of transcendental meditation the conscious 
mind is set on the way to experiencing transcendental, absolute
Being, whose nature is bliss-consciousness, the mind finds the way
increasingly attractive as it advances in the direction of bliss. A light
becomes faint and dim as we move away from its source, and its
intensity increases as we proceed towards its source. Similarly, when
the mind goes in the direction of the absolute bliss of transcendental
Being, it finds increasing charm at each step of its march. The mind
is charmed and so is led to experience transcendental Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This practice is pleasant for every mind. Whatever the state of
evolution of the aspirant, whether he is emotionally developed or
intellectually advanced, his mind, by its very tendency to go to a
field of greater happiness, finds a way to transcend the subtlest state
of thinking and arrive at the bliss of absolute Being. This practice
is, therefore, not only simple but also automatic.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IMPORTANCE OF RIGHT THOUGHT
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A right thought is one which, in its nature, is harmonious and
useful to the thinker and his surroundings. Every thought, like every
spoken word, has some influence on the thinker and his surroundings.
Just as a stone thrown into a pond produces waves reaching all the
pond's extremities, any thought, word or action produces waves in
the atmosphere, and these waves travel in every direction and strike
against everything in the atmosphere. They influence every level of
creation. The whole universe is influenced by every thought, word
and action of each individual.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the influence of a thought is so wide, it is necessary to consider 
carefully the quality of any thought arising in the mind. There
may be a thought whose influence is detrimental to the thinker and
to the rest of the universe. Likewise, there may be a thought whose
influence is favourable and useful to the thinker and to the world
at large. Because each personality has its own duality, it is extremely
important for each man that a special quality of thought be selected
whose physical influence will be beneficial and useful to himself and
to the whole world. The influence of a spoken word carried by waves
of vibration in the atmosphere does not depend upon the meaning
of the word. It lies in the quality of the vibrations set forth. Where it
is necessary to produce vibrations of good quality for all influence of
harmony and happiness, it is also necessary for the quality of vibration 
to correspond to that of the individual.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Individuals differ in the quality of the vibrations which constitute
their individual personalities. That is why the right selection of a
thought for a particular individual is of vital importance for the practice
of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the quality of each man differs, it is all the more difficult to
select the right type of vibration or the proper quality of thought.
The problem of selecting a right thought, the physical quality of
which corresponds to the physical quality of the thinker, becomes
increasingly important when we consider that the power of thought
increases when the thought is appreciated in its initial stage of development.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know that power is greater in the subtle strata of creation than
in the gross. If we throw a stone at someone it will hurt him, but if
we could enter its subtle strata and excite an atom of the stone, tremendous 
energy would be released and the effect would be far greater.
Similarly, when we enter the subtler states of a thought, we appreciate
its finer levels where the power becomes greater than on the ordinary
conscious level of the mind. With this in view, it is essential that,
before starting this practice, the right quality of sound should be selected.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question of selecting the right thought for a particular individual 
presents an enormous problem when we consider the farreaching 
influence of an action on the entire universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An action performed by a particular individual in a particular
place at a particular time may produce results favourable for the doer
and his surroundings. The same action may produce a different influence 
under different circumstances.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consideration of action and its influence is highly complicated.
It is beyond the capacity of the human mind to fathom the influence
of all action at any level of creation. Therefore the problem of selecting 
a right thought for this practice of meditation is something which
cannot be successfully decided by any individual for himself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to facilitate the finding of a right word for each individual, 
teachers have been trained in the art of selecting a sound or
word to correspond to the special quality of the individual. These
trained teachers of meditation are found in almost every country
of the world in the centres of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE NECESSITY OF PERSONAL GUIDANCE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The practice of transcendental meditation has to be imparted by
personal instruction. It cannot be imparted through a book, because
the teacher must not only show the aspirant how to experience the
subtle states of thinking but should also be responsible for checking
his experiences as he proceeds on that path.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experiences vary from man to man. Therefore it is not practical
to record all the possible experiences. Nor is it to the advantage of the
beginner to know in advance all that it is possible for him to experience.
Firstly, because he might anticipate a particular experience and in
so doing will be dividing his attention, thereby eliminating the possibility 
of any significant and deep experience. Secondly, because in
anticipating all experience he might fall a victim to auto-suggestion
and only imagine that experience. In both cases he is deprived of
success. In this meditation the mind actually experiences the subtle
states of thought without having to imagine, anticipate or aim at
any particular experience. It is an entirely innocent process which
succeeds under the personal guidance of a teacher.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thought itself is a very abstract experience for all ordinary man.
If he is asked to experience the subtle states of a thought, he is being
asked to experience the subtle states of that abstract experience. This
seems an impossibility, since the mind has always been accustomed
to experience only gross objects or gross states of thought on the
conscious thinking level.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moment one begins to experience the subtle states of thought,
one finds oneself drifting towards increasingly abstract states of experience. 
It takes a while for the beginner to be able to pinpoint his
experience of subtle states of thought, even with the help of a
personal teacher. For this reason it is of no practical value to describe
in writing the details of the practice. The practice of transcendental
meditation must always be taught by expert masters of meditation,
who have been trained to impart it accurately as well as to check experiences.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The checking of experiences is a vital point in this practice. Again,
it cannot be done through books. The practice must result in all good
in life, and this depends upon the personal guidance of the teacher
together with the obedience and co-operation of the aspirant. It is a
highly specialised and delicate practice. It is important that it should
only be learned from an authorised teacher of the Spiritual Regeneration 
Movement.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HOW TO LIVE BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is not something that exists and can be brought from somewhere 
and lived. It is existence itself, the very life of everything.
It is the all-pervading, omnipresent state of absolute consciousness.
To live It, the conscious mind has first to become acquainted with It.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In meditation, when the mind transcends the subtlest state of thinking 
it arrives at the state of Being. This is a state of no experience because 
the whole field of relativity has been transcended. It is simply
the state of transcendence, the state of existence, pure consciousness,
is-ness, am-ness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From this state of pure Being the mind returns to experience
thought in the relative world. Through constantly entering the realm
of the Transcendent and returning to the field of relativity, familiarity
with the essential nature of Being deepens, and the mind gradually
becomes more aware of its own essential nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more and more practice, the ability of the mind to maintain
its essential nature while experiencing objects through the senses,
increases. When this happens the mind and its essential nature the 
state of transcendental Being - become one, and the mind is then
capable of retaining its essential nature - Being - while engaging in
thought, speech or action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve such a state of mind, two things are necessary. One, as '
we have already seen, is the practice of transcendental meditation; the
other, equally important for the rapid attainment of the desired goal,
is that the mind should not be strained when it emerges after meditation 
to engage in the field of activity. The whole field of activity
should be duly experienced, all necessary actions performed, but the
mind should not be overtaxed. Everything should be done in an
easy manner. For the rapid infusion of Being into the nature of the
active mind, it is very important to take life naturally and easily.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the conscious mind transcends and attains the state of Being,
it becomes Being completely. The mind loses its individuality and
becomes cosmic mind; it becomes omnipresent and gains pure, eternal 
existence. In the state of the Transcendent it has no capacity for
experience. Here the mind does not exist, it becomes existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind returns to the field of relative life, it regains
individuality but retains some of the great, unbounded, universal
status which it had attained. With practice it is able to retain more and
more of that state in the activity of daily life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Generally speaking, any engagement of the mind in the field of
activity is a strain on the essential nature of the mind which is pure
Being. But if the mind engages itself in the activity in an easy, relaxed,
simple and natural manner, the infusion of Being into its nature becomes 
easier. If, on the other hand, the mind is strained during activity, 
the infusion of Being is less effective. For example, when a white
cloth is dipped into yellow dye it becomes yellow. When it is brought
out, the depth of colour is not as great as it appeared to be while the
cloth was in the dye. If the cloth is put in the shade for a time, the
colour fades further. If the cloth is placed in the sunlight it is found
that the colour fades even more rapidly.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, when the mind reaches the transcendental state of Being
it becomes pure Being. If it is put to activity in a normal and natural
manner when it emerges from the Transcendent, the infusion of the
nature of Being is retained for some time. But if the mind is strained
in activity, then the effect of the infusion is soon lost. Therefore it
is very important that one engages in the field of activity in a natural
manner so that the activity may serve as a means to develop the state
of Being in the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we find that the regular practice of transcendental meditation, 
together with natural, unstrained activity in life, is a short cut
to the creation of a state of consciousness where absolute Being and
the relative field of life are lived simultaneously and the one is not a
barrier to the other. This is the state of cosmic consciousness in which
absolute Being is lived together with all the values of relative life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In The Art of Living it is made clear that, by the system of
transcendental meditation, it is not only possible but even easy for
everyone to cultivate this state.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who start this practice of meditation feel more energy,
greater clarity of mind and better health. They become more efficient
and energetic in all activities. They should bear in mind, however,
that as their mental and physical efficiency increases, they should not
expand activity to such an extent that they become exhausted and find
no time for meditation. When the root is watered the tree becomes
green and more vital in itS growth. If the activity of growing were
cherished by the tree to such an extent that it had no time to draw
in water from the root, then the very basis of its growth would be lost.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is important to note that while the infusion of the nature of
Being into the nature of the mind is apparent in rejuvenation of
personality, clearer thinking and greater energy, it is a very delicate
process. This infusion is on the level of Being, the very existence of
the individual, and is never on the thinking level of the mind.
Therefore we warn all aspirants not to expect to feel Being on the
thinking level of the conscious mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is like the process whereby a tree receives water at its root, and
consequently all parts of the tree naturally receive nourishment and
flourish. But no part of the tree is aware of, or experiences, the process
of the root receiving the water. Its influence is seen in the increasing
freshness of all parts of the tree. Perhaps a leaf would argue that it
feels better but does not feel it is receiving any nourishment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is so constituted that it has always received nourishment from
the roots, and this same process is simply continuing on a greater
scale. This is why the leaf does not recognise that anything unusual
is happening to it. What is happening to it, however, is appreciated
by all those who have seen the leaf drying up and who now see it
becoming fresh and beginning to flourish.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, when one meditates, one experiences increased energy
and clarity of mind but not the actual process of the infusion of Being
into the nature of the mind. The whole process is silent, on the level
of pure Being. Whatever the experiences of the mind during meditation,
they are only the different states of the medium of meditation.
These states become finer and finer until eventually nothing remains
of the medium, and the mind is left by itself in the state of pure consciousness.
The infusion of the nature of Being into the nature of the
mind orginates in the transcendental field.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The living of Being cannot be described. Description cannot give
a complete exposition of that state. It can only be lived. If someone
is asked to describe the taste of what he has been eating, it is impossible 
for him to put the exact taste into words, even though he was
able to taste the food perfectly well. Similarly, Being is lived in life
and is a state of experience, but It cannot be described.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being can be lived through the regular practice of meditation. To
begin with, Being is very delicately impressed on the nature of the
mind. As the practice is continued, It becomes more and more deeply
infused into the mind and eventually becomes so deep, significant
and unshakeable that It is lived all the time, through all experiences
of the waking, dreaming and deep sleep states. Then one is living
eternal freedom on the level of relative experience.
ADVANTAGES OF LIVING THE BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are innumerable advantages in experiencing absolute Being
through the practice of transcendental meditation. It influences the
life of the individual at all levels to such a degree that the whole value
of life is transformed beyond the imagination of the human mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How is it possible for a mortal man to visualise the advantages to
his individual life of communion with the cosmic life of absolute Being?
How can ordinary human intelligence, on the level of intellectual
understanding, comprehend the greatness of cosmic intelligence to be
found in the field of transcendental Being? How can an individual, functioning 
within the limitations of his ordinary mental capacity, conceive
of the enormous possibilities of the creative energy of his full potential
when he is in tune with the creative intelligence of absolute Being?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mind, body and surroundings are the three main fields of life.
The advantages of the direct experience of Being in these aspects of
life will be dealt with in the chapters which follow.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experience of Being permits one to live life in its full stature and
significance and leads one to live the normal life of man - cosmic
consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rejuvenation of body and mind are the special blessings of the
experience of Being, and Its influence transforms health3, education4,
and social behaviours. It eliminates fear, tension and suffering, on
both the individual and social planes, bringing peace in life6.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the experience of Being 'an is able to use his full potential 
and to make full use of his surroundings and of the almighty
power of nature. The material and spiritual values of life are brought
into harmony: through the art of experiencing Being it is possible
to live life in eternal freedom while accomplishing the maximum in
the material field. It is not difficult to live Being in all phases of life:
the body, mind, nervous system, speech, thought, breath,
behaviour, and surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brought to the level of the individual mind, Being provides the
key to clear, purposeful and fruitful thinking which in action leads
to self-confidence and increased efficiency in all undertakings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The practice of transcendental meditation brings fullfilment to
psychologyl, philosophy2 and to man's religious3 life and is the key
to God-realisation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHAT IS LIFE ?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is the Light of God, the expression of Divinity. It is divine.
It is the stream of eternal Being, a flow of existence, intelligence,
creativity, purity and bliss.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is unity on the basis of the absolute and eternal unity of life.
On the surface of eternity we are mortal beings in an ever-changing
phenomenal existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is unity in God-consciousness. It is multiplicity in the Light
of God. Life is absolute in bliss-consciousness and relative in the
variety of phenomenal joy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essentially life is Being. Life, in its essential nature, is the unbounded 
eternal ocean of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we state that life is the ocean of Being, we do not mean
life is only that. It is also the stream, the flow of Being. The flow of
Being means Being in Its manifested, relative aspects.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us consider the ocean, since we have said that life is the ocean
of Being. At the bottom of the ocean the water is cool. As we rise
towards the surface we find that the water becomes warmer at each
level and that at the surface of the ocean the temperature is highest.
The various degrees of temperature at different levels constitute the
temperaturc of the ocean. The water is essentially the same at all
levels but, according to the temperaturc of each different level, it
varies in its density.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, Being is the same and yet different at each level of creation. 
It is composed of different levels of understanding, different
levels of intelligence and creativity and different levels of peace and
happiness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All these levels of peace and happiness, creativity, intelligence and
power are nothing but the different levels of Being. One extreme of
Being is absolute, while the other is the grossest state of relative existence. 
The different states of Being between these two extremes
constitute the different states of manifested Being. Eternally remaining
absolute Being, It is found in the different qualities, forms and phenomena 
of diverse creation. In this way we find that life is the ocean
of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another example will serve to illustrate the nature of life. We
know that hydrogen and oxygen are gases and that when they combine 
as H20 they become water. Although gas becomes water, the
essential constituents H and O remain the same hydrogen and oxygen.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When water freezes to become ice, the properties change again,
but the essential constituents remain the same. The fluidity of water
has changed into the solidity of ice. The transparency of water has
changed into the opacity of ice, but with all these changes the essential 
constituents, hydrogen and oxygen, have not changed. The same
elements are found in all the different states, appearing with different
properties, giving rise to different phenomena.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is as if one and the same man is found as an actor on the stage,
a player on the playing-field, a student in the class and a customer in
the market.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a judge sits in the court-room, he wears robes befitting a
judge, but when he goes to his club he appears in clothes suitable for
a club. When he is at home he wears clothes that differ from those
that he wears on the street, and before retiring at night he changes
his clothes yet again. The garments change but the man remains
the same. He is addressed in different ways by different people, yet
the man is forever the same man.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, all different forms and phenomena in creation differ in
their qualities. No two forms are ever the same; even the same form
becomes different with the lapse of time, for nothing in creation is
stable. Everything is changing, yet, at the basis of all these everchanging 
phenomena of creation, the underlying reality is the same
never-changing, eternal, absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life can be explained by the example of a tree. All the components 
of the outer aspect of the tree - trunk, branches, leaves,
flowers and fruit - together with those of the inner root constitute
the whole life of the tree. But when we look more closely we find
that although the root is the basis of the outer tree, it has no absolute,
independent status. The root depends upon the nourishment, or sap,
that comes from the area outside the root itself. This sap is the essence
of the entire tree. It nourishes the root and, passing through the root,
gives rise to all the other aspects of the tree. So the tree is essentially
the nourishment, and its basis lies beyond the boundaries of its outer
form and root. Thus the basis of its life is transcendental in nature,
transcending the boundaries of the inner and outer tree. It is the field
where the essential constituent of the tree is found in its pure nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, the life of a man or any individual life in creation has
three aspects: the outer, the inner and the transcendental. The outer
aspect of life is the body; the inner is the subjective aspect of the personality 
which is concenled with the process of experience and
action; the transcendental aspect of life is Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The various aspects of life may be compared to a coconut. The
outer part consists of a hard shell. Beneath the shell is a more refined
aspect of the coconut, which is the solidified layer of milk, the kernel.
Beyond the kernel is the essence, the milk in its pure form. So the
milk in its pure form has solidified into a firm inner layer and surrounded 
itself with the still harder layer of the shell to protect the
precious inner part.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, in the life of the individual the essence or milk is the
unmanifested absolute Being, the transcendental aspect of life, which
manifests as the ego, intellect, mind, senses. All these subtle states of
life constitute the inner man, the kernel, the subjective aspect of life.
This differs from its objective aspect which is the body with its various
components, the shell, the outer aspect of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to understand life in its totality we must consider it in
its transcendental, subjective and objective aspects, and if we succeed
in having a clear picture of an individual existence in these terms, then
we shall understand the range of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
INDIVIDUAL AND COSMIC LIFE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that life has two aspects, absolute and relative. We
have also seen that the relative aspect is simply the expression of the
absolute phase of life, which is the omnipresent, unbounded ocean
of pure consciousness, or eternal existence. This eternal existence is
said to be cosmic life, and its expression in the relative field is called
individual life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, for the sake of understanding, it could be said that the absolute 
state of life corresponds to cosmic life, and that the relative states
of life correspond to the individual life. Individual life is the expression 
of cosmic life, just as a wave is an expression of the ocean. The
ocean, while remaining the same, is affected by every wave and its
activity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The universe reacts to individual action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a stone is thrown into a pond, waves are produced that travel
throughout the pond. Each wave produces some effect in every part
of the pond. Similarly, the wave of individual life, through its activity, 
produces an influence in all parts of the cosmos.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is one continuous and homogeneous whole. The waves of
individual life on the ocean of life arise without breaking the continuity 
and all-pervading status of eternal, absolute Being. All the
innumerable laws of nature carrying out the process of creation, evolution 
and dissolution in different parts of the universe, are the diverse
expressions of the one eternal, cosmic life. The entire creation is the
expression of cosmic life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When individuality begins to exist at different points in creation,
the continuity and homogeneity of cosmic life are not disturbed.
Life permeates the whole body, and all the different parts of the body
are at the command of the life of the individual. But the hand itself,
for example, is a composite of millions of cells, each of which has
its own life and function to perform. Although the life of the cell is a
life in itself and has its own sphere of activity and individuality, it is
a part of the whole life of the individual. The life of every cell has its
influence on the whole life of man. The smooth function of every
tissue in the body produces a powerful, harmonious influence on the
individual life. But any defect, inactivity or dullness in even one cell
can bring about a corresponding effect in the life of the individual
as a whole. In the same way the universe reacts to individual action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through every thought, word and deed we are producing influences 
which affect our surroundings. Physics has revealed that
through everything we do we produce vibrations in the atomsphere.
Waves of activity are set up by the nervous system which are emitted
from the body to reach all layers of the atmosphere. Recently we
have seem that receivers installed in space-probes travelling at hundreds
of miles a minute receive commands from earth at a distance of thousands 
of miles. The equipment carries out commands and sends back
information. This shows the continuity of life, and that it reacts to our
actions far beyond our immediate surroundings, in unlimited space. Our
every thought, word or action produces an influence in the atmosphere,
and the quality of that influence depends upon the quality of the
vibrations emitted by us. Everything in the universe is constantly
influencing every other thing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This shows how dependent and how powerful is the life of the
individual. A man may not be aware of the influence that he produces
on the surroundings, but the influence is produced none the less. The
expression of goodness, sweetness or love to a child produces a loving
and life-supporting influence in the whole cosmos. One harsh, cruel
word spoken to a person will produce that influence of harshness and
cruelty throughout creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experiments with plants are said to have shown that a plant which
is properly tended with feelings of love and kindness grows stronger
and more quickly than one which the gardener dislikes, though he
may attend to it conscientiously.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One kind look will draw a child to you. A harsh look makes him
cry and run away. This is how, quite silently, influence is produced
on the whole of nature. Innocently one becomes the victim of the
vibrations of other people; one is subjected to and influenced by the
silent emotions and thoughts of other individuals.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A creature of the animal kingdom does not know that it is producing
a far-reaching influence through every action, but man, with
his highly developed nervous system, should know the extent of the
influence he produces. If a man has a kind and compassionate nature,
he will naturally produce a good influence on his surroundings.
When you enter the home of a friend, you may feel elated or depressed.
If the friend is virtuous and a man of good intention, thought
and action, then he creates a very good atmosphere. Wherever he
lives or goes, he carries with him that influence of happiness and
harmony. Someone passes you in the street, and you feel attracted
to him and begin to feel love for him. Another man passes, and
you are repulsed by him. This is due to their qualities and to the
reactions they have on your own vibrations.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is well known that many houses attract passers-by. These houses
are inviting, they convey a feeling of harmony and peace, and to look
at them gives pleasure. Others give an impression of sadness, dryness,
coldness - a feeling of antipathy. This is due to the quality of the
people living in the house, or to the duality of the person who built
it, or to the quality of the wealth with which it was built.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we speak of the quality of wealth, what do we mean?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The quality of wealth is determined by the means by which it has
been earned, as well as by the effects it produces for others.
Wealth of good quality is that which has been earned by means
which have helped to elevate society or to improve the lives of people.
A house built with this wealth or an act done with it will produce a
good influence in the atmosphere. Wealth of bad quality is that which
is gained by illegal or sinful means or through a type of business which
tends to lower the standards of society, lower its consciousness and
directly or indirectly creates a situation whereby the moral, spiritual
and religious values of the people are debased. Any work done with
this wealth or any house built with it, has an over-all depressing effect.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Great wealth earned through an activity which lowers the consciousness 
or damages the lives of people does not produce a healthy
influence for those who inherit it. This tends to show itself in sickness,
a low state of consciousness, degenerate ways of life and minds clouded
with petty and low thoughts. But one who inherits this wealth does
not know that he is suffering from its demoralising influence. These
innocent and basically well-meaning people are the victims of the
harm perpetrated on society by their parents or forefathers. Apart
from its adverse effects upon themselves, their wealth does not engender 
in them any feeling for helping others. The way out of such a
situation is to devote a proportion of the inheritance to any work
directly dedicated to raising the consciousness of the people. This counteracts 
the adverse effects produced at the time the wealth was earned.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The relative fields of life are so closely interconnected, and the
influence of each aspect of life on every other aspect of life in the cosmos
is so complex and diverse, that it is highly important that by some
means every man in the world should become a righteous man.
Each man's thoughts would then be loving, helpful and compassionate, 
producing good influences for himself, on his surroundings
and in the whole of creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only way to achieve this is for each individual to transform
the nature of his mind in such a way that it naturally picks up only
right thoughts, and naturally engages itself only in right speech and
actions .
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each man has to rise to this level by himself. No one can possibly
raise the level of another person's consciousness. Help by way of
information and guidance can be offered by those who know the
way, but the responsibility for raising the level of one's consciousness
lies with oneself. Each individual has to choose his own path and uplift
himself by his own endeavour. Others can at best reveal to him the
wisdom of individual and cosmic life and inspire him to establish coordination 
between himself and the universal state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be firmly established in the mind of every individual that
he is a part of the whole life of the universe and that his relationship
to universal life is that of one cell to the whole body. If every cell is
not alert, energetic and healthy, the body as a whole begins to suffer.
Therefore, for the sake of the life of the individual, and equally for
the life of everything in the entire universe, it is necessary for the
individual to be healthy, virtuous and right in every thought, word
and deed. That the whole universe reacts to every individual action
is rare knowledge, but it is also a scientific fact'. For there exists an
intimate and inseparable connection between the individual and the
universe; neither is independent.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boundaries of individual life are not restricted to the boundaries 
of the body, nor even to those of one's family or home; they
extend far beyond those spheres to the limitless horizons of unbounded
cosmic life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
NORMAL LIFE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have already seen that life has two aspects, relative and absolute.
Therefore normal life should mean that the values of both these
aspects are lived and enjoyed in a natural way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have also seen that relative life has two aspects: the inner
subjective life of the individual, which includes the ego, intellect,
mind, senses, prana and absolute Being taken together, and the outer
objective aspect, which is the body and the surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The body and mind should function normally, Being should
permeate all the fields of relative existence, and the surroundings
should be harmonious and useful. When one naturally uses all the
resources of mind, body and Being for the natural process of evolution,
then life can be said to be normal. When all values of relative life
pertaining to the body, mind and surroundings are supplemented by
divine values, the blissful nature of absolute Being, then worldly life
in the fullness of eternal freedom - in the state of cosmic consciousness 
- is the normal life of a human being. It is a life of all glory in the
material world, supplemented by eternal freedom in God-consciousness. 
Cosmic consciousness is meant to be the normal consciousness of
human beings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The range of human life is not, as is generally thought, restricted
to our various ways of living, sleeping, waking, playing, talking or
behaving; these are only the gross levels of human values. The real,
substantial value of human life is the bliss-consciousness that raises a
man to the high estate of eternal freedom while he is engaged in the
day-to-day world of transitory values.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man who has not achieved cosmic consciousness has not yet
reached the level of normal human life; he is nearer the level of animal
life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wherein lies the difference between man and the animal kingdom?
The process of maintaining life is the same for both. Both eat, drink,
sleep and are active. Man enjoys the objects of the senses, and so does
the animal. Animals shrink from death just as man does. What advantages 
has man over animals?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man is superior to the animal kingdom by reason of his capacity
for greater understanding, his ability to perceive a greater range of
life and his power to act independently. Man has freedom of action,
whereas each animal species has a set pattern of behaviour which
is governed by the laws of nature. No animal has a mind sufficiently
developed to deviate from the channels of activity imposed on it by
natural laws.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man has a developed nervous system through which he can either
maintain his activity in accordance with the laws of evolution or
deviate from those laws. Unlike the animals, he has this choice.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man has a brain sufficiently developed to be able to distinguish
between right and wrong, and for this reason the great responsibility
for right behaviour lies with him. He has the ability directly to experience 
the abstract field of bliss-consciousness. His nervous system
enables him to experience subtler states of thought, to transcend the
subtlest thought and arrive at the transcendental state of pure consciousness, 
the state of absolute Being. This is the inestimable advantage 
that man has over the animals.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a man does not live a normal life, or a life using his full
potential, he feels miserable and tense and suffers in many ways.
But the ability to live in the power of unlimited, eternal Being and
thereby glorify all aspects of life, lies within man's normal capacity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE PURPOSE OF LIFE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expansion of happiness is the purpose of life, and evolution is the
process by which it is fulfilled. Life begins in a natural way, it evolves,
and happiness expands. The expansion of happiness carries with it
the growth of intelligence, power, creativity and everything that may
be said to be of significance in life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The purpose of creation is the expansion of happiness, and this
purpose is fulfilled through the process of cosmic evolution. The
significance and purpose of individual life is the same as that of cosmic 
life. The difference is one of scale.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Individual life is the fundamental unit of the life of the cosmos.
If the purpose of individual life is served, automatically and simultaneously 
the purpose of cosmic life is served to the same degree.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a man has fulfilled the purpose of his life he has done his best to
help the cosmic purpose, for the evolution of the cosmos is basically
served by the evolution of the individual life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a man is unhappy he has missed the very essence of life. If his
intelligence, power, creativity, peace and happiness are not constantly
developing, he has lost his direction. Life is not meant to be lived
in dullness, idleness and suffering; these do not belong to the essential
nature of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life is dynamic, not static. It is energetic, progressive, evolving
and developing through activity and multiplying itself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activity maintains the stream of evolution, and it is the nervous
system of the individual which is the vehicle for this activity. In species
lower than man the nervous system is not so fully evolved, so that
activity leading to evolution is on a far smaller scale. As the nervous
system evolves the rate of evolution increases.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man's nervous system, being complete, is the most highly evolved.
Therefore his possibility of evolution is unlimited in this life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a child is born his means of expression are limited and his
powers undeveloped; but as he grows up and engages in the field
of activity there is no limit to the development of his powers, his
strength, intelligence and creativity, nor to the degree of happiness
which he can experience and radiate.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The purpose of this book is to reveal that since man's nervous
system is so developed he can, through right activity, make use of
his unlimited potential.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man of limited mind, busy in the world, is unable to appreciate
the purpose of life. His mind is occupied with small things, and he
can only create in a limited way. The conscious mind of an ordinary
man is so limited that he is not even able to enjoy life. Many aspects
of his life cause him to suffer, but his suffering is due only to his not
using his full potential.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By not using his full potential, man is unable to fulfil the purpose
of his life. He suffers in many ways because he is not using the full
conscious capacity of his mind or the great energy he carries within
himself. He is not experiencing and expressing in his life the abundance 
of absolute bliss that he naturally possesses, the absolute field
of creativity and power that lies within himself. He is like a millionaire 
who has forgotten his wealth and position and goes begging in
the street.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All suffering is due to ignorance of a way to unfold the divine glory
which is present within oneself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since one possesses the capacity for divine unfoldment, it is ignorance 
of the technique for experiencing the Being within oneself
which is responsible for the misery in life. Without divine consciousness 
man lacks energy, intelligence and clarity of thought. He is
tired, tense and anxious.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Human existence and intelligence have reached such a deplorable
level that in the field of psychology - the great science of the mind -
it is even suggested that tension is necessary for creative intelligence.
How tragic it is to believe that tension is necessary to improve life!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is said that poets and artists have created their most inspired work
under tension. All such statements are due to ignorance and an inability 
to distinguish between tensions and pressure of time or circumstances. 
Pressure of time or circumstances can sometimes produce
much finer work but only from minds that are free and relaxed,
which do not become tense through this pressure.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In our modern scientific age material comforts are certainly
increasing, yet the individual life seems to grow more tense. This is
only because individuals do not know the way to improve their
ability and efficiency through contact with the greater energy and
intelligence which every man has within himself. It is only necessary
to contact consciously that field of inner life to benefit from it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man today is blind to the purpose of life, unable to see that he is
born to enjoy, create and live a life useful to himself and others. He
plunges into whatever activity lies ahead, working hard to the best
of his ability. This is commendable, but when activity increases a man
often finds himself unable to cope with the resulting pressure and
responsibility. Unless his efficiency increases proportionately, tension 
and strain develop.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a man engages in greater activity he should be able to produce
more energy and greater intelligence within himself to deal with this
increased activity. When he does not know how to do this he misses
the entire purpose of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life in freedom is intended for the human race. If a man is not able
to live in freedom the very purpose of life is not fulfilled. Man is
born to live a perfect life, encompassing the values of the transcendental 
Absolute - unlimited energy, intelligence, power, peace and bliss
together with the unlimited values of the world of multiplicity in
relative existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man's life is meant to be a bridge between divine intelligence and
the whole of creation. It exists to cultivate the divine power, intelligence, 
happiness and abundance, and to give this out to all creation.
This is the high purpose of man's life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man is fortunate in being endowed with the capacity to reach this
level through directly contacting the field of the Absolute, thereby
enlarging the conscious capacity of his mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every man is capable of spreading divine splendour throughout
creation. He is able to project all the values of the Absolute into the
world of relative existence for all creatures to enjoy, and to glorify
the entire creation of God. Each man is capable of living a life of full
values. If he fails to do this he brings shame on himself, and he abuses
the glory of almighty God present within and around him.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let every man on earth begin to reach the divine consciousness of
the Absolute and, bringing it through all his activity into the world
of variety, enjoy it himself and radiate it for all others to enjoy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ART OF LIVING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The word art implies a graceful and skilful method of accomplishing 
anything. The art of living any phase of life is to make oneself
master of that phase by using latent potentialities and correct techniques.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of living enables a man to live life to its full value, to accomplish 
the maximum in the world and at the same time to live a life
of eternal freedom in God-consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the art of making a flower arrangement is to glorify every
flower by the beauty of every other flower, so, through the art of
living, every aspect of life is enriched by the glories of every other
aspect.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of living enables the transcendental aspect of life to strengthen 
and bring lustre to the subjective and objective aspects of existence, 
so that the entire range of subjectivity and objectivity enjoys
the absolute strength, intelligence, bliss and creativity of eternal
Being. This is the art of allowing the life-stream to flow in such a
manner that every aspect of living is enriched with the magnificence
of life in all its fullness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the power of the Absolute supplements all aspects of subjectivity 
then the ego is full, the intellect is profound, sharp and onepointed, 
the mind is concentrated and powerful, the thought force is
great and the senses are fully alert. When the ego, intellect, mind and
senses are fully supported by absolute Being they become effective.
Then experience becomes more profound and activity gains power.
In this way all spheres of the individual's life become more useful
for society and even for the entire cosmos.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that it is the sap which is the basis of the root and
the entire tree. In this example we found that the root lay between
the transcendental area of the tree and the outer tree. Likewise, the
subjective aspect of life, the inner man (ego, mind and senses) lies
between transcendental Being (the basis of our life) and the outer
gross field of objective existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of living demands a good and effective life. The art of
living requires a sufficient infusion of Being into the subjective aspect
of life and Its influence in all fields of the objective aspect. The art
of living requires that the mind should draw on the power of Being and
pass this on to the body and its surroundings. For a tree to grow to
maturity, the root must be efficient so that nourishment from the
surrounding area is properly absorbed and transmitted to all the different 
parts of the outer tree. This is the key to the art of living.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inner man should absorb the value of the transcendental,
absolute state of life and transmit this to the outer gross relative
states, enriching each aspect with the power of absolute Being.
Through this technique the mind works in such a way that every
individual thought enjoys the strength of cosmic intelligence, every
action enjoys the power of unlimited cosmic life and the creative
energy of the individual is augmented with the unlimited energy of
cosmic Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we conclude that the art of living requires that the mind be
in constant communion with the absolute state of life, so that whatever 
the mind is thinking, in whatever action it is engaged, it is never
separated from the direct influence of the eternal, absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of living, then, lies in the mind cultivating within itself the
eternal state of absolute Being. The constant and continuous infusion
of the Absolute into the very nature of the mind becomes the living
truth of day-to-day life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a businessman does not invest his wealth in his business he does
not gain the maximum possible profit. If the individual mind does
not reflect the bliss of absolute Being and experience things in the
outside relative field of life while remaining saturated with that bliss,
then nothing that is experienced will bring lasting contentment.
The mind will always be searching for greater happiness. But if the
mind is saturated with bliss, it derives joy from the variety of multiple
creation while remaining established in contentment. Only then does
the mind fully enjoy variety.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the mind is not based on the bliss of unity within itself, it is
tossed about like a football from one point to another, having no
inherent stability.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The variety of the world will be fully enjoyed only when the mind
has gained an unshakeable status in the bliss of absolute Being. Otherwise, 
the very purpose of multiplicity, of the joyful, glorious variety
of creation, is undermined. If experience is only one-sided, if the mind
experiences only the variety of the relative, gross fields of life, then
it is clear that the values of relative life are not being supplemented
by the absolute state of Being. Such a one-sided life is due only to a
lack of knowledge of the art of living which alone can enable man to
unfold his full mental potential and naturally glorify all aspects of his
life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make this clear we shall first analyse man's full potential and
then see how the power of Being can be infused into different levels
of life so that advantage can be taken of all aspects of the art of living.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MAN'S FULL POTENTIAL
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that the nervous system of man is the most highly
developed in creation. With such a gift man should live the supreme
state of life - at the least a life without suffering and at the best a life
of absolute bliss in God-consciousness. God-consciousness is awareness
of the ultimate, omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent reality of
existence, the absolute Being. With God-consciousness a man is
constantly attuned to any supreme manifestation of absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the full potential of man we mean that a man should live life
to his maximum capacity on all levels physical, mental and spiritual.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the full potential of man on the physical plane is meant the
possibility of having a healthy body in which all the limbs, the senses
and the nervous system function normally in co-ordination with one
another. On the mental plane it means the ability of man to make full
use of his mental capacity, and on the spiritual plane it means man's
ability to live the value of spiritual Being in all fields of his daily life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man's full potential on these three planes of life also includes the
perfect co-ordination between the physical and mental planes and
between the mental and spiritual planes.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Full potential means a perfect co-ordination of the Divine with the
material levels of man's life, the functioning of the full capacity of the
mind, perfect:health and the value of divine life or God-consciousness
infused in the day-to-day life of man.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man does not generally use his mind fully. The conscious mind
is only an insignificant part of the total mind that a man possesses.
As long as he functions only on the ordinary level of conscious mind,
he is not using his full mental potential. Man's mind can be said
to be functioning normally only when he uses it to its full capacity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, the use of his full potential would enable a man to
think, speak and act in such a manner that every thought, word and
action would not only accomplish the maximum in material life but
would also become a means of his remaining in tune with almighty
God, thereby bringing His influence to all levels of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each human mind has the ability to include within its consciousness 
the field of the transcendental, absolute, divine Being. The whole
range of creation and the field of the Being lie within the scope of
human consciousness. Each individual can embrace the full cosmic
rife. Thus the full potential of man is on the level of the unlimited
potential of universal Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To live a normal human life is to live a life of divine consciousness,
God-consciousness. A normal human mind should function on human 
levels and yet have the status of universal cosmic mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cosmic consciousness should not be thought of as something far
beyond the reach of any ordinary man: it should be the normal
human consciousness. Any state below cosmic consciousness can only
be considered sub-normal human consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The full potential of man is such that it brings to every man this
blessed and graceful state of divine life in a natural and easy manner,
without effort, and maintains it through all the phases of daily life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The practice of transcendental meditation unfolds the full potential
of the Divine in man and brings human consciousness to the level of
God-consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The effect of this simple practice is to permeate life with unlimited 
creative energy and to harmonise the abstract, absolute values of
divine Being with the concrete, physical values of day-to-day life,
bringing life to a state of eternal freedom.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
HOW TO USE ONE'S FULL POTENTIAL
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that the boundaries of individual life are not restricted
to the boundaries of the body, nor to those of one's family
or one's home; they extend far beyond those spheres to the limitless
horizons of cosmic life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have also seen that man's full potential enables him to live
the supreme state of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of using one's full potential requires that life as a whole
should have a solid basis. Without this, life will be as unstable as a
building on a weak foundation. For stability a solid foundation is the
first requisite.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stability is the characteristic of the absolute state of life which
never changes and is the truth of life, the eternal Being. Life is stable
only in its absolute state.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Life in its relative stages is ever-changing, and those ever-changing
phases of life leave it without stability. Therefore, to be able to use
one's full potential the first step is to infuse stability into the everchanging 
phases of relative life. When the mind is supported by the
power of never-changing absolute Being all the ever-changing phases
of relative existence are strengthened by the power of stability. This
forms the basis for using one's full potential.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If life is not based on the stable status of absolute Being, then,
apart from being ever-changing in character, it will always remain
weak.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the art of strengthening a wave is to enable it to
contact deeper levels of water. A small wave on the surface of the
ocean may not be very powerful but the same wave becomes powerful 
when it is connected with deeper levels of water. If the wave is
to rise high enough to become powerful, the vertical activity of rising
must be supplemented by the horizontal activity of drawing in more
water at the base. Only in this way can it rise in an integrated manner.
If it fails to draw in more water as it rises higher, it becomes weak
at the crest and even a slight breeze shatters it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wave of individual life should not be confined to the surface
values of the ocean of eternal, absolute Being. The art of using one's
full potential requires that the surface value of relative life be supplemented 
by the power lying at the depth of the ocean of absolute Being,
so that the wave of individual life may gain the maximum possible
depth - the wave of relative experience and existence is taken to the
limit of absolute experience and existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one's full potential is unfolded in this way, then every phase
of life strengthens every other phase and life becomes strong and
powerful, more useful and worthwhile on all levels for oneself and
for others.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every wave on the sea has the opportunity to take in at its base as
much water as it likes and to gain infinite power. Similarly, each
individual has the opportunity to gain for himself the strength of
unlimited, eternal Being and to become as powerful as is humanly
possible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it is possible for a wave to enjoy the limitless strength of
the ocean, does it not amount to sheer waste if it is shattered by the
breeze. When the opportunity is open to every man of gaining unlimited 
power, intelligence, peace and happiness, is it not a waste of
life if he remains limited and weak.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of using one's full potential is the same as the art of shooting
an arrow: one begins by pulling the arrow back on the bow. As it is
drawn back it gains the maximum energy for going forward. If the
arrow is not drawn fully back the shot will be ineffective.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of using one's full potential consists in drawing the mind
back to the field of absolute Being before it emerges to face the gross
aspect of the relative fields of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunately, this art of living has been developed to bring the
most effective results in life, and all its glory is centred in a technique
for bringing the mind to the field of Being in a simple and effective
way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolute Being, the stable factor in life, is always beyond the field
of ever-changing phenomenal creation and experience.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ever-changing phase of relative existence must eternally remain 
ever-changing. It cannot be transformed into a never-changing
phase. This is relative life. But the subject within, the inner man, can
gain simultaneously a status in eternal, absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is how the never-changing Absolute can supplement the everchanging 
phenomenal phases of life, and these two together make life
complete.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man has two sides, left and right, and it is necessary that they
should both be used to full advantage. If the left side only is used,
the right side, remaining unused, becomes weak and the left becomes
over-strained by action. The right side, too, can feel strained through
remaining in a state of inactivity. Therefore, to live life fully it is
necessary for left and right to work together in co-operation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Absolute and the relative are the two phases of existence.
Unless they are brought together the Absolute remains transcendental, 
beyond the field of activity, out of sight and seemingly of no
practical value; while the field of relative life is over-strained by
constant activity and in its unstable, ever-changing status remains
weak.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the art of living which links together the never-changing Absolute 
of transcendental nature and the ever-changing field of relative
existence, enabling all the values of life to be lived in perfect harmony.
Both are brought together by the mind, just as the earth's fertility
and the tree are brought together by the root which draws nourishment 
from the one and supplies it to the other.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind proceeds to experience subtler states of thought
and transcendental Being, its full potentialityl unfolds and automatically 
becomes available for use in daily activities. By this process one
begins to make use of one's full potential in the fields of senses, body
and surroundings, and one lives life in completeness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
HOW TO MAKE FULL USE OF ONE'S SURROUNDINGS
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To understand the technique for making full use of the surroundings 
it is first necessary to understand how they are constituted.
They are not always the same: at home a man's surroundings are
different from those in his office.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surroundings are of two kinds: those which are consciously created 
and those which are created without the conscious knowledge of
the individual. For example, if a man builds a new house, he does so
consciously and intentionally. If he invites a friend to the house and
his friend finds out that there is an ulterior motive in the invitation,
the friend may become an enemy. The friend's enmity is the creation
and responsibility of the man who invited him, even though it was
not the man's intention to make an enemy of him.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking into this question more deeply, we find that the unintentional 
creation of surroundings is in accordance with the theory of
karma. Our present intentions and efforts have their origin in the
influence of the past. But we should remember that our present
surroundings are not only the result of the past, because the fruits of
our past actions have to be supplemented by our present intentions.
Therefore our surroundings are not only the result of our past but
the result of a combination of past and present.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the example of a man whose relationship with others is bad.
Many people with whom he is associated speak in of him and misunderstand 
his actions, although the man knows he has not harmed
anyone. This has to be understood as the result of past action. It is
nothing but his own creation returning to him in the present. Man has
to take his surroundings as they are, knowing that they are his own
creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we enjoy, it is the result of our own action and when we
suffer, again it is due to our own action. So whether we experience
joy or misery, our surroundings are not in themselves to blame.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When building a house, if we also plant a garden we enjoy it;
but if we do not plant a garden we just enjoy the warmth of the living
room without suffering from the lack of a garden. This is how we
make the best use of our surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we create our own surroundings, naturally we intend them
to assist us in obtaining what we desire. The technique for receiving
help from surroundings lies in our attitude to giving. If we want to
receive maximum help at all times, we must have an attitude of giving. 
It is a law of nature that if you want to receive you must give.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the life of a tree the root has the responsibility of taking the sap
from the earth surrounding it and of passing it on to the outer tree.
Only when it is prepared to do this is it able to take in the sap.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the sales manager in a factory continues to make sales, the production 
manager keeps up the production. If the product is not sold,
production also comes to a standstill. Production depends upon consumption.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is natural for a man to receive to the extent that he is in a position
to give. The mother gives to the child and receives from it in return;
the father gives all his love, wealth, strength and mind to his son and in
return receives the joy of his confidence, love and happiness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are open with a person, he will be open with you. If you
want love from someone, give your love to him. If you want kind
and sympathetic behaviour from someone, be kind and sympathetic
to him. If you want comfort from him, prove yourself comforting.
If you want admiration from others, do something to show your
admiration for them. If you are sincere in giving, you receive many
times over in return. The teacher learns by teaching; in obeying, the
student commands the respect of the teacher. If your son is readily
obedient to you he captures your heart as a natural return for his
obedience. If you are kind to a child, he will respond to you; if you
are harsh to him, he will revolt against you. This is action and reaction.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That action and reaction are equal is a scientifically established
truth. You react to someone in a certain way and he, in turn, reacts
to you. If he does not react to you, then nature will bring the reaction 
indirectly. If you hurt someone, even if he himself does not react
other agencies of nature will bring you the reaction. It is a law of
nature that as you sow, so you shall reap.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In whatever way you want surroundings to react, your behaviour
towards your surroundings must be in accordance with your wish. This
is the fundamental principle :for making the best use of the surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The laws of nature cannot be deceived; reaction will come. If a
man is jealous of you, you will find, when you search your heart,
that you have been jealous either of him or of someone else in the past.
Be kind to him and to others and your surroundings will be kind to
you; be loving to him and your surroundings will be loving to you.
Begin to doubt and your surroundings will begin to doubt you. If
you hate, surroundings begin to hate you. If your surroundmgs begin
to hate you do not blame the surroundings; blame your own inner
conscience.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is necessary to clear your conscience. Be compassionate and
sincere in your behaviour. Good outward behaviour is certainly of
great value in life but a pure inner conscience is of greater value still.
If you are clear in your conscience and are loving, kind and virtuous
to your fellow men, you will receive good behaviour naturally from
everyone and great joy from your surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have all these qualities and are clear in your conscience
and yet feel there is something wrong with your surroundings, then
take them as they come; they are the result of some action in the past.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you retaliate you lower yourself to the level of the wrong.
Rather let the wrong be just a drop in the ocean of your virtue. It is
a common saying that one should not resist evil. If you resist evil you
must stoop to that level of evil, and furthermore you are responsible
for the evil influence you produce by retaliating.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the impurities of the atmosphere find a refuge in the ocean of
purity in your heart, in the unfathomable joy of your inner pure
conscience. When you forgive, all nature enjoys your brilliance and
returns joy to you. Forgiveness, tolerance, purity of heart, sincerity,
love, kindness are the bases from which to enjoy and make full use
of the surroundings. This is the fundamental principle of giving.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surroundings are of two kinds - animate and inanimate, or living
and non-living. It may be said that there is nothing that is not living
in the universe; physics tells us that nothing is inert, everything is
vibration and activity. Nonetheless, in the field of relative existence
we do distinguish a man from a house, a dog from a garden. A house
and a garden we take to be inert and the dog and the man we take to
be living. Our purpose is to make the best use of both living and inert
surroundings and for this the basic principle is the same - the principle
of giving.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore in all walks of life, under all circumstances, in all kinds
of surroundings, animate or inanimate, it is necessary to have a loving,
kind and sympathetic heart. Our outward behaviour should be based
on that.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want your surroundings to be of the best use to you, be of
the best use to your surroundings. If you want your house to give
you joy and comfort, be joyful in it, bring to it beautiful things. If you
project love to the plants in your garden, they will reward you with
beautiful flowers to give you joy. If you cultivate within yourself a
natural state of kindness, compassion, love and forgiveness, you will
be rewarded a thousandfold by your surroundings. Develop these
qualities to the fullest capacity within yourself. If you can rise to this
level where human life has its full value you will receive the maximum
and make full use of your surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, we find there are two types of surroundings on any level:
immediate surroundings and surroundings that are distant and remote. 
The surroundings near to us are affected by the way we behave,
speak and act in relation to them. If a flower is placed in a bowl of
water it blooms and remains fresh. If, on the other hand, it is left to
wither on the ground in the dust it reflects our negligence. Thus the
surroundings near to us are directly affected by our behaviour. But
surroundings remote from us also react to our feelings and thoughts.
For instance, if we are in India and have a friend in America, his
feelings of heart and mind will be according to our feelings of heart
and mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thought waves are much more powerful than the waves of speech
and action. Through every thought, word and action we are creating
some wave in the atomsphere, but thought waves are especially penetrating. 
If we are joyful and full of kindness and love for the whole
world we receive love from every quarter.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen in detail how thought and action influence the whole
universe and we have also seen how the universe reacts to individual
thought and action. We create a quality of life in the atmosphere
according to the quality of our hearts. The technique for making full
use of all types of surroundings, whether near or remote, for our
best advantage, is to develop loving, forgiving and sympathetic
thoughts for all of them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we are guided by this principle of giving in order to receive,
the receiving will naturally be equal or more, because that which we
give returns to us from many parts of our surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that to unfold and make full use of one's own
human potential it is only necessary to be regular in the practice of
transcendental meditation. From direct experience of bliss-consciousness 
is gained that fullness of life to which all types of surroundings
will react in the most favourable way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make really full use of one's surroundings, it is necessary to be
a normal man, a fully grown man with a perfectly developed personality 
- a man of cosmic consciousness. It is only in this state that a
man receives full advantage from his surroundings because in this
state his heart and mind are established on the level of Being, from
which level the laws of nature are sustaining the evolution of all
things. Only from that level of cosmic consciousness can one really
give. When one lives on this supreme level of giving, then one is in a
position to receive likewise.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cosmic consciousness is the state where a man lives in the service
of the Divine. His thought, speech and action are guided naturally
by the divine will. He is an individual but he is a living instrument of
God. Whatever he does serves the cosmic life. He is by nature the
most obedient servant of the Divine. Once he has attained the state of
cosmic consciousness he need not do anything more in order to derive
the utmost from his surroundings. They will naturally be of full use to
him and of greatest value to others. Everything in his surroundings
will draw the maximum benefit from every other thing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the practice of transcendental meditation one automatically 
makes full. use of one's surroundings. This may appear to be
far-fetched but it is a true principle of life. In no other way is it possible 
to turn one's surroundings to one's maximum advantage. Those
who try to change their surroundings and convert them to their
advantage by force are recorded in history as having only partially
succeeded in their attempts. Even the greatest monarchs and dictators
the world has known were not able to make full use of their surroundings. 
They were unable to mould all circumstances to their wishes
because they had not developed themselves on all levels of life to
will the favour of the laws of nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is necessary to be in tune with nature, raising the level of consciousness 
so that it enters the realm of all harmony and peace which
lies in the eternal status of absolute, transcendental pure consciousness. 
Not by force, moral pressure or suggestion is it possible to
change surroundings or make full use of them for oneself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attempt by modern psychology to reconcile man with his
surroundings by improving his relationships through suggestion and
psychological training is doomed to failure because it has nothing
to do with the fundamentals of life. It is like an attempt to build a
real castle on a beach where only sand is available. Trying to shape
and improve human life through psychological suggestions, that
is, using only the material available in the conscious mind, is a shallow
and limited approach which cannot serve the real purpose of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;lf the petals of a flower start to wither, a skilled gardener waters
the root; he does not water the petals. If tension arises in a relationship,
very little can be gained by trying to reconcile those concerned on the
level of suggestion. Bad relationships can only be handled effectively
by improving the qualities of heart and mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen how quickly the conscious capacity of the mind can
be improved. It is well known that if someone is distressed because
of some tragedy, it is hard for him to derive comfort from all the
suggestions and goodwill by which others try to console him. But
if he begins to practice transcendental meditation, his mind rapidly
calms down, doubts begin to be dispelled from within, tension begins
to resolve and compassion shines. He is able to see the situation from
the broader vision of increased consciousness, and immediately he
finds himself forgiving, and tolerant of the situation which a few
minutes before was a terrible problem. The tragedy is the same, the
circumstances are the same. At one moment he fails to derive advantage 
from his surroundings and is miserable but at the next, by virtue 
of raising the level of his consciousness, he immediately begins to
enjoy his surroundings and derives the maximum advantage for
himself and for others.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To make full use of the surroundings it is first necessary to raise
the level of consciousness; this is accomplished by the regular practice
of transcendental meditation, and all surroundings and circumstances
will by nature become helpful and be used fully to the best advantage 
of all creation, near and distant, animate and inanimate.
HOW TO MAKE FULL USE OF THE ALMIGHTY POWER OF NATURE
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In determining the full potential of man it has been found that
whereas the individual personality appears to be bound by time, space
and causation, the boundaries of an individual life actually touch the
unlimited horizon of eternal life. It has been shown that a man is not
only a part of divine intelligence, his individual life not only a wave
on the surface of the ocean of eternal life, but that he also has the
ability to fathom the unlimited field of cosmic life and derive the
maximum benefit from the absolute power of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been seen that not only does it lie within the capacity of each
individual to contact and live absolute Being in his day-to-day life,
but also that it is simple and easy for him to do so. And it has been
seen2 that it is easy for each individual to be in a position to control
all the laws of nature and to make use of the almighty power of nature
according to his desire, need or convenience.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it is possible for the value of transcendental Being to be infused 
into the very nature of a man's mind, irrespective of its condition 
in the waking, dreaming or deep sleep states, then he can gain the
level of Being which is the source of inspiration for all the laws of
nature; then he can place himself in a position where he is able to use
naturally the almighty power of nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This may sound strange to those who have little understanding
of cosmic law or experience of Being because, for a man who is
gripped by the tensions of day-to-day life and who finds before him
many complicated and unsolved problems, the information that he
can use the almighty power of nature is beyond his imagination. He
will most likely consider it a flight of fancy which has no bearing on
practical life. But it is the experience of many people all over the
world that in spite of having undergone much suffering in life they
have been able to rise above all miseries and tension and have been
able to make their circumstances favourable to themselves.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To use the almighty power of nature it is necessary to put oneself
in the hands of that almighty power. For the son of a millionaire to
be able to take advantage of his father's position in life it is only
necessary for him to show willingness to obey the father. The love
and sympathy of the son for his father and respect for what he represents 
will bring the influence and strength of the father to the son.
In the same way one is able to make use of the almighty power of
nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a man is able to submit himself to nature then nature will react
to his needs. Almighty nature is all-powerful and all-loving, for all
the laws of nature are for the creation and evolution of all beings and
creatures throughout the cosmos. There is no greater kindness than
the kindness of nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a man, because of some misdeeds, seems to be punished by
nature and to suffer as a result, this is also the manifestation of the
kindness and helpfulness of nature If a child has smeared himself with
dirt, his mother will wipe off the dirt. Even if the child dislikes the
process of being cleaned, nevertheless it is good for him because the
dirt could harm his skin. The child, however, does not understand
the harm that the dirt might cause and he rebels against his mother's
efforts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a surgeon operates he uses his knife in all kindness, but he
can only start operating for the patient's benifit after the patient has
entrusted himself completely to his care. If one submits oneself fully
to the will of nature, nature helps one and in this way one begins to
make use of its almighty power.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is certainly not possible for man to understand all the laws of
nature intellectually, nor is it possible to know the intention of nature
in a certain place at a certain time for a specific individual. So an
intellectual understanding of the laws of nature, when attempting to
put oneself in accordance with the natural flow of evolution, is quite
impossible. The eternal process of creation and evolution of the multiple 
variety of life is so complex and diversified that only an almighty
intelligence could possibly conceive the unlimited universe, set it in
motion and maintain it. But there is one fact about creation which
can make it possible for any man to live completely attuned with
nature. It is that all the laws of nature function in the direction of
evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The individual can consciously place himself in this eternally
evolving stream of nature, thereby allowing himself to be carried
forward by the natural flow of cosmic evolution. This inevitable
flow of nature is a flow into which the individual can consciously put
himself to let nature work on him for his evolution in accord with
the natural flow of cosmic evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to the great tradition of the yogis of India and to the blessings 
of Shri Guru Deva we have this possibility. A simple system
of transcendental meditation offers mankind a technique whereby
the individual consciousness can naturally be maintained within the
flow of evolution and by which the evolution of the individual can
even be accelerated.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the simple way of making use of the almighty power of
nature. In losing oneself and gaining the power of the Almighty, one's
life finds its fulfilment. From this springs the ideology of devotion
and surrender. The basis of it all is that the life of the individual is
both relative and absolute. The individual is already in contact with
absolute Being, only this contact has to be brought to a conscious
level.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that the practice of transcendental meditation requires 
from the individual only innocence and simplicity. He must
be devoid of any intellectual play or emotional twist. Simplicity and
innocence are already deeply rooted in the very nature of each
individual. This meditation is a technique for surrendering to the
almighty power of nature and arriving at the absolute, eternal field
of divine intelligence. Having reached that plane, the individual begins
quite automatically to enjoy the power of nature for his own good.
This is only possible on the level of cosmic law ;it cannot be from the
level of human understanding.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The field of surrender is never on the level of thinking: it is
only on the level of Being. Many who want to surrender to God or
to nature try to surrender on the level of thought. In this way they
make a mood of surrender to God, and mood-making is always on
the conscious thinking level.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless the conscious mind extends to the level of Being, the individual 
does not enjoy the power of the Almighty. Just thinking:
I have surrendered to God, and making a mood of that surrender
creates dullness of mind in the individual and deprives him of the
opportunity to advance. True surrender to God cannot be on the
level of thought. It is always on the level of Being and, unless the
level of Being is consciously gained by the mind, any attempt to
make a mood of surrender will only result in a state of fanciful passivity 
and will not be genuinely in tune with the almighty power of
nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unless the conscious mind transcends thinking and feeling it
cannot arrive at the plane of Being. Unless the individual consciousness 
is infused with the state of divine Being, surrender does not
result.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ideology of surrender is not easy to grasp intellectually. Surrender 
to the almighty will of God, surrender to almighty nature, is
the most advanced ideology in life. If one really surrenders, one loses
the petty individuality of the time-space-causation-bound mind and
gains the unlimited, eternal status of absolute Being. This is possible
only in a state of transcendental consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The words 'surrender to the will of God' are very significant and
provide a direct way for the individual to gain almighty power.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But because an easy technique for transcending the limits of relative 
existence was lacking, this expression has had, to all intents and
purposes, no practical meaning for centuries past. It has come to
express merely an abstract, metaphysical or mystical view of life.
But with the practice of transcendental meditation, these words begin
to have significant practical meaning. They are no longer shrouded in
mysticism. They are now a truth of daily experience, and through
this experience comes the ability to make use of the power of the
Almighty.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To those unaware of the practice of transcendental meditation, the
idea of making use of the almighty power of nature remains only a
fascinating and fanciful thought. However, through this meditation,
the idea of making full use of this almighty power becomes practicable. 
For the son of a millionaire, the use of the power of his father's
wealth should be natural and normal. Similarly for man, the son of
Almighty God, it should be natural and normal to make use of His
power in nature, and this is within the scope of each individual.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the regular practice of transcendental meditation brings a
man to that condition in which he finds himself placed where the
almighty power of nature works for him. It is not that he is required
to make use of it, but that he is given its full advantage. Without rising 
to a state of cosmic consciousness, or at least putting himself
on the path, it is simply not possible for him to make use of even the
partial strength of nature, let alone its almighty power.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fortunate is he who has established himself in a natural harmony
with cosmic Being. The whole of nature moves in accordance with
his needs, all his desires are in accord with the cosmic purpose, and
his life serves the cause of cosmic evolution. He is in the hands of
God for the purpose of God, and God is for him and his purpose.
He uses the almighty power of nature, and nature uses his life for the
glorious purpose of creation and evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some who try to use the supernatural power of creation
by contacting the spirit world through a medium or by invoking
spirits. This represents a very limited level of strength because no
spirit is in possession of the total power of nature. There may be
spirits more powerful than man, but invoking these spirits or acting
as a medium for them is not a practice to be encouraged. There are
two reasons for this. First, the power gained through these spirits is
an insignificant, infinitesimal fraction of the power of almighty nature; 
secondly, to receive this fraction of the power of nature one
must give oneself completely to that spirit's influence. To become a
spirit's medium one must give oneself to it completely or else it will
not co-operate. Instead of giving oneself completely to a spirit and
only gaining a small amount of power, one should give oneself
completely to the divine Being through transcendental meditation
and gain the unlimited, almighty power of nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you invest your money in a business, why not invest it in
a business which will bring you the maximum profit in the minimum
time? Contacting spirits in the hope of contacting God is a mistaken
practice. No one can surrender to God through the medium of spirits.
Those who try to achieve these supernatural or psychic powers are misguided. They themselves are not at fault. They are seekers for something higher than that which man's life apparently presents; the wrong is only in the lack of proper guidance. Man's aspiration to contact the higher powers and accomplish great things in life is legitimate, but to contact spirits is an attempt at a very low level and will not accomplish very much.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have never been enough teachers of transcendental meditation, and that is why spiritualistic and similar teachings have become fairly popular, especially in Western countries.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The desire to gain higher powers has led many people, lacking
proper guidance, to try anything out of the commonplace. In order that people may receive the right technique for making full use of the
almighty power of nature it is necessary that large numbers of teachers
of meditation be established everywhere. This will make it possible
for the life of all people to be set naturally on a sound foundation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is yet another type of person who, in his enthusiasm to
develop higher power within himself, takes to practices of concentration 
and control of the mind. After much time spent in these practices 
he seems to achieve something in line with his aspirations, but the
great effort put into them is out of all proportion to the small advantage 
gained. All this amounts to a waste of human aspiration and a
waste of the great possibilities open to man on the way to higher
powers.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there is a fort which commands a whole territory, it is wise to
go straight to the fort and capture it. Then everything in the surrounding 
territory, all its gold and diamond mines and other riches, will
come naturally into one's possession. But if one sets out to capture
each mine separately, all one's time and strength may well be exhausted 
in securing even one.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All psychic powers naturally belong to the field of Being since
there is a way of directly contacting and becoming familiar with the
field of Being, all the psychic powers and all the powers of nature
belonging to almighty, eternal Being are available. Therefore, when
there is a chance for everyone to contact Being in an easy manner,
it is both unwise and a waste of time to practise any form of concentration 
or control of mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is not this an inducement to all seekers of power to start the practice 
of transcendental meditation and raise the level of their consciousness 
to the plane of cosmic consciousness They will gain the
advantage of being placed in a position where, without intention
or effort, the almighty power of nature will be at their disposal and
will serve naturally the purpose of their lives. All their needs and those
of their associates and surroundings will be fulfilled in the most
magnanimous and glorious way.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are other people who have been led to believe that the
power of positive thinking is the greatest power in nature. They are told
to base their lives on positive thinking. It is foolish to base one's
life on the level of thought. Thinking can never be a profound basis
for living. Being is the natural basis. Instead of wasting one's time in
positive thinking and waiting for the positive thought to materialise,
it is better to be.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The state of Being realised through the practice of transcendental
meditation gives the greatest status to life by bringing the possibility
of the power of almighty nature into day-to-day practical life. Thinking, 
on the other hand, is only imaginary. We shall see that it is
necessary to be in order to make thinking powerful. The technique
for achieving the state of Being is also the technique for making thought
powerful.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While positive thoughts are better than negative thoughts, if we
base our life on POSitiVe thinking it will be only on an imaginary basis.
Positive thinking may have its value as against negative thinking but
it has little value when compared with the power of Being. To try
to attain the powers of nature from the basis of thinking is to delude
oneself. If anyone starts to think: I am a king, he may delude himself
with the idea to such an extent that he begins to feel he is a king,
but that feeling of kingship will be far removed from the reality of
being a king.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The philosophy of positive thinking must be replaced by the philosophy 
of Being. It is not the science of mind that is the highest and
most usefull science of life: it is the science of Being which has the
supreme status among the sciences of life and living. To live in the
hope of gaining abundance and fulfilment of life through positive
thinking simply amounts to running after mirages or building castles
in the air.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mind must be supplemented by the power of Being; it is the
power of Being, not the mind, which is the real basis of life. All the
material sciences are in the relative field. Mind is also in the relative
field of existence. The science of mind, like any other science, is
merely a science of the relative fields of life. It is the science of Being
which is the science of the absolute, eternal existence. It is the science
of Being which can bring stability, intelligence, the almighty power
of nature and the eternal bliss of the Absolute into the relative fields
of day-to-day life. It is the power of Being which must be acquired,
and it is easy for all people in the world to acquire it even in the midst
of the hustle and bustle of modern life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus it is in the science of Being that we find the principle of
making full use of the almighty power of nature; and the technique
is the regular practice of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every field of life should be handled and lived in such n way
that the maximum benefit is gained for the individual and the universe. 
We will consider the different fields of life and find the technique 
which makes it possible to use them to the best advantage.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being, as we have seen, is the basic element of life. It is of transcendental 
nature and ordinarily It has Its value in a field beyond the obvious 
features of day-to-day life. The art of Being implies that the
value of Being should be used more thoroughly for the good of the
individual and the universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being means that not only is the value of Being not lost
in the complexities of life, but It is naturally and fully retained in all
spheres, under all circumstances, in all states of consciousness and is
used to glorify all aspects of life and to lead to fulfilment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The different aspects of life are the nervous system, body, mind,
senses, surroundings, karma, breathing, thinking, speaking, experiencing 
and behaving. The three states of consciousness are waking,
dreaming and sleeping.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being exists even without the art of living the Being, because
nothing could exist without It. What could there be without Being?
Being is the basis of the existence of everything, even though it is
hidden behind the obvious.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nature of Being is bliss-consciousness; It is concentrated happiness 
of all absolute nature and permanent status. Therefore the art
of being means that the concentrated state of happiness should be lived
constantly under all circumstances. The art of being demands that at least
Being should not be lost and that normally It should dominate life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means that by nature life is blissful, naturally free from suffering, 
misery, tension, confusion and disharmony. All spheres of life thinking, 
speaking, acting and behaving - should become and remain
permeated with a natural awareness of Being, so that life may be lived
in the full value of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being is, therefore, a technique to fathom Being in the
innermost levels of one's own life and then to draw It out from the
transcendental field of unmanifested nature into relative existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus the art of being consists of a technique which has two aspects.
First it explores the region of Being by transferring the conscious
mind from the gross, relative field of experience to the field of unmanifest 
Being and then it brings the mind out infused with the value
of Being. Thus the art of being, or the technique of gaining the state
of Being, lies in contacting and naturally living the Being. A techniquc 
or an art necessarily means a process performed and accomplished
without strain. Transcendental meditation is a practical technique for
the art of being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In considering the scope of the art of being we will take the different 
aspects of life and examine them in detail.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THINKING AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that when Being is naturally maintained in the mind
all thoughts are on the level of Being. This is the art of being while
thinking, where thinking and Being co-exist.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When thinking is established on the level of Being, Being is
maintained naturally through the process of thought. So the art of
being with regard to thinking necessitates the infusion of the value
of transcendental Being into the nature of the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is the source of thinking. The process of thinking draws
the mind away from its own essential nature, the Being. So we find
that the process of thought is opposed to the state of Being. This is
the reason why the mind is only able to arrive at the state of Being
when it transcends the subtlest stage of thinking during transcendental 
meditation. When it begins thinking again it must emerge from
the transcendental field of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus the conscious mind is either engaged in the process of thinking 
or is in the transcendental state of pure Being. Thinking is,
therefore, like a challenge to Being. This is, however, only because the
mind has not been trained to maintain simultaneously its state of
Being and the process of thinking. Generally speaking, the mind's
ingrained habit of usually remaining in the field of thinking is the
reason why the process of thinking appears to be opposed to the state
of Being. When, by the practice of transcendental meditation, the
conscious mind reaches the source of thought and becomes familiar
with the state of Being, then the state of pure Being is so blissful and
harmonious that the mind will not part with it under any circumstances. 
It is then that the nature of the mind is transformed into the
very nature of Being so that, while yet remaining n thinking mind,
it is naturally established in the field of Being. This is the art of being
in the field of thought.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the mind is not established in the State Of Being the process of
thinking is, as it were, lifeless, and when the mind is not familiar with
Being the force of thought is very weak. The resultant activity, therefore, 
will be weak, accomplishment will remain unsatisfying and the
fulfilment of life will not be gained. So the art of being while thinking 
is the basis of all accomplishment and fulfilment in life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we consider the art of being while thinking, we must make
it clear that the art of being lies in creating a condition of Being in the
mind, and this is done when attention is brought to the transcendental
field of Being. It cannot be accomplished by any other means.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any attempt to become aware of Being without bringing the
conscious mind to the field of transcendental Being can only lead
to the conscious mind cherishing the thought of Being. And when the
conscious mind cherishes the thought of Being it is devoid of the state
of Being, because the thought of Being is not the state of Being. Any
attempt to hold the thought of Being in the hope of maintaining
awareness of Being on the conscious level will only divide the mind
between the thought of Being and another thought. The practice of
cherishing the thought of Being will not cultivate the state of Being
in the mind neither will it allow the full mind to be engaged in any
other thought. This means that the influence of Being will not be profound, 
nor will the thinking be forceful.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are some misguided schools of thought which encourage
seekers of truth to try to maintain Being on a conscious level while
engaged in thinking, speaking or acting. Any attempt to maintain
Being or to try to maintain self-awareness on the level of conscious
thinking without first allowing the mind to transcend is a vain attempt
to live Being in life. It only creates an illusion of the realisation of
Being during thought or activity. Those aspiring to truth and those
who wish to make thinking powerful through the power of Being,
should be aware of the mental effects of only thinking about Being.
Being is a state of life which cannot be lived by simply thinking about
it. Being is lived naturally without having to think about it. The reason
why we fail to live this natural state of Being is that we are not sufficiently 
acquainted with the transcendental field of life. The only
way to achieve this is to transfer the attention from the gross to the
subtle states of thought so that the field of Being is reached consciously. 
Through this regular practice, the art of being in the field
of thinking is attained.
SPEAKING AND THE ART OF BEING;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking is the gross or manifested aspect of thinking. Speaking
requires more energy than thinking, and therefore the process of
speaking engages the mind more than does the process of thinking.
So the art of being on the level of speaking is necessarily a greater art
than on the level of thinking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While dealing with the main principle for enlarging the conscious
capacity of the mind', we have seen that thought starts at the subtlest
level of consciousness and becomes bigger and bigger until it is
eventually appreciated on the conscious level as n full thought. The
same process of the thought bubble becoming bigger continues until
the thought, appreciated as a thought on the conscious level, is expressed
as speech.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basically, the process of speaking is in no way different from that
of thinking. The only difference is in scale, because the energy consumed 
in speaking is greater than in thinking. The art of maintaining
Being on the level of speaking is more demanding than the art of
maintaining Being on the level of thinking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus it is clear that the art of maintaining Being on the level of
speaking is basically the art of maintaining Being on the level of
thinking. The difference is in the intensity of practice; greater practice
of transcendental meditation is needed to maintain Being on the level
of speaking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When, with continued practice, the state of Being begins to be
maintained at the level of speaking, all speech naturally flows from
Being and is, therefore, naturally in accordance with cosmic law.
Speech then produces an influence congenial to all the laws of nature.
This is how Being begins to be naturally maintained at the level of
speech, and when speech supplements and reinforces the functioning
of the laws of nature it becomes an aid not only to the well-being and
evolution of the individual life but also to cosmic life, maintaining
harmony and rhythm in nature. In this way the art of being on the
level of speaking results in great harmony everywhere.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, it should be borne in mind that any conscious attempt to
hold the thought of Being while engaged in the process of speaking
results in dividing the mind between the thought of Being and the
process of speaking. Part of the mind is engaged in maintaining the
thought of Being, while part is engaged in speaking; this division
of the mind produces retardation of speech.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are philosopher-teachers who instruct their followers to
maintain awareness while speaking. By trying to maintain on the
conscious level of the mind an inner awareness of Being while speaking, 
the processes both of thought and speech are impeded. This
leads to retardation of activity and produces dullness in life. This is
not the art of being while speaking. The art of being at the level of
speech lies in the regular practice of transcendental meditation, which
naturally maintains Being in fullness on the level of the mind at all
times.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BREATHING AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is breathing which lies between individual existence and cosmic
life, between the individual stream of life and the eternal cosmic
existence. It is as if breathing starts as an individual stream from the
cosmic ocean of Being. Breathing in its subtlest aspect is referred to as
prana. Prana is the vibratory nature of Being, which creates the manifested 
life-stream of individuals from the unmanifested ocean of
Being. When transcendental, omnipresent, absolute, cosmic Being
vibrates into manifested streams of life by virtue of prana, which is
Its own nature, prana assumes the role of breathing and maintains
the individual life-stream and keeps it connected at its source with the
cosmic life of the Absolute.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At every rise of breath cosmic prana receives the identity of individual 
life-force, and at every fall of breath the stream of individual
life contacts cosmic Being, so that between the fall and the rise of
breath the individual life is in communion with cosmic Being. This
is how breathing on the one hand produces individual life from cosmic
life and on the other maintains the harmony of the individual with
cosmic Being. The art of being as applied to breathing means that
even during the process of breathing the contact of the individual lifestream 
with the eternal life of cosmic Being is not broken.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How is this accomplished?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To discover the formula for maintaining the state of Being during
the process of breathing, it is first necessary to see how breathing starts
and what makes breath, or prana, emerge from Being. We have said
that prana is the vibratory nature of Being. But how and why does
the vibratory nature of Being adopt a particular pattern, giving rise
to a specific stream of individual life by virtue of breathing
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something more than prana is needed, however, to bring forth the
life of a particular individual. What is responsible, other than prana,
for the set pattern of breathing?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know it is the earth's fertility which maintains a tree. But no
amount of fertility is able to produce any tree unless the seed of the
tree is there. It is the seed which determines the tree's pattern; without
it, the fertility has no medium through which to express itself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let us think of fertility as transcendental Being and the tree as the
individual stream of life. Being is eternally present, but in order to
have a specific pattern of individual life Being needs the seed of that
pattern. Without a specific seed no specific individual life can be manifested 
out of unmanifested, omnipresent Being. What is the seed of the
individual through which the Omnipresent by Its own nature, prana,
becomes manifested into an individual life-stream,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The seed of individual life is like the seed of the tree, which is
nothing but unnanifested fertility in its most subtly evolved expression.
Passing through all cycles of evolution, this fertility reaches the highest
evolutionary state in a fully grown tree where it appears as a seed.
Thus the seed signifies the tree at its subtlest development and is
fertility in its most concentrated state. Then that seed attracts more
fertility and grows into a tree again.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being expresses Itself as prana, on which is based the growth of
a thought, which in turn develops into a desire leading to action. And
when the action is completed, the fruit of the action marks the full
growth of the tree of thought or desire. The experience of the fruit
of an action leaves an impression which, like the concentrated seed,
is capable of giving rise to future desires and actions. So we find that
the cycle of seed and tree is like the cycle of thought, desire, action and the fruit of action and its impression. Here the seed is like a thought, and the soil from which it draws its nourishment is Being, which lies at the basis of thought. It could well be said, for the sake of understanding, that Being grows or manifests as a thought, evolves into action and having evolved further as the fruit of action, becomes concentrated into an impression and regains the state from which It began to manifest. This analogy helps us to visualise the stream of
individual life emerging from universal life by virtue of prana.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Omnipresent Being of unmanifested nature, having manifested
as a thought and gone through all the stages of its evolution, reaches
its climax in the fruit of action, which in its turn becomes the seed
for future thought. By virtue of the seed-thought, Being begins to
express Itself in the stream of an individual life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we see how Being expresses Itself in different degrees of
manifestation and passes through different stages of evolution to
arrive at a point where It is capable of becoming the seed for future
life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that prana is the vibratory nature of Being. Unmanifested 
Being does not need any outside instrumentality to vibrate.
It does so by Its own nature. In fact, to maintain Itself as eternal, absolute 
Being while vibrating and sustaining the transitory levels of
existence, life after life, is Its true nature. The true nature of Being
is to maintain Its eternal status as absolute Being and because of the
oneness of life, to be a basis for the ever-changing aspects of manifested, 
relative existence. So when prana manifests, Being vibrates and
in vibrating assumes the role of a particular pattern of breathing to
produce a specific pattern of individual life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The individual seed of life is the unfulfilled karma of the past life
of man. The sum total of all unfulfilled desires from a previous life
is the seed which moulds vibrating Being into the specific life-stream
of an individual. So prana, in conjunction with desire, forms the mind.
And prana, devoid of its association with the mind, forms matter.
This is how the subjective and objective aspects of individual life come
into existence. Individual life is essentially Being. As in the life of
a tree it is the sap which expresses itself in different aspects of the tree,
so in the life of an individual it is Being which expresses Itself in
different aspects of life and living. Just as it is the seed which shapes the
pattern of a tree, so in an individual life it is the impression of experiences 
in a past life which shapes Being into the specific pattern of
individual life-force or prana.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we find that prana or breathing - its gross aspect - is the
fundamental aspect of an individual's life and is the link between the
individual life-stream and the ocean of cosmic life-energy. By virtue 
of mind in conjunction with prana the whole stream of individual
life is set in a specific pattern.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being as applied to breathing lies in maintaining the
value of Being in the nature of the mind, because breathing is the
result of a combination of prana and mind, and prana and mind are
not two completely different things.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mind includes within itself the presence of prana; without prana
the mind could not exist, and without the mind prana is simply the
nature of Being, something of absolute value beyond relative life.
Therefore to maintain Being on the level of breathing, it is first
necessary to bring Being to the level of the mind. When, with the
practice of transcendental meditation, the mind becomes saturated
with Being, breathing is on the level of Being. Breathing is found to
be in harmony with the rhythm of nature, and the individual life
whose breathing has been transformed to the level of Being, breathes
to the harmony and rhythm of cosmic life. Breathing then gains
the subtle state of vibrating prana.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The breathing of an individual is thus in harmony with the nature
of cosmic Being, the level of prana. The art of being as applied to
breathing is the art of raising the status of the individual to the level
of eternal, cosmic Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXPERIENCING AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The experiencer experiences the object when the object is connected through the senses with his mind. The object, coming into contact with the senses of experience, leaves an impression on the mind, and the mind's essential nature is overshadowed.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the process of experience is a process which overshadows Being. This is called identification of Being with the object. It is as if the 'I' becomes identified with outward objects and loses its essential nature.
Thus we find that an experience draws the experiencer away from his
own state of Being. The art of being on the level of experience means
that the experience of an object does not overthrow the status of Being
in the mind; that is, the mind is able to maintain the state of Being
while experiencing the object.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen how the mind begins to maintain the pure state
of Being together with the experience of an object. We have also
seen how Being begins to be maintained at the level of experience or
perception, the experiencer remaining unbound by the impact of
experience. The experiencer lives in the complete freedom of fullness
of Being, at the same time experiencing the outer world around him.
In a state where Being is fully maintained the process of experience
becomes powerful, and the experience of the object becomes deeper
and fuller than before. This art of being on the level of experience is
natural in a fully integrated life where one is able to live all values
of the transcendental, absolute bliss-consciousness of Being together
with experiences of the various aspects of relative creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the art of being on the level of experience which keeps the
life of the individual integrated with cosmic life. The purpose of individual 
life is fulfilled in the art of being on the level of experience.
Without this, when the process of experience brings the subject into
contact with an object, the subject becomes so fully identified with
the object that the impression of its value becomes very strong in the
mind. This impression of the experience is held fast in the mind as a
seed of future desire for a similar experience. This is how the cycle
of experience, impression and desire continues, resulting in the cycle
of birth and death.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To understand the cycle of birth and death caused by impressions
of experience it should first be understood that the cause of rebirth
is the unfulfilled desires of past life. If a man wants to accomplish
this or that and fails to do so before the body ceases to function, he
dies unfulfilled. Because of this the inner man, the mind, goes to
create another body through which that desire from a past life may be
fulfilled.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus it is one's own desire that is the cause of rebirth. When a
man is born, he is born with the impressions of past experiences
deeply rooted in his mind. These impressions serve as the seeds of
desires. The cycle of experience, impression and desire takes a man
from birth to birth; the cycle of birth and death continues until the
cycle of experience and impression is broken.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The maintenance of Being on the level of experience does not
allow an object to make a deep impression on the mind; the impression 
is just enough to give the experience, just enough to allow
perception. Because the mind is full of the value of Being, and Being
is in Its nature bliss-consciousness, impressions of a transitory experience 
naturally fail to make a deep impression on the mind. The
impression is not deep enough to act as the seed for future action.
Just as the tongue, saturated with the taste of the concentrated sweetness 
of honey, is unable to register an impression of other varieties
of sweetmeat because the taste they offer is not as sweet as that of the
honey, so the mind, filled with the bliss of Being, feels so contented
that although it experiences the objects, their values fail to register a
deep impression.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Being is maintained, the impression of an object on the
mind is just enough to give an experience. It is like the impression
of a line drawn on water which is simultaneously erased. When Being
is not established in the mind, the impression made by an object is like
the impression of a line cut into stone, difficult to erase.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mind without the value of Being is always in bondage to experience, 
the cycle of impression, desire and action. It is the technique
of transcendental meditation which establishes Being in the mind and
brings fulfilment to the art of being on the level of experience.
HEALTH AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Good health means existence in harmony with evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The simple fact that Being is the never-changing, eternal phase
of existence and that It pervades the diverse forms of phenomenal
creation gives us the hope of bringing all the diversified phases of
our lives into harmony by co-ordinating their values with the value
of absolute Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All suffering in life would be alleviated if Being were to be established 
on the conscious level of life where discord and disunity prevail. 
Since there is a way to establish Being on the level of mind, body
and surroundings, perfect health is possible at all levels.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The all-pervading, eternal existence of Being is the basis of the
body, mind and surroundings of the individual, as the sap is the basis
of the trunk, branches, leaves and fruit of a tree. But when the sap
fails to reach the surface levels of the tree, then its outer aspects begin
to suffer and wither away. Likewise, when Being is not brought to
the surface level of life, the outer aspects of life begin to suffer.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If health and harmony are to be enjoyed, the transcendental value
of Being must be brought out and infused into all aspects of life:
body, mind and surroundings. It is also necessary to establish healthy coordination 
between them.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The one thing common to all these aspects of life is Being. So we
shall consider how the value of Being can be brought to the surface
level of mind, body and the surroundings so that co-ordination is
established between them by the link of Being; or alternatively, how
the values of mind, body and surroundings can be brought to the
level of Being. Either way the purpose of health will be served and
harmony will be established on all levels, leading to integration of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
MIND AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being as applied to the mind means that the value of
Being is retained by the mind in all circumstances. When the mind
thinks or experiences, the thought or experience does not overshadow
the mind's essential nature. The mind holds Being naturally while
engaged in thinking or experiencing. Not allowing the mind to be
overshadowed by any thought or experience is said to be the art of
being on the level of the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the full mind is acting, the overshadowing influence of
thought and experience is at a minimum; even when the mind is
deeply engaged in thinking and experiencing, the experience or
thought does not overshadow its essential nature. This state of mind
brings eternal freedom in life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is yet another factor which is important in respect of Being
and the mind. When Being is on the level of the mind, the mind's
flow of thought or experience is in accordance with the laws of nature.
We have discussed how, in thinking and experiencing, the natural
flow of the mind can be in accord with the laws of nature. Thus, while
the thought is forceful and the experience complete and deep, the
influence of the thought and experience on the individual and his
surroundings is in the natural stream of evolution and both the individual 
and the universe gain.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being on the level of the mind means that Being is maintained 
by the mind in any state of consciousness. If the mind is in the
wakeful state, Being is lived together with all experiences; if the mind is
in a dream state, Being is not overshadowed; if the mind is in a deep
sleep state, Being is not lost. Being permeates the mind in every state.
This is accomplished through bringing Being to the level of the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the mind to maintain Being during the day's activities it is
first necessary for it to become acquainted with the pure state of Being.
Being is of transcendental nature; It is absolute consciousness. By
the practice of transcendental meditation the conscious mind fathoms the deeper levels of the thought process and eventually transcends the subtlest thought to arrive at and gain the state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, transcendental meditation is the art of bringing the conscious mind to the level of Being, or of bringing Being within the range of the conscious mind. When, with continued practice, the mind becomes more and more familiar with Being until eventually It is rooted in its very nature, then even when the mind is engaged with external surroundings Being remains permanently on the level of the conscious mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This art of bringing Being to the level of the mind simultaneously
enlarges the conscious capacity of the mind and enables the full mind
to function. It has the advantage of bringing into action all the potentialities 
of the mind; nothing remains hidden, nothing remains subconscious, 
everything becomes conscious. This makes each thought
a very powerful thought. Again, while considering cosmic law, we
have seen that when the mind reaches the field of Being it is naturally
set in rhythm with all the laws of nature and in tune with the process
of cosmic evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the nature of Being is absolute bliss-consciousness, the
mind becomes filled with It and everlasting happiness reaches the
conscious level of the mind. Being is eternal and permanent, imperishable 
and unchanging. Therefore the imperishable, eternal, unchanging
aspect of Being becomes infused into the very nature of the mind.
Such a mind is stable, unwavering and steady, and at the same time
blissful, contented, self-contained and alert.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because absolute Being is the source of all thought and all creation,
when the conscious mind reaches that level it comes into contact
with the unlimited creative intelligence of cosmic life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind becomes attuned to the field of Being it gains
the source of unlimited energy. Such a powerful, energetic mind
naturally has very powerful thoughts. Each thought stimulates the
nervous system with vitality and vigour, putting it to sustained, powerful 
activity, which in turn stimulates its end-organ, the body, with such
force and fixity of purpose that immediately and without strain the
thought is translated into positive action. The possibility of thus
materialising as thought is so great that each action becomes forceful.
This is how the art of bringing Being to the level of the mind affects
the individual in his practical everyday life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is necessary to know that the whole process of transcendental
meditation consists in experiencing subtle states of thinking, and that
because thinking depends primarily upon the physical state of the nervous 
system any factor which influences the physical condition of the
nervous system directly influences the process of meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The physical state of the nervous system is nourished and maintained
by the processes of eating, drinking and breathing. Activity and rest
also have an influence. It is obvious, therefore, that if all factors are properly 
adjusted to maintain the ideal physical state of the nervous system,
the practice of transcendental meditation will be ideally successful.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one eats unsuitable food or breathes unsuitable air, creating a
dullness in the nervous system, or if one engages in activities which
result of fatigue and tension, then naturally the mind will not be able
to fathom the deeper levels of the thought process, meditation will
become less effective and the infusion of Being into the nature of the
mind will be unduly delayed. Therefore it is highly important that
care be taken in the selection of food, drink and air.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With regard to discrimination in the matter of food and drink,
it is obvious to those who have made a study of the subject that unwise 
eating and the drinking of alcohol are very detrimental to the
over-all well-being of a man. But this does not mean that one should
suddenly make radical changes in dietary habits. It is enough if one
changes gradually.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE INFLUENCE OF FOOD
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Food has a very great influence on the mind because everything we
eat and drink is transported by the blood which sustains the nervous
system. Therefore the quality of food has a great deal to do with
the quality of the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from the quality of material in the food, it is important how that food has been earned. When a man earns his livelihood by honest means the food has good influence on his mind, but food bought from dishonest earnings will produce dishonesty in his mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Food is likewise affected by the tendencies of the cook who prepares
it and by the tendencies of the mind and the quality of thoughts
while it is being eaten. So the frame of mind in which one eats and
the company and conversation at the time are highly important. This
is the real meaning of saying grace, or giving thanks, before meals.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Thy fullness, my Lord,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Filled with Thy grace,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the purpose of union with Thee
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And to satisfy and glorify Thy creation,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With thanks to Thee with all our hearts
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And with all our love for Thee,
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With all adoration for Thy blessings
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We accept Thy gift as it has come to us.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The food is Thy blessing and in Thy service
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We accept in all gratitude, my Lord.
Such a frame of mind, inspired by the thought of God and His
service and a feeling of gratitude, certainly has a good effect.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activity and inactivity have an important effect on the state of the
nervous system. Over-activity tires it; lack of activity makes it dull.
The balance of activity and inactivity maintains the nervous system
in a state of alertness, which is essential for the success of the art of
being on the level of the mind. When the body is fatigued the nervous
system is dull and the mind becomes drowsy, losing all capacity for
experience; in such conditions the ability to experience subtle levels
of thinking and attain the state of Being is not possible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The state of Being is the most normal and self-contained state of
mind. When, during meditation, the mind transcends the subtlest
state of thinking, it is left by itself and this is the state of self-consciousness 
or the state of pure Being. Therefore to attain the state of Being
the mind must be devoid of all experience of objects, yet must not
lose its ability to experience as in deep sleep.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to allow this state of Being, the nervous system must be in a
condition where it is suspended in such a way that it is neither subjected
to activity nor allowed to be inactive. This will be the state of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the nervous system functions it conveys the experience of
objects through the senses of perception and it engages itself in activity 
through the organs of action. Functioning in this manner it becomes 
fatigued. If the fatigue is slight, perceptions become less sharp
and the man begins to feel drowsy. If the fatigue is greater, perceptions 
cease because the mind fails to experience. This shows that states
of mind depend upon the physical condition of the nervous system,
and we find that fatigue diminishes the ability to experience. This
leads us to conclude that if the nervous system is subjected to fatigue
it will be impossible for the mind to gain the state of Being. Fatigue
is, therefore, an important factor when considering the art of being.
Activity during the day should be such that it does not leave the body
too tired nor the nervous system unduly fatigued.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ln addition to excessive activity, unwise eating and drinking also cause
dullness of the nervous system. This is harmful to the state of Being. It is
therefore advisable to cultivate regular habits of right diet and activity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind is brought to transcendental Being, it is naturally
set in harmony with the laws of nature and is attuned to the source of
unlimited energy. This keeps the field of activity smooth and the
nervous system unstrained. But it is necessary to be cautious so that
the energy gained is not over-spent, otherwise the nervous system will
lose effectiveness and again become strained and fatigued.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to provide the nervous system with the right conditions
of rest, activity and nourishment it is necessary to cultivate a balanced
state of mind. This can only be created by the experience of bliss-consciousness 
which is achieved automatically through the system of
transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SENSES AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are five senses of perception and five organs of action. The senses of perception are sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. The organs of action are the hands, feet, tongue and the two organs of evacuation. Through the five senses the mind perceives and through the five organs of action it acts. For perception the mind is brought to bear upon the external world through the senses; and for action it is brought to bear upon the world through the organs of action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being on the level of the senses exists when the senses and organs retain Being under all circumstances. To make this clear: the senses should remain senses and the organs should remain organs in the fullness of their respective values. This means that they should always
be ready to function and always succeed in functioning to their full
capacity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being on the level of the senses will be achieved when
the full value of the senses and organs is used so that there is full
perception of the object and full accomplishment of the action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The senses of perception should always be strong, alert and free
from tension, delusion, malice and narrowness of vision so that they
naturally produce full perception of the object. The organs of action
should be energetic, strong and in co-ordination with the senses of
perception so that they may act with precision and success and bring
fulfilment to any action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being with regard to the senses is that while the senses
remain saturated with the essential nature of Being, the bliss of Being,
they experience the object. As a result the object is thoroughly perceived 
but fails to overpower the senses to the extent that they become 
its slaves.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the intensely sweet taste of pure honey is on the tongue,
the taste of other sweets makes no impression. Similarly, when the
senses are saturated with the bliss of Being, small. transitory joys fail
to bind them and do not make a lasting impression.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To have Being on the level of the senses means that the senses
receive full contentment in bliss-consciousness; while experiencing the
variety of joys in objects, the senses are not bound by them because
they exist in the eternal value of the unlimited bliss of the Absolute.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoying such a state of contentment, the senses do not tempt the
mind to wander in search of greater happiness. This is because bliss
already permeates the level of the senses by virtue of the saturation of
the mind with Being. When the senses experience an outer object,
the result is complete harmony between the body and mind of the
individual and his surroundings. When the eyes see a beautiful scene
the sight is pure, the vision is full and free from malice or sinful perceptions. 
On the level of perception all is right, moral and in the natural
stream of evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the bliss of Being has not permeated the level of the senses, the
senses cannot be in a state of contentment. By nature they wish to
enjoy as much as possible. This is a legitimate desire. But it is only by
bringing the bliss of Being to the level of the senses that they become
established on a level of contentment which is unshakeable and irresistible. 
Maintained in contentment, they are no longer in bondage
to impressions of experience. This is the result of practising the art
of being on the level of the senses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How is this infusion of Being on the level of the senses achieved
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First it is necessary to be aware of the full range of the senses.
Ordinarily when we see, our eyes are open, the mind associates itself
with the open eyes and contacts the object before it. This is how
perception occurs. But we know that the sense of sight is not limited
to seeing with open eyes. Even with the eyes closed it is possible to
perceive an object. This mental perception or cognition of an object
also occurs through the sense of sight. From this it is clear that the
sense of sight is able to cognise from the gross to the subtle levels of
perception, from the outer to the inner sensory levels.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, in the diagram, A, A, and A2 represent the gross and
subtle levels of the senses and objects.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mind, associating itself with the gross levels of the senses (A),
perceives the corresponding gross levels of the object A; the mind, associating itself with the subtle levels of the senses (A,), perceives the corresponding subtle levels of the object A,; the mind, associating itself with the subtlest level of the senses (A2), perceives the corresponding subtlest level of the object A2. The open eye represents the gross level of the sense of sight.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, when a word becomes audible, gross sound is perceived as
a result of the mind associating itself with the gross level of hearing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one speaks inwardly and the mind hears, it is because the
mind associates itself with the subtle level of the sense of hearing.
When, during the process of transcendental meditation, the mind
perceives very refined states of thought, this is due to the mind's
association with very subtle states of the sense of hearing.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we find that during transcendental meditation the subtlest
sense of perception is put to use, whereas ordinarily in our daily life
we use only the gross levels of the senses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind makes use of the subtlest level of the senses, the
whole range of the senses becomes alive. In this manner, on the way
to transcending during meditation the mind enlivens all the levels of
sense through which meditation is performed. When the full range
of the senses is made alive, Being comes to the level of the senses.
This results in the increase of the capacity of the senses for perception.
They become more capable of experiencing greater happiness. So
long as only a small part of a sense is used for experiencing the 
objective world, the faculty of the sense of experience is not fully used.
In such a state the senses are captured by the minor joy of the object.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the gross level of creation contact of the sense with the object
does not produce great joy. The degree of joy increases as the sense
appreciates subtler levels of creation. During the process of transcendental
meditation the mind, through the organ of speech, experiences
subtler states of thought, and charm increases at each subtler level.
As the charm increases the organ becomes more capable of experiencing
subtler states, thus giving ever-increasing happiness to the mind until,
through the first aspect of the organ of speech, direct perception of
the subtlest state of thought takes place and the mind becomes capable
of experiencing the highest degree of happiness in the relative field.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind transcends that happiness and goes completely
beyond the realm of sensory perception, the bliss of the Absolute is
a direct experience and the mind identifies itself with it completely.
When the mind, fully saturated with Being, returns to the field of
objective experience, Being reflects on the level of the senses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of bringing Being to the level of the senses is the art of
transcendental meditation. This is the art of enabling the senses to
experience an object in all its subtle and gross states.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just as the mind is like an ocean of great depth, so also are the senses.
With transcendental meditation the mind begins to activate the deepest 
level of the senses. In this way the whole range of the senses becomes 
alive. Eventually the senses reach their source and from there
they are fed, as it were, with the value of transcendental, absolute
Being. This is how Being is brought into the field of the senses to
enable them to work with full capacity and at the same time to free
them from the binding influence of experience. This is the art of
being on the level of the senses.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE BODY AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The body is the end-organ or external expression of the nervous
system. Therefore the art of being with regard to the body means
the art of being as applied to the nervous system, only carried further
so that the body can function to its fullest capacity without losing
the level of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being with regard to the body is also the skill. in maintaining 
it so that the nature of Being is infused into the nature of the body
- the permanent never-changing, undying nature of Being infused
into the impermanent, ever-changing, ever-dying nature of the body.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that through the practice of transcendental meditation 
a state is created where the entire nervous system is held in suspension
without activity or passivity. When the nervous system is brought
to this state, Being comes to the level of the body. The entire nervous
system and the body reach that state of suspension which knows
no change and allows the body simply to be in the fullness of life. The
study of the art of being with regard to the body will be complete when
we have dealt with the art of being in relation to the nervous system,
the senses and prana, all of which are essential parts of the body.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we study this in detail we should have clearly in mind that
Being is in Its essential nature pure bliss-consciousness, the unmanifested 
Absolute. Looking at Being from the absolute point of view, we
find that It cannot be qualified by any attribute whatsoever; It is
attributeless. On the other hand, from the relative point of view, all
the attributes of relative life and all the attributes of differing phenomena 
in the relative field of existence have their basis in Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we consider the art of being with regard to different aspects
of the body, we must clearly understand that the art of being in
connection with any aspect of the body leads to more permanence,
stability, health, joyfulness, creativity and life energy. The art of
being must be based on becoming more in tune with the laws of
nature, so that the influence of the individual life on the surroundings
strengthens the purpose of natural laws and creates a greater harmony
in the universe. The art of being, therefore, for any particular aspect
of the body would mean that this aspect is strengthened in itself, in
its value for the individual and for the universe as a whole.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the art of being the different parts of the body function
in co-ordination with one another, and the co-ordination of the body
with the mind through the nervous system is always strong; its
relationship with outer surroundings is stable and useful both to the
body and the surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For such a condition of the body to be created it is necessary for the
mind to be brought to the level of Being, so that the nervous system
and its end-organ, the body, are simultaneously established on the level
of Being. We have seen that through transcendental meditation the body
is brought to a state between activity and no activity, the level of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being with regard to the nervous system means that the
nervous system functions to its fullest capacity under all conditions
without losing touch with Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before proceeding further it is important to note that for any experience 
to occur the nervous system must be in a particular condition.
Whatever the experience, in any state of consciousness - waking,
dreaming or sleeping - it is only possible by virtue of a corresponding
condition of the nervous system. The sight of a flower is possible only
because the nervous system adjusts itself to a specific condition which
makes it possible for the eyes to remain open and the image of the
flower to fall upon the retina of the eye, thus enabling the necessary
impulses to reach the cortex. If the nervous system does not condition
itself in the required manner no experience of the flower will occur.
This conditioning of the nervous system holds true for all experiences.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being in relation to the nenTous system is such that,
whether the nervous system is subjected to the conditions of the
waking, dreaming or deep sleep states, it should never deprive itself
of the state gained during the experience of pure Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first sight this retention of pure Being seems impossible. Experience 
shows that the nervous system cannot be subjected simultaneously 
to two different conditions in which two different states of consciousness 
are maintained. It can only be subjected to one state at a time
either a waking, a dreaming, a deep sleep or a transcendental state.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A close scrutiny, however, will reveal that it is within man's
capacity to subject the nervous system to a state that will permanently
maintain the level of Being as the basis of all the conditions of the
nervous system responsible for an experience in any of the waking,
dreaming or deep sleep states. The nervous system of man is the most
complete in all creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The skill which will create such a permanent state in the nervous
system - a state which will maintain the level of Being yet allow
experiences to occur - is the art of being with regard to the nervous
system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is this art in practice?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To produce an experience of the waking state the mind is brought
into contact with the outside world through the machinery of the nervous 
system, which stimulates the senses and the body and brings the
mind into contact with the world around, producing specific experiences. 
When, owing to sustained activity the senses and the entire
nervous system connected with them become fatigued, the mind
loses contact with the senses and the outer world, and experience of
the waking state ceases.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as the mind is discontented it continues to be active. When
the nervous system is tired on the level of the senses it fails to experience 
the outer world of the waking state. But because the mind desires 
to be active, another part of the nervous system receives the commands 
of the mind. This other part of the nervous system then becomes 
active and stimulates the subtler regions of the senses which
are not commonly used in experiencing the waking state, giving
rise to the illusory experiences of the dream state. When functioning
on this level for some time the subtler regions of the nervous system
become tired, and the ability to perceive illusory experiences is lost.
This gives rise to a state of no experience, that of deep sleep.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During transcendental meditation, however, the nervous system
is subjected naturally to a condition unlike those which produce the
experiences of waking, dreaming or deep sleep states. In this condition 
it is capable of experiencing pure Being - the experience of
transcendental consciousness, the very state of transcendental consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is how, through the practice of transcendental meditation,
the nervous system, which commonly fluctuates only between the
conditions of waking, dreaming and deep sleep, receives a new status.
This status can be located at the junction of any two of the three
states of consciousness. At that point lies the attainment of the art of
being on the level of the nervous system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because the state of the nervous system which results in the experience 
of Being is a state unlike those which produce the experiences 
of the waking, dreaming or sleeping states; because it is located
between any two of the three states; because it is a state where the
entire nenTous system is suspended between activity and inactivity;
and because in none of the three states is the entire nervous system
subjected to one type of conditioning, it is possible to maintain permanently 
the condition necessary for the state of Being even while
allowing activity or inactivity in certain parts of the nervous system
to give rise to the experience of the usual states of waking, dreaming
and sleeping, one after the other. This is the art of being with regard
to the nervous system, which finds its fulfilment in the sustained practice 
of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When discussing how to make full use of one's surroundings
we found that through transcendental meditation, during which the
mind is brought to the level of Being and then returns to function
in the outer world, the atmosphere radiates the value of Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of being in relation to the surroundings means that Being
is maintained whatever the surroundings or circumstances. The fullness 
of life is maintained irrespective of the surroundings, whether
good or bad, favourable or unfavourable, harmful or useful, virtuous
or sinful. Under all circumstances Being, the fullness of life, of intelligence, 
love, joyfulness and energy, is maintained. The maintenance
of Being results in the improvement of the surroundings in every way.
They become useful for the individual, for the purpose of cosmic
evolution and for the universe. This is how the quality and status
of the surroundings is improved by the art of being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the individual maintains Being under all circumstances and in all
surroundings his actions certainly improve the surroundings if they
are in any way in need of improvement, because to be established
in Being means to be established in contentment, intelligence and
creativity while in harmony with the laws of nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;KARMA AND THE ART OF BEING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karma is a term which has various meanings according to the context; such as action, force of action, fruit of action, impression of the experience of action. Generally in the West karma is associated with bad action and the results of bad action. But the word karma makes no distinction between good and bad; it simply pertains to action. Good karma means good action, bad karma means bad action, but karma itself simply means action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The philosophy of karma is a simple philosophy of action and
reaction: as ye sow, so shall ye reap. The law of the conservation
of energy supports the theory of karma. Every action has its result or
reaction for the performer and for his surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one thinks, the process of thinking is the performance of the
action of thinking. Similarly, speaking, acting, behaving or experiencing 
are all different levels of the performance of action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we throw a stone into a pond the stone sinks but leaves
waves in motion on the surface. The waves travel until they reach
the shore, where they strike against sand particles and produce an
influence on them, either pushing them away or drawing them into
the pond. The influence is everywhere, over the pond and at the
shore. This is how an action influences the performer and his surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through every thought, word and action a man produces waves
of influence in the surrounding atmosphere. The quality of the influence 
depends upon the quality of action performed; the degree of
reaction spread through the surroundings depends upon the strength
of the action performed. Thus we find that every moment in life
produces some influence in the atmosphere by the actions of breathing,
thinking, speaking and behaving.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We shall see how far the influence of an action spreads. In the case
of a pond, the influence of a wave, however small, extends over the
whole pond. Similarly, the vibratiom set forth by the performance
of an action strike everything in the surroundings both near and
far. They strike everything on earth, the moon, sun and stars and
travel throughout the entire universe influencing everything they
meet. The influence depends upon the quality and the force of the
action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reaction created by these vibrations as they strike against
everything in the universe travels back to the performer as a rubber
ball thrown against a wall bounces back to the thrower. Obviously a
reaction reaches the performer more quickly from nearby surroundings 
than from distant ones. For example, a man speaks a word;
by speaking this word he produces vibrations. These vibrations
spread and strike a tree; producing some influence on the tree they
rebound to the speaker. They spread further and strike against a
mountain; from there they take longer to rebound. They reach the
moon, and their return takes even longer. To reach the sun and return
to the originator will take a longer time still. There are stars in the
heavens whose light takes many millions of years to reach the earth;
therefore, for the influence of an action to reach them and return
to its originator will take many millions of years.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This shows how an action, having spread its influence throughout
the cosmos, eventually returns to react upon the doer.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question then arises: how can the fruit of an action reach the
performer after thousands or millions of years?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A man sends a letter to his father who lives far away. If, when it reaches
the address, the father has moved to another town, it is redirected
to him. lf necessary, the letter is repeatedly redirected until the father
is traced. The results of an action which are destined to return in a
thousand years will reach the soul wherever it may be in the universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who do not understand the philosophy of rebirth and continuity 
of life after death will find it hard to understand this philosophy 
of karma. How can a man continue to receive the fruits of his
actions for millions of years?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until the soul is liberated, as long as the individual soul has not
merged into cosmic existence, so long will it preserve its individuality
in whatever world or body it may be. The individual will continue
to exist as an individual and will continue to receive the fruits of karma
from the past.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a man is liberated and his individuality has merged into
cosmic existence, then the influence of his past karma will be received
by his son or grandson or by those who have blood affinity with him.
The reaction will continue, and if no member of his family is left the
influence will reach those nearest to his blood relations, their friends
and connections.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karma, the reaction or the fruit of action, unfailingly reaches the
doer. As in a large herd of cows a calf finds its own mother, as a letter
addressed to a man reaches him and no one else, so the fruit of his
action reaches only the doer.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the philosophy of karma, if a man is happy it is the
result of his good actions in the past, the result of his having produced
good, happy and harmonious vibrations in the atmosphere by his
virtuous deeds. If a man suffers in the present it is the consequence of
his having spread an influence of misery, ill-health and suffering in
the atomsphere.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He alone is responsible for his own happiness or suffering. If he
enjoys, he enjoys from his own actions; if he suffers, he suffers from
his own actions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a man comes to us bringing much joy, we think he is by nature
a man brim-full of happiness. But the philosophy of karma says that
he is only a man brim-full of happiness to us because he is at that time
returning to us the happiness that we ourselves once spread in the
world. The reaction of our good karma returns through him. He is
only delivering it to us just as a postman delivers our letter. If he
really had been a man brim-full of happiness, then he could never at
any time bring unhappiness to others.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a man appears to be good to some and bad to others he cannot
be all good, or he would seem to be good to everyone. If he is all bad
he would seem to be bad to everyone. But no one is all bad or all
good. Everyone is sometimes good and sometimes bad. In this way
a man becomes the carrier of other people's good or bad karma. He
creates unhappiness for you when he becomes the carrier of your
bad deeds, and he brings joy to you when he returns the influence of
your good actions. Therefore when misery comes we should not
blame others, and when happiness comes we should maintain equanimity, 
the state of harmony in divine nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowledge of the philosophy of karma should inspire us to be
intent on doing good. How can we decide what is good and what is
bad? Society lays down a broad conception of good and bad; there is
a common understanding among people regarding good and bad.
The laws that govern a country provide another criterion; we should
at least obey the laws of the country in which we live.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we wish to go deeper into the values of good and bad we
should study the scriptures. Whether we are Hindus, Christians or
Buddhists our individual scriptures tell us what is right and wrong.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should not analyse how these scriptures differ one from another but should content ourselves with the religion to which we belong. The truth is present in the scriptures of all religions; therefore the followers of one religion may read the scriptures of others, but it is better not to confuse ourselves by studying comparative religion. It is better to follow the scriptures of one's own religion.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the scriptures may be accepted as the criterion of good and bad.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometimes statements in the scriptures may appear to be contradictory. This is because in the relative field of life values change according to time, circumstances and surroundings. When we speak in terms of good and bad, what is considered good in one situation may be considered bad in other circumstances. Similarly an understanding of good and bad even in the scriptures may be found to differ according to a difference in time, circumstances or surroundings. But a great deal of wrongdoing could be prevented if we followed the scriptures even according to our limited understanding. This is better than not following them at all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolute good should be lived in our lives. But where can the
criterion of absolute good be found? Who will tell us how we should
mould ourselves and our surroundings so that we may live a life of
absolute good?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we wish to have an absolute standard of right and wrong it is
within our reach. We shall see how karma or action can be based on
absolute good, according to the philosophy of karma. But first let
us try to understand what we mean by good or bad, virtue or evil.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A good action is one which produces a good influence in the present 
for the performer, secures his future good and produces a good
influence on all levels of the surroundings. Any action which produces 
a life-supporting influence for the performer and his surroundings 
is a good action, a virtuous action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any action which produces life-damaging influences for the performer 
or the surroundings at any level of life, either in the present
or future, may be called bad, wrong, sinful and immoral.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus we have a criterion of right and wrong action. Action should
result in all good to the performer and the universe, in the present
and for all time. This is a definition of absolute good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who then can decide what kind of influence is produced by a man's
action at any particular time? Who can know how it will affect a particular
stratum of the universe in the present or in the future ? The extent
of the influence of an action is incalculable; it ranges through all time,
space and causation; it goes beyond the range of the human mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since this is the case, who can decide what is right and what is
wrong and whether an action should be performed or rejected?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not seem possible to establish right and wrong from an
intellectual level, and even to attempt it would be highly complicated.
But it is possible to adjust the whole stream of life so that every action
performed is naturally good or right. Let us analyse this possibility
and discover how each thought, word and action can be directed towards 
the good of the individual and of the life of the entire universe.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the life of the universe we mean its maintenance and evolution.
The maintenance and evolution of innumerable beings at the innumerable 
levels of creation are carried out by a natural and automatic
process governed by natural Iaws. We have seen that on the basis of
the eternal, never-changing cosmic law all the laws of nature, inflexible 
in their character, continue to function on different planes,
maintaining and evolving life. The whole cosmic process of evolution
is carried out by the laws of nature, which are ultimately based on
the cosmic law.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since there is a way to direct the life-stream of an individual to
the plane of cosmic law, the entire process of maintaining individual
life and its progress and evolution can be carried on naturally and
automatically. Since there is a way to regulate one's life by the laws of
nature, then all one's thought, speech and action can produce an
influence in accordance with these laws working for the maintenance
and evolution of all things.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen when considering the cosmic law, that the mind
of the individual can be attuned to the transcendental, absolute pure
consciousness through a simple process which may be practised by
any man, anywhere, at any time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This should encourage each individual to attune his life to the natural 
laws which maintain life and evolution. In this way he can through
thought, word and action, produce a good influence for himself and
for others, both now and for eternity.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the philosophy of karma, which reveals to us the unlimited
scope of karma, the ever increasing influence of karma on the doer.
It reveals to us that, even though the range of the influence of action
is far beyond the reach of human understanding, by performing the
action (karma) of transcendental meditation we can reach a plane of
life where everything we do will naturally be in harmony and rhythm
with cosmic life and will maintain and help the evolution of all
beings throughout the universe and so do all good by being all good.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Being is infused into the field of relative existence, into the
very nature of the mind, all karma becomes a karma of absolute
righteousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a direct and practical way to do all good for all time to
all beings and yet to live in absolute freedom from the binding influence 
of karma. How can a performer be free from the binding
influence of karma? Before we deal with this question we should
understand what is meant by bondage and freedom.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being is unmanifested in Its nature. It is karma which makes It
manifest. Karma is temporary, perishable; Being is eternal, absolute.
Being is pure consciousness of absolute nature; karma is based on
conscious mind. By virtue of karma, the pure consciousness of Being
is transformed into conscious mind. In Its nature Being is eternal
unity; karma creates multiplicity within unity. So we find that the
nature of karma is opposed to the nature of Being, even though
Being is the origin of karma. This is the fundamental relationship
between Being and karma.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have seen that the nature of the mind is overshadowed by
every experience, the performer overshadowed by his action, the
thinker overshadowed by a thought. This overshadowing of the
essential nature of the mind is described as the binding influence of
action or karma.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the practice of transcendental meditation, however, the value
of Being is fully infused into the mind of the performer and the action
fails to overshadow his nature. Being, his essential nature, is then maintained 
and action is performed in such a way that it fails to overshadow 
his nature. He then remains unbound by action. In this way,
when Being is maintained, karma fails to bind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not possible to eliminate karma. Action must continue because 
life is activity, its very nature is dynamic. Thus it is not possible
physically to escape from karma or to avoid action. So we see that
until Being has grown into the nature of the mind it is not possible
to avoid the bondage of action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Freedom from karma is gained by attaining the status of eternal
Being. By the action of allowing the mind to reach Being it is possible 
to create a situation within ourselves whereby we shall always
produce good influences for ourselves and for the entire universe.
At the same time we rise above the binding influence of action and
live a life of eternal freedom.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the philosophy of karma. It not only deals with right and
wrong and the far reaching influences of action, but also suggests a
technique to rise above its binding influence. Furthermore, it analyses
the structure of karma and provides a technique to strengthen action
to ensure more powerfull and successful results. This we shall consider
further.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A weak action will naturally produce a weak effect, and a strong
action a strong effect. The strength of an action depends primarily
upon the strength of the thought behind it. Action based on a powerful 
thought wiu yield powerful influences and results. Consequently,
to produce a powerful result and enjoy the fruit of action it is necessary 
to take the mind to the field of Being and for Being to be infused 
into the nature of the mind, so that the conscious mind is always 
filled with the value of Being. When the mind is infused with
the power of Being its creativity is infinitely great, and powerful
actions may be performed to produce the desired result with the
expenditure of very little energy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karma, or action, from the level of Being has infinite value. It is
performed with the minimum of energy and results in maximum good
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;for the performer and the world. The performer, enjoying the results
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;and living on the plane of Being, remains ever free from the binding
influence of karma. The philosophy of karma teaches us this skill in
action. It develops naturally in the individual through the simple
practice of transcendental meditation, which brings our conscious
attention to the field of Being. So when action is performed frOm
the level of Being karma helps to fulfil life's purpose, which is evolution 
of the highest degree.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The purpose of life is to enjoy bliss-consciousness and evolve to the
eternal state of liberation while accomplishing and enjoying the maximum 
in life, achieving the greatest good for oneself and for others.
The philosophy of karma teaches us how, by performing this action
of taking our attention to the field of transcendental Being, we can
fulfil the purpose of our life and play our part in the cosmic evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Action performed by a mind which is not functioning on the level
of Being may or may not be right for the doer and may or may not
be right for the entire universe. Any wrong action throws a strain
on the functioning of the natural laws which govern the process of
evolution of all beings. Such action is weak; it needs great effort for
its accomplishment and causes great tension in the individual life and
its surroundings. Above all, it binds the mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore whatever the purpose of karma, only one technique
is able successfully to produce the best, most effective and powerful
results. This is to draw the mind within, to let it reach the field of
transcendental Being and return to perform actions which will be
strong and satisfying on all levels.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whatever the activity, whatever action is performed by the mind,
senses, body or surroundings, Being should be eternally maintained.
It is the art of being in the field of karma that, even though karma is
by nature opposed to Being, karma itself is brought to the level of
Being. Being is maintained in Its status and karma fails to challenge
Its validity. When both karma and Being are maintained at the level
of the mind, this is simultaneously the art of karma and the art of
being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of thinking lies in producing the most powerful thoughts
with the least expenditure of mental energy. A thought should be
expressed without strain or tension. This is the art of thinking; the
least exertion and the maximum result.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The thought should not only be powerful but should also be right.
The art of thinking does not allow useless or wrong thoughts to
occupy the mind. Only virtuous and moral thoughts naturally fill the
mind, thoughts that will help evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another aspect of the art of thinking is that thoughts come in
such a way that they produce the greatest good for the thinker and
spread harmony in his surroundings.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without the art of thinking, random thoughts will come at any
time. Useless, wrong, weak, misleading or degenerate thoughts are
a barrier to evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Evolution will be assured only when loose thinking is replaced by
the art of thinking. Thinking will then be in harmony with cosmic
law, the laws of nature and the purpose of evolution.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of thinking means that a thought, while setting the mind in
action in the relative field, at the same time leaves it free from bondage
or attachment' . The mind should be free while engaged in thought and
should be used as a means to eternal freedom in God-consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of thinking is cultivated by bringing the mind to the source
of thought, consciously gathering there the seed of thought and bringing
it out with limitless energy from the field of transcendental
Being. The thought becomes saturated with Being and becomes a
means of bringing transcendental Being into the relative field of
multiple phenomenal creation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of archery lies in first drawing the arrow back on the bow
as far as possible and then releasing it so that it hits the target with
great force. Likewise, the art of thinking lies in drawing the mind
back to the source of thought and from there releasing it to produce
a forceful thought, supplemented by the power of Being. This will
bring more efficiency into the field of thinking and action. It will give
power and success to life and it will bring the infusion of Being into
outer activity and become a means for transcendental self-consciousness 
to grow into cosmic consciousness, the most highly evolved
state of human consciousness. Thus the art of thinking is the most
vital aspect of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of thinking includes clear thinking. Clarity of thought
depends upon the state of the mind and nervous system. The nervous
system should not be fatigued, and the full mind should be able to
act on the nervous system and express itself in the outer world. Clear
thinking results from a full mind in co-ordination with a strong nervous 
system; then thoughts are clear and thinking is effective.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Efficiency in any action depends upon efficiency of thought, which
in turn depends upon the ability of the mind to catch the thought at its
subtlest level. If the thought is picked up at the source, it is picked up
where it is strongest and most vital.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the art of thinking lies in having (I) right thoughts; (2) useful,
creative thoughts; (3) powerful thoughts; (4) thoughts by whose
influence the thinker is not bound, remaining established in freedom,
in Being. We shall deal with these four points separately.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(1) RIGHT THINKING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is very necessary for the mind to entertain only right thoughts.
A right thought is one which produces a good, harmonious, useful
and life-supporting influence for the thinker and the entire universe,
now and for all time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A right thought is a thought which is in accordance with the natural
process of evolution and which produces no harmful effects whatever
for the thinker or anyone else.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How could the mind entertain only constructive thoughts!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We saw while discussing the cosmic law that when the mind is
in the state of transcendental Being it gains that level of consciousness
which is the basis of all the laws of nature. And in this state the mind
will naturally entertain only constructive thoughts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It does not seem possible to entertain thoughts which are always
right by merely trying to think in the right way. Conscious attempts
to entertain only right thoughts strain the mind. For the mind to
succeed in entertaining only right thoughts it should be so cultured
that it naturally picks up only right thoughts. If the mind is not established 
on the plane of cosmic law, then the discontented mind will
not succeed in having only right thoughts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no way of ascertaining intellectually which thought is
absolutely right. Even if the rightness of a thought could be judged
intellectually, this could only happen once a thought had already
arisen and been scrutinised to find whether it were right or not. But
by then the thinker and the atmosphere would already have been
influenced by its quality.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So it is not possible to ensure only right thoughts until the mind
develops within itself a state whereby it could not entertain wrong
thoughts. We have already seen2 that it is easy for everyone to achieve
such a state of mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) USEFUL AND CREATIVE THINKING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every thought consumes life-energy in the process of development
If a thought is not useful the energy consumed is wasted. Its repercussion on the surroundings will at best not be useful and at
worst positively harmful. Therefore it is essential for the mind to
entertain only useful and creative thoughts.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Day-dreamers exhaust their minds on fancies. Such impractical
thinking is a great waste of life energy, robbing the thinker of the
ability to think precisely and to make decisions.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A 'useful thought is one which is creative and has a constructive
purpose in life. A thought is entertained by the mind so that it may
be developed and used for the fulfilment of some desire. Thought is
the foundation of action. If the thought is useful and creative, then the
action will be useful and productive. To have one such useful thought
is far more valuable than to waste mental energy in entertaining 
innumerable useless thoughts one after another.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of useful and creative thinking lies in the regular practice
of transcendental meditation, which cultivates the state of Being in
the very nature of the mind so that it is always contented in the bliss-consciousness 
of absolute Being. Thus contented it entertains only
useful thoughts, thoughts that arise to fulfil the need of the hour for
the thinker and the surroundings, thoughts that will fulfil the purpose
of the evolution of the individual and the entire cosmic life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) POWERFUL THINKING
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a thought to be powerful two things are necessary. First,
the full power of the mind should be used to create and develop it,
and secondly, the forces of nature should support it. A thought will be
at its most powerful only if both the thinker and the world around
provide maximum power. If the full potential of the mind is behind
a thought but the thought is not cherished by the surroundings nor
welcomed by nature, then it will not succeed in maintaining its force
to its ultimate fulfillment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transcendental meditation can create a state in which every
thought is supported by the mind's full potential and enjoys the goodwill
of all the laws of nature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) THINKING TO LIBERATE THE THINKER
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The art of thinking demands not only that thoughts should not
produce a binding influence on the thinker but that they should also
serve as a means of liberation from bondage.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the mind thinks, it is identified with the thought. This
identification of the mind with the thought overthrows the validity
of Being. Such a mind, whose essential nature or Being is overshadowed,
remains under the bondage of thought. Thercfore the art of
freeing the mind from the binding influence of a thought lies in the
ability to maintain the state of Being while thinking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the thinker is able to entertain a thought at its origin, the
thought develops under the custody of the mind and fails to bind it,
becoming a means to liberation. But when the thinker ignores the
thought until it has developed to a point where it can no longer be
ignored, then the thought captures the mind, influences it and binds it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A child that is properly taken care of in infancy by its mother
naturally grows up to serve and respect her. But if the child is ignored
in infancy, it grows in arrogance, becoming a means of bondage to
her. In order to gain proficiency in the art of thinking the mind must
be trained to maintain Being at all times. This is possible for everyone
through the practice of experiencing Being.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ART OF SPEAKING
 The art of speaking consists of:
 (1) Speaking with a minimum consumption of energy.
 (2) Speaking rightly.
 (3) Speaking harmoniously.
 (4) Speaking pleasingly.
 (5) Speaking powerfully.
 (G) Speaking usefully.
 (7) Speaking in such a manner that the speaker remains free from
 the binding influence of speech.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) SPEAKING WITH A MINIMUM CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY
 This is possible when the mind is clear and capable of using its full
potential in a natural manner. This, in turn, is only possible when there
exists effective co-ordination between the mind and the organ of speech
and when the surroundings and circumstances are favourable to the
nature of the thought.
 When thinking is clear and powerful, the thought flows into easy
and natural speech without meeting resistance. If, on the other hand,
a thought is weak it needs more energy to reinforce it and transform
it into speech.
 Clarity of mind obviously results in clear and precise thinking,
which in turn results in clarity and precision of speech. Such speech
not only consumes far less energy, but also creates a good impression 
and achieves the purpose of the speaker. Vague and lengthy
speaking, on the other hand, is exhausting and extremely irritating
to both speaker and atmosphere.
 Co-ordination between the mind and the organ of speech requires 
a clear and powerful mind and a strong nervous system functioning 
normally and capable of bringing the full potential of the
mind to bear upon the external world. When discussing mind and the
art of being and the nervous system and the art of being, we have
seen how this can be achieved.
 The influence of the surroundings is also a vital factor. If the surroundings 
and circumstances are not favourable to the nature of the
thought, considerable effort will be needed to put the thought into
speech and a still greater effort will be needed to prevent the thought
from bursting out as speech. If a child wishes to pick a flower from
a vase but is aware that his mother will not like it, he feels strain in
expressing his thought and even greater strain in repressing it.
 If, however, surroundings and circumstances are conducive to the
thought, the process of transferring thought into speech brings with
it a resurgence of life-energy, joyfullness and creative intelligence and
becomes a means of gaining energy instead of consuming it.
 Therefore the art of speaking with a minimum consumption of
energy lies in giving expression to thoughts which are in harmony
with the surroundings and circumstances.
 The practical formula will be:
 Speak according to the moment.
 Speak in accordance with the surroundings.
 the level of conscious receptivity of your surroundings.
 Speak in accordance with your own circumstances.
 Do not speak impulsively.
 If the surroundings and circumstances do not at the outset seem in
accord with a particular thought, or if your own circumstances arc
unfavourable to the thought, the art of speech lies in using such words
as will first suit the surroundings and circumstances and will then gradually
express your purpose. In this manner, without using much extra
energy, speech may be able to achieve its purpose in a graceful manner.
 Such a manner of speech, however, cannot possibly be cultivated
on an intellectual basis. If one strains to adjust one's manner of speaking,
weighing all one's words, one will be under constant inner strain
and will appear unnatural. This will be another way of wasting a
great deal of energy, which will defeat the whole purpose of speaking.
 This purpose is fulfilled by the regular practice of transcendental
meditation, which brings the value of Being into the mind while
making the surroundings and circumstances favourable.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) SPEAKING RIGHTLY
 We have seen that a correct evaluation of right and wrong is
possible only from the plane of Being. Therefore the art of right
speaking is necessarily based on the state of Being.
 Speech is simply a projection of thought. Therefore all that is
valid for the art of thinking is valid for the art of speaking. Right speech
has its basis in right thinking.
 Speech is the expression of the heart together with the mind.
Therefore for speech to be right it is necessary for the heart and mind
to be right2.
 One word from a man reveals his inner quality. Softness of speech
expresses the nature of the heart, and the degree of logic, imagination
or creativity of the expression reveals the culture of the mind. The extent
of a man's evolution can bejudged by a single word uttered by him.
 Speech is a delicate medium between a man and his surroundings.
It is highly important for the well-being of man and his surroundings
that everyone should be skilled in the art of speech, because one
wrong word produces a wrong inAuence in the atmosphere. A man
may change his attitude or his manner of behaviour, but the word
that he has spoken can never be withdrawn. The influence that he has
created on those who hear him and in the atmosphere around him
can never be withdrawn. Therefore it is highly important to possess
the art of right speech.
 Although speech is a projection of thought, one must be more
selective in the art of speaking than in the art of thinking, because not
every thought that arises in the mind need be expressed in speech.
 Take, for example, a business man sitting with his friend in the
evening, who suddenly thinks of something that he must tell his
manager the next day. It would be quite out of place if he began to
express his thought there and then. This is what is meant by the art
of speaking being more selective and, consequently, a more advanced
art than the art of thinking.
 Speech must be in keeping with the atomsphere. A thought and
its expression as speech should be such as to be welcomed by the surroundings. 
Hundreds of words unsuitable to the atmosphere will prove
futile where one right word will achieve the purpose.
 Thus the art of right speaking embraces not only the art of right
thinking but also the skill of using expressions in keeping with the
atmosphere.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) SPEAKING HARMONIOUSLY
 For speech to be harmonious and suitable, thought must be clear
and sharp, at the least harmless and at best life-supporting to the whole
environment.
 The art of speaking lies in clear thinking and in an innocent,
simple way of expression. One should speak as one feels, provided the
thought is suitable to the occasion. If one feels in a certain way, and
if the surroundings will be harmed by the expression of that feeling,
then it is better not to speak. Even though it is considered better not
to suppress one's feelings, the art of speaking demands that words
should not be spoken if they will displease anyone or produce
disharmony in the atmosphere.
 Even if 'no' must be said at some point, the art of speaking demands
that it should be expressed in words which will not appear
 abusive or harsh. The art of speaking lies in truthful speech, but at
 the same time truthful expression should not hurt anyone.
 Many people think truthfully by nature, and they think that
truthfulness lies in saying exactly what they think. This may be
truthful speech, but it may also be tactless and displeasing to the listener 
and result in a disharmony which mars its very purpose. Even if
you must give a ruling against something, express it in acceptable
words. This quality of kindness and delicacy of the heart develops
as the heart begins to melt from the experience of bliss and the great
happiness of transcendental Being. The heart becomes softer, and then a
man cannot by nature be harsh or displeasing to anyone. Speech will
flow naturally in all harmony.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) SPEAKING PLEASINGLY
 The technique of the art of speaking is that, although we are
truthful in our thinking and speaking, the words that emerge are
pleasing, soft and of right quality.
 The habit of speaking pleasingly lies in cultivating that nature -
politeness, softness and kindness of heart - which will not produce
harshness of speech at any time. Speech must be spontaneously truthful 
and pleasing to those who hear it and for this, simplicity and all
affectionate nature need to be developed. Merely trying to be polite
or kind is of no use. No amount of trying will enable a man to master
the art of pleasing speech.
 Any contrived attempt to shape speech in order to sound pleasant
makes it artificial and will not produce a smooth and harmonious
effect on the listener. Affectation in the speaker results in inner strain
for himself and his listeners.
 There are many teachers who train people in speaking. Their
methods produce some improved quality of voice, but these teachers
themselves know that there is no way to improve speech until the
tensions of the mind and muscles are relaxed.
 The art of speaking pleasingly does not lie in speaking any less
or any more. It lies in speaking in a simple and natural way. Although
it seems to be common practice among politicians to speak less or
more for purely political reasons, nevertheless even in this field the
technique of speaking pleasingly lies in truthful and simple expressions 
which will produce a desirable effect. Length of speech has little
to do with creating the right impression; it is sincerity and truth in
speech and the intelligence behind it which make an impression and
accomplish its purpose.
 If speech is pleasant and at the same time purposeful, then this is
the art of speaking. Speech that is pleasing can make even an enemy
work for us. Blessed are those who speak sweet words.
 The art of speaking pleasantly lies in filling the mind and heart
with love. Love is the natural quality of a happy heart. Fullness of
heart is naturally maintained in bliss-consciousness. Experience of
Being is a direct way to it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) SPEAKING POWERFULLY
 The power of speech depends on the power of thought, on thorough
knowledge of the subject of speech and on purity of heart and mind.
It has been seen that purity of heart and mind are gained by increasing 
the purity of consciousness through the regular practice of
transcendental meditation. That also helps to increase intelligence and
thereby makes a man more capable of a thorough knowledge of the
subject of speech.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; (6) SPEAKING USEFULLY
 Speaking usefully is an art belonging naturally to the contented
mind and heart; these are easily gained by the development of bliss-consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 (7) SPEAKING IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE SPEAKER REMAINS FREE FROM THE BINDING
INFLUENCE OF SPEECH
 The art of gaining self-consciousness and rising to the state of
cosmic consciousness is the art of remaining free from the binding
influence of speech.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE ART OF ACTION
 There is a Sanskrit proverb in India which says that the success of
the actions of great men depends more upon the purity of their hearts
than upon the means of action. This proverb reveals how the power
of nature can be influenced to help us to succeed in our undertakings.
 While discussing cosmic law it was made clear that when the
mind acquires absolute purity in the field of Being, it comes into
complete harmony with the laws of nature and gains the favourable
influence of the surroundings. So the art of action lies basically in the
art of transcendental meditation, which washes away all the impurities 
of the mind and leaves it in purity and in conformity with the
laws of nature.
 In explaining the philosophy of action it was shown that the art
of being underlies the art of action. More effective action requires
more effective thinking, and more effective thinking requires more
Being in the nature of the mind. So the basis of the art of action is
the art of being.
 The quality of any action depends upon the quality of the performer, 
upon the circumstances and upon the influence of the surroundings. 
The quality of the performer may be good, his habits orderly
and his life pure, his mind strong and his thinking clear, but unless
the circumstances and surroundings are favourable to his action it
will not be fruitful. We have considered in detail how, through the
 practice of transcendental meditation, surroundings and circumstances
 are made harmonious and conducive to the fulfilment of desire and
 action.
 Another aspect of the art of action is the performance of an action
with the expenditure of minimum energy and the achievement of
maximum work; at the same time the quality of the work is better,
so the least strain and the greatest gain result from the art of action;
both the individual and the universe are amply rewarded.
 Skill in action is another aspect of the art of action. Skill in action
means that the performer derives great pleasure from the action but
at the same time remains free from its binding influence and from the
binding influence of its fruit.
 Skill in action is such that although the performer is fully identified 
with the thought of the work, the process of action and the enjoyment 
of its fruit, all that remains is a state of eternal freedom,
saturated with the bliss-consciousness of absolute Being. For the art
of action the mind must be saturated with Being in order that It
may be freely expressed in the outer world of forms and phenomena.
 So the art of action lies in first fathoming the deeper levels of the
ocean of mind, taking the attention to the source of thinking, the
field of Being. This process brings the mind's full potential to
fruition.
 In this way the whole field of thought and action becomes a
means for transcendental, absolute Being to enter the relative field and
vibrate through all activity. The entire field of thought, of action
and its fruit becomes a plensure, because the laws of nature and all the
surroundings are conducive to the fulfillment of desire. It is as if all
creation and taken it upon itself to fulfil the thought and action.
The thought becomes a thought of the Divine. Action then becomes
a means to fulfil the divine purpose, while at the same time the purpose 
of the individual is served to the maximum capacity. The purpose 
of individual life enters a glorious phase in the fulfilment of the
divine purpose.
 This is the art of action: one is only required to dive deep within
oneself before beginning an action. Thereafter the entire process of
thought and action automatically moulds the art of action.
 An action should be done for the greatest good to the performer.
In this connection his safety should be his first concern, which means
that he should not be bound by his actions. Neither the binding
influence of action nor the binding influence of its fruit should touch
the performer. There is very little understanding of the binding influence 
of action in the world today. An action is done simply for
the sake of satisfying life at the sensory level. This is because the conception 
of Being has been largely forgotten. Action is never thought
of in terms of the level of Being but is thought to exist only on the
level of the mind, senses, body and environment. The whole range
of life today exists on a very superficial level.
 When we consider the art of living we must take into account
the entire field of life - Being, thinking, doing and the whole universe.
Therefore action has to be considered not only in terms of completion 
and fruitfulness but also in terms of the impression and influence
it creates on the performer and his surroundings.
 The main points of the art of action are as follows:
 (1) The art of the proper planning of an action.
 (2) The art of performing an action with minimum expenditure
 of energy.
 (3) The art of performing an action in minimum time.
 (4) The art of performing only useful action.
 (5) The art of performing an action to produce the most effective 
 and desirable results.
 (6) Fixity of purpose in the performance of an action.
 (7) The art of performing an action without harming anyone.
 (8) The art of performing an action to yield maximum results.
 (9) The art of performing an action so that the performance remains
 a joy.
 It is necessary to deal with each point thoroughly, because the art
of action is the primary constituent of the art of living.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 (1) THE ART OF THE PROPER PLANNING OF AN ACTlON
 Successful economy in all fields of life is the main purpose of planning. 
Proper Planning of an action depends upon clarity of mind.
 Unless an action is rightly thought out and its steps rightly planned,
every stage of its performance will probably remain vague and therefore 
unsatisfactory for the doer and all those concerned.
 Effective planning depends primarily upon one's state of mind
and secondarily upon the circumstances and resources at hand. A
survey of resources and an estimation of the possibility of gaining
additional resources, or of completing the work with the resources
already at hand, is a necessary part of planning.
 If an undertaking is started from a pure, expanded consciousness,
then the resources come to hand according to the need. In the case
of a man of highly evolved consciousness there is hardly any need for
planning. That which comes to mind leads the course of action, and
nature provides resources for its fulfillment. The evolved souls speak
as they feel, spontaneously, without forethought. Their feeling finds
concrete expression in results, and success follows their aspirations.
Nature provides for their desires. There is no plan. It is only necessary 
for them to start the work, and the work will take care of itself.
The whole force of nature is behind such an undertaking.
 The way of achieving this automatic planning is to raise one's
consciousness to the level of cosmic consciousness, where all the forces
of almighty nature will be conducive to the fulfilment of the desire. But
for all practical purposes, until the consciousness has been raised to a
sufficiently high degree, it is necessary before starting work to look into
the surroundings and circumstances and to gauge the possibility of
successful performance, taking into account the resources at hand. It is
necessary to be realistic at one's own level of consciousness and to live
within one's means.
 When we consider the importance of planning, we should bear
in mind that automatic machinery produces the faultless product,
free from irregularities and imperfections; if the machinery is not
automatic, the finish of the product may be uneven. If we could
adopt a system of automatic planning by raising our consciousness to
a state where planning and execution of work occur simultaneously,
the chances of variation and error would, of course, be far less. But
as long as we have not gained such a state of mind it is to our advantage 
to spend some time in proper planning.
 If the planning is efficient, the action will take less time and will
be performed with the minimum of energy, giving the maximum
results possible in the circumstances. It is necessary, however, to review 
the plan from time to time in the light of progress.
 Planning should be done properly, but there should be a limit to it.
The time factor, which is the most valuable factor in life, must not
be lost sight of. A higher consciousness should be cultivated to develop 
a broad vision, foresight, clear thinking, intuition, power of
imagination and precision of thought, all of which form the basis of
proper planning. This will provide the master key to successful economy 
in all fields of life, which is the main purpose of planning.
 Once the action has been planned, it is very important that it
should be carried out in the most effective manner.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) THE ART OF PERFORMING; AN ACTION WITH MINIMUM EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY
 For this it is first necessary that the thought behind the action
should be powerful. A weak thought will require a great deal of
exertion to produce the desired result, whereas a powerful thought
will achieve its aim easily. A highly developed power of thought is
achieved through the process of transcendental meditation.
 Surroundings and circumstances should also be favourable for the
performance of an action. If the surroundings feel the need of an
action and hope to receive something useful from it, then the surrounding 
atmosphere is favourable and the performance of the action
becomes easy and harmonious.
 The action should be harmless. If it is meant to harm someone there will be opposition to its performance from the surroundings and it will be necessary to exert more energy to meet the resistance. The doer should be powerful and energetic. If he is not energetic, he lacks confidence in performing an action and at every moment is afraid to take a step. In the state of Being the conscious mind is attuned to the field of limitless life-energy and gains such vitality that any action is easily and quickly performed with the minimum expenditure of energy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) THE ART OF PERFORMING AN ACTION IN MINIMUM TIME
 To work quickly one needs self-confidence and decisive thinking.
Much time is lost in starting ill-considered actions and in repeatedly
trying to undo them in the hope of improvement. This lack of confidence 
is a great barrier to performing actions in the least possible
time.
 The increasingly fast tempo of modern life demands great presence
of mind, a developed intellect and an energetic and vital personality.
Sluggish action does not fit in with the nature of things today. Speed
is the tendency of the age. Those who are unable to keep pace with
the fast tempo of modern life create tensions in themselves. Speed
in action is essential to a joyful life in the world today.
 The aspiration of modern man is to live on earth when the sun
shines during the day and to fly to the moon at night. Success in action 
demands that man should be energetic, intelligent, quick and
self-confident. If these qualities are not present, he does not belong to
the modern age.
 The time factor is a vital factor in life. Those who have accomplished 
great things in the world have been those who valued time.
Time is limited in this life, and much evolution must be accomplished
for fulfilment. The time factor must, therefore, be valued above
everything else. It is said that time and tide wait for no man. Experience 
shows, however, that if we gain ground in the timeless eternity
of absolute Being, then time serves us most because the absolute existence 
of unbounded eternity is the source and basis of all time past, 
present and future.
 Supplemented by Being the life of the individual becomes free
from all forms of resistance, inward and outward. Great self-confidence, 
clarity and power of mind dawn in the individual, and all
harmony and favourable influences in his Surroundings naturally
create a congenial atmosphere for an action to be performed in minimum 
time.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) THE ART OF PERFORMING ONLY USEFUL ACTION
 It is necessary to acquire the ability to select right action.
 The usefulness of an action differs from man to man, depending
upon his state of consciousness. No action in life can be said to be
absolutely useful unless it is performed from the level of absolute
consciousness. Every action in the world may be looked upon as
useful from some angle, but from other points of view it may prove
to be completely useless.
 A deeper consideration of an action's usefulness for the doer and
his surroundings leads us to conclude that there could be an action
which he likes, the fruit of which he may cherish, but which may yet
be harmful to other people either close to him or at a distance. When
action is only partially useful it cannot really be called useful action.
 For example, a thief quickly collects great wealth. This is an action
with results which the thief enjoys; but the action is not cherished by
the surroundings. Such an act is called sinful and wrong; it seems
useful to the doer but only from a very gross point of view; in reality
it is not useful even for him.
 lf an individual has the vision to distinguish betwecn right and
wrong and to foresee the results of his action, that alone will lead
him to choose actions that are useful both to himself and others. This
ability will result from the individual's high level of consciousness.
 We have seen that it is impossible to determine the absolute usefulness
of an action on the intellectual level. When the individual mind
becomes attuned to the cosmic law, action and behaviour are in
harmony with the stream of evolution. Only then can the individual
perform really useful action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) THE ART OF PERFORMING AN ACTION TO PRODUCE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND 
DESIRABLE RESULTS
 To perform an action which will produce the most effective and
desirable results, a man must have the following qualities:
 A. Strong thought-force.
 B. Great energy.
 C. Favourable surroundings and circumstances.
 D. The ability to perform right action.
 E. Self-confidence.
A. Strong Thought-Force
 The power of thought depends on four factors: (a) the ability to
use one's full mental potential; (b) the ability to concentrate; (c) the
capacity to conserve mental energy; (d) effective co-ordination of
mind and nervous system.
(a) Full Mental Potential
 In the chapter How to Live Being, we saw that through transcendental 
meditation it is easy for everyone to use his full mental
potential.
(b) The Ability to Concentrate
 It is generally considered that the ability to concentrate depends
upon the quality and strength of the mind. However, the ability to
concentrate actually depends upon the degree of joy or happiness
provided by the object of attention. If a rose is beautiful, the mind
will quite naturally be concentrated on its beauty. If the rose is in
some way not fascinating or attractive, the mind will not remain
concentrated on it. Anything that is charming attracts the mind. The
greater the charm and happiness provided by the point of attention,
the longer the mind will concentrate on it.
 Every mind has the power of unlimited concentration. it is not
necessary for the mind to acquire this ability because it is already
there. No mind will remain on something that is ugly or which does
not provide happiness. Every mind is attracted to something which
is charming and joyful. Everyone therefore has the ability to concentrate
to any extent.
 It is common experience, however, that the mind is unable to
remain concentrated on any particular point. The reason is that
wherever the attention moves, the point of attention fails to provide
sufficient happiness and the mind wants to move on to a field of greater
happiness. Because there does not seem to be in the world any point of
joy so great that it can satisfy the mind's thirst for happiness, it cannot
remain concentrated at any point but is always seeking greater happiness
in variety. Since this is the situation, is it possible for the mind
to remain one-pointed? Yes, but only when it is based on the greatest
permanent happiness. From birth, the mind has flickered through
transitory joys. For this reason wandering is considered to be the nature
of the mind.
 It is generally thought that the mind is like a monkey, jumping
from branch to branch. To change the mind's nature from wandering 
to steadiness, it is thought that the mind and desires must be
controlled. But since to wander is not the nature of the mind, it is
not necessary to control it to make it steady. Its nature is, in fact,
to remain steady.
 Although a bee flies here and there in search of a honeyed flower,
flying should not be considered its essential nature. It flies with the
purpose of drawing honey from a flower; as long as it does not find
a flower containing honey it will wander. But when the flower is
found, the bee immediately alights on it.
 Similarly the mind wanders, but not by nature. It wanders because 
it does not find a place in which to rest or a medium of happiness. 
The mind is not like a monkey; in fact, it is like a king. Every
mind is like the king of kings. It will go to a place it likes and stay
there; it will. do the work it likes. If a king is found wandering about
his country, it is wrong to conclude that his nature is to wander.
He is wandering only in the absence of a throne to sit on. In the absence 
of his proper seat he continues to wander.
 No self-respecting man will sit in all untidy place unworthy of him.
So although it is not in the nature of a king to keep wandering, he
will do so even though he feels tired. He will not sit down until he
can find a seat worthy of him.
 Similarly the mind, like the wandering king, will not rest in any
place unworthy of it and will not want to be removed from a place
worthy of it which provides attraction and happiness. In such a place
the mind may rest, sit, enjoy and remain in enjoyment. It is wrong
to conclude that the nature of the mind is to wander.
 Work done in accordance with our nature pleases us. Anything
done against our nature displeases us. If it is our nature to run about,
then we feel better when we are allowed to run about. If it is our
nature to sit, then we feel happier when we are allowed to sit. If it
is our nature to sit and we are asked to run about, then naturally we
become miserable and tense.
 A mind which does not have a place in which to rest, which does
not have a medium of enjoyment and so is compelled to run about,
begins to feel miserable and tense. If wandering were the nature of the
mind, then it would feel happier if allowed to wander freely. But on
the contrary, we find that when the mind does not have a place to
rest, its desires remain unfulfilled and it begins to feel restless. For the
mind to remain steady in one place, it is only necessary to provide it
with something it likes. When something charming is given to it,
the mind remains steady; this steadiness is the state of concentration.
 We know that ordinarily the mind is able to concentrate on something 
pleasant and joyful, yet is unable to concentrate on something 
ugly. This is because ugliness is contrary to the nature of the
mind. So it is not a question of the mind having to acquire the ability
to concentrate; it only needs to be led to a place of joy and happiness
where it will remain naturally.
 Nothing in the field of gross creation is so joyful that it will satisfy
for all time the mind's thirst for happiness. Experience shows that
the subtle things of creation are far more charming than the gross.
So if the attention can be led to the subtle fields of creation and if
these can be experienced by the mind, they will naturally attract it by
being more charming than the gross strata of creation. When the
attention is led from the gross to progressively subtler strata of creation, 
the mind will find increased charm at each step. By transcending 
all the relative states of creation and reaching transcendental
bliss-consciousness, the mind will find that great joy transcending
the greatest joy of relative existence, eternal, absolute bliss. Having
gained absolute, eternal bliss, the mind never loses it. It holds it to
such a degree that bliss-consciousness becomes infused into the very
nature of the mind and the mind becomes bliss-consciousness.
 When the mind is thus established it remains steady and does not
need anything else, because there is nothing in the relative field of
existence which can challenge the validity of absolute bliss-consciousness. 
Therefore, once the mind becomes rooted in bliss-consciousness,
eternal contentment becomes its very nature and it remains steady,
even when it is associated with outer experiences and activity.
 The mind can only remain concentrated in the state of bliss-consciousness. 
Any other attempt to cultivate concentration amounts
to hard work without achievement. The practice of transcendental
meditation, which is so simple and which brings bliss-consciousness
into the very nature of the mind, is the most practical way to gain
concentration. As we have seen, it is not the ability to concentrate
which is gained: a state of bliss-consciousness must be created in the
mind so that it remains steady and concentrated by nature.
 People enter into an ascetic way of life thinking that in the busy
world or in the life of the householder the senses are too much attracted 
by pleasure in outer objects. They believe that to control the
mind the joys of the senses must be sacrificed and the senses not allowed 
to come into contact with these joys. This belief has led to practices 
for controlling the mind and has given rise to unnecessary asceticism 
in seekers after truth who wish to increase the capacity of their
minds. Controlling and thereby straining the mind is based on the
erroneous principle that its nature is to wander. The effort of control 
is not necessary.
 There are two ways of keeping a dog at the door. One is to run
after it, forcibly bring it to the door and tie it there with a chain. But
this is a difficult job. Even if the dog is tied it will pull against the
chain and try to run away. It will be difficult to keep it quiet at the
door. The second way is not to run after it and tie it with a chain, but
to put down some food at the door for it to eat. The dog will eat the
food and will willingly remain at the door.
 In the same way, it is not necessary to try to control the mind. The
best, easiest and most practical way of allowing the mind to be naturally
concentrated is to put it to the practice of transcendental meditation so
that it may acquire bliss-consciousness. When the mind remains concentrated 
it does not wander but remains steady wherever we put it.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(c) CONSERVING MENTAL ENERGY
 A great deal of mental energy is consumed when the mind is
perpetually thinking and wandering. Each thought consumes mental
energy, and if thoughts arise one after another, mental energy is
consumed all the time. if fewer thoughts come, less mental energy is
consumed, so that if the mind is established in bliss-consciousness it
remains contented in itself and does not wander here and there thinking 
uselessly. If a thousand thoughts were entertained every hour before 
the mind was established in bliss, and if after it was established
only ten thoughts came in an hour, then each thought would have
a hundred times more power. The only natural way of conserving
mental energy for a constructive purpose is the practice of transcendental 
meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(d) Co-ordination of Mind and Nervous System
 For strong thought-force it is necessary that the co-ordination
between mind and nervous system be well maintained. This requires
that both the nervous system and the mind should be strong. The
nervous system is physical; the mind is abstract. For strong thought-force 
the physical as well as the mental aspect should be strong. The
mind naturally becomes strong when the whole of the subconscious
becomes conscious.
 Proper functioning of the nervous system depends upon its physical 
condition, which is controlled by the food eaten and the exertion
made. If the food is right it keeps the nervous system energetic and
lively under normal functioning conditions. If the nervous system is
not strained it will function normally. But if the body is strained by
flickering or indecision on the part of the mind, then the nenTous
system becomes exhausted and stops functioning.
 If we eat spoiled and stale food the nervous system becomes weak.
If we drink alcohol the nervous system becomes inactive and dull.
If We work too hard the nervous system becomes tired and does not
function normally. This lack of normal functioning makes co-ordination 
of body and mind weak.
 The nervous system should be intact; right food and drink and
regular habits of eating, rest and activity will keep it so. Life should
be ordered by comfortable, regular habits of sleep, food and rest.
Activity should be moderate so as not to exhaust the body. If the
body is exhausted then the nervous system does not function well,
and when co-ordination between body, nervous system and mind
breaks down, the mind is disconnected from the body and the nervous
system, and the whole charm of life is lost in deep sleep.
 The practice of transcendental meditation helps to strengthen the
 physical condition of the nervous system as well as the mind; it
 enables the mind to use its full potential, remain concentrated, con 
serve its energy, establish good co-ordination with the body and thus
cultivate a strong thought-force whereby actions are performed in
such a way that the most effective and desirable results are produced.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;B. GREAT ENERGY
 For effective action and desirable results it is necessary that increased 
thought-force be supplemented with greater physical energy.
 We saw that individual life is like a wave on the ocean of cosmic
life, and that each wave has the possibility of drawing any amount
of water from the ocean, the whole ocean could rise in one wave.
Likewise, each individual can communicate with the unlimited ocean
of cosmic energy to gain the strength to perform actions which will
produce the most effective and desirable results.
 The energy we derive from what we eat, drink and breathe
is limited. That is why, when we have worked for some time, the
energy produced from food is used up and by evening we begin
to feel hungry and exhausted. This shows that to perform action for
the most effective and desirable results we should have some additional
source of life-energy.
 We should realise that life-energy appears as the power of thinking,
intelligence, creativity and joyfulness. The same life-energy is used
in different functions.
 If we want more life-energy than we ordinarily get from food and
drink, it will be necessary to find a means of drawing it from the
atmosphere. In addition we must learn how to obtain more life-energy 
through the power of thinking and being.
 We know that the source of all creation - of the atomsphere, of
food, drink and air, of thought and the thinking ability - is Being.
Therefore communication between our conscious mind and the ocean
of Being will be the way to draw upon this limitless source of energy.
 There are many methods for drawing more energy from the air.
There are saints in the Himalayas who live on life-energy drawn from
the atmosphere, but they are accomplished yogis who can draw,
in the early morning hours, enough life-energy to sustain them
throughout the day. These methods are not for people active in the
world.
 The system of transcendental meditation, however, is the most
effective way to bring the mind to the field of transcendental Being,
where it will naturally acquire life-energy for performing any amount
of hard work and for producing the most effective and desirable results. 
This drawing of energy from the field of Being is the most
striking aspect of the art of living, for it brings the active life of the
day-to-day world into communion with the source of limitless life-energy,
power, intelligence, creativity and bliss.
 If this message that limitless life-energy can be drawn from the
field of eternal Being were to reach the people of the world, and if
they were to take advantage of it, life would become free, joyful,
full of creativity, intelligence, peace and happiness. And if all the people
of the world were to rise to this high state of consciousness, the world
would be a paradise to live in.
 Fortunately, the present time is most suitable for spreading the
ideology of transcendental meditation; the need for such a formula
is now felt more than ever, since man has virtually lost the anchorage
which religions and metaphysical studies offered him in the past.
 The alert minds of the scientific age seem to find futility in the
promises of religion and the different schools of philosophy and psychology. 
Tensions are fast increasing at every level of life throughout
the world. On the one hand, the individual feels a lack of energy and
an increase in tension and on the other, the fast tempo of modern
life does not allow him a moment of real silence. The individual is
torn between the pressing call for greater activity and the lack of
energy to meet it. The result is an increase in heart disease and general
suffering. Each man is seeking that which will help him to
cope with the increased pace of living which modern civilisation
demands.
 Transcendental meditation directly attunes the energy of the
individual with the energy of cosmic life. At this perilous hour for
civilisation it is a gift from heaven.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;C. FAVOURABLE SURROUNDINGS AND CIRCUMSTANCES
 Surroundings contribute a great deal to the success of action.
Either surroundings must be favourable, or the performer must have
great strength of mind to persist whatever the circumstances.
 It should be inherent in an action that harmony is maintained with
the surroundings.
 The greatest force that a man can ever possess to keep his surroundings 
harmonious and favourable to his actions, comes from the purity
of his mind. Fixity of purpose and dedication to the activity strengthen
this force.
 Through the practice of transcendental meditation the individual
maintains the purity of Being in the very nature of his mind and comes
into harmony with his surroundings, and his surroundings come into
harmony with him.
 Other attempts to maintain harmony with the surroundings are
not as effective as this practice. Good behaviour towards others, kindness, 
compassion and helpfulness all. have their value, and one must
be guided by these high principles of life. One must be helpful to
one's neighbour, kind to friends, compassionate to one's surroundings ,
but all this kindness and compassion and help for others will be more
fruitful and valuable if the individual's inner life is pure.
 Fortunately for our generation, purity of life is no longer difficult
to attain because direct experience of Being is easy.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
D. THE ABILITY TO PERFORM RIGHT ACTION
 Right action springs frOm COntentment and the natural need for
action. It should be natural that a man performs only right action.
Right action is action which fulfils a legitimate need. By legitimate
we mean that the doer is justified in his need and in the manner of
action which he adopts to fulfil it.
 As we have seen, the question of right and wrong in the relative
field of life is very complex. We have seen that right action can be
determined only on the level of the laws of nature, and that a man
established in the state of Being naturally moves in accordance with
the laws of nature. Only on that level of heightened pure consciousness 
is it possible for the mind to be righteous. Right action is always
endorsed by the moral code of conduct. Any lack of morality, any
deviation from the diversity of life's purpose, results in deviation from
righteousness.
 Ordinarily it is difficult for a man to know what right action is.
The law of the land provides one criterion. Right action is that which
is at least not against the law. In this sense lawful action is right action.
ln general it could be said that the law of the land is based on the
laws of nature. In countries whose civilisation is old and where tradition 
has value the law of the land is derived fundamentally from the
laws of nature.
 The law of the land and the traditions of a country are general
guides to what is right and wrong. So a guide to right action is that
it must not be against the law of the land and that it should, if possible,
be directly in accordance with the laws of nature. Great delicacy and
sensitivity are required for any significant consideration of the laws
of nature, for they govern the process of evolution at all levels of
creation. They either complement or contradict each other, depending
on the stratum of creation on which they are functioning. A thorn
and a rose are produced from the same sap subjected to different laws.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Only a mind infused with Being can naturally function in accordance 
with the laws of nature. At that level, however, it is not a matter
of determining the rightness of an action but rather that the mind,
 by its very nature, knows only right action. Therefore the state of
 cosmic consciousness offers an absolute basis for right action. Earlier we
said that the law of the land and its traditions provide criteria of right
and wrong. These are criteria in the relative field and do not provide
a perfect guide. Only cosmic consciousness can inspire right action
at all times.
 Many people have the ability to choose a right action naturally
because the structure of society is such that from childhood they are
brought up to distinguish, roughly at least, right from wrong. Deeper
criteria of right and wrong are established when the individual grows
older and comes to know the laws and tradition of the land more
thoroughly. A more and more exact sense of judgment betwecn
right and wrong comes naturally as one's consciousness grows; but
when the consciousness is highest, and Being is infused into the nature
of the mind to the fullest extent, the mind knows without doubt what
is right or wrong. By natural inclination, by natural taste, wrong
actions and wrong thoughts are not even considered. So the real art
of performing right action lies in possessing a mind which is right
at all times. To be right, the mind must be in that state of lasting
contentment and purity which belongs only to the state of pure
consciousness. Acquisition of the highest purity of consciousness,
therefore, is vital for inculcating and maintaining a natural tendency
for right action.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;E. SELF-CONFIDENCE
 Self-confidence is a necessary ingredient in performing an action
which aims at the most effective and desirable results. We have seen
that self-confidence depends upon the state of mind. To have confidence 
in the Self, the Self must at least be known and brought to
the conscious level.
 One who is unaware of his Self cannot possibly have self-confidence. 
Any attempt to improve self-confidence without gaining
familiarity with the Self will always be ineffective.
 Gaining familiarity with the nature of the Self is a first step in
gaining self-confidence. When familiarity with the essential nature
of the Self has been gained so profoundly that it never leaves the level
of awareness, then a state of profound self-confidence is reached.
 Unless one is firmly grounded in an unshakeable state of bliss-consciousness 
of eternal Being, unless one has developed that cosmic
consciousness which alone is capable of establishing the Absolute in
the relative field of day-to-day life, it is not possible to have a natural
state of unshakeable self-confidence.
 No businessman ever gains self-confidence in the market unless
he has great wealth invested in his business. When the individual mind
is enlarged to gain the state of cosmic mind, only then can it remain
self-confident at all times.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(6) FIXITY OF PURPOSE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF AN ACTION
 Before any action can begin it is first necessary for the mind to
have a purpose that will be served by that action. If an action is begun
and the purpose is forgotten the action will not be continued.
 For success in action it is necessary that the process of action be
sustained, and for this a fixity of purpose must be maintained by the
performer. If the mind wishes to conduct the action effectively and
arrive at the most desirable results, it is essential that it should not
deviate from its purpose. This fixity of purpose might be called the
backbone of success of any action and also serves as the driving force
for the process of action.
 How can this ability be acquired?
 The answer lies in cultivating a state of mind where attention does
not waver but remains concentrated and fixed on action. It is the
wavering mind which tends to be distracted, and it is this condition
which is always a threat to the continuance of action and thus to
fixity of purpose.
 Maintaining fixity of purpose depends on the mind being habituated 
to beginning an action only after having considered all the points
for and against the results of action. For this it is most necessary to
possess the ability to follow steadfastly one line of action until the
action is completed.
 In the life of a man there is not just one thing to be done all the
time. There is not just one condition of life that has to be constantly
lived. There is not only one kind of aspiration to be constantly cherished. 
From the beginning of the day until it is time to sleep there are
hundreds of fields of activity and experience, all of which have value
in life. Therefore we must not forget that, together with fixity of
purpose, there has to exist the ability to move from one type of action 
to another and from one field of activity to another. The mind
does not have to be fixed constantly on one thing. This moving from
one plane of activity to another should be as natural to the mind as
remaining fixed on the performance of one action. Thus the mind
must have this double ability so that a man is able to participate in the
multiple activities and experiences of different spheres of life.
 If a man wishes to build a house, his fixity of purpose in performing
the action of building should not be so great that he becomes oblivious
to everything else in life. He should continue to conduct a normal life of
eating, resting, lighting his lamp and performing his normal activities
whatever they are. All such activities and other interests in life should
be allowed to co-exist with the fixity of purpose of building the house.
 Therefore, when we aim at cultivating fixity of purpose, we should
remember that we must not become absorbed in the performance of
an action to the extent that we lose sight of other aspects of life. Often
when someone, such as an artist, musician, or scientist, is engaged in
an activity well suited to his nature he becomes absorbed in his work
to the exclusion of other activities. It is good to be one-pointed about
actions which are natural and are enjoyed, but other aspects of life should
not suffer.
 For example, if a man who is a devoted scientist spends all his time
in the laboratory, his wife suffers, the children miss their father's love
and companionship and the home lacks his care. The culture of the
mind should be on a broad scale and on an all-round basis. The
whole of the mind must be cultured and its ability improved on
all levels.
 We have seen that the practice of transcendental meditation enlarges 
the conscious area of the mind and makes it more profound
and more practical on all levels. It is through this practice alone that
it is possible to cultivate the important ability of single-mindedness in
action and at the same time of not allowing it to bind one to the extent
that it robs one of pleasure in other aspects of life.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(7) THE ART OF PERFORMING AN ACTION WITHOUT HARMING ANYONE
 The art of performing an action without harming anyone lies
first in choosing an action which win bring good to oneself and all
others in one's surroundings, and secondly in adopting legal ways
and means to carry out the action.
 If the results of an action are useful to the doer and his surroundings 
while the process chosen for performing the action is illegal,
tension will be created in the surroundings. When choosing a useful 
action, it is necessary to choose a process of action which is also
harmless.
 Without having attained the state of cosmic consciousness no one
can be sure of performing actions which will not harm others, because 
the question of what influence actions have on different strata
of creation at different times cannot be judged by human intellect.
The effects of action are so complicated and far-spread in the universe
that it is beyond the range of human intelligence to describe an action
in terms of the harm or good done to creation.
 Therefore the only way to perform an action without harming
 anyone is to raise intelligence and consciousness to the level of absolute, 
divine consciousness. When the doer is established on that
level, any undertaking will naturally be in accordance with the rising
stream of evolution, harmless to him and the entire creation.
(8) THE ART OF PERFORMING AN ACTION TO YIELD MAXIMUM RESULTS
 The art of performing an action to yield maximum results rests
solely on the doer, on his intelligence, energy, fixity of purpose,
precision of thought and action, power of concentration, and ability
to control the surroundings to favour the action.
 To obtain maximum results it is necessary for the action to be performed 
to the best ability of the doer. Maximum ability demands the
most highly developed intelligence and energy on the part of the
doer.
 Greatest energy and intelligence are gained when individual consciousness 
is brought to the level of cosmic consciousness, while at
the same time individual energy is brought to the level of cosmic
energy'. When this occurs, great contentment and the ability to
concentrate and persevere develop naturally in the mind. With these
qualities a man is able to act with great precision, gaining maximum
results with the least expenditure of energy.
 However, something more than inner ability and efficiency is
needed to give maximum results from an action. This is the ability
to control circumstances and surroundings. Results are restricted by
the resistance of surroundings and circumstances. lf one has the ability
to perform an action so that the surroundings and circumstances automatically 
become congenial and favourable to success, then one will
certainly succeed in obtaining maximum results from an action. If
surroundings can be made favourable to the performance of an action,
there is no limit to the results an action can yield.
 An innocent, simple approach to action in accordance with the
laws of nature is naturally successful.
 People generally consider that the success of their actions depends
upon their ability, their intelligence, their creative mind and their
energy. But all these factors are of secondary importance. The main
factor for the success of an action is the doer's own purity.
 If the mind is one hundred percent pure, that is if the man is
evolved in cosmic consciousness, then the result will be one hundred
percent. If the purity of the mind is fifty percent, that is if the evolution
of the man is fifty percent, the result of each action will be fifty percent
of the total possibility.
 It is the purity of a man's heart and mind, and his innocent and
faithful approach to action with the purpose of all good to everyone,
which really succeed in yielding maximum results with minimum
effort.
 One more factor plays an important part in producing results
from action. This is karma, the fruit of actions performed in the
past. A good, virtuous man has in the past done good, virtuous deeds
which were in accordance with the process of evolution. The results
of those good deeds now add to the success of his present actions. So
we find that his present ability of mind and body, his intelligence and
energy, bring success to his actions in proportion to the influence of
good or bad karma from the past.
 The influence of good karma from the past brings him more
energy, clarity of thought and the ability to make right decisions, and
also produces influences in the surroundings which are favourable for
the performance of the action in hand.
 The influence of bad karma from the past brings him dullness,
inefficiency, loss of energy, weakness and every tension and suffering
as well as adverse influences in his surroundings, which begin to obstruct 
the successful performance of his actions and to hinder progress
toward any substantial results.
 This aspect of karma from the past is beyond the control of the
doer. The best he can do to neutralise this influence is to engage in the practice of transcendental meditation, which will raise his consciousness 
and produce a favourable influence in his surroundings.
When the consciousness is raised, energy and intelligence are increased.
Then, whatever the influence from the past, that influence will not
be able to nullify present action. Certainly the influence of past karma
will be there, but it will not be able to guide the destiny of present
action completely.
 If a businessman loses five hundred pounds, the loss is a loss for
all time. But although the loss will always remain a loss, if two
thousand pounds are earned the next day the gain overshadows the
loss.
 The formula for producing maximum results is to disregard the
obstacles and negative influences which offer resistance to the performance 
of action. The doer should engage in action and continue
until the desired results are achieved. When the standard of consciousness 
is raised through the process of meditation, the action performed
at that higher level of life energy and intelligence will have an overriding 
influence on karma from the past and will produce maximum
results.
 This is how, by the regular practice of transcendental meditation
supplemented by the power of charity and virtuous deeds, the negative 
influence of past karma can be counteracted and the path of
present karma smoothed. Then the action will be performed without
resistance or obstacle, yielding maximum results.
 This is how, by the power of present action on karma, destiny is
controlled. Herein lies the full meaning of the saying that man is master
of his own destiny.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(9) THE ART OF PERFORMING AN ACTION SO THAT THE PERFORMANCE REMAINS A JOY
 Any action will remain a joyful process throughout for the doer
and his surroundings only when he has great energy and intelligence
and encounters no resistance on the way, receiving all possible
co-operation from everything. The action must not become taxing to
his ability. He must have self-confidence, efficiency and the ability to
concentrate so that he feels no action is beyond his capability.
 When a businessman has great wealth he does not feel concerned
about what he spends in the market. The whole field of business remains 
a joy to him because it does not matter very much whether he
loses or gains; he already has more than enough for his purposes.
Likewise, when the doer has more energy than is required to perform
any action, the action is easy and remains a joy.
 Anything done in accordance with the nature of the mind pleases
it, and anything done against its nature displeases it. So if the action
undertaken by a man is in accord with the nature of his mind and
within his capacity, that action cannot be taxing or wearisome. Only
an action which suits his temperament can be enjoyed.
 For example, a boy is told to take a football to a house two miles
distant. If he can keep kicking the football towards the house, then he
gets it there in a pleasant and joyful manner. The delivery of the football 
to the house does not become a burden because he has played
with it all the time. If, however, he is asked to carry it instead of
being allowed to kick it, its delivery will become a burdensome task.
 If there were a means of raising one's daily actions to the level of
joy, this would be a technique for gaining the ability to perform them
with joy, and they would never become trying, tedious or boring.
 If a mother is loving to her child, the child is filled with joy. If
the mother asks him to run an errand for her, the wish of the mother
becomes an additional wave of joy to the child. He jumps up and
does what he is asked in a playful, joyful mood. But if the mother has
beaten him, making him cry and become unhappy, and then orders
him to do an errand, her order becomes an additional wave of misery
to the child. He would do the errand but the task would be a burden
to him.
 So if the mood is joyful, the performance of any action will be
joyful. lf the mood is miserable, tense and worried, then any action
will become a means of added tension.
 If the mind is not in a natural state of happiness, then no attempt
to be joyful and happy while performing an action will succeed.
Only when the very nature of the mind is saturated with joy can an
action be joyful. This is possible only when the mind has gained the
status of pure consciousness. Only when the conscious mind has become 
so familiar with the bliss of transcendental Being that it never
loses touch with it, is it possible to perform all action in joyfulness.
 Otherwise, any attempt to be happy in performing an action will
add tension, because energy is divided between the performance and
the need to feel joy.
 The modern practice of playing music in factories to bring happiness 
to the workers has the effect of dividing the attention. Although
the work is there and must be completed under pressure, it is natural
for the mind to want to listen to the music. Performing the work is
against the normal tendency of the mind, which is to enjoy the music.
 In this way, not only is tension created in the minds of the workers
but also the work loses quality. The employer provides music in the
workshop to make the workers happy, but the net result is an increase 
of tension and a gradual decrease of efficiency.
 Any artificial attempt to produce joyfulness in the field of activity 
brings adverse results. The only way to make the entire field of
action joyful is to fill the mind with joy. This can only be accomplished 
through the experience of Being.
 The art of behaviour influences not only the surface values of life,
making people happier and better in every way, but also touches the
inner core of life and advances it to the higher levels of evolution.
 The purpose of social behaviour is to give and receive for mutual
benefit. One should meet another either to give or to take; or rather,
mainly to give. When two meet to give the best of themselves to
each other both gain the maximum. If, on the contrary, both meet
and just expect the maximum from each other, each has closed the
door to giving, and neither gains anything from the relationship
except disappointment, resulting in tension on both sides.
 The fundamental rule of behaviour should be to give. When you
go to meet someone, think what you can give him: a concrete gift
such as a beautiful object, words of greeting, warm sympathy, praise,
adoration, love, elevating advice or good news for body, mind or
soul, or whatever you are capable of giving. There must be something
you can give when you meet someone. Merely a 'hello' or a 'how
do you do' is insufficient to produce a wave of love and joyfulness
at the meeting. The art of behaviour demands that the first moment
of a meeting should have something of real value for the meeting of
two hearts.
 The first fundamental in the art of behaviour is : meet with warmth
and meet to give. Behaviour should be on the level of giving. Give,
and it shall be given unto you. If all people in society behaved on
this level of giving, social behaviour could only result in the advancement
and glorification of everyone's life. Then only would the purpose 
of society be fulfilled.
 A sincere sense of giving can only arise on a level of contentment.
Only contented hearts and minds can think in terms of giving. Eternal 
contentment can come only through the development of bliss-consciousness.
 How to behave has become a concern of society today, because
the qualities of heart and mind are not given a fair chance to evolve.
Social relationships should always be a means of joy. They become
a problem only when the fundamentals of life are misunderstood. To
behave rightly with others one must think lucidly and have clear,
good intentions; one must have a decent way of life. One should
possess the qualities of tolerance, love, kindness and joyfulness.
 Joyfulness is a quality which cultivates and spreads love; it is the
result of the overflowing love of the heart and forms the basis of good
social relationships.
 If there is no tolerance, ill-feeling and disharmony result. Take, for
example, someone making an ill-humoured remark. If one is not
able to withstand the remark without reacting to it, ill-feeling springs
up in the repercussions that follow. If a man does not have the quality
of love, if his heart is hard, he begins to hate the person who has
offended him.
 It is the love of a mother for her child which makes her look
kindly on his mistakes. In fact, a mother enjoys the child's mistakes
because then she is able to give him more of her love. In that love the
child is better able to overcome the weakness of committing mistakes.
This is how, by the tolerance and love of his mother, a child improves, 
and the art of behaviour is infused into him naturally.
 What is the shortest way to the art of behaviour?
 Language is one facet of behaviour; we can polish our language.
Good manners are a part of behaviour, but good manners come only
from sound methods of bringing up children; children from good
families are brought up to be well-behaved. But the root of the art
of behaviour lies in a polished state of mind. This refined state of
mind depends upon the conscious mind being brought into communion 
with the bliss of absolute Being. So the basis of the art of behaviour 
is the technique for bringing the mind to the bliss-consciousness
of transcendental Being. This leaves both parties to any relationship
with added joyfulness, energy and love, while at the same time an
influence of peace, harmony and freshness in the atmosphere is created.
 Really good behaviour between people will only be possible when
their minds are broadened, when they are able to see the whole situation, 
to understand each other more thoroughly, to be aware of each
other's need and attempt to fulfil that need. This naturally necessitates 
an expanded consciousness, a right sense of judgment and
all the qualities that only a strong and clear mind possesses.
 Small minds always fail to perceive the whole situation and in
their narrow vision create imaginary obstacles and restrictions which
are neither useful to themselves nor to anyone else. Then their behaviour 
towards others only results in misunderstanding and increase
of tension. Good social behaviour is based on a strong, clear and
contented mind.
 In any social relationship the minds of both parties should be
established on the level of Being, or Being should be established on the
level of their minds, so that the bliss and contentment of Being are
deeply rooted in the hearts of each. Then their behaviour produces
influences of peace and harmony in the surroundings. The art of
behaviour is such that not only do the people concerned gain but
the entire atmosphere vibrates wild their influence of love, kindness,
harmony and peace.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BEHAVIOUR AND SURROUNDINGS
 Established in Being one is able to make the best use of surroundings; 
what they are does not matter; they are made conducive to the
fulfilment of the individual's desire.
 No surroundings can be considered absolutely bad or completely useless. If a mind is unable to take advantage of its surroundings, this is through its own weakness. For example, a man is sitting in a room that is full of dust and dirt. If his mind is grounded in contentment, joyfulness and peace, he radiates these qualities around him and does not pay attention to the dirt and dust. Or he begins to sweep the room, to wipe off the dust, and in doing so he does not feel miserable because even the particles of dust reflect back the joyfulness of his heart. On the other hand, if he is sad or tense he becomes more miserable and tense. The misery of his mind has multiplied itself and is being reflected back from the particles of dust in the room. It is the inner state of mind that is responsible for making a man joyful or miserable in any surroundings.
 A strong mind is tolerant; a weak mind is easily overcome by the
surroundings.
 If one doubts another man's behaviour one will continue to have
doubts even if he expresses love and joy when one meets him, because
the doubts were present before the conversation started. So a doubting
or unkind mind fails to enjoy even the joyfulness and sincerity of the
prevailing surroundings.
 The influence of the atmosphere on the individual depends upon
his own state of mind. According to his state of mind, the nature of
the atmosphere changes. If he puts a red glass to his eye he sees everything 
as red; if he looks through a green glass he sees everything
as green. Whatever the individual's state of mind, the atmosphere is
evaluated accordingly.
 The individual is responsible for the atmosphere. He creates it and
in turn is influenced by it. When his mind is strong, functioning at its
full potential, then he is able to make the best use of his surroundings
and circumstances. The art of action and the art of behaviour lie in
making the surroundings favourable instead of unfavourable to us.
The atmosphere is there for us to use and not to make us miserable.
If someone has said something, it is his action, his responsibility. If it
is useful to us we enjoy it, accept it, think about it, act on it and derive
benefit from it. But if it is not useful or elevating to us, then we do
not think of it again, we pay no attention to it. We do not bring it to
mind and brood over it. If we do so we shall be polluting our mind
with a bad thought.
 Therefore we must so cultivate our minds that we think and act
naturally in a manner which is elevating and beneficial. In this way
we will benefit ourselves and others. We do not encourage damaging
or malicious thoughts either by rejecting or accepting them; indifference 
is the weapon to be used against negative situations in life.
 This is the art of behaviour. If someone has done us an injustice,
we do not harbour it or think about it; perhaps it was a mistake. If
we allow it to affect our future actions towards him we are not giving
him the opportunity to improve his relations with us, and we also
suffer. Even if he does harbour ill-feeling towards us, we heap benefit
on him and ourselves if we behave towards him with love and tolerance. 
In this way, we help the atmosphere to improve and the improved 
atmosphere serves us better.
 As we have seen, when the mind is brought to the level of Being
the body is also brought to the same level. Thus by our thoughts,
words and actions and even by our presence, we radiate an influence
of life, peace, harmony and joyfulness.
 To improve relationships we must first improve our minds
and then we shall begin to behave well. Surroundings respond to us
best if we are grounded in the art of being, which is the technique
that places our lives on a high level so that we naturally and innocently
behave well in harmony and joyfullness. We must never in any way
be unnatural in our behaviour.
 If people everywhere would begin to meditate for a few minutes
morning and evening the whole of social behaviour would reach an
ideal state, for contact with Being not only improves and satisfies the
individual life but improves the atmosphere, increases harmony and
reduces fear, hatred, tension, cruelty and antagonism.
 In the absence of the art of behaviour quite the contrary effect is
produced. Tensions grow in the family, in society and in international
relationships. When Being is infused into the minds of individuals
social relationships improve in the most automatic and natural way,
great harmony is produced in the atmosphere, tension is released,
and the world is made better for people to live in.
The problem of health is the most vital problem in life. Everything
depends upon health: the inner peace and happiness of man, his
attitude and behaviour towards others, his accomplishments in life;
above all, life itself depends upon health.
 To consider health fully we should take into account both the
health of the individual and that of the cosmos - man and his atmosphere.
 Let us look at the following table:
The two main aspects of man's life are the relative and the absolute.
The relative aspect is perishable, the absolute imperishable. Relative
life has three aspects: mental, physical and environmental; or mind,
body and surroundings.
 So we find that man's whole life has four different components: Being, the mind, the body and his surroundings.
 Healthy Being, healthy mind, healthy body and healthy surroundings, together with healthy co-ordination between Being and mind, between mind and body and betwecn body and surroundings will constitute perfect health in an individual. To determine the nature of good health we must therefore consider:
 1. Being.
 2. Mind.
 3. Body.
 4. Surroundings.
 5- Co-ordination of Being and mind.
 6. Co-ordination of mind and body.
 7. Co-ordination of body and surroundings.
 Unless all these seven points are taken into account the consideration
of health will remain incomplete, and no completely correct solution
can be provided to the problem of ill-health.
 We invite the health organisations of the world to consider these
principles so that they may do what is needed to solve the problem
of ill-health and to alleviate man's suffering.
 It is lamentable that for centuries past the problem of ill-health
has been considered primarily on the physical level. Thanks to recent
advances in medicine, investigations into the causes of disease have
revealed that for a great majority of ailments the disease may be of
a physical nature though its cause is not physical. Such findings have
emphasised the validity of mental phenomena as the cause of disorders
in the physical body.
 Psychology and psychiatry were developed to remove mental
stress, thereby eradicating the mental cause of physical diseases, while
the medical profession continued to treat the diseased part of the
physical body.
 How far medicine helps to restore physical health, and how far
psycho-analysis and psychiatry succeed in helping man to overcome
the mental causes of psychosomatic disease are questions for the experts
who guide the destiny of medical science, psychiatry and psychology.
 The least that can be said about the problem of health in the world
today is that the measures so far adopted are insufficient to maintain
the health of the people. Even in countries where medical science is
most advanced and psychiatrists and psycho-analysts are the fashion
of the day, the health record shows that a large number of people
suffer from weak hearts and die of heart failure, and that the number
of mental patients is fast increasing.
 This is a serious situation which can only be resolved by the health
authorities all over the world. But before this can be achieved it is
necessary for them to add to their existing knowledge. This requires
on the part of the medical associations a sympathetic attitude to
new suggestions and a readiness to give them a trial.
 If a leaf begins to wither and dry up it may be either because the
particular leaf has been affected by undue heat or because the supply
of nourishment from the root has decreased. If the cause is excessive
heat, attending to the individual leaf and protecting it from heat will
remove the cause and save the leaf from dying. But even when the
leaves are being attended to individually from outside it is necessary
to see that a supply of nourishment reaches them from the root.
Whenever a leaf shows signs of withering it is essential to maintain
an adequate supply of nourishment from the root to all parts of the tree.
 When a boil appears on a finger a good doctor will test the blood and investigate the cause, even though he treats the boil on the surface.
 We therefore arrive at the principle that those interested in the
prevention or cure of disease should have a knowledge of all. gross
and subtle aspects of the body. These range from the body, which is
the end-organ of the nervous system, to the mind, which in turn extends 
from gross to subtle levels of thinking and touches the field of Being.
 It is necessary, therefore, for the medical profession to have a
knowledge of the whole range of life, from the outside cosmos to the
body and through all the subtle regions of the mind to the state of
pure consciousness, Being. It would also be invaluable if the health
authorities possessed the formula for contacting the field of ultimate
Being, which is the very basis of all the different levels of individual life.
 A gardener who knows how to take care of the root and who sees that it receives the nourishment it needs will succeed in maintaining health at all levels of the tree. A medical man who possesses the knowledge of all the different aspects of individual health, knowing how to care for the basic stratum of life - the field of Being - will succeed in restoring and maintaining good health at all levels.
 A formula exists to take care of the very root of individual life, to maintain and restore health on all levels of mind, body and surroundings.
 We offer this formula in no spirit of competition or challenge but out of love for man and with all goodwill towards those people all over the world who are endeavouring to alleviate suffering by whatever means they have found useful.
 To build more hospitals to alleviate sickness and suffering for
people who have already fallen in is a laudable act of charity. But
it is infinitely more important to find ways and means of preventing
people from falling sick and of ensuring that they will always enjoy
good health. Since a way does exist of preventing people from becoming 
sick, the introduction of it to people all over the world would
be a much greater act of charity.
 We shall see how this new goal of good health may be achieved.
 Preventive medicine is already an established and important part
of the health programme in every country. But real progress in this
field depends upon the application of new findings as they come to
light.
 Something new which has proved its value for the preservation
and improvement of health in body, mind and surroundings is put
forward in the following pages.
 Mental health depends upon the state of the mind, which is an
abstract factor, and upon the state of the nervous system, which is
concrete. The nervous system is the vehicle for the functioning of the
mind, since it serves to connect the subjective nature of man, the mind,
with the objective world around him. So in considering mental health
we must take into account both the state of the mind and the state
of the nervous system.
 But first let us form a clear conception of what the mental aspect
of the personality is, of what mind is in relation to the body and to the
whole personality.
 The mind lies between Being and the body. The mind is simply a
link to connect Being of unmanifested nature to the body and to the
manifested aspects of the relative world. It is a link to co-ordinate the
absolute and relative aspects of life. At one extreme the mind, in its
fullest aspect, touches the core of absolute existence, Being; at the
other it touches the gross levels of relative existence. In terms of Being,
mind could be defined as vibrating consciousness. In terms of the
body, mind may be defined as the fountainhead of the nervous system 
and as such is the source of the body.
 So the mind stands in the same relationship to man as the root to
the tree, and the function of the mind is similar to that of the root.
The root has a dual function to perform. It has to draw nourishment
from the ground and it must pass on that nourishment to the outer
tree. The mind, by virtue of its position between Being and the body,
likewise has a dual function. It must draw in life-energy from absolute 
Being and pass it on to the body and to the other fields of
relative existence. If the root successfully maintains the process of
drawing in and giving out, then the health of the tree is ideally maintained. 
Any failure to maintain this process results in ill-health for the
tree. Likewise, failure on the part of the mind to draw sufficient life-energy 
from Being naturally results in weakness or ill-health of the
body and personality. So we find that co-ordination of the mind with
Being and with the body is the key to good health.
 We shall now deal with the different aspects of health - mental,
physical and environmental.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 MENTAL HEALTH
 Mental health depends upon the normal functioning of the nervous system, so that the whole mind is brought to bear upon the external world. Normal functioning of the nervous system results in good physical health, enabling the body to carry out the dictates of the mind, to fulfil its desires and the purpose of existence. So long as co-ordination of mind and nervous system is intact, mental 
health is maintained. When co-ordination breaks down because of
some failure either on the part of the mind or of the nervous system,
ill-health results. Such failure of the mind is brought about by its
constant inability to fulfil its desires.
 The main reason for this is a lack of clarity and power of thought,
so that the nervous system is not stimulated to the extent where it
can carry out the activity needed to fulfil the desire. Thorough coordination 
and perfect functioning require a profound power of
thought on the part of the mind together with a correspondingly
efficient executive ability in the nervous system.
 The integrity of the organic nature of the nervous system is as
essential as the power of the mind, for they are interdependant in their
functions. It has been found that while the nervous system remains
unchanged, an improvement of the state of the mind results in an
improved state of thinking and a better co-ordination between the
mind and the world around it. What the whole mind is capable of
expressing itself in the external world, the subject comes into a more
perfect and rewarding relationship with the object. Happiness is
clearly a result of the fulfilment of the needs of the mind, and this
provides the basis for normal health.
 It has also been found that if the physical state of the nervous system 
is improved through medicine while the state of mind remains
the same, thinking becomes more profound and the mind functions
more energetically and more efficiently. Thus we find that the mind
and nervous system are interdependent. But since the mind is obviously 
of a more subtle nature than its organ, the nervous system, it seems
wiser to give greater importance to the mind, particularly when considering 
mental health.
 Any number of factors might interfere with the growth of a tree,
but weakness in the seed itself will overshadow them all in importance.
In the same way, any number of factors might prevent the fulfilment
of a need, but weakness in the power of thought must certainly overshadow 
all others. A strong seed will produce a tree even in a desert,
whereas no amount of nurturing will help a weak seed. If the basic
power of thought is strong it will find its way to fulfilment.
 If, because of failure to satisfy its needs and desires, the mind feels
discontented and therefore tension begins to arise within it, the way
to remove these tensions will be to strengthen the mind by increasing
its power to think. This is achieved by enlarging the conscious mind
through meditation.
 When tensions build up in the mind they are reflected upon the
body through the nervous system. The anxious mind, constantly
flitting back and forth among its problems in a discontented state,
exhausts and irritates the nervous system and the body. Just as a
servant whose master constantly gives indecisive and confusing orders
becomes tired and irritable and eventually fails to do anything, so
the nervous system and the body become tired and exhausted and
eventually fail to function efficiently when the mind is in a state of
stress.
 In this way mental stress produces disease and even organic changes 
in the body. Obviously the cure for all such suffering is to create
a situation in the mind whereby it becomes and remains unwavering
and steady. This is achieved by expanding the conscious area of the
mind and thereby making it strong. As a result of strengthening the
conscious mind a better co-ordination between mind and nervous
system is established, and a smooth and efficient functioning of the
body is the natural result. Perfect mental health is maintained by this
co-ordination of the mind with the nervous system and its end-organ,
the body.
 This is already being accomplished by individuals in many countries
all over the world by the regular practice of transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHYSICAL HEALTH
 Medical research has shown that a large proportion of physical
disorders arise primarily from mental tension as a result of anxieties
and failures in life.
 When dealing with mental health we have seen that the process
of transcendental meditation strengthens the mind and releases tension, 
and that this is how all psychosomatic suffering can be relieved
at its source. There are, however, purely organic diseases for which
there is no evidence of a mental cause. But it is well known that
a sick man has a mental and emotional attitude towards his illness
which, while not causing the illness itself, may still have profound
effects on its course. Meditation will certainly remove these anxieties.
It will develop mental strength to endure and rise above suffering.
In this respect also meditation's contribution is of real value.
 But let us now consider what effects meditation can have upon
the physical structure of the body in order to find out its effects upon
purely organic disease.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE INFLUENCE OF TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION ON HEALTH
 When, during transcendental meditation, the attention is drawn
towards consciously experiencing the subtler states of a thought, respiration 
is found to become greatly reduced in amplitude; breathing
becomes soft and refined.
 Physiologically it is clear that for this to take place there must be
a fall in the level of carbon dioxide in the plasma. This can only occur
as a result either of forced over-breathing which washes the carbon
dioxide out through the lungs, or by a fall in the production of carbon
dioxide through metabolic processes.
 Because there is no forced over-breathing during meditation we
can only conclude that the softening of the breath is due to a fall in
the production of carbon dioxide.
 The production of most energy for activity in the body finally
involves the oxidation of carbon and its elimination as carbon dioxide.
 Greater activity needs greater energy, which is produced by the
increased oxidation of carbon and its elimination as carbon dioxide.
Less activity needs a smaller amount of energy, which results from
less oxidation and elimination of carbon dioxide.
 This shows that when during transcendental meditation less carbon 
dioxide is eliminated by softer breathing, the process of oxidation
must be less, which naturally produces lesser amounts of energy.
 That is why the activity of the body and the nervous system is
reduced during transcendental meditation. This explains why the
whole body becomes calm and quiet as the mind proceeds to experience 
finer states of a thought.
 This quietening of the body naturally allows an unusual degree
of rest, which conserves energy to a considerable degree. It is certain 
that the activity of mind and nervous system is least in this state
and that the mind becomes quiet and calm.
 In this quiet state both the mind and the nervous system are alertly
poised like the arrow drawn fully back upon the bow ; they are without
activity, but the entire system is alert in stillness. At the same time
all the mechanisms of the body are acutely balanced and steady.
It is this restful alertness of the nervous system which represents its
most healthy state and is the basis of all energy and action.
 This restful alertness is a state of suspension where the nervous
system is neither active nor passive. This state of no activity and no
passivity is the state of Being. This is how the nervous system is
brought to the level of Being and, becoming attuned to Being
reaches a level of limitless energy. Thus the nervous system attain
its most normal and healthy state. Here lies the key to good health.
 The fall in carbon dioxide output has another effect: that of causing 
a tendency for the reaction of the blood to change from acidity
towards alkalinity. This has in turn widespread effects upon the chemistry 
of the blood, all of which are beneficial to the entire system.
 The existence of the body depends upon the activity of the metabolic 
process. Activity belongs to the relative field, whereas Being
is of transcendental, absolute nature. Maintenance of the body is
dependent upon both the subtle and gross fields of activity. If the body
could be brought to a state where its activity stops but the nervous
system is not allowed to be passive, if it could be in a state where it
is neither active nor passive, the activity of the body would then be
on the level of Being. If the metabolic process could simply remain
still without rendering the body passive, it would place the activity
of the body on the level of Being.
 When we talk of the level of Being let us first see clearly what we
mean. Being is the essential constituent of the individual. It is simply
there, in Its unmanifested state, forming the basis of everything and
all phenomena. It is the basis of all mind and matter, the basis of the
entire manifest creation. This state of Being is beyond all relative
existence; that is why it is called transcendental and absolute. Transcendental, 
because it is out of all relative creation; absolute, because it
does not belong to relative existence. It is never-changing, eternal
existence. Like the sap in a tree, Being is omnipresent in creation. It is
the ultimate source of all energy, intelligence, creativity and activity.
It, in Itself, is neither active nor passive. It is the source or fountainhead 
of all activity and passivity.
 In the relative field of life there is either activity or passivity. Absolute 
Being belongs in its essential nature neither to the field of
activity nor to the field of passivity. Any state of life which belongs
neither to activity nor passivity lies outside relative existence and
naturally belongs to the field of absolute Being, and that which belongs
to the field of absolute Being gains the status of absolute Being
Itself. For nothing other than Itself can be It.
 The meaning of the words absolute Being should now be clear.
In the light of our present thesis it mean the state of life which is
neither active nor passive.
 Thus it is clear that if the metabolic process, which keeps the body
alive and maintains its co-ordination with mind in the relative field
of existence, could be brought physiologically to a state of restful
alertness, life could be placed on the level of Being.
 It can be said that awareness depends upon the state of the nervous
system. When the nervous system is active in the waking state, the
mind has no opportunity to dissociate itself from the surrounding
world; when the nervous system is tired the mind has no chance to
use its conscious capacity, and awareness is lost in deep sleep. If the
nervous system could be brought to a state where it could hold the
mind so that it neither uses its conscious capacity to experience an
outer object nor yet completely loses its awareness - that is, if the mind
could simply remain conscious without being conscious of anything
in the outer world - it would attain a state of pure awareness where it
is neither active nor passive. This pure awareness is the state of Being.
Simultaneously, the nervous system gains the state of restful alertness
which becomes the meeting place for relative and absolute states of
life. The nervous system, as far as its ability to produce awareness is
concerned, is then on the plane of Being, the field of eternal existence.
This would be the state of perfect health in mind and body.
 How is this possible1 What approach could be adopted to produce
such a physiological state of the nervous system:'
 Physiologically, the functioning of the nervous system depends
upon the metabolic process. The metabolic process depends mainly
upon the breathing. If by any means the breathing could be slowed
down or made softer or reduced in amplitude, the metabolic process
would be reduced. If the breathing could be brought to a state where
it is neither active nor passive, that state of extreme delicacy of breath
where it could be said to be flowing and not flowing, the metabolism
would be established in a state of suspension between activity and no
activity on the level of Being. This would harmonise the body with
Being. Life would be sustained but its expression would be silent in
the relative existence. This is the state of the nervous system which
would keep the mind awake in itself, and through this state of self-awareness 
of the mind the whole body would be sustained in itself.
 A state of no physical change will exist in the body; the whole
physical structure of the body will be suspended on the level of the
pure state of life. This will be a state where the process of evolution,
or the process of change, will have stopped building up or decaying;
change will have ceased to be. The whole body and mind will be
placed on the level of Being. Both mind and matter, forming the
gross and subtle aspects of the individual, will have been raised to one
level of never-changing existence, the level of eternal, absolute Being.
Here they will lie together in unity, for both will have gained the same
level of life.
 The desired results can, therefore, be achieved in any of the following 
ways:
 1. Psychological - where only the mind is involved. This in practice 
 is the system of transcendental meditation.
 2. Physiological - where the metabolic process is reduced by working
 on the body or breathing. This practice is achieved through
 yogic physical culture and appropriate breathing exercises.
 3. Psycho-physiological - where both mind and breathing are
 made to function at their levels in order to bring both the mind
 and the body to that state of suspension on the level of Being.
 We shall now see how breathing can be brought to a state of
neither activity nor passivity.
 This state of breath has to be created in a very natural way because
any unnatural method will cause strain. It cannot be achieved by attempting 
to slow the breath because slowing it will strain the process
of breathing. The problem is how to create a natural state of extremely
soft breathing in which breathing would almost transcend activity.
One possible way of slowing the breath is the extended practice of
controlled breathing so that the body becomes used to maintaining
itself when the breath is either in or out. This practice does result in
maintaining the body with very soft breathing and eventually creates
a physiological state where the breath is brought to a condition which
is neither active nor passive.
 The aim of bringing the body to the level of Being is achieved as
a result of such a practice of controlled breathing. But because success
through this method demands long practice of great control under the
expert supervision of a competent teacher it is quite unsuitable for the
householder's way of life, especially in the modern age.
 However, there is the psychological way to achieve this state of
the breath. Let us first consider the principle that governs this way.
Experience shows that breathing becomes faster when we run and
slower when we sit. It is faster after we have eaten because more
oxygen is needed for digestion of the food. Breathing is slow or fast
according to the work the body has to do. The work to be done by
the body depends on how the mind wants the body to function. This
means that the activity of the mind, or thinking, is at the basis of
the activity of the body. So we find that the body's activity, which
directly controls the process of breathing, is governed by the process
of thinking.
 As we have seen the thought process on the level of the conscious
mind is the result of much greater activity than at the starting
point of a thought. Increased activity naturally needs greater release
of energy in the system, and this necessitates correspondingly heavier
breathing. But, on the contrary, if the thought can be consciously
recognised as a thought right at its source, then the energy required
to raise the thought to the ordinary conscious level of the mind would
naturally be saved, and the result would be a lower production of
energy in the system. This would necessitate a general reduction in the
process of oxidation, which in turn would soften the breathing. The
goal of bringing the breath to a state in which it is neither active nor
passive would be achieved.
 This shows that as the mind begins to experience subtler states of thought during transcendental meditation it engages itself in correspondingly less activity, and as a result breathing simultaneously
begins to be shallower, more refined and reduced in amplitude.
 When the mind reaches the experience of the subtlest state of thought the breathing reaches the shallowest level of its flow and eventually, when the mind transcends the subtlest thought and gains the level of pure consciousness, the breathing comes to that State Which is neither active nor passive, the level of pure Being.
 Thus we find that the practice of bringing the mind to the level of Being simultaneously brings the breath to the same level and establishes the nervous system and the body on the plane of absolute existence. In this state there is no release of energy by the metabolic process, no change or decay in the state of the body.
 This is the state of perfect health in mind, nervous system and body.
 The body is then a fit medium through which the omnipresent, absolute  Being can shine and radiate in the relative field of existence.When a glass of water is placed in the sun, the sun is reflected in it. The sun is always shining but shows no reflection unless a proper medium is found through which it can reflect. Similarly, Being is always everywhere but It has no opportunity to manifest Itself directly in relative existence unless a suitable state of the nervous system is created for it to do so.
 When the nervous system is brought to this condition either by the practice of controlled breathing or controlled thinking, or by both together, the body can be brought to the level of Being to enjoy life and good health. Such is the blessing of transcendental meditation.
 The atmosphere of an individual is made up of the radiations from
his mind and body, and its quality depends upon the influence spread
by his thoughts and actions.
 The atmosphere created by a lazy man is dull and depressing,
whereas an energetic man carries with him a dynamic influence. To
produce a healthy and elevating atmosphere one has to be healthy.
 Every man produces his own atmosphere, and every man's atmosphere 
is influenced by that produced by every other man.
 We have seen that health depends upon the state of Being. Therefore 
the formula for the good health of our surroundings must be
based on the manner in which Being can be brought to the level of the
atmosphere or the surroundings can be brought to the level of Being.
 To produce the influence of Being in the atmosphere it is necessary
for the mind and body to be established in Being. When they are
established on this plane the surroundings naturally receive the corresponding 
influence of harmony, happiness, peace and purity. By
bringing the mind and the body to the level of Being, the atmosphere
is naturally infused with the value of Being.
 After meditation, when the mind emerges from the state of transcendental 
Being and engages in the field of thinking, the entire
thinking process is influenced by Being. The vibrations emitted by the
process of thinking have the quality of Being; by experiencing Being
the mind radiates continuously the influence of Being in the atmosphere.
 When the mind is brought to the level of Being it is established on
the level of cosmic law. When, through the practice of meditation,
Being continues to be held on the level of the conscious mind even
when it engages itself in outer activity, the mind remains in constant
communion with cosmic law.
 When the mind functions from the level of cosmic law all the
laws of nature are in complete harmony with it, and the whole of
nature around the individual is set free from disharmony and strain.
 Disharmony in nature is due to the mind not being attuned to
cosmic law. When body and mind are attuned to cosmic law all
thoughts, actions and words vibrate transcendental Being and bring
It to the level of the surroundings, and the entire atmosphere surrounding 
the individual is set in accordance with the cosmic purpose.
 All the different strata of creation are nothing but different stages
of vibrating Being. But when the mind of a man is not in direct union
with Being the vibrations of the mind may be out of accord with
natural laws. When he is established in cosmic Being the vibrations
of the individual are the vibrations of Being. Being, already present
in all the different strata of nature, becomes as if alive and vibrates
in perfect unison with all levels of creation. The different levels of
creation are then correlated with each other according to their natural
affinity and with the laws of nature functioning at their respective
levels. This eliminates the disharmony which may exist between the
different planes of creation around the individual when the mind is
not in accord with cosmic law. This is a very subtle consideration
but it is the truth of nature.
 When the mind is not in tune with cosmic law, not in tune with
Being, it is not functioning in complete accord with the laws of nature.
Such a mind may emit an influence of disharmony unknowingly and
without intention.
 Either the mind functions naturally so that all the laws of nature are
in perfect accord with cosmic law and all atmosphere vibrant with the
value of Being is created around the individual, or the harmony is disturbed 
because the mind is not established naturally on the level of Being
 An individual's atmosphere cannot possibly be made as quiet
and calm as his body becomes when the mind transcends and Being
is established. The nervous system is brought to a state of activity and
no activity, a state which is neither static nor dynamic, and there
gains the level of Being. It is not possible to produce this state of perfect 
equilibrium in the surroundings because these are eternally activated 
by the laws of nature operating in accordance with the cosmic
purpose of evolution.
 Nature moves ever on, eternally evolving the whole of creation.
lt is not, therefore, possible to bring nature to the level of transcendental 
Being. But because the eternal, ever-changing field of nature is
forever permeated by the state of Being, it is possible to make transcendental 
Being vibrate in the surroundings by eliminating the disharmony 
which might be radiated by an individual who is not cosmically 
evolved. This disharmony should be properly understood.
 Take the case of a man who is not cosmically evolved and who acts and
thinks according to his level of consciousness. His desires may not accord
with the cosmic purpose because they have no cosmic basis and therefore 
all that he does may not be in harmony with the cosmic purpose.
 Any thought or activity carried on by the individual which is in
accordance with natural evolution and the cosmic purpose creates an
influence that accords with natural laws. But if it is not in accordance
with the cosmic purpose it is against the natural way of evolution and
the entire atomsphere is strained; all the laws of nature subjected to
that influence are strained. Currents antagonistic to the natural conditions 
of evolution are set in motion in the atomsphere, and the natural 
stream of individual and cosnlic evolution is distorted.
 Here we find the reason for a virtuous way of life. All that is moral,
virtuous and truthful in life is in accord with the laws of nature. All
that is immoral, sinful and harmful is against evolution.
 When a man thinks wrongly, speaks wrongly or acts wrongly,
he strains the laws of nature functioning in his vicinity and causes
discord in them. This can be felt. If you enter the room Of a bad man
)10U begin to feel his harmful influence. If you enter the room of a
good man you immediately sense the influence of harmony. His
influence is held by the walls around him; he is, so to speak, found on
the wall, the ceiling and the floor of his room. That influence of harmony 
is felt in turn by you as inward pleasure. When you are
pleased the sense of harmony and goodwill you create in your friend's
room accords with the process of evolution.
 When an individual has risen to cosmic consciousness all his
thoughts and actions are a part of the cosmic purpose. Whatever he
does, speaks or thinks helps the process of evolution and helps to
neutralise the unnatural influence created in the atmosphere by minds
which remain unintegrated.
 By raising one's consciousness to the level of pure consciousness one
sets the surroundings and circumstances naturally in harmony with the
cosmic purpose, that is, in accordance with cosmic Being. This means
diffusing the value of Being into the surroundings or bringing the
surroundings to the level of Being.
 What do we mean by saying we bring the surroundings to the
level of Being ? We mean that the individual does not emit vibrations
or influences which might in any way be opposed to the natural process 
of evolution or which might create disharmony in the natural functioning 
of creation at all its different levels. Therefore in order that
Being may remain in perfect accord with all the different strata of
nature in the atmosphere of the individual, it is only the individual
who has to rise to the state of pure consciousness. This is how the
individual brings his surroundings and atmosphere under the grace
of Being and avoids creating resistance between the cosmic law and
the innumerable laws of nature functioning at different strata of existence.
 When the breath of an individual becomes the impulse of eternal
life the health of the individual is brought to the level of the eternal
health of cosmic life. When Being is established on the conscious level
of the mind then the body serves the purpose of cosmic evolution.
Such a mind and such a body breathe perfect health into the atmosphere.
 Thus only when Being is established on all levels of individual life
is it possible to have a state of perfect health on all the levels of individu31 
life. When all the different aspects of the tree are saturated
with sap only then does the entire tree breathe in perfect health;
if any part of the tree loses its direct contact with the say it begins to
dry up. Similarly, when any aspect of individual life loses co-ordination 
with Being it begins to suffer from lack of Being. When the
atmosphere fails to receive the influence of Being through the
individual then it loses health and becomes strained. This, as we have
said, is felt by the individual. It does not bring the individual a sense
of harmony and peace, but rather one of strain and agitation, fear and
tension.
 When the body has no opportunity to come to the level of Being
it loses the strength of life. When the nervous system is not brought
to that state of restful alertness the body becomes strained, just as a
machine which continuously functions without ever stopping suffers
great wear. But if the machine is given rest at intervals it suffers less
wear and has a longer life. Similarly, when the body is brought to
that state of restful alertness where the nervous system enables the
mind to experience transcendental Being, the body is rested and is
not continuously under strain; it begins to maintain its level of normal 
life, free from strain and tension. When the mind is always
wandering in the field of desire, wavering between different paths
and goals in relative life, it does not find the great goal of eternal bliss.
Nothing in the world could possibly give lasting contentment to the
mind because everything is perishable and ever-changing. So the
mind, its quest for happiness unsatisfied, wanders all the time, seeking 
in the field of variety a point where it can rest in eternal bliss.
A man with such a mind gains lasting satisfaction and contentment
only when be becomes attuned to the bliss-consciousness of Being.
 It is this state which brings eternal contentment to the mind and
gives it steadiness. It brings the mind fulfilment, and this is its most
healthy state, for here it has acquired the purpose of life, eternal bliss-consciousness.
 So we find that by attuning the mind to Being through the process
of transcendental meditation it is possible to remain in perfect physical
and mental health and to maintain the health of the atomsphere. This
is the way to gain perfect health at every level of individual life.
 The problem of health is not solved until we consider it from all
aspects of the individual's life: his mind, body, surroundings and
Being. If we do not take Being into account the purpose of physical
and mental health will not be served; just as by not taking the sap
into account the health of the tree, its branches, flowers and fruit
could not be maintained.
 A skilled gardener seeing a withering leaf, does not bother to
attend to it by itself. He sees it as a danger-signal for the whole tree.
So he directs his attention to the root, waters it, and by so doing
enables the sap to reach all parts of the tree.
 Similarly, when a man finds his atmosphere is strained, his mind
tense or his body suffering from some disease, he knows these are
symptoms of danger to his whole life. A wise man will go to the root
of the problem.
 Wrong influence of any type emitted from the mind and body of
an individual creates tension in the atmosphere. Tension in the mind
is produced by a wrong type of activity. When the process of thinking
does not accord with the cosmic purpose of the laws of nature it creates
strain and suffering in the body and mind and produces strain and a
negative influence in the atmosphere.
 Failure of achievement and unfulfilled desires result when the individual 
life-stream is not in harmony with the laws of nature. How
call this be remedied:' Physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, anatomy 
and all the different branches of learning explore the different
laws of nature. Innumerable are the strata of creation and the laws
of nature, and varied is the pattern of their interrelationship. It is not
humanly possible to know all the laws of nature. But by bringing
the mind to the level of cosmic law it can be attuned to every law
in nature. Unless a man's life is in tune with nature he will always
produce strain in the natural stream of evolution. Strain produced in
the atmosphere has its greatest reaction upon the individual himself.
This is why discord, disease and suffering exist.
 If the health of an individual is to be properly considered it cannot
be considered in sections. The health of a hand can only be understood
in terms of the health of the entire body, and the health of the entire
body can only be understood in terms of the entire nervous system,
which in turn can only be understood in terms of the mind. The mind
can only be understood in terms of Being, because ultimately it is
Being which is the essence of individual life and its very basis. Only
if co-ordination exists between the mind and Being, between the
body and the mind and between the atmosphere and the body can the
problem of health be solved.
 It is not enough to consider the health of man only in terms of
physiology or psychology. The problem of health will only be solved
when the problem of life as a whole is solved.
 But it should be remembered that the separate consideration of
these different aspects of individual life is not sufficient. Consideration
of the co-ordination between them is also of vital importance.
 The result of research in the field of medical science is that the new
theories of psychology and findings in physiology deal with the problem 
of health from a very limited point of view. Therefore only
partial aspects of health can be considered. That is why suffering continues 
to exist.
 It is not our intention to emphasise the harm done to the whole
personality by dealing with the problem of health in a partial manner, 
for the medical profession and psychologists are themselves aware
of the limitations by which they are hindered.
 When the problem of suffering - physical or mental - has to be
tackled, it must be tackled at the root cause in order to produce lasting 
results. The cause of all causes in life is Being. And all the
causes of suffering arise from inadequate co-ordination between
Being and the different planes of individual life. So if perfect health
is the aim, there is one formula for sound health in all spheres of life.
This formula is based on co-ordination between Being and the mind,
between Being and the body, between Being and the environment.
 The cause of mental and physical suffering in the world is ignorance
of Being and ignorance of the fact that by infusing the value of Being
into the mind, body and environment the basic cause of all disease and
suffering can be eliminated.
 It is time that the medical profession in different countries considered 
the value of Being and put to scientific test the physiological and
psychological effects of transcendental meditation so that the mental
and physical health of all people may benefit from Being. At this
time, in almost every country of the world, there are people practising 
transcendental meditation who would make good subjects for
tests to determine the physiological and psychological changes due
to the influence of Being. Many thousands of these people have found
that their health becomes better, their behaviour towards other people
improves and harmony in the atmosphere is maintained at all levels.
 The purpose of education is to culture the mind of a man so that
he can accomplish all his aims in life. Education, to justify itself, should
enable a man to use the full potential of his body, mind and spirit.
It should also develop in him the ability to make the best use of his
personality, surroundings and circumstances so that he may accomplish 
the maximum in life for himself and for others. There are
tremendous latent possibilities which are never unfolded by young
people during their student life, the most precious time for laying
the foundations of their careers.
 When one travels and meets people of different nations one finds
that public opinion in almost every country is dissatisfied with the
prevailing system of education. In no country of the world are people
really satisfied with it. There may not be many who can point out
exactly what the system of education needs and indicate what is
lacking in the present curricula of schools, colleges and universities.
Nevertheless, it is evident that there is dissatisfaction everywhere with
existing curricula. Not only are the masses dissatisfied, but enminent
authorities on education also speak of its deficiencies.
 What is lacking is a complete system of education which will give
depth to a curriculum and enable students to become responsible
citizens, fully grown in all the values of life, established in higher
consciousness and understanding.
 Subjects should be taught in such a way as to bring home to students 
the full scope of life. Whatever subject they choose should be
so presented as to give them a complete panorama of full values of
living. At the present time, with the advent of new ideas in all fields
of learning, more and more subjects are being added to the curricula,
and each specialised subject becomes a new branch of learning in
itself.
 Obviously each branch of learning ranges from the most elementary 
to the most advanced study of its particular subject. But no
branch of learning has yet reached the peak of knowledge in its own
field. Every branch of learning presents great findings, but still greater 
findings lie in store for coming generations. The highest knowledge 
of any subject is beyond the present range of study. So every
branch of learning is in a very incomplete state. It is necessary that
the wisdom of the Absolute should supplement every branch of
learning.
 Study of the Absolute will reveal to students the great and hidden
values of life which lie beyond the obvious, phenomenal phase of
existence. It will give them a deeper sense of existence, a broader vision
of life and insight into the unfathomable ocean of wisdom. It will also
reveal to them the possibilities of attaining values in life much greater
and higher than those found on the level of relative existence. If the
technique of transcendental meditation were practised, together with
the study of the Absolute, the purpose of education in the true sense
of the word would really be served.
 Enterprising students in many countries are already finding this
out for themselves by practising transcendental meditation. But they
and their fellow students, who far outnumber them and who as yet
do not know of this technique, would be helped inestimably if the
education authorities all over the world would introduce this practical 
study of the Absolute into the curricula of all colleges and universities.
 
 Present systems of education only give students superficial
knowledge. There is nothing in education today to develop the inner
values of mind, body, and spirit. Whatever education is received is
simply on the surface level. In every subject certain information is
given about that subject, and if a student is able to remember the information 
he passes the course. The current system of education only
prepares the student for a career geared primarily to earning a living.
 Information about the inner world of the mind and spirit is unobtainable. 
It is surprising how the inner aspects of life, which form
the very basis of all outer life and existence, have been ignored for so
long all over the world. It is now time that, together with the outer
nature of the different branches of learning, education in the inner
spheres of life should be provided for students. Without knowledge
of the Absolute and without the practice of transcendental meditation
to unfold mental faculties, education remains incomplete. This generation 
of students is kept without contact with the inner values of life
and the permanent basis of existence solely because of ignorance of this
system of transcendental meditation on the part of those who organise 
the present curricula in each country.
 When the student is given only superficial education in his subject 
he has no basis from which to fathom that subject in any real
depth. How much of the world could be physically investigated and
known through examination of phenomenal The universe is so vast
and creation so unlimited that it is not possible to analyse and dissect
everything in the entire creation.
 This is why the present system of education fails to quench the
thirst for knowledge. It excites the thirst but does not have the means to
satisfy it.
 It is almost always true that as a man studies in any field he finds
a greater field of the unknown lying ahead. However much is known
about a subject, more advanced study can eventually only reveal to
the student a far greater range of knowledge which is yet unknown and
to which he has no access. Present systems of education help more to
expose the ignorance of a subject than to provide knowledge of it.
This will always remain the case so long as they are based only on
information.
 The only way to advance from this deplorable state is to find the
means of culturing the mind from within to make it strong, so that when a subject is studied on the informatory level one is also able to explore its deeper regions.
 If this inner culture were provided for the student of any branch of learning together with his usual course of education, this would be supplemented by a development of the mind and of all the mental
faculties from within.
 A really well-educated man would be the product of such a system.
This would be an education which would leave no door of knowledge
closed to the mind and which would enable every student to command 
a full knowledge of his subject. Then the citizens of the world
would really derive benefit from what we call education.
 Such a system would not merely create the ability to maintain life
by means of a job, but would reveal to the growing man the real
significance of his inner life. He would develop a bold character and
shine in his career. Every man would be profusely equipped to gain
great knowledge of any subject.
 The provision of a wide variety of subjects does no more than
enable the student to choose one of them. But every man has such
tremendous mental faculties latent within him that if he could develop 
them properly during his student career every citizen of the world
would be a highly developed personality, using his full potentialities
for the good of himself and others.
 Without a technique for unfolding mental faculties the genius
present within man is only wasted. We have seen that during the
inward course of meditation the conscious capacity of the mind is developed 
to its fullest extent. On coming out of meditation the inner
potentialities of man, the spiritual nature of transcendental consciousness, 
emerge to be lived in the midst of all the relative values of the
world's forms and phenomena.
 This system, which is an easy approach to mental development, to
the unfolding of all latent potentialities and a direct way to fathom
the spiritual values of inner life and to glorify material values by the
light of the inner self, is a simple and direct technique of education
from within. It should be placed in the curricula for students, at least
in the colleges and universities, so that a new humanity may arise,
developed in fullness of personality, free from shortcomings and from
ignorance of the inner values of life.
 This is the need of every country. Any country into which it is
introduced will soon gain great advantages over other nations. Its
citizens will be far more capable in all fields of thought, speech and
action, because they will be using their full potential. Such a country
will have better businessmen, technologists, statesmen, scientists, sociologists, 
better people in every field of life. Its people will be more
integrated in their personalities, happier and more peaceful.
 The system is there; it has been tried and its value proved in every
part of the world. Whether it is adopted may not rest entirely with
the education authorities. It is more than likely that a demand for
it will come from the students themselves, since many of them are
already practising it with outstanding success.
 Let us now analyse different subjects of study in the light of
meditation and see how this practice and the study of the Absolute
can enrich every subject and glorify the whole field of education, fulfilling 
its over-all purpose.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ECONOMICS
 Economics is the science of production, distribution and consumption 
of resources to satisfy human needs. The aim of economics would
be achieved if and when it could create a state of abundance in life
to satisfy fully all the needs of all the people. Such a state of material
abundance could be created, but whether it would satisfy man and
leave him contented is difficult to say. Even today those who have
material abundance in their individual lives are not entirely satisfied.
If man's contentment is not achieved the very purpose of economics
is defeated.
 It may be stated emphatically that unless a man achieves permanent
happiness he will not be contented and satisfied with life. To bring
about this permanent contentment is the final aim of economics. It
therefore appears that the field of economics should not be restricted
to material production and consumption alone, but should be extended
to bring the greatest happiness of a permanent nature within tile reach
of all mankind.
 Experience of the Absolute is a direct means for achieving inner
happiness, the great happiness which could be made an integral part
of everyone's nature. Thus we find that meditation brings fulfilment
to the highest goal of economics. Leading economists have only to
introduce this transcendental meditation into their studies. Meditation
also improves the ability and efficiency of all men's work and will
directly enrich the field of economics on that material plane with
which it is at present most concerned. Thus we find that meditation is
a requisite for economics even within its present range.
 Research students would find this a rewarding subject for study
and development. The realisation that the Absolute is indispensable
to the fulfilment of economics would take the subject beyond the
limitations of its present theories, extending its range to its true limits.
 If the field of economics is limited to creating material abundance
alone it would appear to defeat its own purpose.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE HUMANITIES
 The humanities - philosophy, theology, literature, history - are concerned 
with recording what men have held of value and what should
be of value in the different spheres of human life. The basis of all relative 
values in life is the Absolute, which is the source and end of
everything. Without proper knowledge of the Absolute, therefore,
progress in the humanities will remain incomplete.
 The scope of the humanities should be extended beyond its present 
range to include direct experience of the Absolute. It seems essential 
that the study of the Absolute be introduced as a part of the study
of the humanities.
 Philosophy does aim at the study of the Absolute. But without
direct experience of the Absolute, Its nature remains inconceivable
in the field of logic and discrimination.
 Without meditation the mind can never experience the finer realms
of relative existence and never know the nature of the Absolute, and
so the study of the humanities will remain incomplete. The humanities
as taught today do not help anyone to have strong convictions about
life and its higher purposes.
 A study of the humanities will be completed only by the practice
of transcendental meditation. This alone can fill the pressing need
to expand the range of the humanities beyond their present limit,
enabling them to fulfil their purpose.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;POLITICAL SCIENCE
 The purpose of the study of political science is to learn how best
to organise human beings for the increase of peace and happiness in
their lives. This has been the accepted view of the role of political
science since the time of Confucius.
 To improve the world, improve the nation; to improve the nation,
improve the community; to improve the community, improve the
individual. As the individual perfects himself the family tends towards 
perfection; from the family the effect is felt in the community;
from the community in the nation and in the world.
 Merely to study political institutions in different countries and
their political parties and customs in no way helps a man to improve
as a man. Therefore if the scope of political science is restricted to this
kind of study its purpose will remain unrealised. Transcendental
meditation uncovers latent faculties and improves man's ability in all
walks of life. It therefore seems essential that the practice of meditation 
be included within the study of political science.
 When knowledge of organisations is based on fully developed inner
faculties so that man's qualities and abilities are improved, the study
of political science will have reached its full scope and will achieve its
object.
 Sociology studies group and community behaviour. it aims at
improving man's condition by perfecting his social institutions. The
mutual relations of the members of a community set the standards
of a society. The social behaviour of the members depends upon the
state of their individual minds. When an individual suffers from
inner discontent his behaviour towards other people is impelled by
hidden motives to achieve his own ends. This brings artificiality to his
relationships and in the long run corrupts them, and thus the harmony
of community life is broken.
 Unless sociology aims at increasing the inner contentment of individuals 
and their love for others, its purpose remains unfulfilled.
 The social scientist whose own personality is not properly integrated 
cannot satisfactorily study human relations or apply a knowledge 
of social science to improve them. Transcendental meditation
leads the mind to inner happiness, bringing inner contentment which
results in right thinking and a true sense of values. Inner contentment
leads naturally to increased tolerance and the capacity to harmonise
conflicting relationships. Spontaneous love of others brings mutual
harmony.
 The improvement of social relations depends upon a willingness and
an ability to adjust to different natures and varying circumstances
within society. Social relations improve by developing the qualities
of mind and heart in individuals.
 One whose heart and mind are not in harmony will fail to have a
complete view of life, of his surroundings or of relationships between
people. A social scientist's intellect must be so sharp, acute and comprehensive 
that he combines the innocence of a child with the wisdom
of all elderly father. Only then can he understand the fullness and
completeness of the relationship between father and son. A social
scientist should furthermore be able to understand and bring about
an improvement in behaviour between unscrupulous tyrants and
innocent, helpless, oppressed people.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
PSYCHOLOGY
 Psychology takes as its area of study the scope of the human mind.
Physiological psychology studies how the function of the mind is
affected by the nature of the body, while the psychology of personality
focuses on individual differences in the field of thought. The
purpose of both these branches of psychology is to understand abnormal
and normal human behaviour and to use this knowledge to
help individuals to integrate their personalities. The integration process
first promotes the normality of the conscious mind and then aims
at unfolding the subconscious mind.
 The aim of psychology is to correlate the conscious and the subconscious
states of mind. This is a glorious ideal and so far as its practical
realisation is concerned, the method for bringing an abnormal
mind to a normal state may be justified; but the attempts of present-day
analysis to correlate the conscious with the subconscious are very
disappointing in their results.
 Attempts to bring out suppressed memories of traumatic experience
fathom only the deeper levels of the conscious mind, which may be
considered the upper levels of the subconscious, called by Freud the
pre-conscious. The mind at the deeper levels of the subconscious possesses
the ability to experience the subtler fields of creation which lie
beyond ordinary perceptions.
 The inner discontent felt by the great majority of people who are
neither neurotic nor psychotic certainly indicates the need of a technique
for achieving inner happiness. If modern psychology could
satisfy this need then the study of the mind on modern lives could be
considered useful and worthwhile. But what is the use of a study of the
mind which fails both to unfold latent mental faculties and to quench
the thirst for happiness?
 The system of transcendental meditation is a method for sharpening
the mind to its ultimate point of refinement. It is a process which
makes active the latent levels of the subconscious mind and which
develops hidden faculties, bringing out into life the inner happiness of the soul and improving every aspect of a man's thought, speech and action, for his own good and that of society as a whole.
 Psychology will only become worthwhile if this meditation is made an integral part of its study and is adopted by psycho-analysts and psychiatrists. It is true that many advanced psychologists who are capable of judging the validity of their science do find something wanting in modem psychology, because they have found in practice that they are not able to produce such intensive effects as they desire.
 The effects of transcendental meditation go beyond the limits set by psycho-analysis, which strives to bring to a conscious state only
the repressed material in the pre-conscious area of the psyche but which
fails to correlate the conscious mind with the deeper levels of the subconscious.
 Psycho-analysis fails to uncover latent faculties, to say nothing of
failing to reach the state of pure consciousness beyond the subconscious.
 Research workers in psychology can easily experience for themselves 
the validity of this method and would then be in a position to
work out theories beyond the scope of present psychology.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE NATURAL SCIENCES
 The natural sciences study the cosmos at various levels of organisation: 
at the sub-atomic, the atomic, the molecular, the cellular
and the biological organism levels of objective creation. They are
concerned with the way in which matter and energy operate to produce 
the different aspects of creation. Their purpose is to give man a
degree of command over these forces to improve his material well-being. 
By striving to get at the subtler aspects of creation and eventually 
to find the ultimate cause of creation, the natural sciences aspire
to use knowledge of the ultimate cause of creation to control phenomena 
and thus to make man the master of the cosmos.
 All this is the proper province of the mind. If the mind of the
scientist is free from the worries and miseries of life, is peaceful, happy
and contented; if his intellect is sharp and his discriminating capacity
refined; if he has a developed intuition and increased foresight; then
he will certainly be able to find out much more than has yet been
discovered during many centuries of scientific research.
 All these qualities of mind are easily developed through the system
of transcendental meditation. In their absence, the findings of modern
scientists are more those of chance or accident in the course of what
is called a systematic method of research. Such accidental findings
by incomplete minds in the field of natural forces have produced the
means of destruction for humanity. Like a child who plays with
anything he finds, even with a burning branch or charcoal, the incomplete 
minds of present-day scientists all over the world are playing 
with whatever they find by chance during their experiments,
including atomic and nuclear forces.
 Serious thought must show that without the study of the Absolute,
education is meaningless. Let us hope that those who shape the course
of education in all parts of the world will seize this opportunity to pave
the way for the complete education of present and future generations.
 The need to rehabilitate offenders and crimmals is an age-old
problem which has plagued many civilisations. So far no effective
solution has been found to the problem of making useful individuals
out of delinquents and criminals.
 Crime is a short-cut to satisfy a craving - a short-cut which goes
beyond normal and legal means. Crime, delinquency and the different 
patterns of anti-social behaviour express the tensions which arise
from a deep discontent of mind, from a weak mind and from unbalanced 
emotions. A weak mind is one which lacks balance and a
sense of proportion.
 No approach to the problem of delinquency and crime can be
truly effective unless the basic weakness of the mind is remedied. The
solution lies in enlarging the conscious capacity of the mind and
strengthening it.
 There are many with talent among those who, because of their
misguided behaviour, are shut away behind bars. If they could be
successfully rehabilitated instead of being a burden, they could become
useful citizens making a genuine contribution to the progress of
society.
 The practice of transcendental meditation has been found to relieve 
all kinds of tensions and to change a hard, cruel nature to one
of tolerance and compassion.
 Therefore it is only necessary to introduce this practice to ensure
the speedy and effective rehabilitation of delinquents and criminals.
 Continuous activity results in wear and tear of the body mechanisms.
Rest is a means of checking this process.
 A man works throughout the day and by the evening is tired.
He rests during the night and feels fresh in the morning. Then he is
tired again by evening. But if he engages in an activity which provides
increasing charm as it continues, then he does not become tired.
 The experience of happiness is a direct means of replenishing life-energy 
and revitalising the mind. If great happiness is experienced
the replenishment of energy and revitalisation of body and mind
will be correspondingly great.
 The real purpose of recreation is not only to divert the mind from
one type of activity to another, not only to provide amusement and
entertainment on the physical or mental level, but actually to recreate. 
Its real purpose is re-creation of body and mind, re-creation
of a fresh body and mind, re-creation of a healthy body and
mind. It should serve to re-create healthy co-ordination between
body and mind is well as healthy co-ordination with one's surroundings 
and circumstances and a healthy relationship with one's fellow
beings.
 The state of absolute Being is the field of absolute bliss-consciousness. 
Therefore the purpose of recreation is best fulfilled by the state
of Being which provides a direct experience of absolute bliss.
 We have seen that body, mind, surroundings and circumstances
are all enriched by the direct influence of Being. Thus the purpose of
recreation and rejuvenation is best served by gaining direct experience
of the bliss of Being.
 Recreation today - games, sports, crafts, entertainment - serves
only to consume life-energy instead of conserving it for the regeneration 
of body and mind. The methods of rejuvenation commonly
used lie exclusively within the fields of physical manipulation, diet
and the use of cosmetic. Experience shows that none of these measures
produces profound results. On the other hand, it has been shown that
the regular practice of transcendental meditation produces marvellous
and highly gratifying results in re-creating and rejuvenating the body
and mind.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
RIGHT AND WRONG
 Everything in creation is so intimately connected with every other
thing that it is not possible completely to distinguish the existence
of one from another. And the influence of one thing on all other things
is so universal that nothing can be considered in isolation. We have
already discussed how the universe reacts to an individual action and
have seen that the question of right and wrong is a highly complicated
problem. Only someone who knew everything about the whole of
creation and was able to determine the influence of an individual's
action on any stratum of existence would be able to say for certain
whether an action was right or wrong.
 Right is that which produces a good influence everywhere. Certainly 
right and wrong are relative terms and, therefore, nothing in
relative existence can be said to be absolutely right or absolutely
wrong. But even so, right and wrong can only be judged by their influence 
for good or bad. If something produces a good influence
everywhere it can be said to be right.
 The human intellect has no adequate criterion for right and wrong
because reason is limited and the vision of the human mind is minute
when compared to the vast and unlimited field of influence produced
by an action in the whole universe.
 In the state of cosmic consciousness, however, when the individual
mind gains the status of cosmic mind, then the intellect could be
considered adequate for judging right and wrong; but this judgment
is from the level of Being and not from intellectual understanding,
thinking, discrimination or reason. Those whose consciousness is
raised to the level of cosmic consciousness function on the high level
of right life and are naturally unaffected by influences of wrong. For
them the question of a suitable criterion by which to judge right and
wrong does not arise.
 We must find all adequate criterion for right and wrong for people
whose consciousness is not raised to the level of cosmic consciousness.
 The authority of the scriptures is the supreme criterion of right and
wrong in relative life. All that the scriptures say, when they are understood 
correctly, should be regarded as authoritative when considering 
right and wrong.
 Since there are scriptures of many different religions, the question
may arise as to which one should be the authority. Although the
language of the scriptures differ and there have been different exponents 
of the scriptures recording at different times in the long history
of the world, the essential truth in all is the same. It is not necessary
to go into a detailed history of the scriptures but it is recorded that
the oldest of them are the Vedas. The same essential truth of life propounded 
by the Vedas can easily be discovered in all the scriptures
that have emerged from time to time in different parts of the world, to
guide the destiny of man and to provide an authoritative measure
of right and wrong for the well-being of all people. The followers
of any religion, therefore, will find a criterion for right and wrong
in the correct understanding of their of scriptures.
 A man leading a life according to the scriptural code of his own
religion will find the truth of life without confusing himself by a
comparative study of different religions. People not grounded in the
truths of their own religion who try to understand the truths of other
religions only become more confused.
 If a man establishes his own 1 level and measures the different heights
of the mountains, it is possible for him to calculate precisely the differences 
in the mountains' heights. If he does not establish his own level
before measuring the various heights he is sure to become confused,
having no fixed level of reference.
 If one is not living the truth of any one religion then it is not possible 
to fathom the depths of wisdom of other religions, because religion 
has to be lived. It is not a hypothesis for intellectual understanding. 
It is not like metaphysics which scrutinises the nature of truth
and comes to certain intellectually understood conclusions. Religion is
something practical which must be followed and lived and the truth
of which must be realised by living the principles laid down in the
scriptures. The reality of life is understood intellectually through
metaphysics, and is lived in day-to-day life by putting one's religion
into practice. When the truth of a religion has been realised through
living it there is no harm in reading the texts of other religions. It
will then be found that the truth of one's own religion is essentially
the truth of the religions of others. These truths are the proper criteria 
of right and wrong.
 The field of karma - action - is so vast, unlimited and complex
that it is not possible to understand the proper criterion of right or
wrong actions intellectually. In this area of uncertainty the scriptures
are the chief criteria of right and wrong. Many people talk of inner
feelings. They say: I feel like doing this, so I do it. But my feelings
and my doing can only be right or wrong according to the standard
of my consciousness, and who knows whether my consciousness is
absolutely pure or not?
 It is the state of pure consciousness alone which can be unbiased
and absolutely right in its inspiration, and this consciousness belongs
only to the field of cosmic consciousness. The ordinary consciousness
of man is motivated by many selfish ends. Consciousness overshadowed 
by selfish motives cannot possibly produce feelings, thoughts,
words or actions which could be justified as really right or wrong.
But if a judgment is based on scriptural authority we have every right
to feel within ourselves that we have acted correctly.
 It is true that one must always feel within oneself the right or wrong of a situation. But it is always safer to test this feeling in the light of scriptural authority. One's inner feeling alone cannot be taken as the criterion of right or wrong.
 If someone with no knowledge of the scriptures is unable to decide
for himself whether something is right or wrong, the problem should
be decided by the older people in society. They have a greater
experience of life, they have been through the stresses of human
existence, have dealt with many types of people and have lived all
phases of man's life. They know and understand from experience the
play of nature and the influence and effect of right and wrong actions
much more than do the young. They have seen people flourishing
and being useful to themselves and others by right actions, and they
have seen people who, having taken the path of wrong behaviour,
exhibit cunning and cruelty, deception and dishonesty. They have
seen such people reap the consequences of their own misdoings and
their families suffer as a result. They speak with authority, and their
advice can help to decide what is right or wrong in certain situations.
 The example of great men could also be a criterion. History records 
the actions, the successes or failures of great men both good and
evil at different times in different lands. The paths they took and the
consequences they reaped from a particular way of life are yet another
criterion by which to decide right and wrong ways of life.
 Apart from these criteria it is common knowledge that it is right
not to harm anyone and wrong to do harm. It is right to see good in
others and wrong to see bad in anyone. It is right to love people and
wrong to hate them. It is right to admire men for the good in them
and wrong to rebuke them for their shortcomings and bad behaviour.
It is right to give advice to a man if he is doing wrong and wrong
not to advise him to do good. It is right to do things which will be
helpful to oneself and others and it is wrong to do things which will
harm others. It is right to speak the truth but wrong to speak words
that will harm others even if they are the truth. It is right to be good
to others and wrong to be unpleasant to anyone. This distinction between 
right and wrong is to help the individual and the whole of creation
because, as we have seen, the whole universe reacts to the action
of 3n individual. Therefore the great responsibility for right and wrong
lies with the individual himself whatever his level of consciousness.
 It will be good to scrutinise these points. We say that it is right
not to harm anyone. We see that action and reaction are equal. If
a mother slaps her child in anger then she has slapped or beaten the
whole universe and produced an atomsphere of crying and hatred,
suffering and discord, not only in the child but in everything around
and in the whole universe. Perhaps this influence is much greater on
the child and very faint in the surroundings, but the influence is none
the less there. If each day the majority of people in the world slap
someone and create this same atmosphere, the influence of discord,
suffering, sorrow and hatred will certainly be intense enough to
have an effect in the world.
 Therefore it is very necessary not to harm anyone. This is the least
a man can do; the best he can do is to produce an influence of
harmony, goodness, kindness and helpfulness.
 We have seen2 that a man's action rebound on him from all fields
of creation, so that if he has harmed someone that harm will return
to him from the innumerable strata of creation and for an uncountable 
length of time. The best policy, therefore, is not to harm anyone
so that we may not be harmed at any time, and to do as much good
as possible to others so that the maximum good may return to us
from the entire creation.
 We have said that we should love others for the good in them and
that we would be wrong in rebuking anyone for his weaknesses or for
bad behaviour. It is highly beneficial to see good in others. No man
can, in fact, be all good or all bad because human life is the result
of a mixture of good and bad. Had it been only good we should be
in the world of angels where there is no suffering and where dwell
only happiness and joy. In life, however, we find happiness and suffering 
mixed, which shows that human existence is the result of both
good and bad action. Before we can admire a man for his good qualities 
we must first have seen the good in him. When we see good in
him we receive a reflection of the good. If we try to see bad in someone 
we receive a reflection of the bad which pollutes our minds
and hearts. If we see good in someone then naturally some good reflects 
also on to him. The very action of seeing good in someone reflects 
that good on the mind and heart of the observer and, therefore,
the observer gains the good he sees in the other man. In life it is
a great art to see the good in others. Everyone has some good in
 There is a story in India about a wise man living in Benares, the
seat of learning in Northern India. He would always admire others
and no one had ever heard him speak ill of anyone. People were
astonished that this man could see good in everything in creation.
He would only admire, he would never allow his mind and heart
to become impure from seeing bad in anything or anyone. One day
a mischievous man thought he would find something that was all
bad and show it to the wise man so that he would certainly be unable
to see any good in it. He found a dead and rotting dog lying in the
street and, having invited the wise man to have dinner with him, he
took him along the street where the rotting dog lay. A bad smell was
coming from it, and it was an obnoxious sight. When they reached it
the mischief-maker pointed to it and remarked: 'What a horror to
come across in the street. But the wise man exclaimed: 'Look at the
clean white teeth, how they sparkle like pearls'. As he praised the
sparkling whiteness of the dog's teeth the mischievous man fell at
his feet, and the wise man said: 'If we do not wish to ignore it we
will find some good in everything in the kingdom of God'. This
world is the garden of almighty God and He has made the flowers in
all their variety. You may pick the one you like but you have no
right to say another is bad. Even if you do not like that flower, God
created it for someone who can admire it and who will be happy to
see it. Do not always go about lost in your own taste; admire the
great variety in the garden of God.
 We have said that it is right to advise a man to do that which is
right and good and which will help himself and others. We have also
said that it would be wrong not to advise a man as to what is right or
wrong, if we know the difference. This is a highly significant point
for the world today.
 A general feeling has developed in civilised society that we should
not infringe upon the feelings, likes and dislikes of other people. This
has gone so far as to create a widespread belief that not even children
should be told what to do. It is said that they should not be told what
is right or wrong and should not be guided to do good and avoid what
is bad. This comes from the ideas of psychology which lay down the
principle of growth in freedom. But it is unfortunate to allow this
criterion of freedom to overshadow the fundamental principles of
growth and development in life. If someone does not know that the
thing he does will harm him either now or later, then someone with
that knowledge must tell him in a spirit of love, kindness and sympathy.
 If a child is going to pick up a burning coal thinking it is a lovely
bright toy for him to enjoy, it is only right for the parents to stop him
even if he resents being prevented from playing with the fire. Such
freedom is ridiculous and dangerous to the development of man, to
the development of the younger generation and to the development
of the innocent and ignorant who do not have wisdom and experience
of life. It is the responsibility of the older generation to advise the young.
Even if young people resent and do not obey direction, it is right
to tell them. They will find out for themselves the result of not obeying
their elders, but if their elders do not speak at all and leave the child
to find out for himself what is wrong, then they have wasted his
time and by implication have been cruel to him. In failing to speak
while knowing what was not right or helpful in his life, they failed to
help him on the right way.
 It is a regrettable tendency in parents today that although they believe 
that whatever they say should be followed by the child, if they
see the possibility of the child resenting their advice they keep quiet
and do not give it. It is not kindness or love, and it is not right for
the parents to take this attitude. The child is young and inexperienced
and has not a broad vision or experience of life. The parents should
tell the child freely and in love and kindness that this is wrong and
that is right. If he resents it the parents should not insist, because if he
disobeys it will naturally result in an experience proving to him that
they were right. This is the way to cultivate a child's tendency to
obey and act according to the wishes and feelings of the parents. If
the child is resentful and does not obey, at least the parents have done
their duty by informing the child. It is also their duty to see that
the child is informed of right action by their friends, teachers and
neighbours - by someone whom the child really loves and obeys -
for it is the duty of the parents to see that the child grows in wisdom
and goodness.
 Children are flowers in the garden of God and must be nourished.
They themselves do not know the way that is best for them. It is for
the parents to lead them on to a path which is free from suffering.
It is part of a parent's role to punish a child if he does not obey and
does wrong. But children should be punished in all love.
 The modem tendency to put the fate of children completely in
their own hands is highly dangerous. It only leads to uncultured growth
in the younger generation.
 There is a school of thought, accepted by many educational organisations 
in some Of the imPOrtant countries leading modern thought,
which advocates giving freedom to students. Teachers are not allowed
to punish them for wrong behaviour. The reason given is that genius
grows better in freedom and when it is not suppressed by authority.
Such an ideal must have been initiated by very compassionate hearts
wild only good intentions; but a few decades of experience have
proved that it lacks merit. The increase in child and juvenile delinquency 
and in criminal tendencies in society has alarmed the authorities 
in almost every country where only a few years ago this principle
of growth in freedom was approved of in schools and colleges. It is
a very wrong principle. it is cruel and greatly damaging to the
interests of society not to guide and shape the thought and behaviour
of the younger generation through a combination of love and discipline. 
Young people today do not understand or respect the standards
of traditional, decent behaviour in their own country. Increase of
crime is the product of the undisciplined growth of undeveloped minds
lacking the background of any traditional culture.
 It is the responsibility of statesmen, patriots and intelligent people
to look into the disastrous results of such a pattern of education perpetrated 
in the name of child psychology, and to amend the system
of education and the bringing up of children. Children have to be
nurtured in love, and they have to be punished if they are wrong in
order to help them to succeed in life at all levels. Each nation has a
tradition of its own, and its people have their religion and faith.
Children should be given all understanding of their own tradition,
religion and faith.
 Educators today are profoundly mistaken when, in the name of
democracy, they no longer give any traditional understanding to
children. Such ideas rob the people of their national traditions and the
dignity of their heritage; this weakens the nation. To root out tradition 
in a society is the greatest damage that can be done to the welfare 
of a nation. A society without tradition has no basic stability or
strength. It is like a leaf at the mercy of the wind, blown in any
direction, without stability or basis of its own.
 In the name of modern education the culture of many countries
is drifting away from old traditions. The result is a cancerous growth
of faithless people without tradition who live only on the superficial,
gross level of life.
 It is highly important that the flow of wisdom be maintained betwecn 
the mature generation and the young. And it is only right to
tell people what is good and to refrain from telling them to do something 
wrong. It is necessary to speak rightly and to express right
feelings on a dignified level and in a moderate manner. If a man who
has the ability to discriminate between right and wrong does not
speak up he is guilty of not sharing his knowledge with others.
 We have said that it is right to speak truth but wrong to speak
words of a nature or in a manner that will harm others. Harmful
words spoken by an individual will certainly have repercussions on
him. The harm is spread over the entire universe and will return to
the speaker from many sides. Speech should always be on a high level
of love, admiration and forgiveness for others.
 lf expressing truth damages surroundings and atmosphere, it should
not be spoken. Truth is to glorify the creation of God, and its expression 
must, therefore, necessarily be on that high level. It is not good to
displease even by the expression of truth because truth is the light of
God; it is precious and pure and should not be brought down to
the level of harm or hatred in life. It should be preserved at the high
level of the purity of consciousness, the height of love and godliness.
 The whole of life for the individual is a field of give and take.
It is always reciprocity of behaviour that helps to sustain the life of the
people and aids their evolution. Therefore those who know the truth
always behave correctly. There is no greater act of charity than to
provide a man with something that will directly elevate him and
assist his evolution.
 There could be no greater virtue than to offer a formula whereby
people naturally rise to a state of life where their energy flows only
in right channels. All the virtues have to be assimilated into the very
nature of the mind so that they may be properly lived in life, so that
right may be lived naturally.
 We have seen that the only direct way to do this is to make
available the technique of transcendental meditation to all people.
 A great effort should be made everywhere by responsible people
to see that this technique is given to all young people so that their
consciousness is raised. Greater energy, clarity and purity of mind and
the unfoldment of mental faculties are available to all. If every student
had this technique the oncoming generation would grow in a sense
of right values. Citizens of every country would then have a broad
vision in life and a true sense of right and wrong.
 Life is lived in freedom when all its different aspects are harmonised 
and function in full co-ordination with each other, fulfilling their
ultimate purpose by gaining eternal, absolute freedom in divine bliss-consciousness.
 Freedom in life means that life on all its planes - physical, mental
and spiritual - should be full, unrestricted, unbounded and complete.
 Completeness of life on the physical plane means that surroundings
should be conducive to the fulfilment of life. The body should be
perfectly healthy, all its components functioning in perfect co-ordination, 
so that it neither detracts from the value of life nor obstructs
the flow of evolution. Individual life will enjoy a state of eternal freedom 
and remain in the fullness of its values at all levels if life is free
from resistance both within the body and outside in the surroundings.
 When one produces a wrong influence in the atmosphere the
smooth functioning of the laws of nature, which sustain the natural
process of evolution, is disturbed. This resistance to the natural process
of evolution restrains the growth of things and keeps them as though
bound in less evolved states. This is the binding influence of a wrong
action upon the surroundings. The doer of wrong binds himself and
his surroundings to a lower state of evolution.
 Freedom on the level of the mind should mean that the individual
mind is capable of doing what it likes, able to materialise its desires
without encountering difficulties or obstacles. This would confer the
status of freedom on the mind and enrich life on all levels, because
everything that concerns life is connected with the mental plane.
 As long as the mind does not function with its full potential and
is not in a position to use all the faculties it has, its freedom is restricted.
Therefore the first important step in making the mind really free is
the full unfoldment of its potentialities.
 Another important point regarding freedom of the mind is liberation
from the bondage of experience. On this point rests the whole
philosophy of freedom in life.
 This question of liberation from the bondage of experience has
been widely misunderstood over many centuries and this misunderstanding
is responsible for the loss of the direct path to freedom. The
phenomenon of experience is the main field of metaphysical study
and it is a correct understanding of this phenomenon which provides
a direct way to eternal liberation. A little misunderstanding in this
field strengthens the bondage of life in the name of gaining freedom.
Because of a long-standing misconception, students of metaphysics
have failed to discover the essential nature of divine Being and so to
liberate themselves from bondage.
 We shall deal with the phenomenon of experience in detail and
see where the key to liberation lies. We shall also discover the direct
path, knowledge of which has been lost by the different schools of metaphysics 
over the past centuries.
 Let us analyse the phenomenon of experiencing a flower. The process 
of experience begins when we open our eyes and see a flower.
In this process the image of the flower travels to the retina of the eye
and reaches the mind. The image of the flower impressed on the mind
gives the experience of the flower. The result is that the mind, as it
receives the impression of the flower, is overshadowed by that impression. 
The mind's essential nature is obscured; the image of the
flower remains impressed on it. The observer, or the mind, is as
though lost in the experience.
 The essential nature of the subject, or the experiencer, is lost in
experiencing the object; it is as though the object has annihilated the
subject and the subject loses the value of its own essential nature while
engaged in the experience. Only the object remains in the consciousness. 
This is the common experience of everyone.
 When the object predominates and the subject is as if lost in the
object, the subject is said to be in bondage. The value of the object
has bound or overshadowed the nature of the subject and has become
predominant, leaving no trace of the subjects essential nature. This
is called the bondage of the subject. In the metaphysical field it is
called the identification of the subject with the object.
 Logically it seems correct to conclude that identification is the
nature of bondage. But this conclusion is incorrect and highly damaging. 
Led by this erroneous conclusion, thinkers and philosophers
who guided the destiny of metaphysical thought for many centuries
advocated practices for gaining freedom which proved damaging to
the lives of seekers after truth. It was their conclusion that identification 
is the nature of bondage. This conclusion is incorrect, but to
investigate the wrong done by it we shall, for the time being, take
the statement as true and analyse it more thoroughly.
 When it was thought that identification was bondage, freedom was
naturally thought of in terms of non-identification. It was considered
that if one does not identify oneself with the object experienced,
then one is in a state of freedom. This metaphysical understanding 
which is really a misunderstanding, has given rise to various
practices to gain freedom. It has advocated maintenance of self-awareness 
as a technique to avoid falling into the bondage of identification. 
Those who attempted to gain freedom by trying to maintain
self-awareness took to practices which involved the remembrance of
God while they were engaged in the process of experience in the
world or during the activity of daily life.
 Another method was to attempt to remain conscious of one's
own Self while engaged in experience and activity. By trying to
maintain awareness of the Self while looking at a flower, the aspirant
began to think: I am looking at the flower. The emphasis of his
thought was on 'I am'. Those who tried to maintain God-consciousness
held the idea of God in their minds, remembering God while
engaged in action. It was thought that if anyone were identified with
the idea of God then his mind, engaged with God, would be free from
identification with the object of experience.
 Such practices of trying to maintain self-awareness or God-consciousness 
were undertaken in all sincerity. The result, however, was
fatal. Trying to maintain self-awareness or God-consciousness on the
level of thinking and at the same time engaging in activity, only
divided the mind. While half the mind was engaged in maintaining
self-awareness or the remembrance of God, the other half was engaged 
in outer activity. This practice of dividing the mind simply
made the mind weak. Work suffered because it did not receive full
concentration of the mind, and self-consciousness or God-consciousness 
remained only an act on the level of gross, conscious thinking.
The aspirant was found to be neither fully in the field of activity nor
fully in a state of God-consciousness.
 Long practice of dividing the mind in this way resulted in weakening 
the personality. Those who practised this neither cultivated self-consciousness 
nor God-consciousness, nor were they successful in the
world. The reason is obvious. When practical people found that the
lives of those devoted to God or to metaphysics were half in and half
out of the world a strange attitude developed: they began to mistrust
techniques of spiritual unfoldment because they saw that those
devoted to these techniques were impractical in life, weak and not
dynamic.
 A thought of freedom, although it seems good, is only a thought
and is not a state. A thought of freedom is as binding as any other
thought. Thought by its very nature takes one out of one's Self. When
the mind begins to entertain a thought it enters the field of duality,
and the thought overshadows the mind's essential nature. Therefore
any thought causes identification.
 Thus the problem of identification was not solved at all by thinking 
of the Self or of the Divine or of God. That is why such practices
failed to bring freedom, and why the quest for freedom remained
unsatisfied and became muddled by these practices of cherishing the
idea of the divine Self or God on the thinking level.
 The fundamental error was that identification was itself thought
to be bondage. As a matter of fact, identification is not bondage.
What is bondage is the inability to maintain Being together with
identification. What is bondage is inability to maintain Being while
indulging in experience and activity.
 If identification were bondage, freedom would be possible only
in a state after death where one ceases to experience and ceases activity. 
As long as a man is alive he continues to experience and act, and
so it is impossible for him to avoid identification during his lifetime.
 Identification is not bondage because freedom must be lived in the
world, and living in the world entails identifying oneself with everything 
in it for the sake of experience and activity.
 Identification should not be a terror to the seekers of truth. It is
simply that n state of mind must be cultivated so that the mind, engaged 
with outer things, does not allow the pure state of Being to
be overshadowed.
 The maintenance of Being can never be achieved by merely thinking 
about Being. Being can be spontaneously lived on the level of
thought only when the very nature of the mind is transformed into
the nature of Being. Then all experiences will be on the level of Being.
Only then is it possible for experience not to overshadow or overthrow
the validity of Being. Being will be lived together with identification.
 If one thinks about Being, it is only a thought of Being and not
the state of Being. For Being to be established in the very nature of
the mind so that during waking, dreaming or deep sleep states,
through all activity and inactivity in life Being is not obstructed or
overshadowed, it is necessary for the mind to be transformed into
the nature of Being.
 For this it is necessary that familiarity with the state of Being be
gained by the mind to such a degree that it lives Being through all
life's conditions and situations. This is possible by allowing the conscious 
mind to experience the subtle states of thinking, eventually to
 transcend the subtlest thought and arrive at the transcendental state
 of Being. Through the regular practice of transcendental meditation
the nature of Being becomes steadfast in the nature of the mind to
such an extent that it can never be overshadowed by any experience.
 This permanent infusion of absolute bliss-consciousness establishes
the mind in n state of everlasting freedom, and when the mind identifies 
itself with the objects of experience or activity, even then Being
is maintained. This is the state of eternal freedom which cannot be
obstructed or overshadowed by any state of experience, activity or
passivity in relative existance. Thus freedom in life belongs to the
field of Being. This eternal freedom can never be established merely
by maintaining a thought of Being or a thought of God.
 Being, or the Divine, or God, is something to be lived; a fanciful
thought of Being does not help much in practical life. A thought of
God can be cherished in the mind but, although it may provide
psychological satisfaction, it does not provide the advantages of actual 
contact with almighty God. Such a thought is only abstract imagination; 
it is not a concrete state. This is the fundamental difference
betwecn really succeeding in establishing eternal freedom in life and
remaining hovering in the thought of freedom.
 Such misunderstanding in the field of metaphysics has for many
centuries only helped to mislead genuine seekers of truth and has
created a great gulf betwecn the spiritual and the material.
 The whole conception of freedom and the way to establish it in
life is so delicate and subtle that it is easy for it to be lost in the passage
of time. Once the fine thread is lost the whole field of the understanding 
and experience of reality becomes confused.
 Freedom in God-consciousness is gained by leading the mind to
the field of bliss-consciousness, not by thinking about bliss-consciousness 
and making a mood of it. Unfortunately realisation of God, or
eternal freedom on earth, has remained only on the level of ordinary
thinking. That is why mystical practices in the name of enlightenment 
and God-realisation have left most aspirants suspended in the
mere thought of the Divine or in the hope of realising it some day.
 With the thought of God the mind can plunge into the abstract.
The thought can envelop the mind, and the aspirant may lose a clear
conception of the outer surroundings and feel that he has experiencened
the state of cosmic consciousness. This is sheer delusion. By being
intent on the idea of being a king a man can never attain the status
of a king. By thinking that he is a king over and over again no one
can really attain kingship. To be a king it is necessary to be enthroned
and thus enjoy the status of a king. To achieve God-consciousness
and to live God-consciousness in life it is nceessary to put oneself in
the field of the Divine.
 God is omnipresent; the Divine is present everywhere. This is
common knowledge. So unless the mind is brought to the level of
omnipresent Being the omnipresence of God cannot be appreciated.
The practice of thinking of God and the Divine has created a great
barrier to realisation in metaphysics and religion and has caused
people to remain unfulfilled.
 God-realisation is a positive, concrete experience on the level of
pure existence. It is more real, more substantial and sublime than
the existence of anything on earth. The nature of divine Being is absolute 
and can easily be lived if the mind is led from the field of relativity 
to the transcendental field. It is only necessary for the mind to
transcend and return to the relative field. This is the direct way to
cultivate real freedom in life.
 We have seen that while transcending, the conscious capacity of
the mind increases; therefore when one comes out of meditation and
engages in experience and activity the experience of objects becomes
deeper, fuller and more substantial. 011e engages in activity with
greater energy, more intelligence and improved efficiency. This is the
glory of divine realisation. On the one hand, the state of Being is infused 
for all time into our very nature, and on the other, the field of activity 
becomes more substantial and rewarding at all levels. This brings
harmony between the inner spiritual and outer material glories of life.
 This state has been the object of man's great quest from time immemorial 
because it glorifies all aspects of life. The material life of man
is enlightened by the light of the inner Self. The emphasis of the scriptures 
of all religions and the whole of metaphysics is upon gaining
self-realisation and God-realisation because this is the goal of man.
On the way to this goal man naturally makes his world better. He
enjoys the world more on all levels while enjoying the Divine. The
individual enjoys the world to the maximum because the nature of
his mind is now bliss-consciousness, and bliss-consciousness is the
basis of all his experience and activity. This is the state of a God-realised 
man. This is the state of a man successful in the world. These
states go hand in hand, bringing eternal freedom to life.
 This eternal freedom in life glorifies all fields of thinking, speaking,
acting and behaving, together with the whole field of karma, past
and present. The way to eternal freedom is also the way to success in
the world, and the key to it is the regular practice of transcendental
meditation.
 The problem of peace will only be solved fully and finally through
a state of divine consciousness, or God-consciousness in eternal freedom. 
The way to peace in all its aspects has always been a great
problem in the world: the peace of the individual, the peace of the
family, the peace of society and the peace of the world.
 The basis of peace is bliss. Unless one is happy one cannot be at
peace. Peace without lasting happiness is only passivity. When one
sleeps at night there is an absence of activity. This is called peace.
But when one wakes in the morning and once again enters the field
of thought, speech and activity one finds that the peace felt by the
absence of activity is not lasting.
 The peace gained by emptying the mind of thoughts and holding
the mind in suspension is only due to the lack of thought-pressure.
When such a mind returns to thinking and acting again it begins to feel
the pressures of thought and action. Then the individual begins to feel
a lack of peace. All such practices of silencing the mind are wrong and
if continued for any length of time will only make the mind null.
 There are many groups where people sit in silence and try to hear
their inner voice, or the voice of God as they term it. All such practices 
make the mind passive and dull. Those who practice silencing
the mind begin to lack animation. Their faces are dull and they are
not energetic. They look peaceful but are passive in life. Such all
experience of peace is at the cost of efficiency in life and at the cost
of life itself.
 Any attempt to silence the mind in the hope of experiencing pure
 consciousness is merely pursuing a mirage. When thoughts are kept
 out of the mind it becomes passive because it remains on the conscious
level of thinking but without a thought. What is needed is not an
attempt to empty the mind but for the conscious mind to be led to
the subtle states of thinking, eventually to transcend the subtlest state
and arrive at the positive state of Being. Keeping the mind empty on
the conscious level is only taking it out of the field of activity and
allowing it to be passive or inactive.
 People who practice silencing the mind may feel peace in life because 
they are practising the negation of thought. When a mind that
has become sluggish and dull through such practices is no longer
energetic in the field of experience and activity, the inactivity of the
mind brings a sense of peace. But whenever serious problems arise or
the individual has to be active and alert, the mind feels a strain because 
it has fallen into the habit of inactivity. Such practices are
damaging to the progress of the individual and society.
 peace can be lasting only if the very nature of the mind is transformed 
to bliss-consciousness. The quest for peace should be pursued
by bringing the mind to the field of the Transcendent, the source of
all happiness, through the practice of transcendental meditation.
 When one is not peaceful, fear, lack of self-confidence and all the
pettiness of life arise and one becomes so miserable that one cannot
think or accomplish anything worthwhile. Fear is simply lack of
self-confidence, and the basis of confidence is the contentment which
can only come from the experience of bliss. There is nothing in the
world which can really bring the mind lasting contentment because
nothing in the world can provide a happiness which is intense enough
to satisfy the mind's great thirst. The only field of contentment is the
transcendental field of bliss-consciousness. Unless one arrives at this
state one's peace will always be threatened by anything in the world.
 The golden gate to peace in life is the experience of bliss, and it is
easy for everyone to acquire this great glory and live it throughout
life.
 An individual influences the entire cosmos by every thought,
word and action. Therefore someone with peace in his heart naturally
radiates peace and harmony and influences the whole universe. Those
who are restless, worried or troubled and who have no experience of
bliss-consciousness continually produce unfavourable influences in
their surroundings. All unrighteous, immoral and sinful activity produces 
a degenerating influence in the atmosphere. When large numbers 
of people are unhappy, tense and unrighteous the atmosphere of
the world is saturated with these tense influences. When tensions in
the atmosphere increase beyond a certain limit the atmosphere breaks
into collective calamities.
 The great exponents of medical science in ancient India, Charak
and Shrushut, have shown that as long as people behave righteously
the atmosphere remains full of harmonious vibrations. The crops are
good, the sun shines, it rains at desirable times, and the whole of
creation enjoys everything in the atmosphere. But when people lose
righteousness and act against the moral codes of life the balance of
nature is disturbed, and the atmosphere breaks into such collective
calamities as famines, floods, disasters and all that damages life in the
world. This gives us a measure for assessing the health of the world.
 So to produce a harmonious and healthy atmosphere for the good
of all creatures in the world it is necessary for man to live in happiness
and peace. Each man has the chance to live in this way.
 The problem of world peace can be solved only by solving the
problem of the individual's peace, and the problem of the individual's
peace can only be solved by creating in him a state of happiness. Therefore 
the problem of peace in the individual, the family, the community, 
the nation and the whole world would be solved by transcendental
meditation, which is the direct way to establish bliss consciousness in
life.
 Where there is disagreement and dissension in families or in a group
of friends the disharmony seems to occur only in a small area. Individuals 
do not realise that, through ill-feeling, malice, bad behaviour,
harsh words and suffering, they are contributing to the disruption
and destruction of the peace of the world.
 All international conflicts are caused by the collective effect of
tensions which individuals have released into the atmosphere. And
the individual does not realise that by thought, speech and action he
constantly emits all influence of hatred, building up tension which
at some point will break and return to him the effects which he has
created around him.
 It is now time that those interested in world peace should attend
to the peace of the individual. To try to solve the problem of international 
conflicts while ignoring the problem of the individual is a
wholly inadequate attempt to establish world peace.
 If a crisis is created in Berlin the minds of all statesmen turn to that
city. If something happens in the Congo their whole attention
switches to the Congo. If there is fighting in the Himalayas all their
attention is directed there. Trying to solve these problems individually
is exactly like trying to make a leaf healthy by spraying it with water
instead of watering the root. By now man should be wise enough
to know that only by watering the root can the leaf be really helped.
In their attempts to create world peace the statesmen of the world
should also by now be wise enough to adopt ways of bringing happiness 
and peace to the lives of individuals.
 All the praiseworthy aims of the United Nations only scratch the
surface of the problem of world peace. If the minds and resources of
statesmen in all countries could be used to popularise and effectively
bring to individuals the practice of transcendental meditation, the
face of the world could be changed overnight.
 It is tragic that with all the intelligence and sincerity spent in attempts 
to help people, hardly anything is done to improve the life of
the individual from within. As long as statesmen remain ignorant of
the possibility of improving the lives of individuals from within and
of thereby bringing them abundant peace, happiness and creative intelligence, 
the problem of world peace will always be dealt with only on the
surface, and the world will continue to suffer its cold and hot wars.
 History records the attempts of statesmen to establish lasting world
peace, but because all attempts are made on the surface of international
life and not on the level of the life of the individual the problem of
world peace continues to be a problem for every generation.
 The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation
tries to improve the lot of individuals, but again all attempts deal only
with the surface value of life. Attempts to develop cultural relations
between nations and to bring literacy to the less developed areas of the
world are simply scratching the surface of the problem of world peace.
 The able minds engaged in the work of Unesco now have the
opportunity to use their vast resources to bring this simple system of
transcendental meditation to each individual everywhere. If they were
to take this upon themselves a natural state of lasting world peace
would be established. There would be love, kindness, sympathy,
gratitude and mutual appreciation on all levels of national and international 
life. This is something of practical value which can really
change the face of the world from suffering misery, doubt, hatred
and fear to happiness, peace, creativity, kindness and love.
 Any generation whose leaders sincerely try to apply this principle
widely will succeed in creating lasting world peace. If present statesmen 
and public leaders do this, the credit will be theirs and they will
have the satisfaction of leaving a better world for coming generations.
 A solid foundation for permanent peace and happiness in the world
can be laid down now. Success depends upon those who have the
ability, resources and will to do something of practical value. If the
present generation took the opportunity to lay a solid foundation,
and the fortunate leaders of coming generations maintained the regular 
practice of transcendental meditation in the lives of their people,
the glory of life would be enjoyed by all generations.
 Let it be so is our sincere prayer to the Almighty and is our
humble appeal to all leaders and well-wishers of mankind.
 Fulfillment of life lies in gaining the status of divine life and living 
the life of eternal freedom in the fullness of all the values of
human existence.
 Fulfilment of human consciousness lies in the attainment of divine
consciousness, God-consciousness, which brings together the absolute
and relative values of life.
 The bliss-consciousness of absolute Being and the relative joys in
the variety of creation should be lived simultaneously. This means
the fulfilment of life in cosmic consciousness.
 For the sake of clarity we shall consider what cosmic consciousness is.
 We have seen that during transcendental meditation the conscious 
mind arrives at the transcendental field of absolute Being of
unmanifested nature. Here in this field the mind transcends all that
is relative, and is to be found in the state of absolute Being. The mind
has transcended all limits of the experience of thought and is left by
itself in a state of pure consciousness. This state of pure consciousness,
or the state of absolute, pure Being, is called self-consciousness.
 When this self-consciousness is forever maintained, even when the
mind emerges from the transcendent and engages in the field of
activity, then self-consciousness attains the status of cosmic consciousness. 
Self-consciousness is then established eternally in the nature of
the mind. Even then the mind is awake, dreaming or in deep sleep,
self-consciousness is maintained naturally and this is called cosmic
consciousness.
 Cosmic consciousness means that consciousness which includes the
experience of the relative field together with the state of absolute
Being. This state of cosmic consciousness is one where the mind lives
in eternal freedom, remaining unbound by whatever it experiences
during all activities in the relative world. This freedom from the
bondage of experience gives the mind a status of cosmic consciousness,
a condition of eternal freedom in all the relative states of life - waking,
dreaming and sleeping.
 Perfect mental and physical health is natural in this state of fulfilment 
of life where divine intelligence speaks in all phases, where
God-consciousness permeates all daily experiences and activities, where
universal love flows in and overflows from the heart and where
divine intelligence fills the mind. In such a state of integrated life where
behaviour is in PerfeCt harmony and where all the planes of living
are infused with divine consciousness, universal love for everything
overflows and becomes concentrated in devotion to God, and life
finds fulfilment in the unbounded ocean of divine wisdom.
 The world is the Divine made active, everything rising as a wave
on the eternal ocean of bliss-consciousness. Every perception, the
sound of every word, the touch of every little particle and the smell of
whatever may be, brings a tidal wave from the ocean of eternal bliss.
Every rising thought, word or action is a rising of the tide of bliss.
 In every static or dynamic state of existence the divine glory of the
unmanifested is found dancing in the manifested field of life. The
Absolute dances in the relative. Eternity pervades every moment of
transitory existence. Life is ultimately fulfilled only when cosmic
consciousness is centred in devotion to God. Such is the ultimate of
perfection in life, where a cosmically evolved man rises to the heights
of devotion.
 Fortunate are those evolved, cosmically conscious men in that devotion 
becomes possible for them, raising the value of infinite bliss-consciousness 
to a concentrated state. In comparison with this state
of devotion, the life of cosmic consciousness can be described as mere
cosmic consciousness. It is as if gaining cosmic consciousness is not
 actually attaining the ultimate fulfilment of life, but is merely gaining
the ability to acquire real and ultimate fulfillment.
 Unless one is cosmically evolved, unless one lives eternity in the
day-to-day, transitory field of life, it is not possible to overflow on
the level of universal love. Unless one overflows on the level of universal 
love, where is the possibility of having universal love in a
concentrated state?
 Personal love for a mother or a father, for a husband or wife, is
simply symbolic of the concentrated state of universal love to which
a cosmically evolved soul attains in a state of devotion to God. The
love in a child's heart for his toys, games and studies is spread over
 those objects, but his concentrated love is for his mother. This is an
analogy of the degree of love possible when, having attained the state
of cosmic consciousness, one is devoted to God. A child's innocent
fancy has in it a certain amount of love and that love is concentrated
in love for his mother. A student has a certain amount of love in his
heart for various branches of learning, but all this love is concentrated 
in love for his teacher. A husband 11as a certain amount of love
flowing in his heart towards many things in life, but he finds the concentrated 
state of all his love in love for his wife.
 In the same way, a man with cosmic consciousness has an unbounded, 
unlimited amount of love overflowing in all directions for everything. 
When this overflowing, unlimited, unbounded, cosmic, universal 
love becomes concentrated in devotion to God, then that
concentrated state of universal love is of such a degree as to bring
ultimate fulfilment to life.
 Far more concentrated is the state of cosmic consciousness in devotion 
to God than is any love that could ever be in any sphere of existence. 
To live this state of concentrated, universal love is the ultimate 
fulfilment of life. It is an unbounded flow of love at the sight
of everything, at the sound of everything, the smell or taste of anything, 
the touch of anything; the whole of life in its multifarious
diversity is nothing but the fullness of love, bliss and contentment,
eternal and absolute.
 The capacity for fulfilment comes to an individual when, through
the constnnt practice of transcendental meditation, he gains cosmic
consciousness and then surrenders in devotion at the feet of God.
Unless the state of cosmic consciousness is achieved, devotion in
the real sense of the word does not even begin to mean anything.
A man whose heart does not flow in universal love dues not gain
much from devotion because real devotion results in surrender, and
surrender means losing one's identity and gaining the identity of the
beloved. The path of love, the path of devotion, is successfully traversed 
only by cosmically evolved souls.
 A man who has not risen to cosmic consciousness, who is shrouded
by his limited individuality and is only awake in the identity of his
individual self, can have no clear or significant conception of love or
devotion. Although people on all levels of consciousness feel love
in their hearts and feel devotion to God and practise devotion, the
charm of devotion in the state of cosmic consciousness is a charm
beyond the limits of imagination.
 Devotion and love belong in their full value only to the life of
cosmic consciousness. Below that standard, devotion and love do
not have much significance or value. The devotion of an unrealised
man is merely an attempt, an effort, a strain. At best it leads to imagination 
of the greater and more intensified states of love. But the
love and devotion of a cosmically evolved man have a significant
and substantial value which embraces eternity, and that love and
devotion bind eternity into a single universal individuality. Such is
the power of love, such is the power of devotion.
 Below the level of cosmic consciousness the power of love and
devotion is limited and insignificant. Therefore all who want to
follow the path of devotion are invited to begin the practice of transcendental 
meditation, which enables the individual to rise to a state
of cosmic consciousness without struggle or strife, without penance
or austerity.
 The individual then becomes attuned to cosmic life, his movements 
accord with the movements of the entire cosmos, his purpose
is found in the purpose of the entire cosmos, his life is established in
cosmic life. The will of man then is the will of God, the activity of
man then is the desire of God, and man fulfils God's purpose. When
a man accomplishes God's purpose, when he breathes God's desire
then the son of God is the word of God. Then the Father in heaven
and man on earth are united in the same ideal of eternal good. Man
through all his thoughts, words and actions produces an influence
which serves the purpose of creation, and on all levels of his individual
life he gains fulfilment in the purpose of cosmic life.
 Then is the selfishness of man the selfish end of God; the individual
mind of man the cosnlic mind of God; the individual breath of man
the cosmic breath of God; the individual speech of man the expression 
of cosmic silence.
 The Lord speaks through him; omnipresent, cosmic life gains
expression in his activity; the omniscient is expressed in the limitations
of his individual personality; the cosmic intelligence finds expression
in his individual mind; the thought of cosmic life is materialised in
his process of thinking; the immutable silence of eternal Being finds
expression in his thought, speech and action. The man's eyes behold
the purpose of God, his ears hear the music of cosmic life, his hands
hold to cosmic intentions, his feet set the cosmic life in motion; he
walks on earth, yet walks in the destiny of heaven; he sees, yet sees
the glory of God; he hears, yet hears the silence; he speaks, yet
speaks the word of God; he speaks, yet speaks the intention of God;
he speaks and draws out the purpose of cosmic life; he speaks and gives
expression to the cosmic purpose; he speaks yet his words speak
eternal Being. The man is the living expression of omnipresent, omniscient, 
cosmic existence.
 Here is he who can speak for God, here is he who can speak for
cosmic law, here is he who acts for God, here is the image of God on
earth. His life is the stream of cosmic Being. His individual life-stream
is a tidal wave from the eternal ocean of cosmic Being, a wave which
holds within itself the entire ocean of cosmic life. He is the expression 
of inexpressible, eternal Being. He moves in the ever-immovable
status of the Absolute. His activity in relative existence expresses
the eternal stillness of the Absolute. In the radiance of his relative life
the Absolute finds in him an expression of Its Being. Angels and gods
enjoy his existence on earth; the earth and heavens enjoy the existence
of the bliss of eternal Being embodied in the form of man.
 The formless appears in form, the silence becomes vibrant, the
inexpressible is expressed in a personality, the cosmic life is breathed
by the individual.
 This is how, when the breath of the individual becomes the impulse
of eternal life, his individuality breathes universal existence. Then is
gained the fulfilment of life.
 The fulfilment of religion lies in man gaining a direct way to
 God-realisation; this is all that is necessary to make him a complete
man, a man of fully integrated life, a man of great intelligence, creativity, 
wisdom, peace and happiness.
 The fulfillment of religion lies in gaining for man that for which
the word religion itself stands. The word comes from the Latin infinitive
religare : re, meaning back, ligare, to bind; or, that which binds one back.
The purpose of religion is to bind man back to his source, to his origin.
 If religion succeeds in bringing a man's life back to its source
by bringing the mind back to its source, by bringing the activity of
the body back to the source of all activity, religion succeeds in fulfilling
its purpose. Mind is the pivot of life. If the mind can be drawn back
to its origin the whole of life will be drawn back to its source and the
purpose of religion will be fulfilled.
 Religion is a way, or at least should be a way, to raise the consciousness 
of man to the level of God-consciousness and the human mind
to the level of divine intelligence or universal cosmic mind.
 The purpose of religion is to attune the individual life to the laws
of nature so that it flows naturally in the stream of evolution.
 Religion should co-ordinate the individual life with cosmic life
and so improve all the values of human life. Religion provides a
practical way to the realisation of the supreme reality brought to
light by philosophy. Philosophy is descriptive, whereas religion has
a practical value in providing a direct way to God-realisation. It is
a direct means of enabling human beings to evolve to the level of the
Divine. Religion dictates the do's and don'ts of life to guide the activity 
of the individual towards attaining the highest purpose of human
existence. All these do's and don'ts of religion are meant to provide
a direct way to the realisation of the ultimate reality or freedom
;n God-consciousness. Religion serves a practical purpose.
 We need not describe in detail the deplorable state of religion in
the world today; it will suffice to say that only the body is found;
and the body is devoid of the spirit. Only the rituals and dogma are
found: the spirit has departed. That is why the followers of religion
do not find fulfilment.
 This does not mean that religious rituals have no value. Ritual
and the dogmatic aspects of religion are certainly necessary, because
for the soul to exist so must the body. Their value is that they constitute 
the body of religion for the purpose of providing an opportunity 
for the spirit of religion to guide the destiny of the people.
 The rituals of the various religions represent the body, and the
practice of directly experiencing Being represents the spirit. Both
are necessary and should go hand in hand. One will not survive
without the other.
 When the spirit leaves the body, the body begins to disintegrate.
This is the case with religions today. They seem to be in a state of
 disintegration because they lack spirit. Religion today is like the
corpse of a man without the man himself. The rituals remain without
elevating the consciousness of the people.
 The inner spirit of religion does not seem to exist. If it does exist
at all it fails to appeal to the people. Because of its ineffectiveness it
has practically ceased to capture the imagination of modern man.
There is hardly a religion in the world today whose custodians and
preachers have an understanding of the direct method of experiencing
the ultimate, absolute Being, even though the Scriptures of every
religion contain this practice as the central pivot of their teachings.
This is why all over the world religion has lost its effectiveness and
fails to fulfil its purpose.
 The purpose of religion should not only be to indicate what is
right and wrong ; to fulfil its purpose it should elevate man to a state
of life where he will choose only that which is right and will by
nature avoid that which is wrong. The true spirit of religion is lacking
if it merely lays down what is right or wrong and creates the fear of
punishment and hell and the fear of God in the minds of men. The
purpose of religion should be to take away all fear. It should not
seek to achieve its purpose by instilling a fear of the Almighty. 
 Religion should further a way of living where life is naturally
established in tune with the cosmic purpose of evolution and every
thought, word and action of the individual is guided in a natural way
by a higher purpose. It is not that a man is required to make an effort
to do right and to aspire to higher values, but that all his thoughts,
words and actions should by nature be placed on the level of attainment 
of the highest purpose of life. 
 Religion should be strong enough to bring to the individual in a
natural manner a state of fulfilment in life without strenuous practices
or long years of training. If it is fully integrated in itself, a religion
should enable man to live fulfilment naturally.
 A really live and integrated religion should be able to induce a
spirit of fulfilment in man. By the time a man attains maturity his
nervous system is fully developed. At maturity he should have gained,
by following his faith, the status of fulfilment of life. The rest of his
days should be lived in fulfilment.
 A fully alive and integrated religion will be one through which
each man becomes a man of realised God-consciousness, a man enjoying 
the full values of life, a man of God; the Divine manifested in
the form of man on earth.
 Through the practice of transcendental meditation it is now possible 
for people of all religions to acquire within themsclves an integrated 
state of life and gain absolute, pure consciousness, the state of
divine Being.
 A religion which brings to its people a message to do good but
which fails to develop their consciousness or to raise them to live
naturally a life of good, is a religion merely of words. A religion
worthy of the name should be of real practical value. It should set a
man directly in a way of life full of good and free from evil.
 It is the responsibility of religion to see that good shines from the
faces of its followers. If religious teachings fail to inspire people to
live naturally a life of good in God-consciousness, the preachers of
those religions should renew their strength and do Justice to their
teachings. The inner light of religion is missing from religious teachings; 
this is the case all over the world, with the result that peace
and happiness are absent from the lives of people and everywhere
tensions are increasing. Religious people who seem to have peace in
their lives are often found to be men of passive attitude, lacking
dynamic force, but this is not a feature of true religious life. The
passivity springs from a misguided application of religious ideals.
 The life of a religious man should show good and dynamic activity 
on the surface and underneath should have that unshakeable,
eternal peace which is found at the depth of the ocean.
 Life should be such that religion is lived naturally with its purpose
fulfilled. It should not be a struggle to live or attain fulfilment. Life
should be lived in fulfilment of all its values. Man on earth, a man
of a real, lively and integrated religion, should be a living god, the
Divine speaking, not a struggling man with faith in God searching
for the meaning of the Divine. The substance of God, the status of
God, the existence of God, God-consciousness, divine consciousness -
all these should be the natural life of man.
 Faith in God and faith in religion are supposed to have a purpose
in life. Any faith for the sake of faith alone is just a drain on people's
energy. If faith is unable to relieve a man from suffering and to bring
him good, then that faith needs something more to make it productive. 
People belonging to different religions do have faith in their
religions, and endure in their faith through all the stress of life. It is
for the preachers of religions to provide them with something of
practical value through which their faiths will lead them to the goal
of life.
 The ministers are the ministers of God, standing between man and
God. Their responsibility is to serve as a link between humanity
and divinity. Likewise the priests in the temples stand as mediators betwecn 
man and God and as such their responsibility is great. Their life
must be a life integrated in God-consciousness, and if they fail to live
life in god-consciousness they cease to be a link between man and God.
 It is time for the custodians of religion to be awakened. This
meditation is offered to them out of love of God and of that for
which they stand. It is time that transcendental meditation is adopted
in churches, temples, mosques and pagodas. Let all who are proud
of their religions, who are living their own ways of life in their own
faiths, enjoy the fulfillment of life - the divine life in the life of man -
through the precepts of their own religion.
 Here in a simple practice is the fulfilment of every religion. It
belongs to the spirit of every religion; it existed in the early days of
every faith and has SinCe been lost. The principle is still contained in
the scriptures. It has only been lost in practice. Unfortunately, religious 
teachers seem to have put the cart before the horse. They advise
man to behave righteously, teaching that through right action he will
gain purity and be able to realise God. The right approach would be
to offer a direct way of gaining God-consciousness. Established in
higher consciousness man would naturally behave righteously. Man
behaves from his level of consciousness. Therefore any teaching of
right action without a means of raising consciousness will always
be ineffective. It is much easier to raise man's consciousness than to get
him to act righteously. Religious life is the result of God-consciousness ;
God-realisation is not the result of a religious life. Unless this is understood 
the goal will never be achieved but will always be a far-fetched
dream, forever in the realms of unattained hopes. For many generations 
man has been deprived both of God-consciousness and a good
life. It is painful to see how many generations have gone by without
the real gift of life. Certainly no one can be held responsible for that.
The responsibility for the loss of the spirit of religion lies with the
eternity of time. But now is the time for its revival. ;
 This practice has fortunately come to light during the present generation. 
Let it be adopted by the people of all religions and let them
enjoy it while remaining proud of their faiths. Let the intelligent
minds of all religions and the custodians of the various faiths delve
into the deeper essence of their scriptures and there discover transcendental 
meditation; let them learn the practice and adopt it in the
light of their own teachings.
 The basic premise of every religion should be that man need not
suffer in life. A man belonging to any religion should have no place
in his life for suffering, tension, immorality, vice, sinful thought,
speech or action. None of these negative aspects of life should exist
for a man following religion.
 It is not necessary to dwell on the unfortunate state of the followers
of religion today, the increasing tension in life, the suffering, disease
and decline of human values in all faiths. These failures on the part
of religion are responsible for the modern drift away from religion.
Even though people subscribe in name to one religion or another they
fail to live the values of a religious life.
 A religious life should be one lived in bliss, joyfulness, peace, harmony, 
creativity and intelligence. The stream of religious life should
at least flow on the level of common sense. It should be a life of love,
kindness and tolerance with an innate desire to help one's fellow men.
These qualities should make up the natural state of mind of a religious
man. If these qualities together with the state of God-consciousness
are not naturally found in a religious man, then the name of his religion 
is only a burden to him.
 Religion should not only provide a solid foundation but should
be able to build a high edifice of divine life in the life of man, and
this can be accomplished only by transforming man's nature into divine
nature. It will be difficult for religious rituals to transform inner
tendencies into the essential qualities of the divine nature. But unless
this is done, life on earth can never be virtuous, moral and dignified.
 Teaching which touches only the surface of the conscious mind
has little effect on the transformation of the inner mind. In teaching
truthfulness, kindness, love for others and fear of God, religions have
failed to provide any significant degree of evolution in human life
because they have not used any practical technique for directly raising 
the human mind to divine values.
 Unless the mind rises to high values and attains a fair degree of
divine intelligence man will continue to err. While man remains bound
in the field of humanity he is apt to err. It is necessary, therefore, to
take him above the field of error, to bring divine intelligence within the
range of the conscious mind and thereby to infuse divine nature into
his human nature. Raise humanity to divinity and then it does not
matter what rituals are followed on the gross level of religion and life.
 As long as the spirit of religion dominates the life of the people,
it does not matter what name they give to their religion or what
rituals they follow in their churches, temples, mosques, synagogues
or pagodas. As long as they are established in the spirit of religion
and have risen to a state of God-consciousness, as long as the stream
of life is attuned to the cosmic stream of evolution, it does not matter
whether they can themselves Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu, Jew
or Bnddhist - any name will be significant. On the gross level of
life these names carry significance, but on the level of Being they
all have the same value. What does matter is that man should have a
life of God-consciousness in eternal freedom, a life of complete integration. 
The key to the fulfilment of every religion is found in the
regular practice of transcendental meditation.
 We invite the custodians of all religions, the masters of philosophy,
the leaders of metaphysical movements all over the world to test for
themselves the validity of transcendental meditation and to offer to
their followers the gift of fulfilment of life.
 This meditation is in no way a threat to the authority of priests
or ministers. It is something which belongs to their religions but which
has been forgotten for many centuries. This is something that will
restore to them their followers. Let them know that this will re-establish
in society the value of the temples and churches, and will restore to
the priest the status which should be his.
 Religion in many countries seems to be either discredited or ignored 
by the governments whose constitutions have a secular basis.
The government no doubt has the welfare of the nation at heart, but
it is not enough to allow people to profess and practice their religion
freely. It is necessary that the authorities should be alert to see that
the religion followed by the people produces in them the right spirit
of life and giving, and that they do not become indolent and restless,
which is the result of following only the surface value of religion.
If religion fails to produce the effect it promises then it needs help, and
the national authority should be able to provide that help. Otherwise,
any efforts to improve the nation will always be undermined by the
very life of the people weakened by ineffective religious teaching.
 Transcendental meditation is the practice which cnables man to live
all that religions have taught through the ages ; by this practice he easily
rises to the level of divine Being and this brings fulfilment to all
religions.
 The fulfilment of psychology lies in:
 1. Making the mind strong.
 2. Enlarging the mind's conscious capacity.
 3- Enabling a man to use his full mental potential.
 4. Developing techniques whereby all the latent faculties of the
 mind can be unfolded.
 5. Bringing to each individual greater contentment, peace and
 inner happiness, increased efficiency and creativity.
 6. Developing the power of concentration, together with increased 
 will-power and the ability to maintain inner poise and peace
 even when engaged in outer activity.
 7. Developing self-confidence, tolerance, clear thinking and a greater
 power of thought.
 8. Establishing the mind in eternal freedom and peace in God consciousness under all circumstances, in the midst of all the activity and silence of relative existence.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 The ultimate fulfilment of psychology lies in enabling the individual 
mind to attune itself to the cosmic mind and to remain so
attuned; that is, in establishing a lasting co-ordination of the individual
mind with the cosmic mind, so that all activity in the individual mind
conforms with cosmic evolution and the purpose of cosmic life.
 Psychology should not only enable a man to overcome the strain
produced by failures or pressure of work in his day-to-day life, but
should also give such strength to his mind that it never suffers under
strain nor falls victim to psychosomatic diseases.
 The purpose of the study of psychology should be to enable man
to overcome obstacles in life and to live without suffering. It should
provide that strength and clarity of thought which will enable his
desires to be satisfied so that he will live a life of fulfillment.
 The aim of psychology, the study of the mind, should be to enable
a man to live all values of life, to enjoy all phases of existence, to
create more, to have greater understanding and to live life to the maximum 
in eternal freedom in God-consciousness.
 When we consider the immense possibilities in the field of psychology 
and review the achievements made so far by that science. we
find them discouraging. This is not surprising, for psychology is yet
in its infant stage of development.
 It should not be a function of psychology to remind a man that
his past was miserable, or that his surroundings and circumstances
were unfavourable, or that his associatiom were depressing and discouraging, 
or that there was lack of love and harmony with those
near to him. To remind anyone of such things will only result in
lowering his consciousness.
 It should be considered criminal to tell anyone that his individual
life is based on the inefficient and degencrate influence of his past
environment. The psychological influence of such depressing information 
is demoralising, and the inner core of the heart becomes twisted 
by it. On the other hand, to remember the greatness of one's
family traditions and the glory of one's parents, friends and environment, 
helps to elevate the consciousness and directly encourages one
to rise above weaknesses.
 Analysing an individual's way of thinking, and bringing to the
conscious level the buried misery of his past, even for the purpose
of enabling him to see the cause of his stress and suffering, is deplorable, 
for it directly helps to strengthen the impressions of a miserable
past and serves to depress his consciousness in the present.
 It is a blessing of God that we normally forget the past. Certainly
 the present is born of the past, but the fact remains that the past re 
presents less developed states of consciousness, and the present belongs
 to a more developed state. Therefore it is only a loss to overshadow
 the more evolved present with memories of the less developed past.
 By looking back into the past one's vision is expanded, but it
expands only to bring to a conscious level less developed states of
life. One's vision is thereby enlarged, but at the same time the genius
and the brightness of intelligence are overshadowed.
 If there could be a way to enlarge the mind to more evolved states
of consciousness so that it would eventually gain cosmic consciousness, 
then indeed the subjects of psycho-analysis would be saved from
the unfortunate results of digging into the mud of a miserable past.
 It is for the statesmen of all natiom to realise the harmlul aspects
of modem psycho-analysis and to replace it with the practice of
transcendental meditation. This directly elevates the consciousness
and thereby not only strengthens the mind of the individual but also
enables him to use his full potential, making him more effective and
more powerful, peaceful, happy and creative.
 This technique for gaining transcendental consciousness brings to
a conscious level the subtle levels of thought. In this way the whole
process of thought comes within the range of the conscious mind.
The conscious capacity of the mind increases to its fullest scope. This
is how it is possible to enable a man to rise to his full mental potential
in both thought and action.
 When the mind becomes familiar with the deeper levels of the
thought process it becomes aware of the subtle levels of creation. And
when the mind becomes familiar with the subtle regions of creation,
the ability is gained to stimulate those regions to every advantage.
This amounts to unfolding the latent faculties of the mind.
 This unfoldment of latent faculties can be clarified by an example:
when a man dives into a pond he passes through the surface levels of
water to the deeper levels, reaches the bottom and then comes up.
A second and a third dive will take him through all levels of the
water in the same way. The practice of diving makes the man familiar 
with all the levels of the water and, as familiarity with the deeper
levels grows, the diver is able to remain longer at the bottom of the
pond. when he is able to remain at the bottom for some time, with
increased practice he can acquire the ability to move around at any
level of the pond at will.
 This is the result of gaining familiarity with the deeper levels of
water. With a little more practice he can make himself comfortable
at any level and be active there so as to produce a desired activity on
the surface of the pond. Eventually it will be possible for him to stay
comfortably at any level and to produce a desired activity anywhere
he chooses in the pond. When this ability is acquired, the diver
becomes master of the pond.
 When the mind becomes familiar with the deeper levels of consciousness 
it gains the ability to work from any subtle or gross level
of consciousness. Then it is able to stimulate any stratum of creation
for any desired advantage. This opens the door to the mastery of
creation.
 Students of philosophy and psychology would do well to consider
psychology as exemplified in the Bhagavad-Gita. It presents a study
of the development of the mind from a profound state of indecision
to that most highly developed state in which the intelligence is established
in the eternal Being, the most evolved state of human evolution.
 The Bhagavad-Gita describes the psychology of the individual
mind and the cosmic mind and marvellously brings about their correlation, 
where eternal life is infused into the temporal, phenomenal
existence of man. If this does not take place, the individual remains
forever subject to the temporary aspect of his nature and is consequently 
overtaken by suffering.
 The way in which surroundings and circumstances influence the
individual mind is demonstrated at the very beginning of the text.
Here, Arjuna, the most highly evolved man, the greatest archer of
his time, the hero of the Mahabharata, although awake to a complete
 knowledge of right and wrong, is unable to solve the dilemma before
 him. Surroundings have so strong an effect upon his mind that all
 persuasion and suggestion are powerless to help him.
 The Bhagavad-Gita teaches that the effect of surroundmgs and
circumstances upon the mind depends upon the mind's strength;
that the intensity of the effect of an impression is in inverse ratio to
the strength of the mind. At first Arjuna is found in a perilous state
of indecision, but after putting into practice the psychological teaching 
of the Gita, it is not long before he is infused with the spirit
of action, although the circumstances remain quite unchanged. A
close study of Lord Krishna's discourse reveals a great depth of psychological 
insight; it shows that the individual mind, however intelligent
on the superficial conscious level, can be overcome by its failure to
understand and encompass a situation which obviously lies beyond
its control unless it is attuned to the unlimited cosmic mind. To establish 
conscious co-ordination between the individual and the cosmic
mind is the only way to ensure that the individual becomes entirely
free from the possibility of failure to understand a threatening situation 
and of successfully rising above its adverse effects. A pond is
apt to dry up in the heat of summer, but there is no such danger in the
case of the ocean. The psychology of the Bhagavad-Gita presents a
master technique for bringing about co-ordination of the individual
mind with cosmic mind: the attention is brought to the field of the
Absolute. This transforms the weakness and limitation of the individual 
mind into the unbounded strength of cosmic intelligence. This
great achievement is so easy that every individual on earth can succeed 
in it and make all the petty complexities and innumerable sufferings 
in life unnecessary.
 The technique of transcendental meditation is the key to the wisdom 
of psychology; it has a scientific basis which can satisfy any
intellect. Herein lies the fulfilment of modern psychology.
 The fulfilment of philosophy lies in:
 1. Unveiling the mystery of nature.
 2. Revealing to man the reality of life.
 3. Fulfilling the quest of the human mind.
 4. Providing direct experience of the ultimate reality of life and thereby bringing to the level of direct experience all the various levels of life and creation.
 The fulfilment of philosophy lies in revealing to man that the
transitory values of day-to-day life co-exist with the permanent and
imperishable values of eternal life.
 Philosophy should lead a man to become the knower of reality,
established in the truth of life, free from doubts regarding anything
in the field of creation. He should not only be a knower of reality
but should also live reality with the fully integrated values of life.
He should be a man eternally contented in divine consciousness, living 
fulfilment in life. He should be a master of the art of living
through his knowledge of the science of being.
 The modern study of philosophy does not do full justice to the
scope of the subject. For many years past it has merely skimmed the
surface of this glorious field of wisdom. What is now needed is a
clear vision of the fulfilment of philosophy and a way to bring the
great values of this study to the level of common intelligence and
experience in day-to-day practical life.
 Fortunately for the present generation, the fulfilment of philosophy
may be found in a technique to explore the unseen regions and the
ultimate reality of life. This technique makes transcendental, absolute
Being available to everyone as all actual experience.
 Absolute Being is the ultimate in creation, the ultimate reality,
the truth of life. By truth we mean that which never changes. Transcendental, 
absolute Being is eternal in Its nature; It remains ever the
same. It is the ultimate constituent of creation, never-changing because 
change belongs to the relative field.
 All the different strata of creation are made of that substance which
is called absolute Being. We call it a substance in order to understand
more clearly how all this creation has come from pure consciousness
or absolute Being. It is as if absolute Being is the material from which
all creation is made, which in itself never changes and yet gives rise
to the ever-changing diversity and multiplicity of forms and phenomena 
in creation.
 The experience of absolute Being leaves no doubt about the essential 
constituent of the whole structure of creation. In diving deep
within the mind the attention passes through all the subtle strata of
consciousness, the different strata of creation. That is why, in the
practice of transcendental meditation, not only does the inner range
of consciousness unfold but the entire field of subtle creation is traversed. 
Between the gross and the transcendental strata of consciousness
lie all the different strata of creation. When the mind unfolds and
activates the deeper levels of consciousness it passes through all these
strata of creation. This is how the mind gains an increasing ability
to understand the entire universe.
 This meditation unfolds the mysteries of nature, revealing to man
the truth of creation and the entire field of life. Nothing remains
hidden, everything becomes clear to the mind as it progresses to the
transcendental state of pure consciousness.
 Here is the fulfilment of the age-old quest for the experience of
reality, of the age-old quest of seekers after truth. Philosophy is
fulfilled in this simple system which is now available to every man in
the world - this simple technique for unfolding the inner realms of
life and understanding the essential nature of the ultimate reality.
Every man is thus able to know for himself from personal experience
the truth behind creation. The experience and understanding of
eternal reality set a man free from the bondage and authority of his
own inner thoughts and desires and from the influence of outer ideas,
surroundings and circumstances.
 All the great expressions of Vedic wisdom found in the Upanishads
which declare the ultimate oneness of life in the phrase: I am That,
thou art That and all this is That, remain fanciful imagination or,
at best, an intellectual mood without the actual cognition of the Ultimate. 
Without direct experience of transcendental Being the study
of philosophy leaves man in uncertainty about the nature of supreme
Reality. It is the actual experience which succeeds in eliminating the
intellectual confusion caused by the study of different schools of
philosophy.
 We give thanks to the great glory of His Divinity Swami Brahmananda 
Saraswati, Bhagwan Shankaracharya, whose devotion has
revealed the key to the fulfilment of philosophy and made easy of
accomplishment the path of the seekers after truth. This path has been
reduced to almost no path; it has been reduced to the achievement
of the goal. Through learning the technique of transcendental meditation 
and practising it every day one arrives at the goal itself many
times during daily practice. In this lies the fulfilment of philosophy.
 The word path pre-supposes a distance, starting from one point
and ending at another. The paths to God-realisation mean the methods
or practices adopted by man in order to reach God. To understand the
paths clearly it is first necessary to clarify what we mean by God and
how distant He is from us.
 God is the most highly cherished word for hundreds of millions
of people everywhere. The idea of God is, for those who understand
it, the most highly cherished idea in human life. The conception of
God is a reality greater than the reality of any conception which the
human mind has developed at any time. The idea of God is neither
a fanciful thought, nor a thought to be concealed, nor a thought to be
used as a shelter or place of refuge. God is a reality more concrete than
any of the realities in the entire cosmos. The existence of God is all
existence more permanent and substantial than the ever-changing,
temporary existence of the forms and phenomena of creation.
 God is found in two phases of reality: as a supreme Being of absolute, 
eternal nature and as a personal God at the highest level of
phenomenal creation, the celestial level of creation. Thus God has
two aspects: the personal and the impersonal. They are the two realities 
of the word God.
 The impersonal aspect of God is formless, supreme; it is eternal
and absolute Being. It is without attributes, qualities or features,
because all attributes, qualities and features belong to the relative
field of life, and the impersonal God is of absolute nature. It is absolute, 
impersonal and attributeless, but is the source of all relative
existence. It is the fountainhead of all the different forms and phenomena 
of creation. All the attributes of relative existence have their
source in the attributeless, absolute Being. This Absolute is of unmanifested 
nature; It manifests in different degrees and forms in the
various strata of creation. Everything in creation is the manifestation
of unmanifested, absolute, impersonal Being, the omnipresent God.
 The impersonal, omnipresent, absolute God is by very nature
progressive. It manifests as the different aspects of creation, but even
when found in the variety of forms and phenomena of manifest creation 
It maintains Its status as unmanifested Absolute. So the impersonal, 
omnipresent God, remaining always impersonal and omnipresent, 
appears in the relative field in the form Of creation, guided
by Its own nature.
 To understand how the unmanifested impersonal assumes the form
of the manifested phenomena of creation, let us take the example of
hydrogen and oxygen. Remaining as hydrogen and oxygen, they take
on different qualities and appear as vapour, water and ice. Similarly,
omnipresent, impersonal, almighty Being, while remaining as the
Absolute, manifests variously in qualities, forms and phenomena of
creation. The Absolute is the ultimate reality of life. It is life eternal
and knows no change in Its character. It is the ultimate of creation,
the source, the be-all and the end-all of the entire creation. It is
through the power of the impersonal God that the world was, is and
will be. Just as there is only one essential constituent, H,O, in vapour,
water and ice, so the ultimate constituent of the entire creation - the
See: Prana and Being, Mind and Being and Karma and Being on pages 40, 41 and 46
respectively.
impersonal, absolute God - is one; It appears as many. The appearance
of the one as the many is only phenomenal. The reality of the one
impersonal God is eternal and absolute.
 All ever-changing forms and phenomena are grounded in neverchanging, 
eternal, absolute Being which is the creator, maintainer
and sustainer of the world. It is called the creator because It is the basis
of all creation coming from It. To create is Its nature, to exist is Its
nature, to expand is Its nature. So creating, existing and expanding
are different aspects of the nature of the almighty, impersonal God.
 It is the maintainer of creation in the sense that It is the essential
constituent of creation. Since It is the very basis of all creation, naturally 
all beings dwell in It, their ever-changing existence having their
basis in unchanging, unchangeable, eternal Being. Thus we find that
the world is the creation of the impersonal, absolute God. It is sustained 
by It and eventually dissolves into It. To understand how the
world dissolves into its source, consider again the example of hydrogen
and oxygen taking on the different forms of water and ice. As the
qualities of water dissolve into oxygen and hydrogen, the qualities
of ice dissolve into oxygen and hydrogen and the qualities of vapour
dissolve into oxygen and hydrogen, so all the forms and phenomena
of relative existence dissolve into their essential constituent which is
Being, the impersonal, absolute, eternal God, the Almighty.
 The Absolute is said to be almighty but not in the sense that It
is able to do everything. This is because, being everything, It cannot
do anything or know anything. It is beyond doing and knowing. It
is almighty in the sense that without It nothing would exist. All that
exlsts is in the absolute state of Being. In this sense the impersonal God
is creator, maintainer and sustainer of the world, remaining eternally
in an unmanifest state, and only in that sense almighty.
 We have seen how absolute, impersonal, transcendental Being
vibrates and enters the relative phase of existence as a thought, the
thinker and prana. We have seen2 that as the process of the evolution
of a thought is continued its subtle state becomes the gross state and
is then transformed into speech and action. So it is Being, pure consciousness, 
the impersonal, almighty God, which appears as the subject
and the object.
 The individual in all his various aspects is the light of God, impersonal, 
absolute Being. That is why life is defined as the light of
God, the radiation of eternal, absolute Beingl.
 Impersonal, absolute Being, or God, pervades all fields of existence
as th.e essential constituent of creation. It is omnipresent, of transcendental 
nature, beyond everything of relative existence. It is beyond
belief, thought, faith, dogma and ritual. It lies beyond the reach of
understanding, beyond mind and intellect. Since It is transcendental,
It cannot be comprehended by thought and is beyond contemplation
and intellectual discrimination and decision. It is the state of Being.
The Being of all is the omnipresent, impersonal God.
 It is beyond knowing: It is knowingness itself. Because it is the
Being of all, to realise It means to be simply what one is. Realisation
of Being is the realisation of the impersonal, omnipresent God. No
path to one's own Being could be thought to exist, no path to realising 
the impersonal God, omnipresent Being, could be shown because 
the very conception of a path removes the Self from one's own
Being. The very idea of a path introduces the conception of something
far away, whereas Being is the essential Self. A path means a link
between two points, but in omnipresent, cosmic Being there cannot
exist two different points or states. Omnipresent means present
everywhere, pervading everything; there is absolutely no question,
therefore, of a path. It is just a question of being ; even when established
in the different states of manifested creation one is established in the
state of Being but in a different form. So Being can never be different
from what one already is, and this leads us to conclude that the question 
of a path to realise the Absolute simply does not arise.
 Therefore the realisation of the omnipresent, almighty, impersonal
God is the realisation of the natural state of one's Being. If a way
 to realise the impersonal Omnipresent could be expressed, it could
 only be said to be a way of coming out of what one is not. To be is
 to enter the realm of impersonal nature; so in order to be one's Self
 it is only necessary to come out of personal nature, to come out of
the field of doing and thinking and to be established in the field of
Being. The state of Being is the impersonal state of life. It has been
shown that it is only necessary to gain the habit of arriving at Being
by coming out of the gross into the subtle levels of thinking and eventually 
transcending them.
 So it is clear that realisation of the impersonal God is simply
arriving at one's own Being. And this shows that no path exists between 
the experiencer and the impersonal God. What exists is the
eternal existence of the omnipresent Impersonal. The Impersonal is
permeating the entire field of creation as butter permeates milk or
oil permeates a seed. A practical way to reach the level of the oil in
the seed is to enter into the subtle strata of the seed and reach the field
of the oil. Likewise if the level of the butter is to be reached in milk,
it is necessary to enter into the subtle strata of milk.
 The only way to realise almighty, impersonal God is to enter into
the subtle strata of anything and to transcend the subtlest experience.
There will be found the field of the Impersonal, the field of pure
Being, the state of pure consciousness which lies in the transcendental
field of everything.
 The world today has a very vague conception of God. There are
those who like to believe in God, those who love God and those
who want to realise God, but even they do not have a clear conception 
of what God is. God has remained for the most part a fanciful,
pleasant thought and a refuge during suffering and misery in life. For the
custodians of many strange religions the word God is a magic word to
control the understanding and religious destiny of many innocent souls.
God, the omnipresent essence of life, is presented as something to fear.
 God is not the power of fear; It is not anything from which fear
could emulate. God is the existence of bliss-consciousness of absolute
and eternal life. No fear of the name of God should have been instilled 
into the lives of people; no religions should have been based on
the fear of God.
 Unfortunately there are religions existing in the world today
which base their teachings mainly on the fear of God, and this fear
is instilled into the children of God. It is cruel and damaging to life
to spread fear in the name of God. God is life eternal, purity and bliss.
The kingdom of God is the field of all good to man. God is to be
loved and not to be feared.
 The impersonal God is the Being which dwells in the heart of
everyone. Each individual is, in his true nature, the impersonal God.
That is why the Vedic philosophy of the Upanishads declares: I am
That, thou art That, and all this is That. No one need be afraid of his
own Self, no one need be afraid of bliss-consciousness, no one need be
afraid of the kingdom of heaven where there is all bliss and fulfilment.
 God, almighty, impersonal, unmanifested Being, is the eternal
reality of life. It is imperishable, It is abundance, It is life, It is fulfilment. 
It is at hand for anyone to realise. One only needs to be, and
the technique to be lies in transcendental meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE PERSONAL ASPECT OF GOD
 God in personal form is the supreme Being of almighty nature.
It is not 'It' but can only be 'He' or 'She'. 'He' or 'She' has a specific
form, a specific nature, certain attributes and certain qualities. To some
the personal God is 'He' and to others 'She'. Some say It is both 'He'
and 'She', but certainly It is not 'It' because of the personal character.
'It', we have seen, belongs only to the impersonal aspect of God.
 The personal aspect of God necessarily has form, qualities, features
and likes and dislikes; and, having the ability to command the entire
existence of the cosmos, the process of evolution and all in creation,
the personal God is Almighty.
 God, supreme, almighty Being, in whose person the process of
evolution finds fulfilment, is at the highest level of creation. To understand
how the processes of evolution and creation and fulfilment in
the personal God we must review the whole range of creation.
 We find that there are grades in creation. Some forms, some beings,
are less powerful, intelligent, creative and joyful; others have these
attributes to a higher degree. The whole of creation is composed of
the different strata of intelligence, peace and energy.
 At the lowest level of evolution we find the inert states of creation.
From there the species begin and creation develops in intelligence,
power and joyfulness. The progressive scale of evolution continues
through the different species of the vegetable and animal kingdoms
and rises to the world of angels. Ultimately, on the highest level of
evolution, is He whose power, joyfulness, intelligence and energy are
unlimited. All-knowing is He, all-powerful is He, all-blissful is He,
almighty is He who dwells on the highest level of evolution.
 What do we mean by saying He has an almighty nature ? Almighty
means having the power to do, be and understand everything. This
one supreme, personal Being would have a nervous system so highly
developed that His ability on every level of life would be unlimited.
His senses would be the most powerful senses, His mind the most
powerful mind, His intellect the most powerful intellect, His ego the
most powerful ego.
 When we see different levels of evolution in the strata of life
below the species of man right down to the inert, we can intellectually 
conceive of some stratum of evolution on the highest level of
creation where life will be perfect. Perfection of life would mean
that the senses, mind, intellect, ego and personality are perfect. Between 
this highest state of evolution where life is perfect and the lowest
state of evolution where life begins, lies the whole range of creation.
 So it is as if this supreme, almighty God controls the entire creation.
All the laws of nature are controlled by His will. He, being almighty,
has arranged the entire creation and the whole field of evolution to
operate automatically or, we could say, in complete harmony and
conformity with all the laws of creation. With the dissolution of
creation the almighty, personal God also merges into the impersonal,
absolute state of the Supreme, and with creation comes back again
to dwell on the highest level. This is how the personal God eternally
maintains the cycle of creation, evolution and dissolution.
 The whole field of relative existence is governed by the laws of
nature functioning automatically in a perfect rhythm. That rhythm,
that harmony of life, is maintained by the almighty will of the almighty 
God at the highest level of creation, controlling and commanding 
the entire process. He is God, the almighty He. Intellectually at
least we can hold Him to be the supreme Being. So we find that we
can understand intellectually the possibility of the existence of some
supreme Being in the form of a personal, almighty God.
 To have a clear conception of the almighty nature of a personal
God we should understand that the almighty nature lies in the perfection 
of the senses, mind, intellect and ego. When we say perfection 
of the senses we mean that if He has eyes, His eyes will be perfect 
in the sense that they will be able to see all things at one time.
If He has a nose, His nose will be able to smell all the varieties of
smells at one time. If He has ears, His ears will be able to hear all the
sounds of the entire cosmos at one time. His almighty mind will
naturally be aware of anything on any level at any time. His almighty
intellect will be able to decide everything at any moment. All the
innumerable decisions that are the apparent results of natural laws
in the process of evolution are the innumerable decisions of the almighty, 
personal, supreme God at the head of creation. He governs
and maintains the entire field of evolution and the separate lives of
innumerable beings in the whole cosmos.
 All we have said about a personal God we can understand intellectually, 
and we can see the possibility of such an almighty supreme
Being as the head of creation. If we can conceive of this, then we
should also be able to ascertain intellectually whether there could be
a means of communion with that almighty, supreme power, since the
life of the individual would greatly benefit from the blessings of such
communion. We can understand intellectually that if He or She is a
personal Being, certainly He or She would have a particular nature
 of His or Her own, and the way to achieve His or Her blessings would
 be to attune the individual life to His or Her nature. Such an attempt
would improve life at any level of creation. This would hasten the
progress of evolution and permit the individual life to arrive as
quickly as possible at the highest level of evolution. If the individual
can, by moulding his thought, speech and action in accordance with
the nature of the supreme God, succeed in attuning himself to Him
or Her, then certainly his unevolved, insignificant life will be blessed
with God's all-powerful, merciful nature. In this way the height of
evolution can be gained by any man.
 If the existence of the supreme, almighty, personal God cannot be
intellectually conceived of, it would appear to be the result of poor
understanding. Anyone who can see the inert or least evolved creation
at one end of exlstence and can recognise the different grades of
creation, should be able intellectually to conceive of an almighty,
supreme Being at the highest level of relative existence, and having
done so, to aspire to the great realisation.
 Inability to appreciate the conception of the personal God, and
inability to realise the personal God, are understandable. But to refute
the existence of the personal God can only be the result of an undeveloped 
state of mind.
 God is the holiest of holy words because it brings to consciousness
the supreme state of existence, the almighty status of the supreme
Being. It has been said that God-realisation is the aim of life. An individual 
at any level of evolution can be said to have God-realisation as
his ultimate goal, because if and when he is attuned to the almighty,
supreme Being, this will be a state of fulfilment and abundance,
unlimited energy, creativity, intelligence and bliss.
 We shall now see the possibility of God-realisation and analyse the
different ways to realisation of the impersonal and personal God.
 In our consideration of the two aspects of God - impersonal,
omnipresent, absolute Being and personal, supreme Being - we saw
that realisation of God could mean realisation of the impersonal God
or the personal God. We shall discuss the realisation of these two
aspects of God separately, because realisation of the impersonal God
will naturally be on the transcendental level of consciousness. Nothing
in the relative field can be omnipresent; relative means bound by
time, space and causation, and the omnipresent is unbounded.
 The realisation of the personal God, on the other hand, has to be
in the relative field of life, on the level of human perception, on the
level of sensory experience. Realisation of the personal God means
that the eyes should be able to see that supreme person and the heart
to feel His qualities. Thus the realisation of the impersonal God is in
transcendental consciousness and the realisation of the personal God
is on the level of sensory experience in the waking state.
 We saw that the nature of the impersonal God is transcendental,
absolute bliss-consciousness. To realise It our conscious minds must
transcend all the limits of relative experience and enter a field beyond
relative existence where the conscious mind remains conscious all
by itself. This necessitates realisation of the transcendental field. It is
necessary for the conscious mind to be brought from the present level
of experience to the subtler levels and eventually to transcend the
subtlest level and consciously arrive at the transcendental field of
existence. Let us consider how many possible ways could bring the
conscious mind to the field of transcendental Being.
 The machinery of the body or nervous system is the physical
mechanism through which the abstract mind experiences. For any
experience, the nervous system must adapt itself to certain specific
conditions. When a man sees, a particular part of his brain functions
in a particular manner. When he hears, thinks or smells, diffkrent
parts of his brain function for each activity. So according to the
activity in the mind a corresponding activity is set up in the nervous
system. To produce a particular experience in the mind, the nervous
system must be brought to a state of specific activity.
 Let us suppose that the mind is thinking of the sun. The thought
of the sun can be experienced only when a particular part of the brain
functions in a particular manner. This leads us to conclude that a
thought can be experienced by the mind in two ways. Either the mind
begins the process of thinking and stimulates the nervous system
until the particular portion of the brain comes to that level of activity
which makes the mind experience the thought of the sun; Or, if such
activity were produced in the brain physiologically, the mind would
experience the thought of the sun.
 Since a thought can be experienced in two ways, an experience
may occur in two ways. Either the mind begins the process and stimulates 
the nervous system for a particular experience, or else the
nervous system is stimulated so as to create an activity which will
enable the mind naturally to experience the desired object.
 The realisation of transcendental Being is an experience; therefore 
the realisation of the impersonal God must be a positive experience 
of transcendental reality. Realisation means experience. The
experience of transcendental reality establishes the nervous system in
a particulnr state. The experience of the transcendental, impersonal
God necessitates a particular condition of the nervous system. If this
activity in the nervous system could be produced by physiological
means, then this would be the physiological approach to realising
the impersonal God. We will see in detail how this could be possible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE FIVE PATHS
 Having established the possibility of a physiological path to God-realisation, 
we come tO the possibility of God-realisation through (I)
the process of understanding; (2) the process of feeling; (3) the process
of action or perception.
 Perception is also all action of the mind and can be called a mechanical 
process. In order to see something we just open the eyes and see.
To see, we do not need to stimulate the intellect or excite the emotions.
Thus the process of perception is simply a mechanical process which
does not include within its range any quality of emotion or intellect.
 So we come to five main approaches to realisation of the impersonal God:
 1. The psychological or intellectual approach.
 2. The emotional approach.
 3- The physiological approach.
 4. The mechanical approach.
 5. The psycho-physiological approach.

 Any one of these five paths to God-realisation would suffice for
any one man. The intellectual approach will only suit those who are
intellectually cultured and whose intellectual capacity is high. The
emotional approach will generally suit those whose qualities of heart
are highly developed. Those who are cultured neither emotionally
nor intellectually are left with two approaches to realisation; the
physiological and the mechanical. The psycho-physiological approach
is, as we shall see, a combination of the physical and mental.
 The physiological approach necessitates bringing the body and
nervous system to a state which will establish the mind on a level of
cognition of the transcendental nature of existence. The physiological
way will suit those people who are physiologically normal and whose
nervous systems are normal or almost normal. If their nervous systems
are normal, the physiological approach will raise their level of consciousness 
regardless of their intellectual or emotional culture. To
produce a particular state in the nervous system without training
the mind or heart will, however, require a great deal of sustained
physical or physiological training.
 The psycho-physiological approach is a way which will suit
people who would prefer to approach the question of God-realisation
from both the physical and mental angles, training the mind and body
simultaneously. The mechanical path, however, will suit any man no
matter how undeveloped may be his mind, heart or nervous system.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE INTELLECTUAL PATH TO GOD-REALISATlON
When considering the omnipresent state of the impersonal God we said that the transcendental, omnipresent Divine is, by virtue of Its omnipresence, the essential Being in everyone. It forms the basis of every life; Ie is nothing other than one's own Self or Being. Therefore no path for realising It can be conceived of. So to talk of a path to realisation of one's own Being seems unjustifiable. But because throughout our life our attention is directed to the outer, gross, relative field of experience, we are as though debarred from direct experience of the essential nature of our own Self. or transcendental Being. That is why it is necessary to raise the attention to the transcendental level of our Being. This raising of the attention is said to be a path to realisation. Thus we find that the idea of a path to realisation is metaphysically absurd but on a practical level highly significant.
 Discrimination, or the power of the intellect, is the vehicle which
enables a man to advance on the path of knowledge. The intellectual
approach to God-realisation is one of knowledge. On this path it is
mainly the intellect that functions; here the approached used on the
emotional path, the path of mechanical perception or the physiological 
path to realisation have no place. On this path everything must
be scrutinised and understood through discrimination based on logic;
everything must be exact and precise; the intellect has to be wide
awake. It is a very delicate path to realisation.
 Three steps are necessary on this path. First one must hear about
the nature of life from a realised man who has travelled this path.
One must delve deep into the nature of experiences of the world.
What one hears from the realised soul is that creation is perishable
and that everything is changing; the manifested creation of forms and
phenomena, bound by time, space and causation, is the perishable
aspect of life. Having heard this one must come to distinguish the
perishable aspect from the imperishable. This discrimination is the
second step. The third step is to assimilate this principle into practical
life.
 Discrimination between the different phases of life leads to the
conclusion that the whole of relative life is perishable and that the
imperishable, ultimate Reality underlies it. This is the significant understanding 
on the intellectual path of enlightenment. First one must
know that the world is not real, even though it appears to be. The
mind concludes that forms and phenomena are always changing and
that that which is always changing has no lasting status.
 On the sensory level, however, the world seems real enough.
But through the intellect we decide that because the world is everchanging 
it cannot be real; the real is that which is always the same.
But the world cannot be simply dismissed as unreal, because we do
experience it.
 We experience that a wall is here, a tree is there. We cannot say
that a tree is not there. If we say that a tree is unreal, we shall have to
say that it does not exist and we are not in a position to make such a
statement. We acknowledge that the tree is there but must also say
that it is always changing. Because it is always changing it is not real,
but because it is there we have for all practical purposes to credit the
tree with the status of existence.
 What is that status between real and unreal ? We call it phenomenal
existence. The phenomenon of the tree is there even though it is not
real. So the tree has a phenomenal reality. Ln Sanskrit this is called
mithya. The world is mithya, phenomenal, not really existing. The
conclusion is that the world is neither real nor unreal.
 A man possessing a strong, cultured mind analyses his life in the
world with discrimination and eventually comes to the conclusion
that the world is mithya, or only a phenomenon.
 The seeker, using discrimination in assessing the values of the
world, will eventually realise the perishable nature of the entire creation. 
Contemplation on the perishable nature of creation will begin
to take his mind to some deeper reality underlying the ever-changing
phase of existence.
 When he gains some insight into the reality of inner life he will
be able to contemplate the abstract metaphysical reality of imperishable
nature and to realise hidden secrets of existence which lie beyond the
ever-changing phenomenal phase of life.
 He sees that a tree has many aspects - trunk, branches, flowers
and fruit. The tree changes every day; new leaves come out, old
 leaves decay, branches fall and new ones grow. The whole existence
of the tree seems set in an ever-changing pattern. But behind these
ever-changing phenomenal phases there is one which does not
change; the nourishment, or sap, which is drawn from the root is
always the same. It is the sap which manifests as branches, leaves,
flowers and fruit. The different aspects of the tree change, but the
sap remains sap. The transformation of the sap into the different aspects
of the tree reveals the hidden mystery of nature.
 Beyond the ever-changing phases of phenomenal existence there
seems to be some reality of an unchanging character which gives rise
to all the changeable aspects of phenomenal creation. When his power
of discrimination reveals to the seeker the possibility of the existence
of some never-changing reality as the basis of ever-changing, phenomenal 
creation, he enters a second phase on the path of knowledge.
He is set to contemplate the never-changing, permanent phase of life,
the unchanging aspect of existence which is the reality.
 When he has thoroughly assimilated the idea of the impermanence
of creation and the phenomenal nature of the world, when his intellect 
is firmly established in the idea that the world is perishable,
ever-changing and phenomenal, then he begins to contemplate the
permanent, never-changing level of life.
 Analogies from the world of material creation, such as the example
of the sap in a tree, help the seeker to discover the metaphysical
truth which lies beyond the phenomenal phase of existence. Chemistry
tells us that beneath the phenomenal existence of water there is the
reality of oxygen and hydrogen. Water changes in its form, becoming 
vapour, snow and ice, but the essential constituents do not
undergo any change. The permanent value of oxygen and hydrogen
gives rise to various perishable values - water, snow and ice - everchanging 
values of differing forms and phenomena. This is a simple
example to indicate that, underlying the different levels of creation,
there is something which remains constant in its value even while on
the surface it continues to give rise to qualities of an ever-changing
nature.
 Contemplation on the inner value of life eventually reveals to the
aspirant that the ever-changing world is based on a never-changing
state of life devoid of form and phenomena. All forms and phenomena 
belong to the relative field of existence, and that which lies
beyond all forms and phenomena belongs necessarily to a field which
is out of relativity.
 Intellectual discrimination finds that the world has only a phenomenal 
existence but that a permanent element underlies the phenomcnal 
phases of life. This is how the seeker after God, treading the
intellectual path to enlightenment, finds his mind firmly established
in the impermanence of creation and the permanence of its transcendental 
nature. The intellect is thus able to come to a point where it
call appreciate the idea that the essential nature of transcendental
reality is permanent, never-changing, eternal and absolute. All that
remains is to attain realisation.
 Because he is on the intellectual path to realisation he tries to
ascertain again and again the reality of transcendental, absolute nature
which underlies the phenomenal existence of creation.
 As the practice of contemplation continues, his mind becomes more
and more established in eternal Being which grows increasingly
familiar to him. He begins to contemplate in terms of: I am That,
Thou art That and all this is That. This idea becomes so deeply rooted
in his consciousness that, with prolonged practice, this principle becomes 
part of him and he begins to live this understanding through
all the experiences of daily life.
 When he can fix his understanding in the oneness of life his mind
begins to be held in this oneness even in the midst of all the diverse
experiences of daily life. A state of mind is created which is as if he
were deeply hypnotised by the idea: I am That, thou art That and
all this is That. His consciousness is captured by the idea of the oneness
of life, and the obvious diversity of existence and phenomenal creation 
begins to co-exist with this oneness. This is the beginning of the
experience of transcendental reality on the level of intellectual understanding.
 So the first step on the intellectual path to God-realisation is discrimination between the real and the unreal and contemplation on the transient, futile, ever-changing, perishable nature of the world.
 The second step is to contemplate on the oneness and the eternal features of the never-changing existence which lies at the basis of all the ever-changing phases of life.
 The third step is to live this principle in practical life through the
practice of establishing in the depths of consciousness the oneness of
eternal life in terms of the first person, second person and third person: 
I am That, thou art That and all this is That.
 This path of enlightenment is, we could say, a path of self-hypnotism. 
Discrimination in assessing ever-changing, phenomenal existence
while trying to locate an unchanging underlying feature is one thing ;
attempting to associate one's Being with the cosmic Being is another.
This is the intellectual path of enlightenment where only the intellect
functions. Unless the understanding of the oneness of life goes deep
in consciousness and begins to be lived in the midst of all the multiple,
diverse experience and activity of life, it will not become a state of
realisation. Therefore the aspirant on the intellectual path of realisation 
understands, assimilates and tries to live the unchanging, imperishable 
oneness of absolute Being in terms of his own Being.
 The idea of the oneness of life goes so deep in the aspirant's consciousness 
that the association of his mind with the experiences of the
wakeful state, the dreaming state and the deep sleep state do not weaken 
the conviction that he is himself imperishable, unchanging, eternal, 
absolute Being. When this becomes fixed in the consciousness, he
begins to live that oneness of life through all the diversity of the wakeful, 
dreaming and sleeping states. When he rises to a state of eternal
Being, while yet remaining in the field of relative experience, then is
his consciousness complete, then is his life fully realised. This is realisation 
of the omnipresent, impersonal God by way of the intellectual
path.
 The nature of this path is such that it cultures the mind so that it
gradually loses interest in the experiences of practical day-to-day life.
Such a mind is by nature contemplative. It is first engaged in thinking
in terms of the negation of creation, of the futility and the evanescent, 
perishable nature of phenomenal existence, and secondly in
contemplating the imperishable nature which lies behind the obvious
phases of life. The mind is always thinking and contemplating, trying
to distinguish transcendental reality from the perishable outer world,
and in trying to live this reality it loses the charm of the outer world.
Such a mind necessarily becomes divorced from practical life; therefore 
the intellectual path to God-realisation through contemplation is
certainly not a path for practical men. It is not a path for the householder. 
No man remaining active in the world, bearing the responsibilities 
of family and society and the pressure of business, can possibly 
succeed in infusing the divine nature into his mind through this
method of contemplation. This intellectual path of divine revelation
suits those who have nothing to do with practical life, who have kept
themselves apart from the responsibilities of life, who have shunned
business activities and chosen the way of a recluse. The silence which
a recluse enjoys is such as to keep him away from work. He spends
most of the time in silence, contemplating, discriminating and assimilating 
the divine nature as his own. Only the aspirant who leads
this secluded type of contemplative life can succeed in realisation by
the path of contemplation.
 Take, for example, a man who keeps repeating: I am a king, I am
a king. By concentrating on being a king he could eventually produce
within himself a state of mind in which, even when walking in the
street, he would continue to feel that he was a king. So firm and
convincing a state could be created that even if he had to beg in the
street he would continue to feel within himself that he was a king.
In this way, irrespective of circumstances or surroundings, he could
create a state of mind in which he would always feel that he was a king.
 Such is the state of the contemplative seeker after truth who
treads the intellectual path to realisation. It is important to note that
success in this type of contemplation depends on long devotion
to this path. If a man has much time at his disposal to dwell on the idea that he is a king, then it will be possible for him to establish deep in his consciousness the feeling that he is a king. But if he does not have time for lengthy contemplation on the idea of being a king, the idea will not become firmly rooted in his mind.
 In order to establish oneself in the oneness of life through contemplation  it is necessary to be contemplative for most of one's life. Much
time is needed for the aspirant to be established in the idea of the one-ness
and permanence of life. This is certainly not the path of a house 
holder because a householder has responsibilities on many levels.
 This type of contemplation will either result in the householder re 
signing from the responsibilities of his way of life or will make him irresponsible. The carrying out of responsibility requires attention and devotion to work and this type of contemplation requires negation and abstinence from work.
 The practice of Raja Yoga, being accomplished through contemplation, 
belongs to this type of intellectual approach to God-realisation. 
This is certainly not the way of an ordinary householder. For
God-realisation the householder needs a path through action and not
through contemplation. It is impractical for a man of the world, with
the responsibilities of family life and social obligations, to think of
everything in terms of evanescence, futility and impermanence. The
intellectual method of discrimination, when practised while living
all active life in the world, results in a state of divided mind which
disturbs the co-ordination of the mind and nervous system and thus
prevents the possibility of any development in higher consciousness.
 For centuries past many seekers of enlightenment have unfortunately, 
been victims of this state which results in failure in the
world as well as failure in the divine quest. True enlightenment through
the intellectual path means intellectually rising above the field of the
intellect and arriving at the field of transcendental, divine consciousness. 
This necessitates bringing the conscious mind to the transcendental 
reality of Being. No kind of intellectual mood-making can
succeed in bringing anyone to this level of consciousness.
 So it is clear that complete God-realisation is not possible merely
by the process of intellectual discrimination and understanding without
the actual experience of transcendental Being. Direct experience of
the Absolute not only reveals the nature of the supreme reality or
God, but also enlightens the intellect, enabling it to hold an unmistakably 
clear understanding about lt. This is the reason why those who
are traditionally initiated into the path of intellectual understanding,
into the recluse way of life, are necessarily initiated into the practice
of transcendental meditation. Those who try to follow the path of
intellectual realisation through reading books remain in the field of
mood-making without the joy of bliss-consciousness - the main
blessing of the realisation of God.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE EMOTIONAL PATH TO GOD-REALISATION: THE PATH OF DEVOTION
 The path of devotion proceeds by the qualities of the heart. All
paths of devotion are emotional paths to God-realisation. The qualities 
of the heart are the qualities which enable a man to feel. They
differ from the qualities of the mind which enable a man to think
and understand.
On the intellectual path to God-realisation the predominant factor
is knowing and understanding. Here, on the path of devotion, the
main factor is feeling. The feeling of love is the vehicle which enables
a man to advance on this path. Love, emotion, happiness, kindness
and surrender are the qualities of heart which sustain the path of devotion. 
Love increases and as it progresses it leaves behind the fields
of lesser happiness and gains ground in more stable and valuable
regions of happiness. The path of devotion is a path of happiness, a
path of love, the path through the qualities of the heart.
 Love of God is the greatest virtue that a man can ever cultivate;
through this develops love for the creation of God, for the children
of God. Kindness, compassion, tolerance and helpfulness to others
emanate from the heart in which the love of God grows.
 Fortunate are those whose hearts melt in love of God, who feel
abundance in love and devotion to God, whose hearts flow and
overflow with His remembrance, with the name of God. Fortunate
are those whose life is dedicated to almighty God and to the good of
His creation. Increased devotion means increased love, and this
brings with it increased happiness, contentment, glory and grace.
 A man on the path of devotion finds himself increasingly aware
of ever greater degrees of happiness. The path of love is like the
relationship between a child and the heart of his mother. As the child
takes his first step towards his mother her heart swells. Her happiness
radiates and reflects on the child, so that at each step he enjoys greater
happiness, and this again reflects in the heart of the mother. The
mother's joy increases and reaches its height when the child arrives
in her arms and finds himself one with his mother's heart.
 As love increases in his heart the devotee gains a greater degree of
happiness. His heart finds its goal when his love rests in the eternal
existence of God. The devotee and God become one. The drop of
water finds itself in the fullness of the ocean and the two unite. The
unity is complete, and in its fullness the unity alone is. Here is the
one leaving no trace of the other. The two are there no more; the
path of union is extinct and only the union stands.
 The lover of God is drowned in the ocean of His love, and God
is drowned also in the ocean of the lover's love. This is the great
union in all its simplicity. There is no discrimination, no elimination,
no negation; there is no understanding. The path of love is the path
of blinding bliss. On the path of love there is only one direction:
from the field of lesser happiness to a field of greater happiness.
 The river of love flows down the steep slope of God-consciousness. 
It runs rapidly and quickly loses itself, and in losing itself attains
the unbounded status of the ocean of love. Loss is a victory on the path
of love. It is a blessed loss which marks the gain of fulfilment in life.
Blessed are those who lose themselves in this path of love, and more
blessed yet are those who lose the path as well and gain the goal and
live it.
 The beauty of this path is that the loss of the self is incurred for
the sake of love. The lover knows only how to lose, and this process
of losing has no motive of gain. He only knows himself to be without
any aim. The love begins and he accepts it as it comes, and as it comes
it increases. He keeps losing himself but does not know that he is
losing himself, does not even know when he is completely lost. For
when he is lost he is God; or rather, it is not that he is God but that
God is God. Oneness of God-consciousness, one eternal existence,
oneness of eternal life, oneness of absolute Being; only the One remains. 
Then the varieties of life are like the varieties of waves on the
eternal ocean of the love of God.
 The multiplicity of life finds itself in the oneness of God-consciousness. 
The many forms and phenomena of the world around are like
ripples and waves, a mirage which only appears to exist in the unbounded 
existence of God. The waves of love rise on the surface
of life simply that life may be felt and known and lived in its variety ;
so that the path of love may continue to be found on the surface of
life and that love may continue for everyone who comes into life;
so that the lovers of life may find life in losing it and find God in
losing themselves in God-consciousness.
 All this is in order that again and again devotees may continue
to need and find God, and God may continue to descend on the devotees 
and rest in them, and the devotees may continue to rest and
live in God. The path to God, the path of love, leads in one direction
only; from lesser degrees of happiness to greater degrees of bliss and to
bliss eternal; from lesser degrees of intelligence to absolute, eternal
intelligence.
 To speak of the increase of intelligence on the path of love seems
inconsistent, because love is a quality of the heart and has little to do
with intelligence. It does not seem reasonable to say that intelligence
grows as love grows. With an increase of love the light of God
increases and becomes the light of love. The light of God increases and
through it intelligence and all which rests on it are nourished. Yet no
place is left for intelligence because everything is conquered by the
 great influx of love. Not that intelligence is annihilated; it is only as
if the light of intelligence merges into the light of love, the light of
life. As the different colours of the spectrum merge together to give
rise to a powerful beam of white light, so the light of intelligence,
happiness and creativity unite to produce a forceful stream of love.
 The light of love is the blinding light of love alone, and the greatness 
of intelligence and power and all else is present there, but in
latent form. They are all lost in the light of love; not actually lost:
it is as if their identities are forgotten in the love of God. Love and
intelligence, power and intelligence, and all the variety and vanity
of life merge in the oneness of God, leaving God in the love of the
devotee and the devotee merged in the ocean of God's love. All the
qualities of life and the manifold forms of phenomenal existence sink,
to leave the fresh waters of eternal life full in the ocean of God-consciousness.
 On the path of love the variety of the universe finds fulfilment in
the unity of God. In love God is found in the world and the world is
found in God. And for the glory of God to be experienced happiness
must increase. For what is there on the surface of life that can increase
happiness? The attention has to go to the finer fields of life, the subtler
levels of creation, the deeper levels of consciousness. Bringing attention 
to the deeper levels of consciousness is the key to experiencing
greater happiness. This is the principle of transcendental meditation.
This is what brings fulfilment to the path of love. The path of devotion 
without the practice of transcendental meditation, without
greater experience of greatest happiness, remains unpractical.
 Transcendental meditation fills the heart of man with great happiness; 
the heart feels completely filled. The practice of this meditation 
increases the ability to experience greater happiness in the heart,
and so enables the devotee to continue even while he feels the fullness
of eternal bliss, not ceasing until the ocean of love is full of absolute
glory in grace and overflowing into everything in creation. Meditation
makes absolute love a real, significant, personal experience in whatever 
is experienced in that eternal state of God-consciousness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE PHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO GOD-REALISATION
 It may seem strange to speak of a physiological approach to God-realisation. 
But we belong to a scientific age, and to explore the paths
to God-realisation we should explore them from all sides.
 The physical universe of multiple experiences is before us. Can
there be a physical means to God-realisation? Can the physical plane
provide a means to rise to cosmic consciousness. Can the physical
plane provide a means to rise to the fulfilment of life? How can we
produce a state of all tranquillity in the midst of all activity? How
can we reach that pinnacle of human development from the physical
side of life?
 To understand how this is possible we should know that the state
of divine existence, divine life, or God-realisation, is a state of positive
experience. It is all experience, not a fanciful thought; it is not a
mood, neither is it on the thinking level. It is a positive experience of
life. It is the state of life, it is Being.
 For any experience a specific activity must be created in the nervous
system. The nervous system must be set in a particular order. The
machinery of the nervous system must reach a specific condition to
give rise to a specific experience. If we hear a word, hearing it is the
result of some activity in the nervous system, and this activity is
responsible for providing the experience of the word. If we see a
flower and its image passes through the retina of the eye to the mind,
there is a highly complicated activity in the nervous system which
gives rise to the perception of the flower. If we smell something,
some activity in a specific part of the nervous system produces the
particular experience of smelling. If we touch something, the experience 
of touch produces a particular activity in that part of the nervous 
system which gives the experience. So whatever the experience,
it is based on a particular activity of the nervous system.
 Those who meditate know that during meditation they experience
the subtle states of thought. To experience a very subtle state of thought
there must be a correspondingly subtle activity in a more sensitive
 region of the nervous system. When the thought has been transcended
and the mind reaches the transcendental state, it arrives at a state of
 suspension and silence and gains the full awareness of pure consciousness. 
This is a positive experience. Although it is not an experience
of any outside object, it is an experience of its own kind where the
experiencer is left by himself. This is the state of pure consciousness,
the experience of pure Being. The experience of pure Being and the
state of Being mean the same thing.
 For this experience to be possible there must be a particular condition 
in the nervous system, a particular state of poised alertness where
the nervous system is not passive. It is active but has no activity
because there is no experience of any object. This is not the usual
condition of the brain during the wakeful, dreaming or sleeping
states.
 When the thought is experienced during meditation, a particular
condition is created in the functioning of the brain mechanism. At
each level of subtle experience of the thought the brain functions at
an appropriate level of activity. In the state of transcending there is a
specific state of the brain mechanism which gives rise to the experience 
of transcendental pure consciousness. This particular state of the
brain mechanism is arrived at by the process of experiencing progressively 
subtle states of thought, that is, through the agency of the mind.
 This is dlc mental approach to God-realisation. The mind is
brought from experience to experience, progressing from an experience 
of a gross nature to an experience of a subtle nature, finally
reaching the particular experience of the transcendental state.
 When the body functions for a long time the nervous system becomes 
tired and sleep follows. This fatigue is a physical state of the
nervous system brought about through continuous functioning
without rest until a state is reached which fails to give rise to any
experience.
 In some way it should be possible to create physically a particular
state of the nervous system which would correspond to that state
which is responsible for the creation of transcendental consciousness.
Just as when the nervous system is tired a state is created in which
the brain does not experience anything, so it should be possible by
physically stimulating the nervous system to create transcendental
consciousness.
 If this is possible it will constitute a physiological approach to
God-realisation.
 In Hatha Yoga we find a system which has existed since ancient
times in India: a physiological approach to God-realisation whereby
the nervous system is brought to a state which causes the brain to
function in a particular manner. In this condition the brain enables
the mind to gain transcendental consciousness.
 During sleeping, dreaming, waking and through all experiences
breathing continues and the brain continues to function; this causes
incessant activity in the body. We have seen that to create transcendental
consciousness the activity of the brain must cease, but the brain
must not be allowed to become static. The brain is held in a. suspended
state of activity yet is not passive. It is alert without activity. If the
brain is to be held like this in a state of suspension, then the entire
functioning of the nervous system must be held in a particular state
of neither activity nor inactivity. For this to be possible the breath
must be held in a state of neither breathing out nor breathing in. The
breath must be between flowing and not flowing, and must be suspended
there.
 To bring the functioning of the nervous system to that state of
suspension the body must be trained because its habit has been either
to remain active in the waking state or to be inactive in the sleeping
state; these are the normal conditions of the body. It must, therefore,
be trained to be still, yet not to enter a passive state.
 When the body is functioning normally the general experience is
one of being either awake or asleep. To some extent we are aware
when sleep comes for increasing dullness overtakes us. The ability to
experience becomes less, and we do not know when sleep actually
comes. We do feel when we are about to sleep, and we do feel that
our consciousness becomes gradually fainter, and then we do not
feel anything. Consciousness fades to nil, but we do not experience the
final fading of consciousness. This shows that the body or the mind
is not completely normal. If the whole nervous system were normal,
then we should be able to experience pure awareness, that state of
awareness which is almost one with deep sleep and at the same time
almost one with the subtlest state of the waking state.
 It is as if our constant subjection to outer experiences had set a
pattern to the system. Normally we should experience the start of a
thought. This should be our normal experience if the body is perfectly 
pure, that is, if the brain is physically perfectly pure. To be
physically pure means that it must be free from dullness and tension.
 In our ordinary state of mind when a thought arises the mind is
overshadowed. The mind is then engaged with that thought. When
the thought is transformed into action and its purpose achieved, the
desire is fulfilled. If we want to smell a flower the thought arises, and
when it reaches the conscious level our mind tells the hand to grasp
the flower, bring it to the nose and we smell the flower. Now the desire
to smell the flower is complete, that is, the desire has come to an end.
 If the brain is functioning normally, once the desire is fulfilled and
before another desire arises, the mind will experience the state of pure
Being, or pure consciousness. This is what happens in a realised man
when he experiences a desire. When one desire is fulfilled and before
another desire arises, he enjoys the natural state of Being. This is
because there is no activity in the brain. Being free from activity the
brain does not enter a state of passivity. It cherishes the state of Being,
or pure consciousness.
 Between two thoughts is the state of pure Being. Every thought
arises from the state of pure Being, and between two thoughts there
is a gap. The gap should not be a gap containing no experience. If the
brain is functioning normally, if the mind and nervous system are
 pure, then between every two thoughts a state of Being will be
experienced. This, however, is not generally the case.
 When we become tired the mind becomes dull and ceases to function.
The inability of the brain to function is the result of impurity.
This may be due to physical reasons. Alcohol, for example, affects
the brain and causes dullness of mind. The effects of activity also make
the mind tired and dull and so exhaust the nervous system that the
mind is unable to experience even the gross, let alone the subtle.
 The ability of the nervous system to cognise extra subtle states of
experience is marred through contamination of the brain matter by
impure physical matter, through fatigue or through wrong thinking,
all of which exhaust mental energy. Fatigue is the main factor. It does
not allow the mind to experience subtleties. Wrong food also can
make the mind dull, put one to sleep or make one irritated. We eat
and drink, and whatever we eat or drink may contain some impure
element which affects the mind.
 If a material factor can influence the mind to become dull, then a
material factor can influence the mind to become sharp. If exhaustion
can make the mind dull and produce sleep, then freshness and energy
can revive the mind and make it alert.
 The physiological approach is meant to remove from the nerVOus
system the physical conditions which cause dullness. It therefore
attacks the impurity in the body and the reason for fatigue. We want
to purify the nervous system to such an extent that this will eventually
create the exact condition in the nervous system which will give rise
to the state of transcendental consciousness. Therefore we create such
a physical state in the nervous system as to cause the body to be in
its most normal condition.
 The human nervous system is perfect because it has the ability to
gain transcendental consciousness. But consuming wrong food and
drink and breathing poor air cause the system to become physically
unfit to attain transcendental consciousness. Thus we find that
the physiological approach to divine consciousness consists of (1)
choosing the right quality of food; (2) choosing the right type of
activity; (3) eliminating from the system the influence of wrong food
and wrong activity.
 All this naturally requires much discipline at all levels of life. Therefore 
such an approach is suitable only for those who lead a hermit's
life. Only they can afford to spend the required time under the personal 
supervision of a teacher. It is certainly not the path of the householder 
whose pattern of life is such that he cannot make use of laborious 
and time-consuming practices. There are, however, other ways
to enlightenment more suitable to the modern householder.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO GOD-REALISATION
 The psycho-physiological approach to God-realisation, as the name
implies, involves the simultaneous use of the body and mind.
 We have seem how the body and mind are closely interrelated.
The state of the mind directly effects the body and the state of the
body influences the mind.
 In describing the physiological approach to God-realisation we
saw that by culturing the body and breath a state of restful alertness
can be created in the nervous system so that the individual may
experience Being. This brings the hope of accelerating progress on
any path to God-realisation, intellectual or emotional, by supplementing 
it with a physiological approach.
 This combination of the physiological with the intellectual or emotional 
paths constitutes the psycho-physiological path to God-realisation .
 It may be said that the main feature of the psycho-physiological
path is the culture of the body and mind to produce simultaneously
the state of transcendental consciousness in the mind and a state of
restful alertness in the body. The purpose is to provide help from the
physical plane in culturing the mind and from the mental plane in
culturing the body. The sole intention is to arrive at the goal with
greater ease in the shortest time.
 Seen from this point of view the psycho-physiological approach
seems fascinating because there is no lover of God, or seeker after
truth, who would not be lured to follow the path offering greater
ease and more rapid realisation. But as has already been made clear,
the physiological path necessitating rigorous practices of physical
control and breath control is not suitable to the householder's way of
life. So, in spite of its scope, the psycho-physiological path cannot be
a universal one.
 As we have seen, culturing the body and the breath needs close
personal supervision by a teacher if the health of the aspirant is to be
safeguarded. There are, however, some light exercises for breathing
and for the body which may be practised as an accompaniment to the
intellectual or emotional paths, and which do not require strict personal 
supervision. These would certainly help to accelerate progress
on these paths.
 The psycho-physiological path to God-realisation, however, finds
fulfilment in the practice of transcendental meditation, which simultaneously 
influences the body and the mind. Without control of
ally kind on any level, it automatically places the mind in the state
of transcendental consciousness and brings the body and the nervous
system to that condition of restful alertness which is essential to the
state of enlightenment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE MECHANICAL PATH TO GOD-REALISATION
 It is unusual to conceive of a path to God-realisation proceeding and
succeeding in a mechanical way. But a close scrutiny of the process
of perception will reveal that God-realisation is indeed possible in
a mechanical way.
 Perception is the result of the natural radiation of consciousness
from the centre of pure Being in man to the object perceived. An
example will illustrate this.
 The current from a battery cell reaches the bulb and projects as a
beam of light. As the light proceeds, its strength diminishes until
eventually a limit is reached where the light may be said to be nil.
Likewise, from the inexhaustible energy of Being, consciousness
radiates through the nervous system, reaches the senses of perception
and passes to the object of experience. As it radiates outwards the
content of consciousness, the degree of bliss, diminishes. The whole
process is automatic and mechanical.
 The nervous system is the means by which consciousness manifests
and projects itself into the outside world, giving the phenomenon of
perception.
 The process of perception is both mechanical and automatic. To
see an objeCt we have only to open our eyes and sight of the object
comes automatically without the use of intellect or emotions. For
perception to take place it is not necessary to involve intellect or emotions. 
This is what is meant by the statement that perception is mechanical.
 The radiation of consciousness starts from the abstract, absolute,
pure state of bliss and carries the bliss in a diminishing degree as it
proceeds outwards. The oneness of Being, appearing in its infinite
variety of creation, is an automatic projection of consciousness.
 So perception in the outer world results mechanically from the
diverging process of consciousness. The degree of bliss decreases as
we proceed to the outer gross levels of experience and increases as we
move inwards towards the subtler levels approaching the source, the
Being. So whether we experience on the levels of outward projecting
consciousness, or on the levels of inward projecting consciousness, the
process of perception remains both mechanical and automatic. Perception 
remains automatic whether it is directed outwards or inwards; 
whether it is perception of the gross or the subtle fields of life
or perception of the transcendental state of Being. This is how realisation 
of Being is possible on the plane of mechanical perception. This
justifies the mechanical process of perception as a means to God-realisation.
 We shall now analyse the process of perception which brings about
this realisation.
 The process of perception of the outer world begins in the unmanifested 
field of pure consciousness and is carried through the instrumentality 
of the mind and nervous system to the manifested field of
gross creation. This means that the process of perception is the result
of the inner consciousness projecting outwards. If, however, the state
of pure consciousness is sought, it will be necessary for this process of
perception to be reversed. The consciousness must be gathered from
the outer gross field and directed inwards. The perception of pure
Being, therefore, necessitates stopping gross activity and appreciating
instead successive stages of diminishing activity until the least activity 
can be appreciated and transcended. This gives rise to the state
of pure consciousness, or the perception of transcendental Being.
 The appreciation of activity from the gross outer to the subtle
inner levels of perception is obviously the path in the inward direction. 
Whether perception is outward or inward it is automatic and
mechanical. Perception in the outward direction is the result of a progressive 
increase of activity in the nervous system; perception in the
inward direction is the result of diminishing activity until the nervous
system ceases to function and reaches a state of stillness, a state of restful 
alertness. This is the state described in the words: Be still and
know that I am God.
 This stillness is achieved ideally when activity in the nervous system 
is brought to that state of restful alertness where even the mind's
activity is reduced to nil, where the thinking process has been reduced
to a point at the source of thinking. At this point perception remains
in a state of absolute consciousness, the state of enlightenment is
gained and absolute transcendental Being comes to be on the conscious
level of life; or the conscious level of the mind reaches the transcendental 
level of Being.
 The inward movement of the mind brings it mechanically to a
state of full enlightenment. This mechanical process of perception in
the inward direction causes the nervous system to arrive naturally at
the state of restful alertness, and is the mechanical path to God-realisation. 
In its practical form it is known as transcendental meditation 
It is called a mechanical path to indicate that the process of inward 
perception is innocent and does not need intellectual or emotional 
help. It does not proceed through discrimination or feeling. This
mechanical path of perception succeeds independently without intellectual 
or emotional interference.
 The activity of the mind in the inward direction brings it to the
field of the transcendental Absolute and fills it with the power of
eternal Being. Then, as the mind moves outwards again, its activity
brings the light of transcendental, absolute Being into the outer world,
thereby increasing the intensity of bliss in the perception of the gross,
manifested fields of creation.
 This is how the innocent path of mechanical perception quietly
serves to take the mind to transcendental, absolute Being, or to take
man to the field of God and from there to bring him out with the
glory of God to brighten all fields of his life in the world.
 This explains the high significance of action and justifies its status
as a path to enlightenment. This innocent, natural, simple process of
perception and experience from the outer gross to the inner subtle
and on to the Transcendent, and from there returning outwards
to the gross, comprises the path of action for enlightenment.
 The mechanical path of perception succeeds in harmonising the
values of eternal Being with the transitory field of activity in the world.
Because the realisation of Being entails inward perception, and because 
infusion of Being in outward activity entails outward perception, 
we find that it is the glory of mechanical perception which fills
the whole field of life with the glory of divine Being and brings
individual life to a state of cosmic consciousness. This is how we find
that the mechanical path to God-realisation lies in the simple process
of inward and outward perception.
 Therefore any man is capable of realising God by this path, irrespective 
of his intellectual or emotional state of development. It is
only necessary to know how to use one's ability to experience, and
this knowledge opens the highway to God-realisation.
 The mechanical path to God-realisation as found in transcendental
meditation is so simple and comprehensive in its results that it attracts
all lovers of God and seekers after truth proceeding on any of the
paths to God-realisation, intellectual, emotional, physiological or
psycho-physiological. It is so graceful that anyone treading any path
in life will find it comforting and elevating. It supports and strengthens
any path to fulfilment, any path to the great goal of God-realisation.
 Generation after generation man is born anew. Each generation
 gives rise to new aspirations in life, new standards of thought and
 action, and brings a new quest for fulfilment. It may be that each man
 in his generation has aspirations in common with those around him,
 but they are his own new aspirations to bring fulfilment to his life.
 Each man needs sound physical and mental health, greater ability
in action, a greater capacity to think clearly, increased efficiency in
work and more loving and rewarding relationships with others. He
needs freedom from suffering and misfortunes ;l day-to-day living.
He needs enough intelligence and vitality to satisfy the desires of his
mind and bring contentment to his life. In addition to all these things
man should have a life of permanent freedom in God-consciousness.
 We have seen that all this can be gained by the regular practice
of transcendental meditation. Regularity in practice and simplicity and
innocent natural behaviour towards others will accomplish all this in
the individual life. Therefore a strong and effective system must be
created so that each man in the world may receive the technique
of transcendental meditation. He will then fulfil his own purpose
and create an atmosphere conducive to the fulfilment of the lives of
others.
 A solid foundation should be established for all generations of
men to gain fulfilment in life at all levels. The responsibility lies on the
shoulders of the great-hearted and intelligent leaders of the present
generation.
 In order to formulate all effective plan for the emancipation of the
entire human race generation after generation, we must give primary
consideration to the factor of purity. Purity is life. Absolute purity
is eternal life. Surival depends upon purity. At the root of the plan
should be purity.
 When we speak of purity let us make it clear that in the state of
highest evolution, in the field of cosmic consciousness, when the mind
receives the fullest infusion of absolute Being, then by nature it functions
on the plane of purity in accordance with all the natural laws.
which carry out the eternal process of evolution in creation.
 Any system of life which is based on the natural evolution of
creation will certainly survive through the age because evolution is
the process which conducts the march of time through the changing
conditions of all life.
 The sole purpose of the plan should be to maintain continuity
and purity in the teaching of transcendental meditation.
 In view of these considerations such a plan should contain the following
points:
 1. In order that the teaching of transcendental meditation may be
imparted on the level of the, laws of nature governing the process of
evolution, it is necessary for the teachers who impart this knowledge
to be established on the plane of cosmic law, or at least to be working
sincerely towards this end in their own lives.
 For this it is necessary to provide special facilities which will
ensure that the teachers of meditation are trained thoroughly in the
practice and understanding of its principles.
 An Academy of Meditation has been built in the foothills of the 
Himalayas on the bank of the holy river Ganges, where people from
all over the world can be trained under conditions ideal for meditation.
The plan should include the building of similar academies in every
country.
 2. For teaching to be imparted to every man on the level of his
evolution it must be imparted according to his natural tendencies.
Natural inclinations should not be disturbed because they are the path
of a man's evolution. The teaching should allow people to be what
they are, allow them to do what they like and not to do what they do
not like. If the teaching is such as to bring fulfilment of a man's
desires, then it will not only be readily accepted but will certainly
bring greater momentum to his path of evolution. The technique for
imparting transcendental meditation lies in discovering what are a
man's aspirations, what he wants to accomplish and what his desires
are, and then telling him of the gains from transcendental meditation
in terms of his desires, needs and aspirations.
 If transcendental meditation is taught in relation to each individual's
aspirations, then it will be in accordance wild the level of his evolution
and will regulate his life in conformity with natural laws. The whole:
stream of his life will begin to flow in accord with the eternally progressive 
rhythm of nature. The harmony of his life will become the
eternal harmony of nature.
 3. The purity of the system must be maintained at all costs from
generation to generation because the effect of the teaching depends upon
its purity. For this it is necessary to train the teachers thoroughly in the
practice and theory of transcendental meditation so that the purity
of the system is engrained in their hearts and the teaching is passed
on to others in its pure state. To maintain the purity of the system it is
also most necessary for organisations to have their own premises.
Centres of transcendental meditation, temples of human evolution,
should be constructed everywhere in the world so that dedicated
teachers may work with ease and maintain the purity of the teaching.
 Moreover, the history of different religions shows that it is the
temples, churches, mosques and pagodas which have provided a centre
for teaching the wisdom of their religions. If it were not for these
great edifices the message would long ago have been lost. Certainly
the structures themselves do not have any significance in maintaining
the purity of the tradition, but they are a strong safeguard. It is not
the buildings which carry on the message but they are fixed places
from which the message is given to all generations.
 4. To maintain the teaching for all time, it is also necessary for the
practice of this meditation to be made an integral part of daily routine. 
It should fall into the pattern of life, it should be a way of life
so that every man always lives in harmony and the world is glorified.
To bring such joy to living it is only necessary to ensure that everyone
in the coming generation is cultured in the science of being and the
art of living. The only direct way is to introduce this teaching into
the field of education, so that no man enters the world of responsibility 
without the technique of integrated life. Every educational institution 
should have a meditation centre.
 But to build meditation centres only in the colleges and universities 
will not suffice: sanctuaries of silence should be constructed in the
midst of the noisy centres of big cities, so that before going to work
and after leaving it people may spend a short time in silent meditation 
rooms and, diving deep within themselves, profit from undisturbed 
and regular meditations.
 Such centres should also be constructed in holiday resorts where
people go at week-ends. There they may have long hours of meditation 
and return home renewed in spirit, intelligence and energy.
 The practical realisation of this plan for the emancipation of all
mankind generation after generation requires the construction of a
world centre for training spiritual leaders and the construction of
silent meditation rooms in colleges and universities, in the business
areas of cities and at holiday resorts.
 It is hoped that lovers of life and well-wishers of humanity will
come forward to begin the building of these meditation centres. If
and when in the passage of time the right understanding of the teaching 
becomes obscured through being mixed with other ideologies and
the teachers fail to produce beneficial effects in society, then these permanent 
buildings will stand as symbols of the message. Although unable to
carry the message effectively, they will speak silently, from generation
to generation, of the existence of a simple way to liberate mankind.
 A building serves as the home of an ideology. Both body and spirit
are needed to make all effective personality. Without the body the
spirit will not be found, and without the spirit the body cannot function. 
So the spirit of the message will be in the evolved state of consciousness 
of the teachers and the purity of the system; the body of the
message will be those buildings and books which will endure and
help to preserve its spirit.
 5-If the teaching is to be maintained from one generation to
another it should accord with the general tendency of each generation. 
The level of understanding and tendencies change from time to
time. The teaching must maintain its integrity at all times and yet
accommodate itself to all changes.
 There was a time when religion guided the destiny of man, but
when the message of religion failed to provide a means of peace and
inner harmony or a direct way to God-realisation, people lost faith.
History shows that when religion is reduced to ritual and dogma alone
the human mind, in its attempt to find a true understanding of life,
turns to philosophy, the quest for truth on an intellectual basis.
Dogmatic religions lose their importance and naturally fade into the
background of people's lives.
 Until about fifty or a hundred years ago religion held sway over
the consciousness of people in general. When religion lost its hold,
metaphysical movements or the comparative study of different religions 
became predominant. When, in spite of all its endeavours
to describe reality, metaphysics could offer no practical formula for
the realisation of abstract, metaphysical truth, the human mind needed
to turn to something else.
 The study of philosophy remained the interest of some, but mass
consciousness turned to political awakening. With the spread of the
democratic ideology, mass consciousness was caught up in day-to-day
political events all over the world. In a democracy each man has a
political responsibility and this draws political consciousness into his
life. As democratic governments became more widespread political
consciousness began to dominate life. People looked to politics for the
fulfilment of life. Politics can never provide an adequate formula for
the fulfilment of individual life. Today politics seem to dominate
mass consciousness. Anything that happens in the field of politics receives
wide publicity, is talked about and attracts the attention of all nations.
But times are changing fast, and the day is not far off when political
consciousness will be replaced by economic consciousness. Economists
are already influencing the direction of politicians in most countries.
 The teaching of transcendental meditation should accord with the
consciousness of the masses at any particular time. In view of the
changing phases of mass consciousness it follows that the level of the
teaching of transcendental meditation should not be rigid or restricted. 
The policy of its propagation should accept changes in the level
of consciousness at any time so that it can be imparted easily to every
man of each generation.
 When religion dominates mass consciousness, transcendental meditation 
should be taught in terms of religion. When metaphysical
thinking dominates the consciousness of society, transcendental meditation 
should be taught in metaphysical terms, aiming at the fulfilment 
of current metaphysical thought. When politics dominate mass
consciousness, transcendental meditation should be taught in terms of
politics, aiming at bringing fulfilment to the political aspirations of the
time. When economics dominate mass consciousness, transcendental
meditation should be taught in terms of economics, with the aim of
bringing fulfilment to the economic aspirations and goal of the time.
 Today, when politics are guiding the destiny of man, the teaching
should be related primarily to the field of politics and secondarily to
that of economics. It will then be easier to spread it through all countries 
and to make it not only popular but available practically to all
people everywhere. When after a few years economies gain the ascendent 
the teaching should be related primarily to aspirations in this
field. Politics should then come second and metaphysics and religion
third. The teaching of transcendental meditation should be based on
that influence which is guiding the destiny of mass consciousness at a
particular time.
 For the present it seems that transcendental meditation should be
made available to everyone through the agency of governments. This
is a time when any effort to perpetuate a new and useful ideology can
succeed only with the help of governments. It is the governments of
democratic countries which have the trust and goodwill of their people.
The leaders are the representatives of the people and every leader
naturally wishes to do something good for those he represents. If
conscientious leaders who understand that this meditation is for the
good of each individual accept it for its truth and value, it will easily
and effectively reach every home on earth.
 In view of the great benefits that transcendental meditation can
bring to health, education and social welfare and to the lives of prisoners 
in gaols, and to the misguided lives of delinquents, it is essential 
for it to be given through the government departments of health,
education, social welfare and justice. It should be a practice adopted
by the members of the medical profession, by teachers and professors 
in schools and colleges, by social workers trying to improve the
level of behaviour in society and by all well-wishers of life in every
field.
 Thus the plan for the emancipation of all mankind in every age
lies in training teachers of transcendental meditation, in constructing
meditation centres, in bringing the practice to each individual on
the level of his need and nature, and in finding ways and means for
its propagation according to the level of consciousness at different times.
 Transcendental meditation in its pure form will help people at all
times to alleviate suffering and to remove shortcomings and ignorance;
it will usher in a new era for a new humanity developed in all life's
values - physical, mental, material and spiritual - and enable man to
live a life of fulfilment established in the eternal freedom of God-consciousness. 
The peace and prosperity of people everywhere will
be secured. Higher consciousness will guide the destiny of man. All
will be established in the true values of life. Accomplishments will be

 JAI GURU DEV&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following speech war delivered to the WORLD PARLIAMENT ASSOCIATION
in Paris, in October, 1962 by Prince Giovanni Alliata de Montereale, a 
member of the Parliament of Italy
Dear Colleagues:
 In my contact with parliamentarians for the last fifteen years, ever since the birth
of this World Parliament Association, I have come to the conclusion that something
has to be done by us to improve the peoples of our countries.
 On the international scene our aim is to establish unity among the nations and for
this high purpose we have been working and our efforts will continue.
 On the national scale all of us are directly concerned with the integrity of our own
nations. We want our industry and commerce to grow; we want our technology to
develop; we wish our scientists great success in their undertakings; we want our
agriculture to be better ; we want our nation to be more integrated and more powerful 
in every way.
 In order to achieve all these aims we should plan for our people to be healthier,
more intelligent and more creative. This could be achieved by developing the power
of each man within himself and unfolding the faculties latent in his mind.
 The study of psychology has shown that whatever a man is able to express of
himself is only a part of his whole.
 The greater part of man does not find expression in his behaviour and activity in
life, because the conscious mind is only a part of the total mind that a man possesses.
So what we need is to make available to every man in our country a technique of
enlarging his conscious mind, a technique of enabling him to use his full mind.
 For example, if a man is using only a fraction of his mind, by enabling him to use
the whole of his mind, he will become infinitely greater as a man. He will think much
more deeply and more fully than he now does.
 Suppose that the conscious mind of man is only one-fourth of his total mind.
Then whatever he thinks and does is only a quarter of his real potential. If we want
him to use his full potential then his full mind should be made conscious and only
then his thought force will be four times more powerful and he will be four times
stronger and four times more sensible and happier than before.
 His love for his fellow man and the harmony in his home and his surroundings
will increase four times. In the field of science, in the field of industry and commerce,
on the level of civilization as a whole, great improvement will be found.
 For this purpose we propose adopting one simple method which will enlarge the
conscious mind and thereby simultaneously improve man on all levels - physical,
mental and spiritual - and also increase his creative intelligence and improve his relations 
with his fellow men.
 This one simple Method of improving each man as a whole is available in the world
today. We have only to incorporate it in our system of education, health and welfare.
 To accomplish this I propose that we, the members of Parliaments assembled here
from all over the world, unite in presenting to our respective govemments the bills
incorporating these ideas, the details of which are available for your examination.
 I propose that we present four bills in our Parliaments to cover the scope of the
Ministries of Education, Social Welfare, Justice and Health.
 I trust that you will certainly examine this matter carefully and that you will be
one of those who will introduce this in your Parliament.
 As I previously remarked, a simple method of improving each man as a whole is
available in the world today. I can, with confidence, say something about it because
of my own experience. The method is known as transcendental meditation. Its practice 
has been introduced to people throughout the world by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
 I have personally practised Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's simple system of transcendental 
meditation for enlarging the conscious mind.
 On the basis of my own personal experience and on the basis of my observations
of Some hundreds of people from England. Germany and Italy, who are also following 
this practice, I urge you most earnestly to practise it yourselves.
 In the name of peace and happiness of the individual, in the name of the solidarity
of our nations and in the name of world peace, I urge you, my friends, to introduce
this tried and proven method to all the people of your countries through your Parliaments 
in a systematic and effective way.
 All our peoples will be healthier, happier, more intelligent and more creative.
 By improving our peoples we will be improving our civilization on all levels.
Our present generation will be better and will leave a better world for the oncoming
generations. This, I am sure, is an effective way of creating a natural situation for
lasting world peace.
 Now I take this occasion to propose a theme for our next conference. As the aim
for our World Parliament Association has always been the peace and progress of
mankind and in our past meetings we have been discussing the Iegislative, economic
and other topics of national and international importance, for the next year, I propose
we meet to discuss:
 Maharishi explains his principle of expansion of the conscious mind by the analogy 
of a wave on the sea -
 When the wave makes contact with the deeper levels of the water, it becomes
more powerful. Likewise, when the conscious mind expands to embrace deeper levels
of the subconscious, then the conscious mind becomes more powerful.
 In order to achieve this Maharishi uses a technique whereby the sub-conscions
area of the mind is made conscious. This is done by consciously experiencing the
thought in its infant state in the sub-conscious.
 The correctness of the process is verified directly by the results - the mind begins
to feel instantaneous release of mental fatigue and tension. Increase of compassion,
feeling of increased energy, clarity of thought along with increase of self-confidence
are some of the obvious experiences that justify the exp,vlsion of the conscious
mind.
 To picture this principle more thoroughly, let us examine the process of thinking.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THOUGHT PROCESS
 The origin of a thought is in the deepest level of the sub-conscious from which it
rises to pass through all the levels of the sub-conscious to reach the conscious level of
the mind. It is here, at the conscious level, that the thought is appreciated as a thought.
 A thought starts from the deepest level of the sub-conscious as a bubble starts
from the bottom of a pond. As the bubble comes up it becomes bigger. Only when
it reaches the surface does it become large enough to be perceived.
 The bubble of thought arising from the level Z becomes bigger (see illustration).
By the time it has reached the surface level A. it has developed enough to be appreciated
as a thought. This is the level of the conscious mind.
 The subtle states of the bubble of thought below the level of the conscious state
are not consciously appreciated. If there could be a way of conscious appreciation of
the bubble of thought at all levels of its development, and at the source Z, then the
small area of the conscious mind represented by W1 will become a bigger area represented 
by W2.
 If the bubble of thought could be consciously appreciated at the level below A
and at all levels of its subtlety from A to Z, then it would be possible to bring the
level Z within the range of the conscious mind. In this way the depth of the conscious
mind represented by W1 would become greater as represented by W2 and the power
of the conscious mind would be increased manifold.
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE
 Bubbles of thought are produced in a stream one after the other and the mind is
trained to experience the oncoming bubble at an earlier and earlier stage of its development, 
from A to Z, in sequence (see illustration). When the attention has reached
level Z, then it has traversed the whole depth of the mind and has reached the source
of creative intelligence in man.
 The source of thought, the source of creative energy, thus comes within the scope
of the conscious mind and fills it with strength over and above the strength gained
by the conscious mind in fathoming the deeper levels of the sub-conscious. The depth
of the conscious mind represented on the diagram by WI has thus been transformed
into greater depth represented by W2. This is how the conscious mind is enlarged to
its maximum capacity, embracing within its fold the source of creative intelligence
mind thus becoming infinitely powerful.
 It is noteworthy that this technique of enlarging the conscious mind is so simple
that it can be practised by anyone. It does not need any preparation to start nor does
it depend upon the person's power of concentration. It is not dependent on the intellectual 
or emotional state of one's mind.
 Although the technique has become famous as transcendental meditation, it is
non-sectarian in its character. It is purely a scientific method of enlarging the conscious 
mind. It does not conflict with any religion or faith. It is already being practised 
by over fifty thousand people in twenty-five different countries.
 This simple technique of enlarging the conscious mind has been found beneficial
in the various fields of:
1 Education
2 Social Welfare
3 Delinquency and Crime
4 Mental Health
 This is the reason why it is intended that this technique be made available in a
systematic and effective way to all the people through government departments
concerned with Education, Social Welfare, Justice and Health.
 This finding of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is unique and has no parallel in the findings of modem psychology
 This technique of enlarging the conscious mind is scientific because:
 1. It is systematic.
 2 It is not opposed to any methods of scientific investigation.
 3 It is universal in its application.
 4 It is open to verification by personal experience.
 5 The end result is found to be the same by everyone.
 As it is, our present system of education is lacking in a technique to enlarge the
conscious mind by developing the potentialities of the sub-conscious. It has the capacity 
of exercising the conscious mind, but it fails to develop the potentialities of the
sub-conscious.
 It has been made clear, while dealing with the main principle for the expansion
of the conscious mind, that the conscious mind is only a small portion of the total
mind that man possesses. and that through Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's system of
transcendental meditation, the whole mind becomes conscious and the potentialities
develop. This is highly important in the career of students.
 That is why we propose to introduce this system into the curricula of our schools
and universities.
 This is the unique approach to improve our present system of education. The
introduction of this single principle of transcendental meditation will vitalize modem
education and will usher in an educational renaissance all over the world. It will
develop the potentialities of the minds of students to their fullest extent and enable
dull minds to become bright.
 It will develope balance in life and understanding of right values. It will improve
the memory and power to retain knowledge. It will increase self-confidence and
self-reliance. It will develop creative intelligence. In fact, it will supply that which
is needed to make modern education complete.
 It is therefore proposed. that this simple system of transcendental meditation
should be introduced into the curriculum so that the students may start practising it
from about the age of IS years (in Italy this is the last year of the compulsory education.
It is also proposed to introduce it into the curricula of university classes so
that before the students enter the full responsibilities of life they develop the full
capacity of their minds.
 The following is the outline of the way in which this aim could be achieved:
 Teachers could be fully trained to give the technique of transcendental meditation 
for the development of the conscious mind to the students for whom they are
responsible. This can be accomplished in three ways:
1. Several teachers could be sent to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Academy of Medita 
tion in India for three months, so that they could return and train others.
2. Some of our teachers could go to participate in the meditation guides' training
 courses, which Maharishi Mahesh yogi conducts annually in different parts of
 Europe. America and India.
3. Arrangements could be made so that a large number of our teachers could be
 trained in our own countries. For this, arrangements could be made by contacting
 any of the centres of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, whose addresses are
 listed on page 331.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
DELINQUENCY AND CRIME REHABILITATION OF THE DELINQUENT AND THE CRIMINAL THROUGH TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION
 The need to rehabilitate the offenders is the age-old problem of society. Crime,
delinquency and the different patterns of anti-social behaviour arise from the
deep discontent of the mind. A weak mind loses its balance and sense of proportion.
 Crime is evidently a short-cut to satisfy a craving - a short-cut which goes beyond
the normal and legal means.
 No approach to the problem can hope to be truly effective unless the basic weakness 
of the mind is remedied.
 While dealing with the main principle for expansion of the conscious mind, it has
been made clear how the conscions mind is enlarged to its fullest capacity and strengthened 
to its utmost extent by the practice of Maharishi's simple system of transcendental 
meditation.
 Therefore it is necessary to introduce this system of transcendental meditation
for the speedy and effective rehabilitation of delinquents and criminals.
 Many with potential talent are among those who are shut behind bars because of
their misguided behaviour. Instead of being a burden they could become useful citizens 
making a genuine contribution to the progress of society if only they could be
successfully rehabilitated.
 It has been found that all kinds of tensions are released and the hard and cruel
nature of man changes to one of tolerance and compassion through the practice of
transcendental meditation.
 The following is an outline of the way in which this aim could be achieved:
 Social welfare workers, prison officials and others who are engaged in the rehabilitation 
of delinquents and criminals, could be fully trained to give the technique
of transcendental meditation to develop the conscious mind, to the offenders with
whom they are concerned.
 This can be accomplished by utilizing trained meditation guides of the Spiritual
Regeneration movement who are conducting meditation centres in the country. In
addition to this, any of the following methods may be employed:
1. Some of our welfare workers could be sent to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Academy
 of Meditation in India for three months, so that they could be trained to teach
 the method.
2. Some of our welfare workers could go to participate in the meditation guides'
 training courses which Maharishi Mahesh Yogi conducts annually in different
 parts of Europe and America.
3. Arrangements could be made for training courses to be held in this country. For
 this. arrangements could be made by contacting any of the centres at the addresses
 listed on page 33.
 The need to improve the quality of human relationships is deeply felt in every
country in the world. Within the family, within the larger sphere of industry and on
the international scale, the need is there.
 There can be no improvement on a larger scale until harmony is established on
all the smaller scales within it. Everything is finally dependent upon the individual
mind, for the only actuality of any group, however large, is the individuals of which
it is composed.
 The basis of all disharmony is the inability of man to satisfy his needs. This may
be due to loss of energy or to lack of intelligence, to poverty of imagination or to his
inability to make the best out of the situation in which he finds himself.
 These are the human incapacities which must be overcome in order to improve
the whole man and thus improve his total situation and his accomplishments on every
scale.
 To achieve this end, it is necessary to develop and strengthen the individual mind.
 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's work in all parts of the world during the last six years
has proved that this is precisely what his simple systen of transcendental meditation
does achieve, and in this way the whole man is improved.
 It is within the easy reach of every human being to improve the quality of his
mind and of his heart. This meditation enlarges the mind's conscious capacity and
enhances its ability to perceive and respond significantly to its situation.
 Generally, a man does not use his whole mind, and therefore he perceives only a
part of his situation. Responding to that alone, his behaviour remains inadequate to
his total position.
 Transcendental meditation brings into conscious activity areas of the mind which,
before, were active only below the level of conscious mind and so the conscious mind
is made larger, and therefore more alert and powerful. A fully developed mind
succeeds in perceiving the total situation and is thus enabled to respond fully and
successfully to that situation.
 Maharishi illustrates this by describing how a wave on the surface becomes powerfull 
when it includes within itself the deeper levels of the ocean that lie beneath the
surface. Likewise, when the conscious mind embraces the deeper levels of the subconscious, 
it becomes more powerful; all the latent faculties of the sub-conscious are
unfolded.
 With the expansion of the conscious mind, the latent potentialities are fully developed. 
The increased contentment of the heart gives rise to compassion, and the sharpness 
of the mind gives rise to understanding. Such a complete individual mind
accomplished more in life, while it remains fully secure, established in the inner peace,
harmony and happiness. Such a mind is of value to the individual and the society.
 These enlarged capacities improve a man's relationship with his fellow man in a
natural and spontaneous way, whereas contemporary methods of improving individual 
relationships by counsel and advice, and social relationships by meetings and
discussions, can only scratch the surface of the situation.
 A gardener seeing a leaf withering away in the sun does not direct his attention
directly upon it, but hastens to water the root, whereas, and he been more skilful. the
root would have been watered before the leaf begin to wither. Today, those wl,o
conceal themselves with the inter-relationships of people seem unable to do much
more they hurry from one withering leaf to the next. uttering vague cries of consolation 
and goodwill. To try to bring harmony only in this way is like running after
a mirage in the hope of obtaining water. For it is obvious that as group-therapy
techniques multiply, problems also multiply and tensions continue to grow. Problems
of relationship and its tensions cannot be solved at the group level.
 The root of every situation, on whatever scale it is, is the state of the individual
mind, and it is this root that needs to be vital and healthy. Rather than attending to
effects at the level of the group, it is essential to attack the cause. This lies always in
the individual mind.
 A man's incapacity to cope with his environment, to dominate it. and to use it to
its fullest advantage, to gain the most from it and to satisfy his needs within it - this
incapacity leads to frustation and rising tension, for he becomes unable either to
tolerate the situation as it is, or to change it for the better. He is then forced by the
increase of tension within him to burst out into revolt and aggression against everything 
around him and even against himself. In this way he makes the situation continuously 
worse and creates confusion and unhappiness.
 A man of powerful mind. in the same circumstances, interprets the situation quite
differently. He behaves in such a way to make the best out of the existing circumstances 
for himself and at the same time brings about an improvement of the situation
for everyone involved in it. Thus he fertilizes and enriches his whole field of inAuence.
 All anti-social behaviour, even crime and delinquency, arises from inner discontent, 
which finds a fertile field in the weak mind which is unable to properly come
to grips with the world around it and to achieve a stable and rewarding relationship
with it. No approach to these problems can hope to be truly effective unless the basic
incapacity of the mind, which is their cause, is fundamentally remedied.
 This can be achieved simply and without effort by the practice of Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi's system of transcendental meditation, for this brings the mind to its
full stature. so that it not only becomes content in itSelf but is also, at the same time,
able to act with strength and decision in the fields of choice.
 It is therefore proposed that this simple system of transcendental meditation should be
brought to the people of our country through the departments concerned with social welfare.
 The following is an outline of the way in which this aim could be achieved:
 Social welfare workers could be fully trained to give the technique of transcendental 
meditation to the people whom they are helping. This can be accomplished in
three ways:
1. Trained meditation guides who are already conducting meditation centres of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in the country may be utilized by the Welfare Department of the State.
2 Several of our social welfare officers could be sent to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Academy of Meditation in India for three months, so that they could return and train other social workers in our country.
3. Some of our social workers could go to participate in the meditation guides' training courses which Maharishi Mahesh Yogi conducts annually in different parts of Europe and America.
4. Arrangements could be made so that a large number of our social workers could be trained in our own country. For this, arrangements could be made by contacting any of the centres of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement, whose addresses are listed on page 331.
 To build more hospitals in order to remove the suffering when people have
already fallen in, is certainly the responsibility of the government, but a far greater
responsibility lies in finding ways and means whereby people will not fall sick. We
propose to show how the new goal of good health may be achieved.
 We note that preventive medicine is already an established and important part
of health programmes of governments. Progress in this field depends upon the
application of new findings from time to time.
 Here is something new which has proved its value for the preservation and betterment 
of health.
 Individual health has both mental and physical aspects. These are very closely
interdependent and it is only for the sake of clarity that we shall consider them separately 
to see how health is affected by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's system of transcendental 
meditation.
MENTAL HEALTH
 The mind functions through the nervous system which serves to connect the
subjective nature of man with the objective world around him.
 Mental health depends upon the strength of the mind. A strong mind establishes
a thorough coordination 
with the nervous system and enables it to function normally. 
When the nervous system functions normally the full mind is brought to bear
upon the external world. The normal functioning of the nervous system results in
physical good health as well, and thereby the body is able to carry out the directives
of the mind, and fulfil its desires.
 As long as the co-ordination of the mind with the nervous system is intact, mental
health is maintained. When this co-ordination breaks down, in health is the result.
Such lack of co-ordination is mainly due to the weakness of the mind or lack of
thought-force. A weak thought fails to stimulate the nervous system to a sufficient
extent to carry out successfully the activity that is needed for its fulfilment.
 For the most thorough co-ordination and perfect function, a profound power
of thought on the part of the mind, together with a correspondingly efficient
executive ability in the nervous system. is required. An improvement of the state of
the mind results at once in an improved co-ordination between the mind and the
world around it; thus the full mind is brought to bear upon the external world and the
subject comes into a more perfect and rewarding apposition with the object. Happiness 
is clearly the result of the fulfilment of the desires of the mind, and happiness is
the expression of sound mental health.
 If, because of the failure to satisfy the needs and desires of the mind, discontentment 
begins to produce tension within it, then the way to remove these tensions will
be to strengthen the mind by increasing its power to think - the force of thought.
This is achieved by enlarging the conscious mind through the practice of transcendental 
meditation as has already been explained while dealing with the main principle
of transcendental meditation for the expansion of the conscious mind.
 When tensions build up in the mind, they are reflected through the nervous system
upon the body. The anxious mind, constantly flitting back and forth amongst its
problems in its discontented state, exhausts and irritates the nervous system and the
body. As a servant, to whom his master constantly gives indecisive and confusing
orders, becomes tired and irritable and eventually fails to do anything, likewise, the
nervous system and the body become tired and exhausted and eventually fail to
function efficiently when the mind is in a state of stress due to confusion and indecision.
 In this way, mental stress produces disease, and even organic changes in the body.
Obviously the cure of all such suffering is to create such a situation in the mind that
it may become, and remain, unwavering and steady. This is achieved by expanding
the conscious mind, and thereby making it strong. As a result of strengthening the
conscious mind, a better co-ordination between the mind and the nervous system is
established and smooth and efficient functioning of the body is naturally the result.
perfect mental health is maintained because of this co-ordination of the mind with
the nervous system and with its end organ, the body.
 It has been seen in hundreds of cases in many countries that worried and tensed
people naturally lose their tensions within a short time of starting the practice of
transcendental meditation. Thus we find that this practice of meditation is a boon for
mental health. It is a means for preservation of mental health; it serves as a mental
tonic and at the same time is a natural and effective cure for mental illness.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHYSICAL HEALTH
 Medical researches have shown that a very large proportion of physical disorders
arise primarily from mental tension as a result of the anxieties and failures in life.
 While dealing with mental health we have seen how the process of transcendental
meditation releases tension and this is why we find that all suffering that could be
described as psychosomatic is relieved at its source by transcendental meditation.
There are, however, purely organic diseases in which there is no evidence of a mental
cause - but it is well known that a sick man in his situation, has a mental and emotional 
attitude to his illness which, while not causal to the illness itself, may still be having
profound effects upon its course. Certainly meditation will remove these secondary
anxieties, but let us now consider what effects meditation may have upon a purely
organic disease. To do this we must consider the physiological effects of transcendental
meditation.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION
 As the attention is drawn to consciously experience the subtler states of a thought
during transcendental meditation, it is found that respiration becomes greatly reduced
in amplitude; the breathing becomes soft and refined.
 Physiologically it is clear that for this to take place there must be a fall in the level
of carbon dioxide in the plasma. This can occur only as a result of either forced overbreathing. 
which washes the carbon dioxide out through the lungs, or by a fall in the
production of carbon dioxide through metabolic process.
 Because there is no forced over-breathing during transcendental meditation we
can only conclude that the softening of the breath is due to the fall in the production
of carbon dioxide by metabolic process.
 The production of most of the energy for activity in the body involves finally the
oxidation of carbon and its elimination as carbon dioxide.
 Greater activity needs greater energy which is produced by a greater amount of
oxidation of carbon and its elimination as carbon dioxide. A lesser amount of activity
needs a lesser amount of energy, which is produced by a lesser amount of oxidation
of carbon and its elimination as carbon dioxide.
 This shows that when a lesser amount of carbon dioxide is eliminated by way of
softer breathing, during transcendental meditation. the process of oxidation is
lessened and this naturally produces a lesser amount of energy.
 That is why the activity of the body and that of the nervous system is lessened
during transcendental meditation. This explains why, during meditation, as the mind
proceeds to experience finer states of a thought, the whole body becomes calm and
quiet.
 This quietening of the body naturally allows in unusual degree of rest which
itself stores energy to an unusual degree. Certainly activity of the mind and the nervous 
system is least in this state and the mind quietens and becomes calm.
If by means of deep meditation one does not produce this state even for a few minutes daily, then one
has no chance of providing any rest to the inner machinery of the body which otherwise is kept functioning
twenty-four hours of the day, for the whole of one's life as long as the breath keeps flowing.
Obviously it is to the advantage of health and longevity of life that the ever-functioning inner machinery
of the body is allowed a few moments of rest and silence each day.
 In this quiet state the mind and the nervous system are alertly poised like the
arrow drawn fully back upon the bow; they are without activity but the entire
system is alert in stillness. At the same time all the mechanisms of the body are acutely
balanced and steady. It is this restful alertness of the nervous system that is its most
healthy state and is the basis of all energy and action.
 The fall in carbon dioxide output has also another effect - that of causing a tendency 
to change the reaction of the blood from acidity towards alkalinity. This in
its turn has widespread effects upon the blood chemistry, all of which are beneficial
to the system as a whole.
 These considerations lead us to the following:
 That Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's system of transcendental meditation is beneficial
in the field of health in two ways. It is both preventive and curative -
1. It is a means of preservation of mental and physical health.
2. It is a means of providing complete rest and relaxation to body and mind which
restores energy and greatly aids medical treatment toward a speedy recovery from
ill-health.
 Following is an outline of the ways in which this could be achieved :
1. Trained meditation guides who are already conducting meditation centres of the
Spiritual Regeneration Movement may be utilized by departments of health.
2. One professor from each medical college could be trained either in Maharishi's
Academy of Meditation in India or in training courses that Maharishi holds in
Europe or America. This trained professor will be able to train medical students
so that the future medical practitioners will be competent to impart the technique
of transcendental meditation to their patients.
3. Officers of the Health department, doctors and nurses could be trained to give
the practice of transcendental meditation to the sick and the needy.
India, Italy, Greece. Germany, France, Holland, Switzerland, England. Scotland
Ireland, Norway, Sweden. Denmark, Finland, Canada. Iceland, United States, New
Zealand, Australia, Hongkong, Singapore, Malaya, Burma, East Africa, South Africa.

TIMELY CALL TO THE LEADERS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW
 This is the text of an appeal made by Members of Parliament from all the States ofIndia,
in the Spring of 1963. Their names are mentioned at the end of the appeal.
 Live in peace or perish is the challenge of the nuclear age. The state of increasing
tension cannot continue indefinitely; it must give way to peace or annihilation.
 Hundreds of educated, intelligent, energetic and devoted persons are needed to
serve the cause of world peace, by popularising the practical formula of peace and
harmony in the life of the individuals in every corner of India and abroad.
 His Holiness Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of the world-wide Spiritual
Regeneration Movement, expounds a simple system of transcendental meditation
whereby any man may turn his mind within himself and tap the source of unlimited
energy, happiness, peace and creative intelligence.
 Maharishi's simple system of transcendental meditation bridges the gulf between
the inner and outer aspects of life. It regenerates the personality improving all phases
of life, resulting in a harmonious development of body, mind and soul.
 Thousands of people all over the world are now enjoying 'a tension-free life'
through Maharishi's simple system of transcendental meditation.
 Three times Maharishiji has gone round the world establishing Meditation Centres
in India, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, Hongkong, United States of America,
Canada, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, England, Scotland, Ireland, France,
ltaly, Greece. East Africa, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.
 Hundreds of Meditation Guides trained by Maharishiji in India and abroad are
satisfactorily conducting the Meditation Centres in all these countries.
 This is an attempt to spiritually regenerate all mankind and create a lasting world
peace for which Maharishiji started the Spiritual Regeneration Movement four
years ago, and for which His Holiness has recently established the Academy of
Meditation as the world headquarters for training Meditation Guides.
 The need for more Meditation Guides is increasing day by day with the universal
acceptance of Maharishi's philosophy of simple and transcendental meditation.
 A forty-day training programme of Meditation Guides will commence from
20th May, 1963 at the Academy of Meditation at Shankaracharya Nagar, near Rishikesh.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE NATIONAL OUTLOOK
 Experience has shown us that we, even in India, cannot live in peace if we have
not spread peace in our surroundings. Even to maintain a balance of mind and peace
within our society it is imperative that we should rise to the challenge of the day and
carry the practical message of peace and harmony to every part of the world.
 The present grave situation of the national life of our country demands strength
and unity which is only possible by increasing the consciousness of our people.
 Increased consciousness means greater energy, creative intelligence, better health
and also greater harmony in social relationships. Maharishi's simple technique of
transcendental meditation is a direct way to it. It is only necessary for us all to adopt
it.
 We are by tradition a peace-loving nation. We know by experience that peace
is not possible in weakness. Let us rise to strengthen ourselves. Let us unfold our
latent faculties. and begin to use our full potential. Let each of us realise that in the
strength and intelligence of each one of us lies the strength of India.
 Let us not forget that every one of us is responsible for our national crisis. What
is the cause of such a collective calamity1 It is the collective tensions of the individuals.
And what causes collective tensions? Individual tensions appearing as anger. fear.
hatred, greed, jealousy, wrong thought, speech, action and corrupt practices of all
sorts.
 Individual tensions accumulate in the atmosphere as collective tensions and produce 
collective calamities, national crises and international conflicts.
 Elimination of the existing tensions in the atmosphere is the urgent need of India.
When a boil develops on any part of the body surgery is, of course, necessary. But
treatment to purify the blood is also of vital importance. Meeting the national crisis
on its level is certainly necessary but a remedy to eliminate the existing tension in the
atmosphere must be considered to be of equal importance if not more.
 It is our national duty to alleviate the atmospheric tensions as soon as possible by
eliminating the tensions in the lives of every individual. This can best be accomplished
by giving the people a simple technique of creating powerful influences of peace and
harmony from the deepest level of their consciousness - by a few minutes of daily
practice of transcendental meditation.
 His Holiness is now travelling throughout India to make available to all the people
his simple technique of transcendental meditation to combat the fear of war, and
enable everyone to live in peace and strength.

*'''Приве́т!''' is an informal greeting, loosely translated as 'Hi!' or 'Hey!'. The more formal meeting is '''здра́вствуйте''' (''&lt;small&gt;ZDRAV&lt;/small&gt;-stvooy-tye'')
*'''Меня́ зову́т...''' literally means 'Me they call...' or 'They call me...', and is the Russian way of saying 'My name is...'. Similarly, '''как тебя́ зову́т?''' literally means 'How you they call?', or 'How do they call you?', and is how Russians ask 'What's your name?'.
*'''Как дела́?''' literally means 'How (are) things?' (the word 'are' is omitted in Russian). '''А у тебя́?''' means 'And by you?'.
*'''Хорошо́''' is a general catch-all word that means 'good', 'fine', 'OK', etc.
*'''Студент''' and '''студентка''' both mean 'student', but the former is for males and the latter is for females. Feminine words often end in a '''-а''' or a '''-я''', while masculine words often end in a consonant. See the page on [[Russian/Grammar/Gender|gender]] for more details.
*Russians often omit the ''copula'', i.e., words like 'is', 'are', 'am' - any present tense form of the verb 'to be'. They also omit articles, which in English are 'a', 'an', and 'the'. Thus, 'I am a student' becomes '''Я студент / Я студентка'''.
*'''Ну''' is an interjection, a filler word that corresponds to the English 'well'.

=== Formal and Informal ===
Russian distinguishes between formal and informal modes of address ([[w:en:Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]). Friends and family address each other using the informal register with the [[w:en:Grammatical person|second person]] singular pronoun &quot;ты&quot; (you), while employees and students use the formal register with bosses and professors with the second person plural pronoun &quot;вы&quot; (you, referring to more than one person). Adults always use &quot;ты&quot; when talking to a child. In the vocabulary tables &quot;Notes&quot; column, the &quot;X&quot; denotes an exclusively informal term, and the &quot;O&quot; indicates an exclusively formal term.

; Example
* Доброе утро, [[wikt:студент|студенты]]!
*: ''Good morning, students!
* До свидания, [[wikt:профессор|профессор]].
*: ''Good bye, professor.
* Катя, пока!
*: ''Katya, bye!

* &quot;Как тебя зовут?&quot;, the phrase used to ask someone's name, translates to &quot;How do they call you?&quot;
* &quot;Очень [[wikt:приятный|приятно]]&quot;, means &quot;very pleasant.&quot;

; Example
* Как тебя зовут?
*: ''What is your name?
* Меня зовут Пётр.
*: ''My name is Pyotr.
* Очень приятно.
*: ''Nice to meet you.

{{hidden begin

* It should now be obvious that тебя and вас are interchangeable, the former used in casual / familiar settings and the latter in formal settings; вас is also the plural form of &quot;you&quot;. An example may be у вас есть хлеб? meaning, &quot;do you have bread?&quot; - being both plural and formal.

* With the first phrase comes an interesting note. Because the function of words is mostly determined by [[Russian/Grammar/Cases|declension]], word order is ''mostly'' free. &quot;Меня зовут Пётр&quot; and &quot;Пётр меня зовут&quot; mean the same thing. &quot;Mostly&quot; is highlighted, however, because some combinations do not work, so avoid straying too far from the word order of the examples until later.

Endive (Cichorium endiva) is a leafy [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] vegetable. It is often confused with chicory.

There are three main varieties of endive: Belgian endive, curly endive and escarole.

Belgian endive (also known as French endive and witloof) has a small head of cream-coloured bitter leaves. It is grown in complete darkness to avoid the leaves turning green.

Curly endive (sometimes mistakenly called chicory in the United States) has green rimmed curly outer leaves.

Escarole has broad, pale green leaves and is less bitter than the other varieties

Psychology is an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including relating to individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. 

Psychology differs from the other social sciences — anthropology, economics, political science, and sociology — in that psychology seeks to explain the mental processes and behavior of ''individuals''. Whereas biology and neuroscience study the biological or neural processes and how they relate to the mental effects they subjectively produce, psychology is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behavior on a systemic level. The subfield of neuropsychology studies the actual neural processes while biological psychology studies the biological bases of behavior and mental states.

[[w:Psychology|Psychology]] is an academic and applied field involving the study of behavior, mind and thought and the subconscious neurological bases of behavior. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness. It is largely concerned with humans, although the behavior and mental processes of animals can also be part of psychology research, either as a subject in its own right '''('''e.g. animal cognition and ethology''')''', or somewhat more controversially, as a way of gaining an insight into human psychology by means of comparison '''('''including [[w:comparative_psychology|comparative psychology]]''')'''. '''Psychology is commonly defined as the science of behavior and mental processes.'''

Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system and can be framed purely in terms of phenomenological or information processing theories of mind. Increasingly, though, an understanding of brain function is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[w:artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]], [[w:neuropsychology|neuropsychology]], and [[w:cognitive_neuroscience|cognitive neuroscience]]. 

Psychology describes and attempts to explain consciousness, behavior and social interaction. Empirical psychology is primarily devoted to describing human experience and behavior as it actually occurs. In the past 20 years or so psychology has begun to examine the relationship between consciousness and the brain or nervous system. It is still not clear in what ways these interact: does consciousness determine brain states or do brain states determine consciousness - or are both going on in various ways? Perhaps to understand this you need to know the definition of &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;brain state&quot; - or is consciousness some sort of complicated 'illusion' which bears no direct relationship to neural processes?
The late 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise. The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study, because in that year German scientist '''[[w:Wilhelm Wundt|Wilhelm Wundt]]''' founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research in Leipzig, Germany. 

Wundt combined philosophical '''[[w:introspection|introspection]]''' with techniques and laboratory apparatuses brought over from his physiological studies with [[w:Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], as well as many of his own design. This experimental introspection was in contrast to what had been called psychology until then, a branch of philosophy where people introspected themselves.

'''Introspection''' ''is the direct observation or rumination of one's own heart, mind and/or soul and its processes, as opposed to extrospection, the observation of things external to one's self.
''

====Early Systems of Psychology====

Wundt's form of psychology is called ''[[w:Structuralism#Structuralism_in_psychology_.2819th_century.29|structuralism]]''.  It is in a class called systematic interpretations because It attempted to explain all behavior with reference to one systematic position.  Some other ''systems of psychology'' are ''functionalism'', ''behaviorism'', ''gestalt psychology'', and ''psychodynamic psychology''.

[[w:Functionalism_%28psychology%29|Functionalism]] is concerned with the reason for behavior and not the structure of the brain.  It allowed the study of new subjects including children and animals. 

[[w:Behaviorism|Behaviorism]] is an approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be studied and explained scientifically without recourse to internal mental states.  Psychologists that use behaviorism are concerned mainly with muscular movements and glandular secretions.

[[w:Gestalt_Psychology|Gestalt Psychology]] is a theory of mind and brain that proposes that the operational principle of the brain is holistic, parallel, and analog, with self-organizing tendencies.  It has a particular interest in perceptual problems and how they can be interpreted.  A Gestaltist believes that the whole is greater than or different than the sum of all of the parts.  Trying to break up behavior into separate parts is simplistic because everything affects everything else.

[[w:Psychodynamic_psychology|Psychodynamic psychology]] was first practiced by Sigmund Freud, although he didn't intend it to be a system.

====Perspectives====

While the use of one system to solve all problems has been abandoned by most psychologists, these early systems were important in the development of new systems and ideas.  There are eight major perspectives that psychologists usually take, although many use an eclectic approach instead of confining themselves to just one.

The [[w:psychodynamic|psychodynamic]] perspective emphasizes unconscious drives and the resolution of conflicts, the
[[w:behaviorist|behavorial]] emphasizes the acquisition and alteration of observable responses, and the
[[W:self_actualization|humanistic]] approaches attempt to achieve maximum human potential as set in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

The [[w:biological_psychology|biological]] perspective  is the scientific study of the biological bases of behavior and mental states, very closely related to [[w:neuroscience|neuroscience]].

[[w:evolutionary_psychology|Evolutionary]] psychology is a theoretical approach to psychology that attempts to explain certain mental and psychological traits—such as memory, perception, or language as evolved adaptations, i.e., as the functional products of natural or sexual selection.

[[w:Cognitive psychology|Cognitive psychology]] accepts the use of the scientific method, but rejects introspection as a valid method of investigation. It should be noted that Herbert Simon and Allen Newell identified the 'thinking-aloud' protocol, in which investigators view a subject engaged in introspection, and who speaks his thoughts aloud, thus allowing study of his introspection.

[[w:Social_psychology_%28psychology%29|Social psychology]] is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others (Allport, 1985).

Wundt argued that &quot;''we learn little about our minds from casual, haphazard self-observation...It is essential that observations be made by trained observers under carefully specified conditions for the purpose of answering a well-defined question.''&quot;

Many scientists threw away the idea of introspection as part of psychology because the observation of stimulation was speculative without an [[w:empiricism|empirical approach]]. However the case, an opposite to introspection called [[w:extrospection|extrospection]] has been created with a relation to '''Psychophysics'''. [[w:Psychophysics|Psychophysics]] is the branch of psychology dealing with ''the relationship between physical stimuli and their perception''.

The important distinction is that Wundt took this method into the experimental arena and thus into the newly formed psychological field. Other important early contributors to the field of psychology include Hermann Ebbinghaus (a pioneer in studies on memory), the Russian Ivan Pavlov (who discovered the learning process of classical conditioning), and the Austrian Sigmund Freud.

The mid-20th century saw a rejection of Freud's theories among many psychologists as being too unscientific, as well as a reaction against Edward Titchener's abstract approach to the mind.

'''Edward B. Titchener''' (1876-1927) was an Englishman and a student of Wilhelm Wundt before becoming a professor of psychology at Cornell University. He would put his own spin on Wundt's psychology of consciousness after he emigrated to the United States.

At the turn of 19th century the founding father of experimental psychology Wilhelm Wundt tried to experimentally confirm his hypothesis that conscious mental life can be broken down into fundamental elements which then form more complex mental structures. Wundt's '''structuralism''' was quickly abandoned because it could not be tested in the same way as behavior, until now, when the brain-scanning technology can identify, for example, specialized brain cells that respond exclusively to basic lines and shapes and are then combined in subsequent brain areas where more complex visual structures are formed. This line of research in modern psychology is called '''cognitive psychology''' rather then [[w:structuralism|structuralism]] because Wundt's term never ceased to be associated with the problem of observability.

The majority of mainstream psychology is based on a framework derived from '''cognitive psychology''', although the popularity of this paradigm does not exclude others, which are often applied as necessary. Psychologists specialising in certain areas, however, may use the dominant cognitive psychology only rarely if at all.

'''Cognitive psychology''' ''is the psychological science which studies cognition, the mental processes that are hypothesised to underlie behavior.'' This covers a broad range of research domains, examining questions about the workings of memory, attention, perception, knowledge representation, reasoning, creativity and problem solving.

Cognitive psychology is radically different from previous psychological approaches in two key ways.
* It accepts the use of the [[Introduction to Psychology/Scientific method|scientific method]], and generally rejects [[Introduction to Psychology/Introspection|Introspection]] as a valid method of investigation, unlike [[w:phenomenology|phenomenological]] methods such as [[w:Freud|Freudian]] psychology.
* It posits the existence of internal mental states (such as [[w:belief|belief]]s, [[w:desire|desire]]s and [[w:motivation|motivation]]s) unlike [[w:behaviourism|behaviourist]] psychology.

Regardless of the perspective adopted there are hundreds of specialties that psychologists practice.  These specialties can usually be grouped into general fields.

*[[w:clinical_psychology|Clinical]] and [[w:counseling_psychology|Counseling]] Psychology: Over half of all psychologists work in this field.  Clinical psychologists are more likely to treat or conduct research into the causes of abnormal behaviors, while counseling psychologists more often work with mild social or emotional problems.  Typically people seeking the help of a counselor are not classified as abnormal or mentally ill.
*[[w:Educational_psychology|Educational]] and [[w:School_psychology|School]] Psychology: Educational psychologists are concerned with the use of psychology to increase the effectiveness of the learning experience, including facilities, curriculum, teaching techniques, and student problems.  A school psychologist works in a school environment to evaluate the structure and effectiveness of the learning environment. A school psychologist assesses, counsels or guides students who have academic,behavioral,emotional,and/ or guidance needs. A school psychologist consults with teachers,staff, and parents to help students adjust and learn most effectively in their learning environment.
*[[w:industrial_psychology|Industrial/Organizational Psychology]](also known as I/O psychology, work psychology, occupational psychology, or personnel psychology) is the study of the behavior of people in the workplace. Industrial and organizational psychology applies psychological knowledge and methods to aid workers and organizations. I/O psychologists who work for an organization are most likely to work in the HR (human resources) department.
*[[w:Consumer_psychology|Consumer Psychology]]:Consumer behaviour is the study of how people buy, what they buy, when they buy and why they buy.
*[[w:Engineering_psychology|Engineering Psychology]]: See link
*[[w:Forensic_psychology|Forensic Psychology]]: Forensic psychology is the application of psychological principles and knowledge to various legal activities involving child custody disputes, child abuse of an emotional, physical and sexual nature, assessing one's personal capacity to manage one's affairs, matters of competency to stand trial, criminal responsibility &amp; personal injury and advising judges in matters relating to sentencing regarding various mitigants and the actuarial assessment of future risk.
*[[w:Sport_psychology|Sport Psychology]]: Sport psychology is a specialization within psychology that seeks to understand psychological/mental factors that affect performance in sports, physical activity and exercise and apply these to enhance individual and team performance.
*[[w:Environmental_psychology|Environmental Psychology]]: Environmental psychology is an interdisciplinary field focused on the interplay between humans and their surroundings.  Areas of study include pollution effects, recycling efforts, and the study of stress generated by different physical settings.

==History==
===Early development===
The first use of the term &quot;psychology&quot; is often attributed to the German scholastic philosopher Rudolf Goeckel (Latinized Rudolph Goclenius), published in 1590.[1] More than six decades earlier, however, the Croatian humanist Marko Marulić used the term in the title of a work which was subsequently lost.[2] This, of course, may not have been the very first usage, but it is the earliest documented use at present.

The term did not fall into popular usage until the German idealist philosopher, Christian Wolff (1679-1754) used it in his Psychologia empirica and Psychologia rationalis (1732-1734). This distinction between empirical and rational psychology was picked up in Diderot's Encyclopedie and was popularized in France by Maine de Biran.

The root of the word psychology (psyche) is very roughly equivalent to &quot;soul&quot; in Greek, and (ology) equivalent to &quot;study&quot;. Psychology came to be considered a study of the soul (in a religious sense of this term) much later, in Christian times. Psychology as a medical discipline can be seen in Thomas Willis' reference to psychology (the &quot;Doctrine of the Soul&quot;) in terms of brain function, as part of his 1672 anatomical treatise &quot;De Anima Brutorum&quot; (&quot;Two Discourses on the Souls of Brutes&quot;). Until about the end of the 19th century, psychology was regarded as a branch of philosophy.

===Early modern era===
In 1879, Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), known as &quot;the father of psychology&quot;, founded a laboratory for the study of psychology at Leipzig University in Germany. The American philosopher William James published his seminal book, Principles of Psychology, in 1890, laying the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would focus on for years to come. Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850–1909), a pioneer in the experimental study of memory at the University of Berlin; and the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), who investigated the learning process now referred to as classical conditioning.

Meanwhile, during the 1890s, the Austrian physician Sigmund Freud, who was trained as a neurologist and had no formal training in experimental psychology, had developed a method of psychotherapy known as psychoanalysis. Freud's understanding of the mind was largely based on interpretive methods and introspection, and was focused in particular on resolving mental distress and psychopathology. Freud's theories became very well-known, largely because they tackled subjects such as sexuality and repression as general aspects of psychological development. These were largely considered taboo subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society. Although Freud's theories are only of limited interest in modern academic psychology departments, his application of psychology to clinical work has been very influential.

Partly in reaction to the subjective and introspective nature of Freudian psychology, and its focus on the recollection of childhood experiences, during the early decades of the 20th century behaviorism gained popularity as a guiding psychological theory. Championed by psychologists such as John B. Watson and Edward Thorndike (and later, B.F. Skinner), behaviorism was grounded in studies of animal behavior. Behaviorists argued that psychology should be a science of behavior, not the mind, and rejected the idea that internal mental states such as beliefs, desires, or goals could be studied scientifically. In his paper &quot;Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It&quot; (1913), Watson argued that psychology &quot;is a purely objective [emphasis added] experimental branch of natural science,&quot; that &quot;introspection forms no essential part of its methods&quot;, and that &quot;the behaviorist recognizes no dividing line between man and brute.&quot;

Behaviorism reigned as the dominant model in psychology through the first half of the 20th century, largely due to the creation of conditioning theories as scientific models of human behavior, and their successful application in the workplace and in fields such as advertising.

===Modern era===
However, it became increasingly clear that although behaviorism had made some important discoveries, it was deficient as a guiding theory of human behavior. Noam Chomsky's review of Skinner's book Verbal Behavior (that aimed to explain language acquisition in a behaviorist framework) is considered one of the major factors in the ending of behaviorism's reign. Chomsky demonstrated that language could not purely be learned from conditioning, as people could produce sentences unique in structure and meaning that couldn't possibly be generated solely through experience of natural language, implying that there must be internal states of mind that behaviorism rejected as illusory. Similarly, work by Albert Bandura showed that children could learn by social observation, without any change in overt behavior, and so must be accounted for by internal representations.

Humanistic psychology emerged in the 1950s and has continued as a reaction to positivist and scientific approaches to the mind. It stresses a phenomenological view of human experience and seeks to understand human beings and their behavior by conducting qualitative research. The humanistic approach has its roots in existentialist and phenomenological philosophy and many humanist psychologists completely reject a scientific approach, arguing that trying to turn human experience into measurements strips it of all meaning and relevance to lived existence.

Some of the founding theorists behind this school of thought were Abraham Maslow who formulated a hierarchy of human needs, Carl Rogers who created and developed client-centered therapy, and Fritz Perls who helped create and develop Gestalt therapy.

The rise of computer technology also promoted the metaphor of mental function as information processing. This, combined with a scientific approach to studying the mind, as well as a belief in internal mental states, led to the rise of cognitivism as the dominant model of the mind.

Links between brain and nervous system function were also becoming common, partly due to the experimental work of people such as Charles Sherrington and Donald Hebb, and partly due to studies of people with brain injury (see cognitive neuropsychology). With the development of technologies for accurately measuring brain function, neuropsychology and cognitive neuroscience have become some of the most active areas in contemporary psychology. With the increasing involvement of other disciplines (such as philosophy, computer science and neuroscience) in the quest to understand the mind, the umbrella discipline of cognitive science has been created as a means of focusing such efforts in a constructive way.

[[Image:ARS_romaine_lettuce.jpg|right|romaine lettuce]]
'''Lettuce''' is a temperate plant grown for its leaves, which are used in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]], [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwiches]], and several other dishes. Lettuce is generally used raw and in cold dishes, but in South-East Asian cooking it is used as a 'wrap' around a hot filling. 

There are many varieties of lettuce commonly available, including:

* Iceberg (head lettuce)
* Red leaf
* Green leaf
* North Pole
* [[Cookbook:Romaine lettuce|Romaine lettuce]] or Cos
* Butter lettuce

Some lettuces (especially iceberg) have been specifically bred to remove the bitterness from their leaves. These lettuces are largely water with very little nutrient value. The more bitter lettuces and the ones with pigmented leaves contain anti-oxidants. Consider replacing lettuce with [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] or [[Cookbook:Alfalfa|alfalfa sprouts]] if you wish to have high nutrient value; these replacements also last longer in the refrigerator.

'''Brassicas''' are known as the cruciform vegetables, because the leaves of a seedling form a cross.

Surprisingly, [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] (var. ''italica''), [[Cookbook:Cauliflower|cauliflower]] (var. ''botrytis''), [[Cookbook:Kohlrabi|kohlrabi]] (var. ''caulorapa''), [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]] (var. ''gemmifera''), [[Cookbook:Kale|Chinese kale]] or Chinese broccoli (var. ''alboglabra''), [[Cookbook:Broccolini|broccolini]] (var. ''italica x alboglabra'') and [[Cookbook:Broccoflower|broccoflower]] (var. ''italica x botrytis'') are varieties of the same plant species: ''Brassica oleracea''.

[[Cookbook:Broccoli_rabe|Broccoli rabe]] is also a brassica (''Brassica rapa ruvo'').</text>

==Before the Rise of Civilization==
Early people were nomadic hunter-gatherers and lived off the land.  Over time, nomadic groups of foragers and hunters began to settle down.  The pastoral society helped to further tie groups to specific areas of land.  The raising of animals created strains on nomadic peoples to find large and reliable sources of food to feed their growing population of animals.
Drawbacks at the onset of civilization were that they were unusually aggressive, babies were greatly dependent for many years on adult care, and they were aware of the inevitability of death.  However, they had several advantages, such as opposable thumbs, ease of reproduction, the ability to adapt to varying physical environments, and above all, an advanced brain and eventually speech.  This ability to communicate allowed them to thrive.

In the Paleolithic Age (Paleolithic means &quot;old stone&quot;) 2 million to 10,000 years ago, ''Homo sapiens'' evolved, originating in Africa.  Humans spread from Africa roughly 75,000 years ago and developed speech and fire before the Neolithic.  There is substantial evidence that humans of this period had already developed a belief in the afterlife.  Also, some societies in the late Paleolithic appear to have developed social structures and hierarchies.  Cave paintings, burials, and tools are leftover relics from this period.

Over several thousand years, these developments, as well as other factors, led to what is known as the Neolithic Revolution or the Agricultural Revolution.

==Civilization makes its début (8000 - 3000 BC)==
Neolithic means &quot;new stone&quot;, even though agriculture was the crowning achievement of the period.  Civilizations started out small.  Agriculture at first tended to tie only small groups together.  These groups also all settled along rivers, important as a reliable and predictable source of water.  As time passed, families usually worked the same plot of land over successive generations, leading to the concept of ownership.

As agriculture became more and more widespread, people began to accumulate surpluses of food, meaning that a single family grew more than it consumed.  At the same time, the increasing tendency to remain in a single location put pressure on groups to protect themselves from other still nomadic peoples.  In addition, when peoples stayed rooted near one another, cultural and social bonds began to form.  People began to do things in similar ways (it is a property of human nature to want to belong).  Because of these factors, especially a surplus of food, labor began to specialize and branch out away from just farming.  When everyone did not have to farm all of the time to live, people began to become artisans and craftsmen.  Such developments also brought trade, and a class of merchants.  Merchants often travelled along the same routes.  Also, within individual villages, artisans contributed to the homogenization of culture.  Merchants caused further interaction and exchange, known as Cultural Diffusion.  Human religion also began to evolve.  Rising above the past nomadic &quot;religions&quot;, cultures developed a unified polytheism within their ranks, which led them to further bond themselves together.  Priests became a class as well.  As you can see, specialization of labor was a direct offshoot of an agricultural surplus.

The new societies had one problem, however: now that the labor was specialized, agricultural surpluses had to happen every year without a break if the new culture was to remain intact.  In stepped governments to fill the void.  Government most likely began with religious leaders, such as priests, exercising control. Governments also provided roads for their citizens and merchants.  They further cemented the bonds between people within villages and regions, unifying culture to the point that it might be called a ''civilization''.  However, governments needed a way to pay the laborers who built and worked on their projects.  Taxes thus first, perhaps unfortunately, appeared on the scene, usually in the form of a tax-in-kind (taking a portion of a product, such as grain from a farmer, the use of money was yet to appear).  Suddenly, all the parts of an ancient civilization appeared.  Governments soon fell into a type of system known as a monarchy, or rule by hereditary leaders (such as kings or princes).  The reason for this was two-fold: monarchy came naturally because it was like the family, with the parents on top and the children beneath; eventually the parents grew old and the children became adults and parents in their own right and the cycle continued.  Secondly, monarchy was predictable and reliable.  In an age without mass communication or speedy travel, it was important for any void left by the death of a leader to be filled quickly, without fuss and strife.  Most of the new governments were, however, small city-states, or independent countries composed of a city and some surrounding farmland.  This was the beginnings of the world's oldest civilizations in Ancient Mesopotamia.
'''
An insight into the spread of farming:'''

The spread of farming and early domestication of plants and animals was extensive, as the practices expanded from three specific regions (7000 BC) of the world to various other regions, spreading to five continents by the year 3000 BC. Agriculture first started in the Middle East around 10,000-9500 BC. By 7000 BC it had spread to the western part of the Indian subcontinent, and by 6000 BC, agriculture spread to Egypt. By 5000 BC, it had reached China, and around 2700 BC, corn was being farmed in Mesoamerica. The Middle East, covering the areas of modern day Turkey, Iraq, Palestine, and Israel, had domesticated cattle and pigs. They were also successful in the domestication and farming of several crops and plants like wheat, barley, rye, onions, peas, and grapes. The Mesoamericans had begun farming corn, beans, avocados, squash, pumpkins, and cotton. They had not domesticated any animals. In the Andes region (Peru), potatoes, tomatoes, lima beans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes were farmed. The Andeans had also domesticated the llama. The spread in the Middle East had the greatest expansion in terms of area. Sheep were domesticated in the greater Middle East; goats were originally domesticated in Central Europe, olives in the Mediterranean. Cotton was first farmed in the Indian sub-continent, and hemp, camels, and buckwheat were originally domesticated west of the Caspian Sea. Furthermore, in the Americas, the Mesoamericans expanded north and south, spreading farming and herding to Central and slightly further into North America. From there the practice extended to South America. The Andeans had minimum spread, expanding farming and herding to regions immediately around theirs. The farming and domestication of plants and animals, by 3000 BC, had been independently innovated in Southeast Asia, China, and North-central Africa. In Southeast Asia, rice, citrus, and chickens were originally farmed and domesticated.  The farming of millet and soybean was practiced in China. Sorghum and coffee were farmed originally in North-central Africa. In a brief period of 4000 years, humans had farmed and domesticated over thirty plants and animals. The spread of farming and herding had reached over five continents, and ten regions of the world.

==River Valley Civilizations==

The first civilizations came about in river valleys which provided a constant source of water for crops. Irrigation works were often needed which required leadership perhaps leading to the creation of the first states. In addition rivers facilitated travel helping a common culture spread along its banks. The four river valley civilizations were the worlds first and each shared many common characteristics.       
The four river valley civilizations: 
China(along the Yellow River aka. Huáng Hé) 
Indus Valley(Along the Indus River) 
Mesopotamia (Along the Tigris and Euphrates river)  
Egypt(Along the Nile)

Each Civilization had: 
*A form of writing 
*Cities
*Agriculture and surplus of food 
*A form of government(usually claiming divine right) 
*A polytheistic or henotheistic religion
*Art and Architecture 

Whereas historians argue on what exactly civilization is, writing, cities, agriculture, government, religion and art are usually on the list.

==Ancient Mesopotamia==

Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) was home to the world's first truly urban cultures -- societies featuring permanent cities whose populations were fed from the surrounding countryside, but themselves engaged in other activities besides agriculture, such as trade, specialist crafts and record-keeping.  From 4000 to 3000 BC,  the Sumerians established some of the first known cities in the then-moist land of Sumer (modern southern Iraq, called ''Ki-en-gir'' by the Sumerians).  It is not currently known with certainty where the Sumerians came from, but immigration from elsewhere seems probable; or, their myths suggested the sea.  From an anthropological viewpoint Sumerians belonged to the Caucasian, Mediterranean, Balkan European race.

Historians speculate that the first Sumerian settlers may have been driven by overpopulation or conflict, as Sumeria was superficially inhospitable to stone-age man; it lacked the stones needed in Neolithic life to make most tools. However, the early Sumerians discovered that mud could be dried and used as a building material, and the soil was rich in clay to use to make farm tools. Once the Sumerians began to plant, they realized that Sumeria's rich mud yielded far greater quantities of food than they could consume. This surplus resulted in some of the first known exports in history.  

Situated near the head of the Persian Gulf, Sumer was well-positioned for sea trade, as well as having land connections to neighbouring Anatolia and Elam (modern southern Iran), both of which harboured simpler cultures.  The early Sumerians began to trade their surplus grain with their neighbours for the items that Sumeria did not have, such as livestock and stone. This influx of goods (and therefore merchants) gave rise to some of the first true cities.  Sumerian cities spoke the same language and worshipped the same gods. However, they were not one, with whole cities being burnt to the ground in their inter-city warfare. A typical run-of-the-mill city-state consisted of the city proper and much of the country-side around it. Early Sumerian government was strictly theocratic, and governed everything from sacrifices to taxation to irrigation. Therefore, the central point of each city was its great platform/ziggurat in the centre. These ziggurats became the main form of the later Babylonian monument architecture in the same region.  

Writing in its strictest sense was first invented and used by the Mesopotamians around 3100 BC. It evolved out of a Mesopotamian trade tradition. When two merchants made an agreement, they would make clay models of the items being traded and then would seal them in a clay ball. However, if one of the merchants wanted to double check the quantities agreed upon in the contract, the merchants would need to break open the clay ball, literally breaking the contract. Therefore, the merchants began to scratch little picture of the items onto the outside of the clay ball. Eventually someone realized that the ball and models were no longer necessary. Later the Sumerians created more symbols for use in writing down laws and eventually even stories. This form of writing was called ''cuneiform''.

As many as a thousand clay tablets were found in the Uruk archaeological layer dating to the 30th century B.C. From Sumer, cuneiform script and civilization spread to all the peoples of Asia Minor (Assyrians, Hittites, Urartuans, etc). For instance, the ancient Asomtavruli alphabet of the modern Georgian language has ethno-cultural contacts with the Sumerian world. Georgian specialists study the similarity of Sumerian and Iberian-Caucasian languages. Sumerian remained the language of religion and science as the 2nd-1st millenium B.C. before its replacement by Semitic languages.  But Sumerian did not confide the Semites with the Majuscule alphabet, the secret spiritual alphabet that has a lot of similarity to ancient Georgian Asomtavruli alphabet. More than 200 Sumerian and Svanian terms are identical both phonetically and semantically. Sumerians created new simplified 22 simple letter-signs alphabet. The Semitic alphabet created by Sumerian scientists for Accadians laid the foundation for various people's writing creation and spreading (Moabs, Phoenicians, Hebrews, Greeks, Latins, Arabs and others) Sumerian sacral alphabet of 35 letter signs that concealed the Sun and the Moon calendar.

After flourishing for the better part of a millennium, Mesopotamia apparently experienced a climate change, which led to drought, exhaustion of the heavily-used soil, agricultural failure, and the decline of the Sumerian city-states that had become dependent on reliable surplus food production. Neighbouring peoples and tribes launched military incursions against the weakened city-states, resulting in political power shifts and the rise of new states and cities further north. Sumerologist Samuel Noah Kramer wrote &quot;in the last quarter of the 3rd millennium B.C. the Semites inhabiting the town of Akkad conquered Sumer and made the Sumerian scientists create an alphabet for them, which subsequently came to be called the Semitic&quot; This event took place in 2125 B.C.


===The Akkadians: The First Empire===

====Origins of Akkad====

Semitic speakers seem to have already been present in Mesopotamia at the dawn of the historical record, and soon achieved preeminence with the first Dynasty of Kish and numerous localities to the north of Sumer—where rulers with Semitic names had already established themselves by ca. the 3rd millennium BC. One of these, contemporary with the last Sumerian ruler, Lugal-Zage-Si of Uruk, was Alusarsid (or Urumus) who &quot;subdued Elam and Barahs (Barahsi?)&quot; thus beginning the trend towards regional empire.

The first known mention of Akkad is in an inscription of Enshakushanna of Uruk, where he claims to have defeated Agade—indicating that it was in existence well before the days of Sargon of Akkad, who the Sumerian kinglist claims to have built it. Sargon has often been cited as the first ruler of a combined empire of Akkad and Sumer, although more recently discovered data suggests there had been Sumerian expansions under previous kings, including Lugal-Anne-Mundu of Adab, Eannatum of Lagash, and Lugal-Zage-Si

====Sargon and his sons====

The fame of the early establisher of Semitic supremacy was far eclipsed by that of Sargon of Akkad (Sharru-kin = &quot;legitimate king&quot;, probably a title he took on gaining power[5]) (23rd century BC), who defeated and captured Lugal-Zage-Si, conquering his empire.

The earliest records in Akkadian all date to the time of Sargon. Sargon was claimed to be the son of La'ibum or Itti-Bel, a humble gardener, and possibly a hierodule, prostitute, or priestess to Ishtar or Inanna.

One legend related of Sargon in neo-Assyrian times says that &quot;My mother was a changeling, my father I knew not. The brothers of my father loved the hills. My city is Azurpiranu (the wilderness herb fields), which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates. My changeling mother conceived me, in secret she bore me. She set me in a basket of rushes, with bitumen she sealed my lid. She cast me into the river which rose not over me. The river bore me up and carried me to Akki, the drawer of water. Akki, the drawer of water, took me as his son and reared me. Akki the drawer of water, appointed me as his gardener. While I was gardener Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and (fifty?) ... years I exercised kingship.&quot;

Originally a cupbearer to a king of Kish with a Semitic name, Ur-Zababa, Sargon thus became a gardener, responsible for the task of clearing out irrigation canals. This gave him access to a disciplined corps of workers, who also may have served as his first soldiers. Displacing Ur-Zababa, the crown was set upon Sargon's head, and he entered upon a career of foreign conquest.[7] Four times he invaded Syria and Canaan, and he spent three years thoroughly subduing the countries of &quot;the west&quot; to unite them with Mesopotamia &quot;into a single empire.&quot;

However, Sargon took this process further, conquering many of the surrounding regions to create an empire that reached as far as the Mediterranean Sea and Anatolia, and extending his rule to Elam, and as far south as Magan (Oman), an area over which he reigned for 56 years. Trade extended from the silver mines of Anatolia to the lapis lazuli mines in Afghanistan, the cedars of Lebanon and the copper of Oman. This consolidation of the city-states of Sumer and Akkad reflected the growing economic and political power of Mesopotamia. The empire's breadbasket was the rain-fed agricultural system of northern Mesopotamia and a chain of fortresses was built to control the imperial wheat production.

Images of Sargon were erected on the shores of the Mediterranean, in token of his victories, and cities and palaces were built at home with the spoils of the conquered lands. Elam and the northern part of Mesopotamia (Subartu) were also subjugated and rebellions in Sumer were put down. Contract tablets have been found dated in the years of the campaigns against Canaan and against Sarlak, king of Gutium.

Sargon, throughout his long life, showed special deference to the Sumerian deities, particularly Inanna, his patroness, and Zababa, the warrior god of Kish. He called himself &quot;The anointed priest of Anu&quot; and &quot;the great ensi of Enlil&quot; and his daughter, Enheduanna the famous poet, was installed as priestess to Nanna at the temple in Ur.

He also boasted of having subjugated the &quot;four quarters&quot;—the lands surrounding Akkad to the north (Subartu), the south (Sumer), the east (Elam) and the west (Martu). Some of the earliest texts credit him with rebuilding the city of Babylon (Bab-ilu) in a new location.

Troubles multiplied toward the end of his reign. A later Babylonian text states &quot;In his old age, all the lands revolted against him, and they besieged him in Akkad (the city)&quot;…but &quot;he went forth to battle and defeated them, he knocked them over and destroyed their vast army&quot;. Also shortly after, &quot;the Subartu (mountainous tribes of) the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.

These difficulties broke out again in the reign of his sons. Revolts broke out during the 9-year reign of his son, Rimush, who fought hard to retain the empire—and in the fifteen year reign of Rimush's elder brother, Manishtushu. The latter king seems to have fought a sea battle against 32 kings who had gathered against him. Both appear to have been assassinated.

====Naram-Sin====

Naram-Sin (Beloved of Sin), Sargon's grandson, who assumed the imperial title of &quot;King Naram-Sin, of the four quarters (Lugal Naram-Sin, Šar kibrat 'arbaim)&quot;, and, like his grandfather, was addressed as &quot;the god (Sumerian = DIN.GIR, Akkadian = ilu) of Agade&quot; (Akkad), also faced revolts at the start of his reign.

Naram-Sin also recorded the Akkadian conquest of Ebla and Armani (also read Armanum or Armanim). The Assyrians, who are direct descendants of Akkadians, to this day refer to Armenians by the inscription from Armani. They were located between Carchemish and Ebla. To better police this area, he built a royal residence at Tell Brak, a crossroads at the heart of the Khabur basin of the Jezirah. Naram-Sin is supposed to have possessed an army of over 360,000 men, the largest size of any state up until that date. It enabled him to campaign against Magan (thought to be Oman) which also revolted; Naram-Sin, &quot;marched against Magan and personally caught Mandannu, its king&quot;. The chief threat seemed to be coming from the northeastern mountaineers. A campaign against the Lullubi led to the carving of the famous stele, now in the Louvre. This newfound Akkadian wealth may have been based upon benign climatic conditions, huge agricultural surpluses and the confiscation of the wealth of other peoples.[8]

The economy was highly planned. After the advancing Akkadian forces from Tell Brak took the massive (100 acre) site of Tell Leilan, they destroyed nearby villages and brought the organization of farming and grain distribution into its bureaucratic control. Grain was cleaned, and rations of grain and oil were distributed in standardized vessels made by the city's potters. Taxes were paid in produce and labour on public walls, including city walls, temples, irrigation canals and waterways, producing huge agricultural surpluses.

In later Babylonian texts, the name Akkad, together with Sumer, appears as part of the royal title, as in the Sumerian LUGAL KI.EN.GIRKI URUKI or Akkadian Šar māt Šumeri u Akkadi,[10] translating to &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;. This title was assumed by the king who seized control of Nippur,[11] the intellectual and religious centre of southern Mesopotamia.

During the Akkadian period, the Akkadian language became the lingua franca of the Middle East, and was officially used for administration, although the Sumerian language remained as a literary language. The spread of Akkadian stretched from Syria to Elam, and even the Elamite language was temporarily written in Mesopotamian cuneiform. Akkadian texts later found their way to far-off places, from Egypt (in the Amarna period) and Anatolia, to Persia (Behistun).

====Collapse of Akkad====

Within 100 years the Empire of Akkad collapsed, almost as fast as it had developed, ushering in a Dark Age. By the end of the reign of Naram-Sin's son, Shar-Kali-Sharri, the empire collapsed outright from the invasion of barbarians of the Zagros known as &quot;Gutians&quot;. It has recently been suggested that the Dark Age at the end of the Akkadian period (and First Intermediary Period of the Ancient Egyptian Old Kingdom) was associated with rapidly increasing aridity, and failing rainfall in the region of the Ancient Near East, caused by a global centennial-scale drought.[12]

The fall of the empire established by Sargon seems to have been as sudden as its rise, and little is known about the Gutian period. From the fall of Akkad until around 2100 BC, there is much that is still dark.

The Sumerian king list, for the period after the death of Sharkalishari, states:

Uruk was smitten with weapons and its kingship carried off by the Gutian hordes.

Evidence from Tell Leilan in Northern Mesopotamia shows what may have happened. The site was abandoned soon after the city's massive walls were constructed, its temple rebuilt and its grain production reorganised. The debris, dust and sand that followed show no trace of human activity. Soil samples show fine wind-blown sand, no trace of earthworm activity, reduced rainfall and indications of a drier and windier climate. Evidence shows that skeleton-thin sheep and cattle died of drought, and up to 28,000 people abandoned the site, seeking wetter areas elsewhere. Tell Brak shrank in size by 75%. Trade collapsed. Nomadic herders such as the Amorites moved herds closer to reliable water suppliers, bringing them into conflict with farmers. This climate-induced collapse seems to have affected the whole of the Middle East, and to have coincided with the collapse of the Egyptian Old Kingdom. A relatively well-known king from that period is Gudea, king of Lagash.

This collapse of rain-fed agriculture in &quot;the Upper Country&quot; meant the loss to southern Mesopotamia of the agrarian subsidies which had kept the Akkadian Empire solvent. Water levels within the Tigris and Euphrates fell 1.5 metres beneath the level of 2600 BC, and although they stabilised for a time during the following Ur III period, rivalries between pastoralists and farmers increased. Attempts were undertaken to prevent the former from herding their flocks in agricultural lands, such as the building of a 180 km wall between the Tigris and Euphrates under the neo-Sumerian ruler Shu-Sin. Such attempts led to increased political instability; meanwhile, severe depopulation occurred to re-establish demographic equilibrium with the less favourable climatic conditions.

It has also been suggested (Burroughs, 2007) that the rapid climatic collapse, marking the Akkadian Dark Age, may have been responsible for the religiously prescribed prohibition against the raising and consumption of pigs that spread through the Ancient Middle East from the end of the third millennium BC.

The period between ca. 2100 BC and 2000 BC is sometimes called the 3rd dynasty of Ur or &quot;Sumerian Renaissance&quot;, founded by Ur-Nammu (originally a general). Though documents again began to be written in Sumerian, this dynasty may also have been Semitic; Sumerian was becoming a purely literary or liturgical language, much as Latin later would be in Medieval Europe.

====The curse of Akkad====

Later material described how the fall of Akkad was due to Naram-Sin's attack upon the city of Nippur. When prompted by a pair of inauspicious oracles, the king sacked the E (temple)E-kur temple, supposedly protected by the god Enlil, head of the pantheon. As a result of this, eight chief deities of the Anunaki pantheon were supposed to have come together and withdrawn their support from Akkad.
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time since cities were built and founded,
The great agricultural tracts produced no grain,
The inundated tracts produced no fish,
The irrigated orchards produced neither syrup nor wine,
The gathered clouds did not rain, the masgurum did not grow.
At that time, one shekel's worth of oil was only one-half quart,
One shekel's worth of grain was only one-half quart. . . .
These sold at such prices in the markets of all the cities!
He who slept on the roof, died on the roof,
He who slept in the house, had no burial,
People were flailing at themselves from hunger.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For many years, the events described in &quot;The Curse of Akkad&quot; were thought, like the details of Sargon's birth, to be purely fictional. But now the evidence of Tel Leilan, and recent findings of elevated dust deposits in sea-cores collected off Oman, that date to the period of Akkad's collapse suggest that climate change may have been the culprit

===The Babylonians===
The Babylonians built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and sun baked clay houses.  They also introduced the convention of using 360 degrees in a circle, and of dividing the day into 24 hours, and each hour into 60 minutes.

===The Old Kingdom===
'''The Old Kingdom''' started circa 2700 BC during Egypt's 3rd dynasty. During this period of Egyptian history the Pharaohs were absolute rulers. It was during the Old Kingdom that the Great Pyramid was built as a tomb for Khufu, a Pharaoh during Egypt's 4th dynasty. The Old Kingdom failed at around 2150 BC for a number of reasons. These included the long life span of Pepi II, who ruled 94 years. Pepi II lived to be about 100 years of age, outliving many of his heirs. Additionally, the lower Nile inundation became irregular and led to failed harvests, which may have been caused by a drier climate.

===The First Intermediate Period===
Nomarches competed for control of Egypt and civil wars were common. Famines were common during this period and it is called the dark age of Egyptian History.

===The Middle Kingdom===
Egypt's Middle Kingdom was Egypt's golden age because of trading, and new conquest. It lasted from 2050-1650 BC. The Pharaohs period of this period called themselves good shepherds and they were not as powerful as they were during the Old Kingdom. Their pyramids were smaller. The Middle Kingdom ended because of weak Pharaohs and an invasion by Asiantic people called the Hyksos.

===The Second Intermediate Period===
The Hyksos ruled Lower Egypt from about 1650-1550 BC until the Thebean king named Ahmose I expelled them out of the country and started the New Kingdom.

===The New Kingdom===
During the New Kingdom Egypt was at its height of power. This period lasted from 1550-1070 BC, During this period Egypt became an empire when Thutmose III conquered Palestine, Syria, and Nubia this empire lasted to Amenhoptep VI who ended Egypt's worship of many gods in favour of one god Aton. Later his son Tutankhamen restored the old religion, Tutankhamen died at 18 leaving no heirs to the throne. Seti I restored some of Egypt's empire in Palestine and Syria and his son Ramses II fought the Hitties at Kadesh, then made the first peace treaty with them. He ruled for 67 years. The last great Pharaoh was Ramses III who was not a relative of Ramses II. He protected Egypt from invasion. About 1070 BC the New Kingdom ended.

===The Postdynastic Period===

== Ancient Indian Civilization==
The earliest known farming cultures in south Asia emerged in the hills of Balochistan, Pakistan, which included Mehrgarh in the 7th millennium BC. These semi-nomadic peoples domesticated wheat, barley, sheep, goat and cattle. Pottery was in use by the 6th millennium BC. Their settlement consisted of mud buildings that housed four internal subdivisions. Burials included elaborate goods such as baskets, stone and bone tools, beads, bangles, pendants and occasionally animal sacrifices. Figurines and ornaments of sea shell, limestone, turquoise, lapis lazuli, sandstone and polished copper have been found. By the 4th millennium BC we find much evidence of manufacturing. Technologies included stone and copper drills, updraft kilns, large pit kilns and copper melting crucibles. Button seals included geometric designs.

===Indus Valley civilization===

By 4000 BC a pre-Harappan culture emerged, with trade networks including lapis lazuli and other raw materials. Villagers domesticated numerous other crops, including peas, sesame seed, dates, and cotton, plus a wide range of domestic animals, including the water buffalo which still remains essential to intensive agricultural production throughout Asia today. There is also evidence of sea-going craft. Archaeologists have discovered a massive, dredged canal and docking facility at the coastal city of Lothal, India, perhaps the world's oldest sea-faring harbour. Judging from the dispersal of artifacts the trade networks integrated portions of Afghanistan, the Persian coast, northern and central India, Mesopotamia (see Meluhha) and Ancient Egypt (see Silk Road).

Archaeologists studying the remains of two men from Mehrgarh, Pakistan, discovered that these peoples in the Indus Valley Civilization had knowledge of medicine and dentistry as early as circa 3300 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization gains credit for the earliest known use of decimal fractions in a uniform system of ancient weights and measures, as well as negative numbers (see Timeline of mathematics). Ancient Indus Valley artifacts include beautiful, glazed stone faïence beads.

The Indus Valley Civilization boasts the earliest known accounts of urban planning. As seen in Harappa, Mohenjo-daro and (recently discovered) Rakhigarhi, their urban planning included the world's first urban sanitation systems. Evidence suggests efficient municipal governments. Streets were laid out in perfect grid patterns comparable to modern New York. Houses were protected from noise, odors and thieves. The sewage and drainage systems developed and used in cities throughout the Indus Valley were far more advanced than that of contemporary urban sites in Mesopotamia.

===Vedic Civilization===

The Vedic civilization is the Indo-Aryan culture associated with the Vedas, which are the oldest extant Indo-European texts, composed in Vedic Sanskrit. The exact connection of the genesis of this civilization with the Indus Valley civilization on one hand, and a possible Indo-Aryan migration on the other hand, is the subject of disputes. Early Vedic society was largely pastoral. Later on, the society became agricultural, and was organized around four Varnas, or classes. Several small kingdoms and tribes merged to form a few large ones which were often at war with each other.

In addition to the principle texts of Hinduism, (the Vedas), the great Indian epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the latter of which constitutes the longest poem in the world, are said to have been first written during this period, perhaps from a longer spoken tradition of unwritten recitation. The Bhagavad Gita, another primary text of Hinduism, is contained within the Mahabharata.

Early Indo-Aryan presence probably corresponds to the presence of ochre coloured pottery, archaeologically. The kingdom of the Kurus marks flowering of the Vedic civilization, corresponding to the Black and Red Ware and the beginning of the Iron Age in Northern India begins, around 1100 BC, likely also contemporary with the composition of the Atharvaveda. Painted Grey Ware spread over all of Northern India marks the late Vedic period, corresponding to a wave of urbanization occurred across the Indian sub-continent, spreading from Afghanistan to Bengal, in the 7th century BC. A number of kingdoms and republics emerged across the Indo-Gangetic plain and southern India during this period. 16 Mahajanapadas (great kingdoms) are referred to in ancient literature of the period.

===The Mahajanapadas===

By 600 BC, sixteen hereditary monarchies known as the Mahajanapadas stretched across the Indo-Gangetic plains from modern-day Afghanistan to Bangladesh. The largest of these nations were Magadha, Kosala, Kuru and Gandhara. The right of a king to his throne, no matter how it was gained, was usually legitimized through religious right and genealogies concocted by priests who ascribed to the king divine origins.

Hindu rituals at that time were complicated and conducted by the priestly class. It is thought that the Upanishads, the secondary texts of ancient Hinduism, dealing mainly with philosophy, were first composed early in this period. The court language at that time was Sanskrit, while the dialects of the general population of northern India were referred to as Prakrits. In 537 BC, Gautama Buddha gained enlightenment and thus founded Buddhism, which was initially intended as a supplement to the existing Hindu Vedic dharma. Around the same time period, in mid-6th century BC, Mahavira founded Jainism. Both religions had a simple doctrine and were preached in Prakrit which helped it gain acceptance by the masses. While the geographic impact of Jainism was limited, Buddhist nuns and monks spread their teachings of Buddha to Tibet, Sri Lanka and South East Asia.

In around 500 BC, the Indus Valley region was invaded by the Persian ruler Darius I making the far north-west of India a satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire. Though the Persians made Taxila the capital, their influence was marginal and governed the region for around 150 years. The Persians were defeated by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC. In 326 BC, Alexander the Great crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and invaded what is now Pakistan. However, costly campaigns against the forces of Porus(also known as Puru), and the tired troops forced him to retreat to his empire after reaching the Beas River in Punjab. He appointed Greek governors to rule the newly acquired province to keep open trade routes between India and Greece.

====Maurya Dynasty====

In 321 BC, exiled general Chandragupta Maurya overthrew reigning king Dhana Nanda to establish the Mauryan Empire. Chandragupta was succeeded by his son Bindusara, who expanded the kingdom over most of present day India, barring the extreme south and east. During this time, most of the subcontinent was united under a single government for the first time.

The kingdom was inherited by his son Ashoka the Great who initially sought to expand his kingdom. In the aftermath of the carnage caused in the invasion of Kalinga, he renounced bloodshed and pursued a policy of non-violence or ahimsa after converting to Buddhism. The Edicts of Ashoka are the oldest preserved historical documents of India, and from Ashoka's time, approximate dating of dynasties becomes possible. The Mauryan dynasty under Ashoka was responsible for the proliferation of Buddhist ideals across the whole of East Asia and South East Asia, fundamentally altering the history and development of Asia. Ashoka the Great has been described as one of the greatest rulers the world has seen.

====Shunga Dynasty====

The Sunga dynasty was established in 185 BC, about 50 years after Ashoka's death, when the king Brihadratha, the last of the Mauryan rulers, was brutally murdered by the then commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, Pusyamitra Sunga, while he was taking the Guard of Honour of his forces. Pusyamitra Sunga then ascended the throne.

== Ancient Chinese Civilization ==
The earliest written record of China's takes the form of inscriptions of divination records on the bones or shells of animals—so-called &quot;oracle bones&quot;. 

The earliest comprehensive history of China, the &quot;Historical Records&quot; written by Sima Qian, a renowned Chinese historiographer of the 2nd century BC, begins perhaps 3600 BC with an account of the Five Emperors (五帝). These rulers were legendary sage-kings and moral exemplars, and one of them, the Yellow Emperor, is sometimes said to be the ancestor of all Chinese people. Following this period Sima Qian relates that a system of inherited rulership was established during the Xia dynasty, and that this model was perpetuated in the successor Shang and Zhou dynasties. It is during this period of the Three Dynasties (Chinese: 三代) that the historical China begins to appear.

===Xia Dynasty===
Sima Qian's account dates the founding of the Xia Dynasty (夏) to some 4,000 years ago, but this date has not yet been corroborated. Some archaeologists connect the Xia to excavations at Erlitou in central Henan province, where a bronze smelter from around 2000 BC was unearthed. Early markings from this period, found on pottery and shells, have been alleged to be ancestors of modern Chinese characters, but such claims are unsupported. With no clear written records to match the Shang oracle bones or the Zhou bronze vessel writings, the Xia remains poorly understood.

===Shang Dynasty===
Archaeological findings provide evidence for the existence of the Shang dynasty (商), ca. 1600 to 1046 BC, and the archaeological evidence is divided into two sets. The first, from the earlier Shang period (ca. 1600 to 1300) comes from sources at Erligang, Zhengzhou and Shangcheng. The second set, from the later Shang or Yin period, consists of a large body of oracle bone writings. Anyang in modern day Henan has been confirmed as the last of the six capitals of the Shang (ca. 1300 to 1046 BC).

Chinese historians living in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another, but the actual political situation in early China is known to have been much more complicated. Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can possibly refer to political entities that existed at the same time, just as the early Zhou (successor state of the Shang), is known to have existed at the same time as the Shang.
What was the religion?

===Zhou Dynasty===
By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Zhou Dynasty (周) began to emerge in the Huanghe valley, overrunning the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi-feudal system. Nevertheless, power became decentralized during the Spring and Autumn Period when regional feudal lords began to assert their power, absorb smaller powers, and vie for hegemony. The Hundred Schools of Thought of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period and such influential intellectual movements as Confucianism, Taoism, Legalism and Mohism were founded. After further political consolidation, seven prominent states remained by the end of 5th century BC, and the years in which these few states battled each other is known as the Warring States period. Though there remained a nominal Zhou king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.

Meanwhile, neighboring territories of these warring states were gradually annexed, including areas of modern Sichuan and Liaoning, and governed under the new local administrative system of commandery and prefecture (郡县), which had been in use since the Spring and Autumn Period and was very loosely a primitive prototype of the modern system of Sheng and Xian (province and county). The final expansion in this period began during the reign of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi in 214 BC enabled him to proclaim himself the First Emperor (始皇帝，Shi Huangdi), forming the first Chinese empire under the Qin Dynasty (秦), that laid the foundation for the consolidation of the Chinese territories that we know today.

==The Hittites==
The Hittites were the prescendants of the Caucasian Kartvelian group of nations and were the descendants of Sumerians. Their innovations in the design of chariots, moving the wheel to the centre from the back, gave them a military advantage over other civilizations. Another point of note is that the first international peace treaty was signed by the Hittites and the Egyptians after the Battle of Kadesh. The original copy is kept in the headquarters of the United Nations. After 600 years as a major empire in the Ancient Middle East the Hittites, crippled by the attacks of the Sea Peoples abandoned their capital, Hattusa, and seemed to vanish from history.

==The Assyrians==
The Assyrians were a civilization located near modern Iraq, along the Tigris River. The Assyrians eventually grew to occupy modern-day Iraq, northern Egypt, the eastern parts of Asia Minor and modern-day Jordan.

Assyria started around 2000 BC with Semitic barbarians invading the area and establishing the roots for a civilization. By 1800 BC the Assyrians had firm control over most of northern Mesopotamia, but later lost it to the Babylonians.

By 1076 BC, the Assyrians reached the Mediterranean coast. The Empire reached it's peak at around 1000 to 700 BC, with the conquering of northern Egypt and Babylon. However, the Assyrians were very harsh with the lands they conquered, and thus it's citizens were very unhappy with the ruling class. By 600 BC, their capital, Nineveh, fell to the revolting vassal states, including Babylon. Soon after, the Assyrians existed only in the history books.

Though the Assyrians did not advance far in the fields of science and technology, philosophy or the arts, they were mentioned in Biblical records for being great warriors, and their tactics of war would influence later powers, such as the Persians.

==The Persians==
The Persian Empire started in the north west corner of what is now Iran. It grew through military conquest to cover a huge region that roughly encompasses today's Iran, Iraq, Armenia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Bulgaria, many parts of Greece, Egypt, Syria, much of what is now Pakistan, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Caucasia, Central Asia, Libya, and northern parts of Arabia. The empire eventually became the largest empire of the ancient world.
Persepolis was the ceremonial capitol of Persia. Susa and Pasargadas also acted as capital cities at different times in Persian history. They were all in what is now Iran.

=== What did they eat?===

The food prepared for Persian kings was luxurious. Persians ate stews made from meat and fruit with herbs. They ate rice and bread made with wheat. Yoghurt was also a staple in Persian food. Tablets from the time of these ancient peoples indicate that the inhabitants of Mesopotamia were using basil, cilantro, cumin and caraway in their food in 4,000 BC. Apricots, artichokes, eggplants, lemons, lime, oranges, pistachios, spinach, saffron or tarragon all came to Europe through Persia. Other condiments and spices such as cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, coriander, dill, nutmeg, pomegranates, saffron, sumac, turmeric, as well as orange-flower water and rose water were used in Persian food. Lamb and goat were the primary meats eaten by Persians.

===What did their buildings look like?===
Persians made very interesting buildings. The Ruins at Persepolis are an example of ancient Persian buildings. Persians were among the first to use mathematics, geometry, and astronomy in their building. Their buildings were grand and were created by skillful workers. Some Persian buildings had huge barrel-vaulted chambers. The Persians created huge domes of rock and clay and supported their roofs with tall columns. They also decorated the walls of their palaces with lions, bulls and flowers.
The Kharaghan twin towers and the Shah Mosque are two other old buildings built in a Persian style.

===What did they wear?===
The Persian king wore a robe of honour that was a large piece of fabric that was draped around him. For the king and other aristocracy, their clothes were often decorated with golden clothing ornaments. Some of these are in the form of roundels, while others are gold plaques with loops or rings on the back so they can be sewn onto the cloth. Rich people also liked to wear gold jewelry such as bracelets with animal head carvings.
Common people wore coats and pants made out of leather. Men's coats reached from their shoulders down to their knees and were fastened with a girdle. Their sleeves were somewhat tight and went down to their wrists.
Originally woman's clothing was quite similar to men's clothing but as time went their style changed. Initially their clothes were short and tight but when the style changed their clothes were made longer, more voluminous and were made out of softer materials.
Persian shoes were usually just pieces of leather that were wrapped around their feet and were tied up on the top. These would have look similar to moccasins.

===What did their writing look like?===
Old Persian was written from left to right in Old Persian cuneiform script. Old Persian cuneiform script was supposably invented by King Darius I, one of ancient Persia's famous kings. There were 36 letters in their alphabet, although some of them essentially represented different syllables. For example they had one symbol for &quot;ka&quot; and another symbol for &quot;ku&quot;. They used these symbols even though they also had symbols that represented &quot;a&quot; and &quot;u&quot;.

===What did they believe?===
The Persian civilization spawned three major religions: Zoroastrianism, Mithraism, and Manichaeanism.
The Persian thinker Zoroaster (who propagated Zoroastrianism) was the main religious movement leader. Living around 3500 years ago, he helped to unite the Persian empire. He rejected the old Persian gods and introduced that a single wise god, Ahura Mazda, ruled the world. However, Ahura Mazda was often in battle with the prince of evil and lies, Ahriman. On Earth, each person had to choose which side to support.
Zoroaster's teaching were written in a book, the Zend-Avesta. It said that Ahura Mazda would conquer over the forces of evil, Ahriman, at the end. On that day, all the people would be judges for their actions. Those who did good would enter paradise. Those who did evil would be condemned to eternal suffering.

===Are some of them famous even today?===
Of course, but perhaps the most famous Persian of all time is Cyrus the Great who founded the Persian Empire. In fact, in 1992 he was ranked #87 on Michael H. Hart's list of the most influential figures in history. Other famous Persian kings were Cambises and Darius the Great.
Darius III is famous only because he suffered under the hands of Alexander the Great of Greece. During Darius' reign, the whole Persian Empire was destroyed by Alexander, who first attacked the Persians in what is now modern Turkey. He then moved on into the heart of the Empire where he captured the capital Susa. Darius ran away from battle against Alexander twice, but was murdered by his governor Bessus who wanted the throne for himself. Alexander was angry this happened and respected his dead opponent. He held a great funeral for the dead king. Later, Bessus was captured and executed.


===What is left of them today?===
Persians are one of the only ancient civilizations that has made significant contributions to humanity from prehistoric times by their Persian empire all the way through to the modern day in their country Iran. Most Persians are now Muslims, although there are Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians still living and practising their religion in Iran. There are also some Persians, called Parsis, living in mainly the north and west of India.

'''Functional programming''' is a paradigm that treats computer programs as mathematical functions.  When programming in a pure functional style, we do not manipulate states and variables (things that change value), but focus entirely on constants and functions (things that never change).  Another distinguishing feature of functional programming (FP) is that functions are treated as first class citizens. Programs written in a functional style often consist of functions that take other functions as input.  This is a key feature of FP languages because it makes it very easy to build modular programs.  The result is that software written in FP languages tend to be very concise.  Indeed, one group of programmers in Utrecht University was able to build [http://www.cs.uu.nl/dazzle/ a tool] for &quot;constructing, editing and analyzing Bayesian
networks&quot; in only 10 000 lines of Haskell code, graphical interface included.  An equivalent program in Java took 200 000 lines, twenty times as much.

==Introduction==
Programmers are procrastinators. Get in, get some coffee, check the mailbox, read the RSS feeds, read the news, check out latest articles on technical websites, browse through political discussions on the designated sections of the programming forums. Rinse and repeat to make sure nothing is missed. Go to lunch. Come back, stare at the IDE for a few minutes. Check the mailbox. Get some coffee. Before you know it, the day is over.

The only thing, every once in a while challenging articles actually do pop up. If you're looking at the right places you'll find at least one of these every couple of days. These articles are hard to get through and take some time, so they start piling up. Before you know it, you have a list of links and a folder full of PDF files and you wish you had a year in a small hut in the middle of the forest with nobody around for miles so you could catch up. Would be nice if someone came in every morning while you're taking a walk down the river to bring some food and take out the garbage.

I don't know about your list, but a large chunk of the articles in mine are about functional programming. These generally are the hardest to get through. Written in a dry academic language, even the &quot;ten year Wall Street industry veterans&quot; don't understand what functional programming (also referred to as ''FP'') articles are all about. If you ask a project manager in Citi Group or in Deutsche Bank&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#ask-a-manager 1]&lt;/sup&gt; why they chose to use JMS instead of Erlang they'll say they can't use academic languages for industrial strength applications. The problem is, some of the most complex systems with the most rigid requirements are written using functional programming elements. Something doesn't add up.

It's true that FP articles and papers are hard to understand, but they don't have to be. The reasons for the knowledge gap are purely historical. There is nothing inherently hard about FP concepts. Consider this article &quot;an accessible guide to FP&quot;, a bridge from our imperative minds into the world of FP. Grab a coffee and keep on reading. With any luck your coworkers will start making fun of you for your FP comments in no time.

So what is FP? How did it come about? Is it edible? If it's as useful as its advocates claim, why isn't it being used more often in the industry? Why is it that only people with PhDs tend to use it? Most importantly, why is it so damn hard to learn? What is all this closure, continuation, currying, lazy evaluation and no side effects business? How can it be used in projects that don't involve a university? Why does it seem to be so different from everything good, and holy, and dear to our imperative hearts? We'll clear this up very soon. Let's start with explaining the reasons for the huge gap between the real world and academic articles. The answer is as easy as taking a walk in the park.

==A Walk In The Park==
Fire up the time machine. Our walk in the park took place more than two thousand years ago, on a beautiful sunny day of a long forgotten spring in 380 B.C. Outside the city walls of Athens, under the pleasant shade of olive trees Plato was walking towards the Academy with a beautiful slave boy. The weather was lovely, the dinner was filling, and the conversation turned to philosophy.

&quot;Look at these two students&quot;, said Plato carefully picking words to make the question educational. &quot;Who do you think is taller?&quot; The slave boy looked towards the basin of water where two men were standing. &quot;They're about the same height&quot;, he said. &quot;What do you mean 'about the same'?&quot;, asked Plato. &quot;Well, they look the same from here but I'm sure if I were to get closer I'd see that there is some difference.&quot;

Plato smiled. He was leading the boy in the right direction. &quot;So you would say that there is nothing perfectly equal in our world?&quot; After some thinking the boy replied: &quot;I don't think so. Everything is at least a little different, even if we can't see it.&quot; The point hit home! &quot;Then if nothing is perfectly equal in this world, how do you think you understand the concept of 'perfect' equality?&quot; The slave boy looked puzzled. &quot;I don't know&quot;, he replied.

So was born the first attempt to understand the nature of mathematics. Plato suggested that everything in our world is just an approximation of perfection. He also realized that we understand the concept of perfection even though we never encountered it. He came to conclusion that perfect mathematical forms must live in another world and that we somehow know about them by having a connection to that &quot;alternative&quot; universe. It's fairly clear that there is no perfect circle that we can observe. But we also understand what a perfect circle is and can describe it via equations. What is mathematics, then? Why is the universe described with mathematical laws? Can all of the phenomena of our universe be described by mathematics?&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#universe-math 2]&lt;/sup&gt;

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics Philosophy of mathematics] is a very complex subject. Like most philosophical disciplines it is far more adept at posing questions rather than providing answers. Much of the consensus revolves around the fact that mathematics is really a puzzle: we set up a set of basic non-conflicting principles and a set of rules on how to operate with these principles. We can then stack these rules together to come up with more complex rules. Mathematicians call this method a &quot;formal system&quot; or a &quot;calculus&quot;. We can effectively write a formal system for Tetris if we wanted to. In fact, a working implementation of Tetris ''is'' a formal system, just specified using an unusual representation.

A civilization of furry creatures on Alpha Centauri would not be able to read our formalisms of Tetris and circles because their only sensory input might be an organ that senses smells. They likely will never find out about the Tetris formalism, but they very well might have a formalism for circles. We probably wouldn't be able to read it because our sense of smell isn't that sophisticated, but once you get past the ''representation'' of the formalism (via various sensory instruments and standard code breaking techniques to understand the ''language''), the concepts underneath are understandable to any intelligent civilization.

Interestingly if no intelligent civilization ever existed in the universe the formalisms for Tetris and circles would still hold water, it's just that nobody would be around to find out about them. If an intelligent civilization popped up, it would likely discover some formalisms that help describe the laws of our universe. They also would be very unlikely to ever find out about Tetris because there is nothing in the universe that resembles it. Tetris is one of countless examples of a formal system, a puzzle, that has nothing to do with the real world. We can't even be sure that natural numbers have full resemblance to the real world, after all one can easily think of a number so big that it cannot describe anything in our universe since it might actually turn out to be finite.

==A Bit of History&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#history 3]&lt;/sup&gt;==
Let's shift gears in our time machine. This time we'll travel a lot closer, to the 1930s. [[w:Great_depression|The Great Depression]] was ravaging the New and the Old worlds. Almost every family from every social class was affected by the tremendous economic downturn. Very few sanctuaries remained where people were safe from the perils of poverty. Few people were fortunate enough to be in these sanctuaries, but they did exist. Our interest lies in mathematicians in Princeton University.

The new offices constructed in Gothic style gave Princeton an aura of a safe haven. Logicians from all over the world were invited to Princeton to build out a new department. While most of America couldn't find a piece of bread for dinner, high ceilings, walls covered with elaborately carved wood, daily discussions by a cup of tea, and walks in the forest were some of the conditions in Princeton.

One mathematician living in such lavish lifestyle was a young man named [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church Alonzo Church]. Alonzo received a B.S. degree from Princeton and was persuaded to stay for graduate school. Alonzo felt the architecture was fancier than necessary. He rarely showed up to discuss mathematics with a cup of tea and he didn't enjoy the walks in the woods. Alonzo was a loner: he was most productive when working on his own. Nevertheless Alonzo had regular contacts with other Princeton inhabitants. Among them were [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_turing Alan Turing], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_neumann John von Neumann], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel Kurt Gödel].

The four men were interested in formal systems. They didn't pay much heed to the physical world, they were interested in dealing with abstract mathematical puzzles instead. Their puzzles had something in common: the men were working on answering questions about ''computation.'' If we had machines that had infinite computational power, what problems would we be able to solve? Could we solve them automatically? Could some problems remain unsolved and why? Would various machines with different designs be equal in power?

In cooperation with other men Alonzo Church developed a formal system called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus lambda calculus.] The system was essentially a programming language for one of these imaginary machines. It was based on functions that took other functions as parameters and returned functions as results. The function was identified by a Greek letter lambda, hence the system's name&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#lambda 4]&lt;/sup&gt;. Using this formalism Alonzo was able to reason about many of the above questions and provide conclusive answers.

Independently of Alonzo Church, Alan Turing was performing similar work. He developed a different formalism (now referred to as the Turing machine), and used it to independently come to similar conclusions as Alonzo. Later it was shown that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machines Turing machines] and lambda calculus were equivalent in power.

This is where the story would stop, I'd wrap up the article, and you'd navigate to another page, if not for the beginning of World War II. The world was in flames. The U.S. Army and Navy used artillery more often than ever. In attempts to improve accuracy the Army employed a large group of mathematicians to continuously calculate differential equations required for solving ballistic firing tables. It was becoming obvious that the task was too great for being solved manually and various equipment was developed in order to overcome this problem. The first machine to solve ballistic tables was a Mark I built by IBM - it weighed five tons, had 750,000 parts and could do three operations per second.

The race, of course, wasn't over. In 1949 an Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (''EDVAC'') was unveiled and had tremendous success. It was a first example of von Neumann's architecture and was effectively a real world implementation of a Turing machine. For the time being Alonzo Church was out of luck.

In late 1950s an MIT professor [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_%28computer_scientist%29 John McCarthy] (also a Princeton graduate) developed interest in Alonzo Church's work. In 1958 he unveiled a List Processing language (Lisp). Lisp was an implementation of Alonzo's lambda calculus that worked on von Neumann computers! Many computer scientists recognized the expressive power of Lisp. In 1973 a group of programmers at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab developed hardware they called a Lisp machine - effectively a native hardware implementation of Alonzo's lambda calculus!

==Functional Programming==
Functional programming is a practical implementation of Alonzo Church's ideas. Not all lambda calculus ideas transform to practice because lambda calculus was not designed to work under physical limitations. Therefore, like object oriented programming, functional programming is a set of ideas, not a set of strict guidelines. There are many functional programming languages, and most of them do many things very differently. In this article I will explain the most widely used ideas from functional languages using examples written in Java (yes, you could write functional programs in Java if you felt particularly masochistic). In the next couple of sections we'll take Java as is, and will make modifications to it to transform it into a usable functional language. Let's begin our quest.

Lambda calculus was designed to investigate problems related to ''calculation.'' Functional programming, therefore, primarily deals with calculation, and, surprisingly, uses functions to do so. A function is a very basic unit in functional programming. Functions are used for almost everything, even the simplest of calculations. Even variables are replaced with functions. In functional programming variables are simply aliases for expressions (so we don't have to type everything on one line). They cannot be modified. All variables can only be assigned to once. In Java terms this means that every single variable is declared as ''final'' (or ''const'' if we're dealing with C++). There are no non-final variables in FP.
 
 final int i = 5;
 final int j = i + 3;

Since every variable in FP is final two fairly interesting statements can be made. It does not make sense to always write the keyword ''final'' and it does not make sense to call variables, well... variables. We will now make two modifications to Java: every variable declared in our functional Java will be final by default, and we will refer to variables as ''symbols.''

By now you are probably wondering how you could possibly write anything reasonably complicated in our newly created language. If every symbol is non-mutable we cannot change the state of anything! This isn't strictly true. When Alonzo was working on lambda calculus he wasn't interested in maintaining state over periods of time in order to modify it later. He was interested in performing operations on data (also commonly referred to as &quot;calculating stuff&quot;). However, it was proved that lambda calculus is equivalent to a Turing machine. It can do all the same things an imperative programming language can. How, then, can we achieve the same results?

It turns out that functional programs can keep state, except they don't use variables to do it. They use functions instead. The state is kept in function parameters, on the stack. If you want to keep state for a while and every now and then modify it, you write a recursive function. As an example, let's write a function that reverses a Java string. Remember, every variable we declare is final by default&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#strings-final 5]&lt;/sup&gt;.

 
 String reverse(String arg) {
     if(arg.length == 0) {
         return arg;
     }
     else {
         return reverse(arg.substring(1, arg.length)) + arg.substring(0, 1);
     }
 }

This function is slow because it repeatedly calls itself&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#tail-calls 6]&lt;/sup&gt;. It's a memory hog because it repeatedly allocates objects. But it's functional in style. You may be interested why someone would want to program in this manner. Well, I was just about to tell you.

==Benefits of FP==
You're probably thinking that there's no way I can rationalize the monstrosity of a function above. When I was learning functional programming I was thinking that too. I was wrong. There are very good arguments for using this style. Some of them are subjective. For example, people claim that functional programs are easier to understand. I will leave out these arguments because every kid on the block knows that ease of understanding is in the eye of the beholder. Fortunately for me, there are plenty of objective arguments.

===Unit Testing===
Since every symbol in FP is final, no function can ever cause side effects. You can never modify things in place, nor can one function modify a value outside of its scope for another function to use (like a class member or a global variable). That means that the only effect of evaluating a function is its return value and the only thing that affects the return value of a function is its arguments.

This is something unit testers will find very useful. You can test every function in your program only worrying about its arguments. You don't have to worry about calling functions in the right order, or setting up external state properly. This means you can spend less time worrying about writing mocks, stubs and other forms of fake objects and less time verifying that setup and tear down methods are run by the test suite. All you need to do is pass arguments that represent edge cases. If every function in your program passes unit tests you can be a lot more confident about quality of your software than if you were using an imperative language. In Java or C++ checking a return value of a function is not sufficient - it may modify external state that we would need to verify. Not so in a functional language.

===Debugging===
If a functional program doesn't behave the way you expect it to, debugging it is a breeze. You will always be able to reproduce your problem because a bug in a functional program doesn't depend on unrelated code paths that were executed before it. In an imperative program a bug resurfaces only some of the time. Because functions depend on external state produced by side effects from other functions you may have to go through a series of steps in no way related to the bug. In a functional program this isn't the case - if a return value of a function is wrong, it is ''always'' wrong, regardless of what code you execute before running the function.

Once you reproduce the problem, getting to the bottom of it is trivial. It is almost pleasant. You break the execution of your program and examine the stack. Every argument in every function call in the stack is available for your inspection, just like in an imperative program. Except in an imperative program that's not enough because functions depend on member variables, global variables, and the state of other classes (which in turn depend on these very same things). A function in a functional program depends ''only'' on its arguments, and that information is right before your eyes! Furthermore, in an imperative program examining a return value of a function will not give you a good idea of whether the function behaves properly. You need to hunt down dozens of objects outside its scope to verify that it performed correct actions. In a functional program all you have to do is look at the return value!

Walking through the stack you look at arguments passed to functions and their return values. The minute a return value doesn't make sense you step into the offending function and walk through it. You repeat this recursively until the process leads you to the source of the bug!

===Concurrency===
A functional program is ready for concurrency without any further modifications. You never have to worry about deadlocks and race conditions because you don't need to use locks! No piece of data in a functional program is modified twice by the same thread, let alone by two different threads. That means you can easily add threads without ever giving conventional problems that plague concurrency applications a second thought!

If this is the case, why doesn't anybody use functional programs for highly concurrent applications? Well, it turns out that they do. Ericsson designed a functional language called [http://www.erlang.org/ Erlang] for use in its highly tolerant and scalable telecommunication switches. Many others recognized the benefits provided by Erlang and started [http://www.erlang.org/faq/t1.html#AEN50 using it]. We're talking about telecommunication and traffic control systems that are far more scalable and reliable than typical systems designed on Wall Street. Erlang systems are simply rock solid.

The concurrency story doesn't stop here. If your application is inherently single threaded the compiler can still optimize functional programs to run on multiple CPUs. Take a look at the following code fragment:

 
 String s1 = somewhatLongOperation1();
 String s2 = somewhatLongOperation2();
 String s3 = concatenate(s1, s2);

In a functional language the compiler could analyze the code, classify the functions that create strings ''s1'' and ''s2'' as potentially time consuming operations, and run them concurrently. This is impossible to do in an imperative language because each function may modify state outside of its scope and the function following it may depend on it. In functional languages automatic analysis of functions and finding good candidates for concurrent execution is as trivial as automatic inlining! In this sense functional style programs are &quot;future proof&quot; (as much as I hate buzzwords, I'll indulge this time). Hardware manufacturers can no longer make CPUs run any faster. Instead they increase the number of cores and attribute quadruple speed increases to concurrency. Of course they conveniently forget to mention that we get our money's worth only on software that deals with parallelization problems. This is a very small fraction of imperative software but 100% of functional software because functional programs all support parallelization out of the box.

===Hot Code Deployment===
In the old days of Windows in order to install updates it was necessary to restart the computer. Many times. After installing a newer version of a media player. With Windows XP the situation has improved significantly, yet it still isn't ideal (I ran Windows Update at work today and now an annoying system tray icon won't go away until I restart). Unix systems have had a better model for a while. In order to install an update you only need to stop relevant components, not the whole OS. While it is a better situation, for a large class of server applications it still isn't acceptable. Telecommunication systems need to be up 100% of the time because if dialing emergency is not available due to upgrades, lives may be lost. There is no reason Wall Street firms need to bring down their systems to install software updates over the weekend.

An ideal situation is updating relevant parts of the code without stopping any part of the system at all. In an imperative world this isn't possible. Consider unloading a Java class at runtime and reloading a new definition. If we were to do that every instance of a class would become unusable because the state it holds would be lost. We would need to resort to writing tricky version control code. We'd need to serialize all running instances of the class, destroy them, create instances of the new class, try to load serialized data into them hoping the loading code properly migrates the data to work with the new instance. On top of that, every time we change something we'd have to write our migration code manually. And our migration code would have to take special care not to break relationships between objects. Nice in theory, but would never work well in practice.

In a functional program all state is stored on the stack in the arguments passed to functions. This makes hot deployment significantly easier! In fact, all we'd really have to do is run a diff between the code in production and the new version, and deploy the new code. The rest could be done by language tools automatically! If you think this is science fiction, think again. Erlang engineers have been [http://www.erlang.org/doc/doc-5.5/doc/reference_manual/code.html#12.3 upgrading] live systems without stopping them for years.

===Machine Assisted Proofs and Optimizations===
An interesting property of functional languages is that they can be reasoned about mathematically. Since a functional language is simply an implementation of a formal system, all mathematical operations that could be done on paper still apply to the programs written in that language. The compiler could, for example, convert pieces of code into equivalent but more efficient pieces with a mathematical proof that two pieces of code are equivalent&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#proof 7]&lt;/sup&gt;. Relational databases have been performing these optimizations for years. There is no reason the same techniques can't apply to regular software.

Additionally, you can use these techniques to prove that parts of your program are correct. It is even possible to create tools that analyze code and generate edge cases for unit tests automatically! This functionality is invaluable for rock solid systems. If you are designing pace makers and air traffic control systems such tools are almost always a requirement. If you are writing an application outside of truly mission critical industries, these tools can give you a tremendous edge over your competitors.

==Higher Order Functions==
I remember learning about the benefits I outlined above and thinking &quot;that's all very nice but it's useless if I have to program in a crippled language where everything is final.&quot; This was a misconception. Making all variables final ''is'' crippled in a context of an imperative language like Java but it isn't in a context of functional languages. Functional languages offer a different kind of abstraction tools that make you forget you've ever ''liked'' modifying variables. One such tool is capability to work with ''higher order functions.''

A function in such languages is different from a function in Java or C. It is a superset - it can do all the things a Java function can do, and more. We create a function in the same manner we do in C:

 
 int add(int i, int j) {
     return i + j;
 }

This means something different from equivalent C code. Let's extend our Java compiler to support this notation. When we type something like this our compiler will convert it to the following Java code (don't forget, everything is final):

 
 class add_function_t {
     int add(int i, int j) {
         return i + j;
     }
 }
 
 add_function_t add = new add_function_t();

The symbol ''add'' isn't really a function. It is a small class with one function as its member. We can now pass ''add'' around in our code as an argument to other functions. We can assign it to another symbol. We can create instances of ''add_function_t'' at runtime and they will be garbage collected when we no longer need them. This makes functions ''first class objects'' no different from integers or strings. Functions that operate on other functions (accept them as arguments) are called ''higher order functions.'' Don't let this term intimidate you, it's no different from Java classes that operate on each other (we can pass class instances to other classes). We can call them &quot;higher order classes&quot; but nobody cares to because there is no strong academic community behind Java.

How, and when, do you use higher order functions? Well, I'm glad you asked. You write your program as a big monolithic blob of code without worrying about class hierarchies. When you see that a particular piece of code is repeated, you break it out into a function (fortunately they still teach this in schools). If you see that a piece of logic within your function needs to behave differently in different situations, you break it out into a higher order function. Confused? Here's a real life example from my work.

Suppose we have a piece of Java code that receives a message, transforms it in various ways, and forwards it to another server.
 
 class MessageHandler {
     void handleMessage(Message msg) {
         // ...
         msg.setClientCode(&quot;ABCD_123&quot;);
         // ...
         
         sendMessage(msg);
     }
     
     // ...
 }

Now imagine that our system has changed and we now route messages to two servers instead of one. Everything is handled in exactly the same way except the client code - the second server wants it in a different format. How do we handle this situation? We could check where the message is headed and format the client code differently, like this:
 
 class MessageHandler {
     void handleMessage(Message msg) {
         // ...
         if(msg.getDestination().equals(&quot;server1&quot;) {
             msg.setClientCode(&quot;ABCD_123&quot;);
         } else {
             msg.setClientCode(&quot;123_ABC&quot;);
         }
         // ...
         
         sendMessage(msg);
     }
     
     // ...
 }

This approach, however, isn't scalable. If more servers are added our function will grow linearly and we'll have a nightmare updating it. An object oriented approach is to make ''MessageHandler'' a base class and specialize the client code operation in derived classes:
 
 abstract class MessageHandler {
     void handleMessage(Message msg) {
         // ...
         msg.setClientCode(getClientCode());
         // ...
         
         sendMessage(msg);
     }
     
     abstract String getClientCode();
     
     // ...
 }
 
 class MessageHandlerOne extends MessageHandler {
     String getClientCode() {
         return &quot;ABCD_123&quot;;
     }
 }
 
 class MessageHandlerTwo extends MessageHandler {
     String getClientCode() {
         return &quot;123_ABCD&quot;;
     }
 }

We can now instantiate an appropriate class for each server. Adding servers becomes much more maintainable. That's a lot of code for such a simple modification though. We have to create two new types just to support different client codes! Now let's do the same thing in our language that supports higher order functions:
 
 class MessageHandler {
     void handleMessage(Message msg, Function getClientCode) {
         // ...
         Message msg1 = msg.setClientCode(getClientCode());
         // ...
         
         sendMessage(msg1);
     }
     
     // ...
 }
 
 String getClientCodeOne() {
     return &quot;ABCD_123&quot;;
 }
 
 String getClientCodeTwo() {
     return &quot;123_ABCD&quot;;
 }
 
 MessageHandler handler = new MessageHandler();
 handler.handleMessage(someMsg, getClientCodeOne);

We've created no new types and no class hierarchy. We simply pass appropriate functions as a parameter. We've achieved the same thing as the object oriented counterpart with a number of advantages. We don't restrict ourselves to class hierarchies: we can pass new functions at runtime and change them at any time with a much higher degree of granularity with less code. Effectively the compiler has written object oriented &quot;glue&quot; code for us! In addition we get all the other benefits of FP. Of course the abstractions provided by functional languages don't stop here. Higher order functions are just the beginning.

==Currying==
Most people I've met have read the [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/103-9055240-2348603  Design Patterns] book by the Gang of Four. Any self respecting programmer will tell you that the book is language agnostic and the patterns apply to software engineering in general, regardless of which language you use. This is a noble claim. Unfortunately it is far removed from the truth.

Functional languages are extremely expressive. In a functional language one does not need design patterns because the language is likely so high level, you end up programming in concepts that eliminate design patterns all together. Once such pattern is an Adapter pattern (how is it different from Facade again? Sounds like somebody needed to fill more pages to satisfy their contract). It is eliminated once a language supports a technique called ''currying''.

Adapter pattern is best known when applied to the &quot;default&quot; abstraction unit in Java - a class. In functional languages the pattern is applied to functions. The pattern takes an interface and transforms it to another interface someone else expects. Here's an example of an adapter pattern:
 
 int pow(int i, int j);
 int square(int i)
 {
     return pow(i, 2);
 }

The code above adapts an interface of a function that raises an integer to an integer power to an interface of a function that squares an integer. In academic circles this trivial technique is called currying (after a logician Haskell Curry who performed mathematical acrobatics necessary to formalize it). Because in FP functions (as opposed to classes) are passed around as arguments, currying is used very often to adapt functions to an interface that someone else expects. Since the interface to functions is its arguments, currying is used to reduce the number of arguments (like in the example above).

Functional languages come with this technique built in. You don't need to manually create a function that wraps the original, functional languages will do that for you. As usual, let's extend our language to support this technique.
 
 square = int pow(int i, 2);

This will automatically create a function ''square'' for us with one argument. It will call ''pow'' function with the second argument set to ''2''. This will get compiled to the following Java code:
 
 class square_function_t {
     int square(int i) {
         return pow(i, 2);
     }
 }
 square_function_t square = new square_function_t();

As you can see, we've simply created a wrapper for the original function. In FP currying is just that - a shortcut to quickly and easily create wrappers. You concentrate on your task, and the compiler writes the appropriate code for you! When do you use currying? This should be easy. Any time you'd like to use an adapter pattern (a wrapper).

==Lazy Evaluation==
Lazy (or delayed) evaluation is an interesting technique that becomes possible once we adopt a functional philosophy. We've already seen the following piece of code when we were talking about concurrency:

 
 String s1 = somewhatLongOperation1();
 String s2 = somewhatLongOperation2();
 String s3 = concatenate(s1, s2);

In an imperative language the order of evaluation would be clear. Because each function may affect or depend on an external state it would be necessary to execute them in order: first ''somewhatLongOperation1'', then ''somewhatLongOperation2'', followed by ''concatenate''. Not so in functional languages.

As we saw earlier ''somewhatLongOperation1'' and ''somewhatLongOperation2'' can be executed concurrently because we're guaranteed no function affects or depends on global state. But what if we don't want to run the two concurrently, do we need to run them in order? The answer is no. We only need to run these operations when another function depends on ''s1'' and ''s2''. We don't even have to run them before ''concatenate'' is called - we can delay their evaluation until they're required within ''concatenate''. If we replace ''concatenate'' with a function that has a conditional and uses only one of its two parameters we may never evaluate one of the parameters at all! [[Haskell]] is an example of a delayed evaluation language. In ''Haskell'' you are not guaranteed that anything will be executed in order (or at all) because ''Haskell'' only executes code when it's required.

Lazy evaluation has numerous advantages as well as disadvantages. We will discuss the advantages here and will explain how to counter the disadvantages in the next section.

===Optimization===
Lazy evaluation provides a tremendous potential for optimizations. A lazy compiler thinks of functional code exactly as mathematicians think of an algebra expression - it can cancel things out and completely prevent execution, rearrange pieces of code for higher efficiency, even arrange code in a way that reduces errors, all guaranteeing optimizations won't break the code. This is the biggest benefit of representing programs strictly using formal primitives - code adheres to mathematical laws and can be reasoned about mathematically.

===Abstracting Control Structures===
Lazy evaluation provides a higher order of abstraction that allows implementing things in a way that would otherwise be impossible. For example consider implementing the following control structure:
 
 unless(stock.isEuropean()) {
     sendToSEC(stock);
 }

We want ''sendToSEC'' executed unless the stock is European. How can we implement ''unless''? Without lazy evaluation we'd need some form of a macro system, but in a language like Haskell that's unnecessary. We can implement ''unless'' as a function!
 
 void unless(boolean condition, List code) {
     if(!condition)
         code;
 }

Note that ''code'' is never evaluated if the condition is true. We cannot reproduce this behavior in a strict language because the arguments would be evaluated before ''unless'' is entered.

===Infinite Data Structures===
Lazy languages allow for definition of infinite data structures, something that's much more complicated in a strict language. For example, consider a list with Fibonacci numbers. We clearly can't compute an infinite list in a reasonable amount of time or store it in memory. In strict languages like Java we simply define a Fibonacci function that returns a particular member from the sequence. In a language like Haskell we can abstract it further and simply define an infinite list of Fibonacci numbers. Because the language is lazy, only the necessary parts of the list that are actually used by the program are ever evaluated. This allows for abstracting a lot of problems and looking at them from a higher level (for example, we can use list processing functions on an infinite list).

===Disadvantages===
Of course there ain't no such thing as a free lunch™. (Unless you're lucky.) It seems that lazy evaluation comes with a number of disadvantages. Mainly that it is, well, lazy, and sometimes doesn't allow the programmer to also be so to their heart's content, meaning, you need to employ some workarounds in certain cases. There are real world problems that require strict evaluation. For example consider the following:
 
 System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;);
 System.in.readLine();

In a lazy language you have no guarantee that the first line will be executed before the second! This means, if laziness were an absolute principle, we wouldn't be able to do IO, to use native functions in any meaningful way (because they need to be called in order since they depend on side effects), and couldn't interact with the outside world! If we were to introduce primitives that force ordered code execution we'd lose the ability of reasoning about our code mathematically (which would take all of the benefits of functional programming with it). Fortunately not all is lost. Mathematicians got to work and developed a number of tricks to ensure code gets executed in particular order in a functional setting. So we really get the best of both worlds! These techniques include continuations, monads, and uniqueness typing. In this article we'll only deal with continuations. We'll leave monads and uniqueness typing for another time. Interestingly, continuations are useful for many things other than enforcing a particular order of evaluation. We'll talk about that as well.

==Continuations==
Continuations to programming are what the ''Da Vinci Code'' supposedly is to human history: an amazing revelation of the greatest cover-up known to man. Well, maybe not, but they're certainly revealing of deceit in the same sense as square roots of negative numbers.

When we learned about functions we only learned half truths based on a faulty assumption that functions must return their value to the original caller. In this sense continuations are a generalization of functions. A function must not necessarily return to its caller and may return to any part of the program. A &quot;continuation&quot; is a parameter we may choose to pass to our function that specifies where the function should return. The description may be more complicated than it sounds. Take a look at the following code:
 
 int i = add(5, 10);
 int j = square(i);

The function ''add'' returns ''15'' to be assigned to ''i'', the place where ''add'' was originally called. After that the value of ''i'' is used to call ''square''. Note that a lazy compiler can't rearrange these lines of code because the second line depends on successful evaluation of the first. We can rewrite this code block using ''Continuation Passing Style'' or ''CPS'', where the function ''add'' doesn't return to the original caller but instead returns its result to ''square''.
 
 int j = add(5, 10, square);

In this case ''add'' gets another parameter - a function that ''add'' must call with its result upon completion. In this case ''square'' is a continuation of ''add''. In both cases ''j'' will equal ''225''.

Here lays the first trick to force a lazy language to evaluate two expressions in order. Consider the following (familiar) IO code:
 
 System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;);
 System.in.readLine();

The two lines don't depend on each other and the compiler is free to rearrange them as it wishes. However, if we rewrite this code in CPS, there will be a dependency and the compiler will be forced to evaluate the two lines in order!
 
 System.out.println(&quot;Please enter your name: &quot;, System.in.readLine);

In this case ''println'' needs to call ''readLine'' with its result and return the result of ''readLine''. This allows us to ensure that the two lines are executed in order ''and'' that ''readLine'' is evaluated at all (because the whole computation expects the last value as a result). In case of Java ''println'' returns ''void'' but if it were to return an abstract value (that ''readLine'' would accept), we'd solve our problem! Of course chaining function calls like that will quickly become unreadable, but it isn't necessary. We could add syntactic sugar to the language that will allow us to simply type expressions in order, and the compiler would chain the calls for us automatically. We can now evaluate expressions in any order we wish without losing any of the benefits of FP (including the ability to reason about our programs mathematically)! If this is still confusing, remember that a function is just an instance of a class with one member. Rewrite above two lines so that ''println'' and ''readLine'' are instances of classes and everything will become clear.

I would now wrap up this section, except that we've only scratched the surface of continuations and their usefulness. We can write entire programs in CPS, where every function takes an extra continuation argument and passes the result to it. We can also convert any program to CPS simply by treating functions as special cases of continuations (functions that always return to their caller). This conversion is trivial to do automatically (in fact, many compilers do just that).

Once we convert a program to CPS it becomes clear that every instruction has some continuation, a function it will call with the result, which in a regular program would be a place it must return to. Let's pick any instruction from above code, say ''add(5, 10)''. In a program written in CPS style it's clear what ''add'''s continuation is - it's a function that ''add'' calls once it's done. But what is it in a non-CPS program? We could, of course, convert the program to CPS, but do we have to?

It turns out that we don't. Look carefully at our CPS conversion. If you try to write a compiler for it and think about it long enough you'll realize that the CPS version needs no stack! No function ever &quot;returns&quot; in the traditional sense, it just calls another function with the result instead. We don't need to push function arguments on the stack with every call and then pop them back, we can simply store them in some block of memory and use a jump instruction instead. We'll never need the original arguments - they'll never be used again since no function ever returns!

So, programs written in CPS style have no stack but have an extra argument with a function to call. Programs not written in CPS style have no argument with a function to call, but have the stack instead. What does the stack contain? Simply the arguments, and a pointer to memory where the function should return. Do you see a light bulb? The stack simply contains continuation information! The pointer to the return instruction in the stack is essentially the same thing as the function to call in CPS programs! If you wanted to find out what continuation for ''add(5, 10)'' is, you'd simply have to examine the stack at the point of its execution!

So that was easy. A continuation and a pointer to the return instruction in the stack are really the same thing, only a continuation is passed explicitly, so that it doesn't need to be the same place where the function was called from. If you remember that a continuation is a function, and a function in our language is compiled to an instance of a class, you'll realize that a pointer to the return instruction in the stack and the continuation argument are ''really'' the same thing, since our function (just like an instance of a class) is simply a pointer. This means that at any given point in time in your program you can ask for a ''current continuation'' (which is simply the information on the stack).

Ok, so we know what a current continuation is. What does it mean? When we get a current continuation and store it somewhere, we end up storing the current state of our program - freezing it in time. This is similar to an OS putting itself into hibernation. A continuation object contains the information necessary to restart the program from the point where the continuation object was acquired. An operating system does this to your program all the time when it context switches between the threads. The only difference is that it keeps all the control. If you ask for a continuation object (in Scheme this is done by calling ''call-with-current-continuation'' function) you'll get an object that contains the current continuation - the stack (or in a CPS case the function to call next). You can store this object in a variable (or alternatively, on disk). When you choose to &quot;restart&quot; your program with this continuation object you will &quot;transform&quot; to the state of the program when you grabbed the continuation object. It's the same thing as switching back to a suspended thread or waking up an OS from hibernation, except you can do it again and again. When an OS wakes up, the hibernation information is destroyed. If it wasn't, you'd be able to wake up from the same point over and over again, almost like going back in time. You have that control with continuations!

In what situations are continuations useful? Usually when you're trying to simulate state in an application of inherently stateless nature to ease your life. A great application of continuations are [http://www.seaside.st/ web applications]. Microsoft's ASP.NET goes to tremendous lengths to try and simulate state so that you can write your application with less hassle. If C# supported continuations half of ASP.NET's complexity would disappear - you'd simply store a continuation and restart it when a user makes the web request again. To a programmer of the web application there would be no interruption - the program would simply start from the next line! Continuations are an incredibly useful abstraction for some problems. Considering that many of the traditional fat clients are moving to the web, continuations will become more and more important in the future.

==Pattern Matching==
Pattern matching is not a new or innovative feature. In fact, it has little to do with functional programming. The only reason why it's usually attributed to FP is that functional languages have had pattern matching for some time, while modern imperative languages still don't.

Let's dive into pattern matching with an example. Here's a Fibonacci function in Java:
 
 int fib(int n) {
     if(n == 0) return 1;
     if(n == 1) return 1;
         
     return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
 }

And here's an example of a Fibonacci function in our Java-derived language that supports pattern matching:
 
 int fib(0) {
     return 1;
 }
 int fib(1) {
     return 1;
 }
 int fib(int n) {
     return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
 }

(Do not try with higher numbers since this algorithm isn't suited for higher numbers due to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(2^n)&lt;/math&gt; [[w:Time_complexity|time complexity]]; ''fib(35)'' will already take a considerable amount of time)

What's the difference? The compiler implements branching for us.

What's the big deal? There isn't any. Someone noticed that a large number of functions contain very complicated switch statements (this is particularly true about functional programs) and decided that it's a good idea to abstract that away. We split the function definition into multiple ones, and put patterns in place of some arguments (sort of like overloading). When the function is called, the compiler compares the arguments with the definitions at runtime, and picks the correct one. This is usually done by picking the most specific definition available. For example, ''int fib(int n)'' can be called with ''n'' equal to ''1'', but it isn't because ''int fib(1)'' is more specific.

Another possibility, which you find in Haskell, is to check the patterns in the order they are defined (one of the few cases where the order of the expressions in a functional program matters, but most of your code can be written in any order you wish, which is very convenient.) For example, a function's argument might be tested against three patterns, fun (x &lt; 100), fun (x &lt; 1000), fun (x = anything), and when called with x = 50 the first instance of its definition will be used, although x = 50 also would fit the other two. (And in a mathematical sense, taking into account negative numbers, none of these definitions is more specific since the sets of matching patterns all have the same infinite size.) In this system you usually order your definitions so that the more specific ones come first, which automatically encompasses the other way of deciding which instance of the function will be used.

Pattern matching is usually more complex than our example reveals. For example, an advanced pattern matching system will allow us to do the following:
 
 int f(int n &lt; 10) { ... }
 int f(int n) { ... }

When is pattern matching useful? In a surprisingly large number of cases! Every time you have a complex structure of nested ''if''s, pattern matching can do a better job with less code on your part. A good function that comes to mind is a standard ''WndProc'' function that all Win32 applications must provide (even though it's often abstracted away). Usually a pattern matching system can examine collections as well as simple values. For example, if you pass an array to your function you could pick out all arrays in which the first element is equal to ''1'' and the third element is greater than ''3''.

Another benefit of pattern matching is that if you need to add or modify conditions, you don't have to go into one huge function. You simply add (or modify) appropriate definitions. This eliminates the need for a whole range of design patterns from the Gang of Four book. The more complex your conditions are, the more pattern matching will help you. Once you're used to it, you start wondering how you ever got through your day without it.

==Closures==
So far we've discussed features in the context of &quot;pure&quot; functional languages - languages that are implementations of lambda calculus and don't include features that conflict with Church's formalism. However, many of the features of functional languages are useful outside of lambda calculus framework. While an implementation of an axiomatic system is useful because it allows thinking about programs in terms of mathematical expressions, it may or may not be practical. Many languages choose to incorporate functional elements without strictly adhering to functional doctrine. Many such languages (like Common Lisp) don't require variables to be final - you can modify things in place. They also don't require functions to depend only on their arguments - functions are allowed to access state outside of their boundaries. But they do include functional features - like higher order functions. Passing functions around in impure languages is a little bit different than doing it in the confines of lambda calculus and requires support for an interesting feature often referred to as lexical closure. Let's take a look at some sample code. Remember, in this case variables aren't final and functions can refer to variables outside of their scope:
 
 Function makePowerFn(int power) {
    int powerFn(int base) {
        return pow(base, power);
    }
 
    return powerFn;
 }
 
 Function square = makePowerFn(2);
 square(3); // returns 9

The function ''makePowerFn'' returns a function that takes a single argument and raises it to a certain power. What happens when we try to evaluate ''square(3)''? The variable ''power'' isn't anywhere in scope of ''powerFn'' because ''makePowerFn'' has returned and its stack is long gone. How can ''square'' work, then? The language must, somehow, store the value of ''power'' somewhere for ''square'' to work. What if we create another function, ''cube'', that raises something to the third power? The runtime must now store two copies of power, one for each function we generated using ''makePowerFn''. The phenomenon of storing these values is called a ''closure''. Closures don't only store arguments of a host function. For example, a closure can look like this:
 
 Function makeIncrementer() {
    int n = 0;
 
    int increment() {
        return ++n;
    }
 }
 
 Function inc1 = makeIncrementer();
 Function inc2 = makeIncrementer();
 
 inc1(); // returns 1;
 inc1(); // returns 2;
 inc1(); // returns 3;
 inc2(); // returns 1;
 inc2(); // returns 2;
 inc2(); // returns 3;

The runtime manages to store ''n'', so incrementers can access it. Furthermore, it stores various copies, one for each incrementer, even though they're supposed to disappear when ''makeIncrementer'' returns. What does this code compile to? How do closures work behind the scenes? Fortunately, we have a back stage pass.

A little common sense goes a long way. The first observation is that local variables are no longer limited to simple scope rules and have an undefined lifetime. The obvious conclusion is that they're no longer stored on the stack - they must be stored on the heap instead&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/fp.html#gc-alloc-speed 8]&lt;/sup&gt;. A closure, then, is implemented just like a function we discussed earlier, except that it has an additional reference to the surrounding variables:
 
 class some_function_t {
    SymbolTable parentScope;
    
    // ...
 }

When a closure references a variable that's not in its local scope, it consults this reference for a parent scope. That's it! Closures bring functional and OO worlds closer together. Every time you create a class that holds some state and pass it to somewhere else, think of closures. A closure is just an object that creates &quot;member variables&quot; on the fly by grabbing them from the scope, so you don't have to!

==What's next?==
This article only scratches the surface of functional programming. Sometimes a small scratch can progress to something bigger and in our case it's a good thing. In the future I plan to write about category theory, monads, functional data structures, type systems in functional languages, functional concurrency, functional databases and much more. If I get to write (and in the process learn) about half of these topics my life will be complete. In the meantime, [http://www.google.com Google] is our friend.

==Comments?==
If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please drop a note at [mailto:coffeemug@gmail.com coffeemug@gmail.com]. I'll be glad to hear your feedback.

&lt;div id=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;When I was looking for a job in the fall of 2005 I often did ask this question. It's quite amusing how many blank stares I got. You would think that at about $300,000 a piece these people would at least have a good understanding of most tools available to them.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;This appears to be a controversial question. Physicists and mathematicians are forced to acknowledge that it isn't at all clear whether everything in the universe obeys the laws that can be described by mathematics.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;I've always hated history lessons that offer a dry chronology of dates, names, and events. To me history is about the lives of people who changed the world. It is about their private reasons behind their actions, and the mechanisms by which they affected millions of souls. For this reason this history section is hopelessly incomplete. Only very relevant people and events are discussed.

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;When I was learning about functional programming I was very annoyed by the term &quot;lambda&quot; because I couldn't really understand what it really means. In this context lambda is a function, the single Greek letter was just easier to write in a mathematical notation. Every time you hear &quot;lambda&quot; when talking about functional programming just translate it in your mind to &quot;function&quot;.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;Interestingly Java strings are immutable anyway. It's rather interesting to explore the reasons for this treachery, but that would distract us from our goal.

&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Most functional language compilers optimize recursive functions by transforming them to their iterative alternatives whenever possible. This is called a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_recursion tail call optimization].

&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;The opposite isn't always true. While it is sometimes possible to prove that two pieces of code are equivalent, it isn't possible in all situations.

&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;This is actually no slower than storing on the stack because once you introduce a garbage collector, memory allocation becomes an O(1) operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Characteristics ===

* '''First-class functions'''. In functional languages, functions are just data, and can be passed to and returned from other functions as desired.
* '''Immutability'''. In functional programming, the use of mutable variables is generally &quot;discouraged&quot;, which is to say functional languages usually make the programmer go out of her way to create a variable whose value can change, or they disallow the practice altogether. While this may sound like an onerous restriction, in practice it has essentially no impact on the programs you can comfortably express; it turns out, rather, that the choice of using mutable or immutable variables is usually a matter of efficiency.
* '''Recursion'''. Without mutable variables, we don't write loops like
&lt;pre&gt;
for (i=0; i&lt;100; i:=i+1) { /* do some stuff */}
&lt;/pre&gt;. In such cases we generally write recursive functions to do the same computation.

=== Features ===

Here are some typical features of functional languages

* tuples
* parametric polymorphism
* type inference
* pattern matching
* laziness

=== The languages ===

There are many so-called functional languages. The most widely used pure functional languages (that is, ones whose programs have no side effects) are [[Haskell]] and [[Erlang Programming|Erlang]]. Other popular functional languages which are not pure in the strict sense but still support the functional programming style in its full splendor are ML, [[Objective Caml]], [[Scheme Programming|Scheme]] and [[Subject:Lisp programming language|Lisp]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Preprocessor|Standard libraries}}

A ''library'' in C is a group of functions and declarations, exposed for use by other programs. The library therefore consists of an ''interface'' expressed in a &lt;code&gt;.h&lt;/code&gt; file (named the &quot;header&quot;) and an ''implementation'' expressed in a &lt;code&gt;.c&lt;/code&gt; file. This &lt;code&gt;.c&lt;/code&gt; file might be precompiled or otherwise inaccessible, or it might be available to the programmer. (Note: Libraries may call functions in other libraries such as the Standard C or math libraries to do various tasks.)

The format of a library varies with the operating system and compiler one is using. For example, in the Unix and Linux operating systems, a library consists of one or more ''object files'', which consist of object code that is usually the output of a compiler (if the source language is C or something similar) or an assembler (if the source language is assembly language). These object files are then turned into a library in the form of an archive by the ''ar'' archiver (a program that takes files and stores them in a bigger file without regard to compression). The filename for the library usually starts with &quot;lib&quot; and ends with &quot;.a&quot;; e.g. the ''libc.a'' file contains the Standard C library and the &quot;libm.a&quot; the mathematics routines, which the linker would then link in. Other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows use a &quot;.lib&quot; extension for libraries and an &quot;.obj&quot; extension for object files. 

We're going to use as an example a function to [[w:Parsing|parse]] arguments from the command line. Arguments on the command line could be by themselves:

     -i

have an optional argument that is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenate concatenated] to the letter:

     -ioptarg

or have the argument in a separate argv-element:

     -i optarg

In order to parse all these types of arguments, we have written the following &quot;getopt.c&quot; file:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;              /* for fprintf() and EOF */
#include &lt;string.h&gt;             /* for strchr() */
#include &quot;getopt.h&quot;             /* consistency check */

/* variables */
int opterr = 1;                 /* getopt prints errors if this is on */
int optind = 1;                 /* token pointer */
int optopt;                     /* option character passed back to user */
char *optarg;                   /* flag argument (or value) */

/* function */
/* return option character, EOF if no more or ? if problem.
	The arguments to the function:
	argc, argv - the arguments to the main() function. An argument of &quot;--&quot;
	stops the processing.
	opts - a string containing the valid option characters.
	an option character followed by a colon (:) indicates that
	the option has a required argument.
*/
int
getopt (int argc, char **argv, char *opts)
{
	static int sp = 1;            /* character index into current token */
	register char *cp;            /* pointer into current token */
	
	if (sp == 1)
	{
		/* check for more flag-like tokens */
		if (optind &gt;= argc || argv[optind][0] != '-' || argv[optind][1] == '\0')
			return EOF;
		else if (strcmp (argv[optind], &quot;--&quot;) == 0)
		{
			optind++;
			return EOF;
		}
	}
	
	optopt = argv[optind][sp];
	
	if (optopt == ':' || (cp = strchr (opts, optopt)) == NULL)
	{
		if (opterr)
			fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s: invalid option -- '%c'\n&quot;, argv[0], optopt);
		
		/* if no characters left in this token, move to next token */
		if (argv[optind][++sp] == '\0')
		{
			optind++;
			sp = 1;
		}
		
		return '?';
	}
	
	if (*++cp == ':')
	{
		/* if a value is expected, get it */
		if (argv[optind][sp + 1] != '\0')
			/* flag value is rest of current token */
			optarg = argv[optind++] + (sp + 1);
		else if (++optind &gt;= argc)
		{
			if (opterr)
				fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s: option requires an argument -- '%c'\n&quot;,
							argv[0], optopt);
			sp = 1;
			return '?';
		}
		else
		/* flag value is next token */
		optarg = argv[optind++];
		sp = 1;
	}
	else
	{
		/* set up to look at next char in token, next time */
		if (argv[optind][++sp] == '\0')
		{
			/* no more in current token, so setup next token */
			sp = 1;
			optind++;
		}
		optarg = 0;
	}
	return optopt;
} 
/* END OF FILE */
&lt;/source&gt;

The interface would be the following &quot;getopt.h&quot; file:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#ifndef GETOPT_H
	#define GETOPT_H

	/* exported variables */
	extern int opterr, optind, optopt;
	extern char *optarg;

	/* exported function */
	int getopt(int, char **, char *);
#endif

/* END OF FILE */
&lt;/source&gt;

At a minimum, a programmer has the interface file to figure out how to use a library, although, in general, the library programmer also wrote documentation on how to use the library. In the above case, the documentation should say that the provided arguments &lt;code&gt;**argv&lt;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*opts&lt;code&gt; both shouldn't be null pointers (or why would you be using the &lt;code&gt;getopt&lt;/code&gt; function anyway?). Specifically, it typically states what each parameter is for and what return values can be expected in which conditions. Programmers that use a library, are normally not interested in the implementation of the library -- unless the implementation has a bug, in which case he would want to complain somehow.

Both the implementation of the getopts library, and programs that use the library should state &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;getopt.h&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, in order to refer to the corresponding interface. Now the library is &quot;linked&quot; to the program -- the one that contains the main() function. The program may refer to dozens of interfaces.

In some cases, just placing &lt;code&gt;#include &quot;getopt.h&quot;&lt;/code&gt; may appear correct but will still fail to link properly. This indicates that the library is not installed correctly, or there may be some additional configuration required. You will have to check either the compiler's documentation or library's documentation on how to resolve this issue.

== What to put in header files ==

As a general rule, headers contain anything that should be exported, or &quot;seen&quot; by the other modules in a program. This includes macro definitions (preprocessor &lt;code&gt;#define&lt;/code&gt;s); structure, union, and enumeration declarations; typedef declarations; external function declarations; and global variable declarations. In the above &lt;code&gt;getopt.h&lt;/code&gt; example file, one function (&lt;code&gt;getopt&lt;/code&gt;) is declared and and four global variables (&lt;code&gt;optind&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;optopt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;optarg&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;opterr&lt;/code&gt;) are also declared.

The &lt;code&gt;#ifndef GETOPT_H/#define GETOPT_H&lt;/code&gt; trick is colloquially called &lt;b&gt;include guards&lt;/b&gt;. This is used so that if the &lt;code&gt;getopt.h&lt;/code&gt; file were included more than once in a translation unit, the unit would only see the contents once.

When a wave of the ocean makes contact with deeper levels of water it becomes more powerful. Likewise, when the conscious mind expands to embrace deeper levels of thinking, the thought waves become more powerful.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The expanded capacity of the conscious mind increases the power of the mind and results in added energy and intelligence. Man who generally uses only a small portion of the total mind that he possesses, begins to make use of his full mental potential.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The technique may be defined as turning the attention inwards towards the subtler levels of thought until the mind transcends the experience of the subtlest state of the thought and arrives at the source of the thought. This expands the conscious mind and at the same time brings it in contact with the creative intelligence that gives rise to every thought.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A thought-impulse starts from the silent creative center within, as a bubble starts from the bottom of the sea. As it rises it becomes larger; arriving at the conscious level of the mind, it becomes large enough to be appreciated as a thought, and from there it develops into speech and action.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Turning the attention inward takes the mind from the experience of thought at the conscious level (B) to the finer states of the thought until the mind arrives at the source of the thought (A). This inward march of the mind results in the expansion of the conscious mind (from W1 to W2).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This que is described as Transcendental Meditation. Its practice is simple. There are no prerequisites for beginning the practice, other than receiving instructions from a qualified teacher.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It should be noted Transcendental Meditation is neither a matter of contemplation nor of concentration. The process of contemplation and concentration both hold the mind on the conscious level thinking, whereas Transcendental Meditation systematically takes the mind to the source of thought, the pure field of creative intelligence.

! COSMIC LAW, THE BASIC LAW OF CREATION
|-
|
The ever-changing creation of infinite variety seems to be grounded on some stable plane of existence. The rhythm of nature seems to conform to a definite pattern. The infinite number of the galaxies in the vast structure of cosmic space seems to move according to a definite plan. The creation, evolution and dissolution of all things seems to follow a definite procedure. Things change, but the incessant change itself seems to have some unchanging basis.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hydrogen and oxygen are gases. They combine to form water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The qualities of gas change to the qualities water, but hydrogen and oxygen remain H and O. Again when water freezes it is transformed into ice, the qualities of water change to those of ice, but hydrogen and oxygen, the essential constituents, remain the same. This means that, there are certain laws responsible for changing the qualities of gas to water and water to ice, there is some force, some law, which maintains the integrity of hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The law that does not allow hydrogen and oxygen to change into anything else is itself the unchanging basis of the laws responsible for changing gas into liquid and liquid into solid. The cosmic law is that law which maintains the integrity of the essential and ultimate constituent of integrity creation--absolute Being. Being remains Being by virtue of the cosmic law, which gives rise to different laws responsible for different strata of creation. Although these varied laws of nature are directly responsible for the maintenance and evolution of the universe, their basis is the eternal cosmic law at the plane of Being.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When during Transcendental Meditation, the mind transcends the subtlest state of thought and attains the state of Self-consciousness or pure Being, it attains the level of cosmic law. Coming out of that state, its position is that like a man entering the office of the President and coming endowed with his good will; all the subordinates begin to be in sympathy with him and give their full support by directing his activities towards a successful end.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When the mind comes out from the field of Being, the plane of cosmic law, into the relative field of activity, which is under the influence of innumerable laws of nature, it automatically enjoys the support of the cosmic law, and this makes possible the accomplishment of any aspiration and the ultimate fulfilment of life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is how the life of a man who has risen to cosmic consciousness is eternally established on the level of cosmic law and receives spontaneous support from all the laws of nature.

I joined wikibooks so that I could publish my A-level revision notes on the web and at the same time contribute to the open-source community. Most of my contributions to wikibooks are simply copies of my a-level notes only with greater detail. Hopefully, someone will find them useful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why JaF893?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
JaF is my initials - my full name is Joseph Adam Farish. The 893 suffix comes from the japanese card game Oicho Kabu. Oicho Kabu is simillar to blackjack except that the aim is to get a total of 19. In Japanese, Ya means 8, ku means 9 and za means 3. Since 8+9+3 = 20 , it is a worthless score. Similarly the Yakuza or Japanese mafia serve no purpose within Japanese scoiety.

----

You have three bags, each containing two marbles.  Bag #1 contains '''two white marbles''', bag #2 contains '''two black marbles''', and bag #3 contains '''one white marble and one black marble'''.

You pick a random bag and take out '''one marble'''.  Given that this is a '''white marble''', what is the probability that the remaining marble from the same bag is '''also''' white?

2/3, or approximately 66.7%

== Reasoning ==

The most common wrong answer is 50%.  This is due to the misconception that you are given the information that you have picked either bag #1 or bag #3 [Challenge: This is not a misconception - This information is already provided in the question - a fact] .  This is not the case, as explained below:

Label each of the marbles: bag 1 contains 1a and 1b, bag 2 contains 2a and 2b, and bag 3 contains 3a (white) and 3b (black).  Because you picked a random bag and a random marble, each marble has an equal chance of being picked.  Given that you picked a white marble, you have the following distribution:

First marble:
* 1a: 1/3
* 1b: 1/3
* 2a: 0 (''black ball was not picked'')
* 2b: 0 (''black ball'')
* 3a: 1/3
* 3b: 0 (''black ball'')


Given this information, we look at each situation:
* 1a: You have picked bag #1, so the second marble must be 1b, a '''white marble'''.
* 1b: You have picked bag #1, so the second marble must be 1a, a '''white marble'''.
* 3a: You have picked bag #3, so the second marble must be 3b, a '''black marble'''.

If you are in the first two situations, your second marble will be a white marble, therefore, adding 1/3 and 1/3, you get 2/3 chance of getting a white marble

== Algebraic explanation ==

Let W be the event of drawing a white marble, WW be the event of drawing from bag 1 (two white).

Then P(WW | W) = P(WW &amp;#8743; W) / P(W) = P(WW) / P(W) = (1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3.

== Correct answer ==

Correct answer - 50% - is commonly considered wrong, but really - past events have no influence on future probabilities at all (You cannot count &quot;You have picked bag #1&quot; twice. You just either did it or not).
Right now You have one white marble in your hand and knowledge, that another one is either black or white depending on which bag (out of two) you selected.

Challenge: You essentially just start by picking a marble--and there are three white marbles. Two of those white marbles are in the same bag as another white marble; so, given that you've picked one of the three white marbles, 2/3 of the time its pair matches--right?

==Korean Conversation, Level I, Lesson 1: Greetings==

Welcome to the first conversation lesson for learning Korean.  By now you should be familiar with hangeul (the Korean writing system) and how to form syllables.  If you are not yet familiar with hangeul, see [[Korean/Alphabet]].  It is highly recommended that you know these basics before you embark on learning how to make sentences and commencing dialogue.

In this first section, we will introduce basic Korean sentence structure, basic vocabulary, and greetings in Korean. Note that the following dialogue uses the formal, very polite -습니다/습니까 verb endings, which are appropriate for introduction into the Korean language, however, is seldom used within everyday conversation in Korea, save for several set phrases, such as thank you, excuse me, etc. 

: [[wikt:시작하다|시작할까요]]?
: (Shall we start?)

===Dialogue===
The simple dialogue below is between Korean native 찬호 and Joseph (조세프) from America.  Joseph is interested in Korean culture and language, and was able to meet 찬호 through a program in his school.  Here, they meet for the first time:

:찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕하십니까, 조세프 씨?'''&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''예. 안녕하십니까, 찬호 씨?'''&lt;/big&gt;
:찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''만나서 반갑습니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''저도요. 저는 집에 갑니다.'''&lt;/big&gt;
:찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''예. 안녕히 가십시오.'''&lt;/big&gt;
:조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕히 계십시오.'''&lt;/big&gt;

===Overview===

The conversation began with 찬호 asking this:

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:안녕하십니까|안녕하십니까]], 조세프 [[wikt:씨|씨]]?'''&lt;/big&gt;

Here, we learn our first bit of Korean. &quot;안녕하십니까?&quot; is a common formal greeting in Korean.  It literally means &quot;Are you at peace?&quot;. &quot;씨&quot; is a title which means &quot;Mr&quot;. Joseph replied like this:

: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:예|예]]. 안녕하십니까, 찬호 씨?'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;예&quot; means &quot;yes&quot;.  Then Joseph asked 찬호 the same question.  Typically, the response to &quot;안녕하십니까?&quot; is &quot;예&quot;, but it is not necessary to respond that way, as we learn from 찬호's response:

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:만나다|만나]]서 [[wikt:반가워|반갑습니다]].'''&lt;/big&gt;

&quot;만나서 반갑습니다&quot; means &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot;  This can also be shortened to &quot;반갑습니다&quot;, but since 찬호 and Joseph have first met, it is best to be as polite as possible.  &quot;만나서&quot; means &quot;because we've met&quot;.

: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''[[wikt:저|저]]도요. 저는 [[wikt:집|집]]에 [[wikt:가다|갑니다]].'''&lt;/big&gt;

Here, we learn some important things about making a Korean sentence.  &quot;저&quot; means &quot;I,&quot; and &quot;저도요&quot; means &quot;Me too&quot;.  Then Joseph says:
&quot;저는 집에 갑니다.&quot;  This means &quot;I go home.&quot;  We'll dissect this sentence more in just a moment.  First, let us finish analyzing the conversation:

: 찬호: &lt;big&gt;'''예. 안녕히 [[wikt:가시다|가십시오]].'''&lt;/big&gt;
: 조세프: &lt;big&gt;'''안녕히 [[wikt:계시다|계십시오]].'''&lt;/big&gt;

Look carefully at how each says &quot;Good bye&quot; to each other.  찬호 says &quot;안녕히 '''가십시오'''&quot; while Joseph says &quot;안녕히 '''계십시오'''&quot;
Why do their replies differ from each other?  Well, Joseph is leaving, while it is assumed that 찬호 is staying.  So, 찬호 tells Joseph to &quot;Go in peace&quot; (like spock!) and Joseph tells 찬호 to &quot;Stay in peace.&quot;  It may sound funny, but that's how it works in Korea.  Remember these two carefully and try not to mix them up!

===Grammar: &quot;I go home.&quot;===

The short sentence 저는 집에 갑니다 (&quot;I go home.&quot;) reveals a great deal of usable grammar:

{| border=solid
|-align=center style=&quot;font-size:150%&quot;
| 저 || [[wikt:는|는]] || 집 || [[wikt:에|에]] || 갑니다 || .
|-align=center
| I || (topic) || house || (location) || go || .
|}

Let's discuss 는, 에, and 갑니다.  As mentioned above, 저 means &quot;I&quot;.  In Korean, &quot;는&quot; marks the primary topic of a sentence.  Joseph is talking primarily about himself, so he says &quot;저는&quot;.  Note that if the primary topic ends in a consonant, &quot;는&quot; changes to &quot;은&quot; so it's easier to pronounce. So, if Joseph wanted to talk primarily about his house (집) instead of himself, he would say &quot;집은&quot;.

&quot;에&quot; is in a similar class of elements (called &quot;particles&quot;), but it marks the location, such as &quot;to school (학교에), to the bathroom (화장실에),&quot; and so forth.  However, if Joseph wanted to say &quot;to me&quot;, he would say &quot;저에게&quot;, not &quot;저에.&quot;  The difference is that &quot;에&quot; means &quot;to that thing or place&quot; and &quot;에게&quot; (the dative particle) means &quot;to that person.&quot;  This is an important distinction to remember, but even if you make a mistake, a Korean will probably still understand.

Finally, we see the verb, &quot;갑니다.&quot;  Now, if you were to look up &quot;go&quot; in a Korean dictionary, it would probably say &quot;가다.&quot;  This is the verb's unconjugated dictionary or &quot;base&quot; form.  &quot;가&quot; is the actual root of the verb, or &quot;Verb Stem&quot; (VS).  When we put the verb into a Korean sentence, it must be conjugated.  The standard, polite statement conjugation in Korean is {VS + ㅂ/습니다}.  What does this mean?  This means we take the verb stem (가) and add &quot;ㅂ니다&quot; if the stem ends in a vowel and &quot;습니다&quot; if the verb stem ends in a consonant.  In this case, &quot;가&quot; ends in a vowel, so we slip the ㅂ under it (갑) and add &quot;니다&quot; = &quot;갑니다&quot;.  If the verb was &quot;먹다 (to eat)&quot;  then we would add &quot;습니다&quot; because the verbstem ends in a consonant (먹).  Thus, we have &quot;먹습니다.&quot;  A special thing to remember about this is, when conjugated, the verb is actually pronounced &quot;감니다&quot; like there's a ㅁ on the bottom.  This is because of a special pronunciation rule called &quot;nasalization&quot; which we won't discuss here, but keep it in mind.

In order to make a question, the form is {VS + ㅂ/습니까}.  An astute student would see something like that in &quot;안녕하십니까&quot;, which is actually a question.  So, if 찬호 wanted to ask &quot;Do you go (are you going)?&quot; he would ask &quot;갑니까?&quot; (Remember pronunciation: &quot;감니까&quot;).  Armed with this information, we can now make a statement or a question with almost any verb.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font size=2&gt;The word &quot;[[Hindi]]&quot; written in Devanagari&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Usage ==

While the language has emigrated to all parts of the world, the noteworthy use of the language is in its country of origin - [[wikipedia:India|India]]. A large number of languages and dialects are spoken there, and no single one is spoken by all. The proper term for the form of Hindi used in northern India is Hindustani which is spoken in and around Delhi and borrows equally from other languages such as Urdu and Punjabi. Hindi though, is the most widely understood (~80%) and spoken (~66%) language in the region.
&lt;BR&gt;
* [[wikipedia:List of national languages of India|Click here for more on this topic]]

== Writing System ==
Hindi is written in the [[wikipedia:Devanagari|Devanagari]] script (देवनागरी) a left-to-right writing system with a very characteristic top line.  Several other languages such as Marathi, Nepali and Sanskrit use the Devanagari script.

== History ==

Hindi originated in 17th century by the mixing of the Polulau languages of the areas around Delhi (capital of India)  with ''Urdu'' and ''Persian'' (brought in by Muslim rulers from the west).

Hindi is indirectly derived from ''Sanskrit'', the ancient language of India from which most of the Indian languages are derived.
Hindi is heavily influenced by Urdu and even Persian, although it still retains the Devanagari script of Sanskrit.

Spoken Hindi and spoken Urdu are so similar that they are mutually intelligible by native speakers. In their literary forms, however, Hindi borrows more heavily from Sanskrit while Urdu borrows vocabulary from Persian and Arabic.

[[Image:Dutch_Rooster.jpg|right|thumb|rooster (male chicken)]]
The '''chicken''' is a descendant of the southeast Asian red jungle fowl first domesticated in India around 2000 B.C. Most of the birds raised for meat in America today are from the Cornish (a British breed) and the White Rock (a breed developed in New England). Broiler-fryers, roasters, stewing/baking hens, capons and Rock Cornish hens are all chickens. The following are definitions for these:

*''Broiler-fryer'' - a young, tender chicken about 7 weeks old which weighs 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds (1 to 2 kg) when [[wikt:evisceration|eviscerated]]. Cook by any method.
*''Rock Cornish Game Hen''- a small broiler-fryer weighing between 1 and 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg). Usually stuffed and roasted whole.
*''Roaster'' - an older chicken about 3 to 5 months old which weighs 5 to 7 pounds (2.25 to 3.25 kg). It yields more meat per pound than a broiler-fryer. Usually roasted whole.
[[Image:Roast_chicken.jpg|thumb|right|Roast Chicken. Quite a difference, huh?]]
*''Capon'' - Male chickens about 16 weeks to 8 months old which are surgically unsexed. They weigh about 4 to 7 pounds (1.75 to 3.25 kg) and have generous quantities of tender, light meat. Usually roasted.
*''Stewing/Baking Hen'' - a mature laying hen 10 months to 1 1/2 years old. Since the meat is less tender than young chickens, it's best used in moist cooking such as stewing.
*''Cock or rooster'' - a mature male chicken with coarse skin and tough, dark meat. Requires long, moist cooking.

Chicken [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s are also used for food.  See that module for more information.

==Food Borne Organisms Associated with Chicken==

As on any perishable meat, fish or poultry, bacteria can be found on raw or undercooked chicken. They multiply rapidly at temperatures between 4 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140 °F) (out of refrigeration and before thorough cooking occurs). Freezing doesn't kill bacteria but they are destroyed by thorough cooking of any food to 71 °C (160 °F).

Most food borne illness outbreaks are a result of contamination from food handlers. Sanitary food handling and proper cooking and refrigeration should prevent food borne illnesses.

Bacteria must be consumed on food to cause illness. They cannot enter the body through a skin cut. However, raw poultry must be handled carefully to prevent cross-contamination. This can occur if raw poultry or its juices contact cooked food or foods that will be eaten raw such as salad. An example of this is chopping tomatoes on an unwashed cutting board just after cutting raw chicken on it.

Following are some bacteria associated with chicken:

*''[[w:Salmonella Enteriditis|Salmonella Enteriditis]]'' may be found in the intestinal tracts of livestock, poultry, dogs, cats and other warm-blooded animals. This strain is only one of about 2,000 kinds of Salmonella bacteria; it is often associated with poultry and shell eggs.
*''[[w:Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]]'' can be carried on human hands, in nasal passages, or in throats. The bacteria are found in foods made by hand and improperly refrigerated, such as chicken salad.
*''[[w:Campylobacter jejuni|Campylobacter jejuni]]'' is one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in humans. Preventing cross-contamination and using proper cooking methods reduces infection by this bacterium.
*''[[w:Listeria monocytogenes|Listeria monocytogenes]]'' was recognized as causing human food borne illness in 1981. It is destroyed by cooking, but a cooked product can be contaminated by poor personal hygiene. Observe &quot;keep refrigerated&quot; and &quot;use-by&quot; dates on labels.

==How to Handle Chicken Safely==

===Fresh Chicken===
Chicken is kept cold during distribution to retail stores to prevent the growth of bacteria and to increase its shelf life. Chicken should feel cold to the touch when purchased. Select fresh chicken just before checking out at the register. Put packages of chicken in disposable plastic bags (if available) to contain any leakage which could cross-contaminate cooked foods or produce. Make the grocery your last stop before going home.

At home, immediately place chicken in a refrigerator that maintains 40 °F (4 °C), and use within 1 or 2 days, or freeze at 0 °F (-18 °C). If kept frozen continuously, it will be safe indefinitely.

Chicken may be frozen in its original packaging or repackaged. If freezing longer than two months, overwrap the porous store plastic packages with airtight heavy-duty foil, plastic wrap or freezer paper, or place the package inside a freezer bag. Use these materials or airtight freezer containers to repackage family packs into smaller amounts or freeze the chicken from opened packages.

Proper wrapping prevents &quot;[[w:freezer burn|freezer burn]],&quot; which appears as grayish-brown leathery spots and is caused by air reaching the surface of food. Cut freezer-burned portions away either before or after cooking the chicken. Heavily freezer-burned products may have to be discarded because they might be too dry or tasteless.

===Ready-Prepared Chicken===
When purchasing fully cooked [[w:rotisserie|rotisserie]] or fast food chicken, be sure it is hot at time of purchase. Use it within two hours or cut it into several pieces and refrigerate in shallow, covered containers. Eat within 3 to 4 days, either cold or reheated to 165 °F (hot and steaming). It is safe to freeze ready-prepared chicken. For best quality, flavor and texture, use within 4 months.

===Safe Defrosting===

There are three recommended ways to defrost chicken: in the refrigerator, in cold running water and in the microwave. Never defrost chicken on the counter or in other locations. It's best to plan ahead for slow, safe thawing in the refrigerator. Boneless chicken breasts will usually defrost overnight. Bone-in parts and whole chickens may take 1 to 2 days or longer. Once the raw chicken defrosts, it can be kept in the refrigerator an additional day or two before cooking. During this time, if chicken defrosted in the refrigerator is not used, it can safely be refrozen without cooking first.

Chicken may be defrosted in cold water in its airtight packaging or in a leak proof bag. Submerge the bird or cut-up parts in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes to be sure it stays cold. A whole (3 to 4 pound (1 to 2 kg)) broiler fryer or package of parts should defrost in 2 to 3 hours. A 1-pound (500 g) package of boneless breasts will defrost in an hour or less.

Chicken defrosted in the microwave should be cooked immediately after thawing because some areas of the food may become warm and begin to cook during microwaving. Holding partially cooked food is not recommended because any bacteria present wouldn't have been destroyed. Foods defrosted in the microwave or by the cold water method should be cooked before refreezing.

Do not cook frozen chicken in the microwave or in a slow cooker. However, chicken can be cooked from the frozen state in the oven or on the stove. The cooking time may be about 50% longer.  Some advise against cooking frozen meat and poultry altogether; with chicken, always check the temperature with a food thermometer to ensure proper cooking.

===Marinating===

Chicken may be marinated in the refrigerator up to 2 days. Boil used marinade before brushing on cooked chicken. Discard any uncooked leftover marinade.

==Defrosting?==
''Do not cook frozen chicken in the microwave or in a slow cooker. However, chicken can be cooked from the frozen state in the oven or on the stove. The cooking time may be about 50% longer.''
This is a quote from the defrosting section, near the end of the current article.  I have heard from many sources that frozen or partially-frozen meat and poultry should '''not''' be cooked, and can in fact be dangerous in that the meat will likely remain uncooked in parts.  I am going to add a note in this section that the food should always be checked to ensure that it is cooked through.

'''more defrosting.'''&lt;br&gt;
It says when defrosting with cold water to change the water every 30 minutes, but i think a frozen chicken would keep the water cold anyways, much colder than tap water anyways. Here in Australia, we must be careful with wasting water needlessly. I have not edited the page because I am no expert on the matter, plus im new to trying to contribute to wiki so i dont want to make my first move a dumb one -gaspah</text>

Here are all the official letters of the Arabic alphabet in order.  &lt;!-- click on the letter to learn how it is pronounced --&gt; 
[[Image:Alph2.gif|Alph2.gif]]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The following image shows which letters have an equivalent in the English language. Note that the ''r'' differs from the English one; it is a trill like in Spanish and Russian.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:AlphExplanation1.gif|AlphExplanation1.gif]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because you know English, you have an advantage that speakers of other Western European Languages don't have:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:AlphExplanation2.gif|&quot;th&quot; sound]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The rest of the letters have no true English equivalents. Before you learn them they will sound silent, or seem like another letter. We will learn to pronounce and recognize these letters later.
&lt;br&gt;

==Arabic Letters have tails==
[[Image:ArabicAlphTailsCut.gif|Minus tails]] 

Some Arabic letters have extra parts to them. These parts are only written at the end of words, and a few of them are optional. Look at the picture above. These extra parts have been cut off and brightened so you can see the important part of each letter. Without the extra parts, you see what letters look like at the beginning of words.
[[Image:Focus_on_some_letters.gif|Focus_on_some_letters.gif]]

==Some letters==
In the picture before the one above, there were some letters that didn't seem to have any extra parts.  Some don't. These don't connect to letters after them--connecting them to letters after them would make words very difficult to read, and is not allowed. We boxed these letters in the picture directly above. Some letters do connect to letters after them, but don't have tails; instead, the whole shape of the letter changes. These letters are circled above, and their different shapes are shown in the picture below..

[[Image:ArAlphExplanation_of_ه_and_ك.gif|ه هـ ـهـ ـه]]

==Explanation==
Arabic letters change shape according to their place within a word. Usually this means not writing a tail, because the letter is not at the end of the word. But because Arabic is meant to be written mainly by hand, there are also other changes (i.e., shortcuts) that make writing easier. 
Here is an important shortcut. Because the shortcut is always used in handwriting, it has made its way into Arabic printing.
[[Image:ع_explanation.gif|ه هـ ـهـ ـه]]
Notice how the hole in the middle and final forms of the letter get covered presumably due to thick ink. This comes from calligraphy, Arabic has an incredibly rich calligraphic history.

There are even more shortcuts (mainly ligatures) that we will cover later.
Just in case you didn't notice, Arabic is written and read from right to left.



The Arabic alphabet is very focused on representing '''sounds'''. Some of the sounds may be hard to distinguish for English speakers. See [[Arabic/Arabic sounds|Arabic sounds]] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_alphabet Wikipedia:Arabic Alphabet] for more details on sounds.  

The alphabet does not have capital letters (letters especially designed for names or certain grammar cases). But the way letters are written does depend on the '''location''' of the letter in a word. A letter at the beginning of a word (initial) is often written slightly different from the same letter at the ending of a word (final), or somewhere in between (medial). 

The easiest way to learn the language is to try to recognize certain '''shapes''' in the letters (like hooks, bows, and points). Based on these shared shapes, the letters can be divided in shape groups. See [[Arabic alphabet (by group)]] to learn more on how to tell the written shapes apart, and how to write them.

Each Arabic letter is made up of two parts: a shape, a number of dots. Rules for all writing systems using the Arabetic (writing using Arabic shapes, with dots) system. The following Rules apply.

#Every letter consists of a shape with no dots or some dots.
# The placement (above or below) is important. A shape with a dot underneath is not the same letter as the same shape with a dot above.
# The number of dots is important. A shape with one dot is a different letter than the same shape with a different number of dots.


In Arabic Arabetics, dots can only be above or below the shape, never both at the same time. The way the dots are placed relative to each other, (i.e. diagonally, vertically, in a triangle) does not make different letters.

Welcome to my user page.  For more details, or to get in touch by email, please visit me on [[w:en:User:Sj|Wikipedia]] or [[m:User:Sj|Meta]].

=== About me ===
I loved the main page design as of mid-2009.  I am interested in the '''multilingualism''' and naming conventions of this project, and hope to get more people to come work on language texts in German and Spanish.  As of 2014 I'm on the advisory board of [[w:Boundless Learning|Boundless Learning]], which also builds freely licensed textbooks (which should be portable into WB projects).

===Interesting projects=== 
* Import the awesome Light and Matter book series.
* Import material from CK12 books (single format) from before they switched licenses to CC-NC :/ .
* Import material from Boundless (single format) and Saylor (multi-format, multi-license) books.
* Add cheatsheets and summaries of programming languages, as [[Oracle Programming/SQL Cheatsheet]], [[ASP Notes]], [[Tcl Programming/TCL and ADP|TCL and ADP]], ...
* Cleaning up [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Lonelypages&amp;limit=100&amp;offset=700 Orphans] and the [[Cookbook:Recipes|Cookbook]]; fixing talk page redirects and interwiki deletions
* Upload the [[w:Whole Earth Catalog|Whole Earth Catalog]] and making it editable.  See [[User:Sj/Whole Earth Catalog]] for a start.  Improving the old content with modern information about the same texts and categories.  (free copyright license granted by original publishers, Steward Brand/Kevin Kelly.  Copies of 5 volumes donated for scanning.)
* The [[Wikibooks:Reading room|reading room]] archives need some cleaning up again... to cull out good project ideas and combine them into a persistent thread/idea-page.  
* Outreach: Someone needs to follow up with each of the external authors who have considered publishing on Wikibooks, and those free-content authors who have not.  There are many free-content text generators, from ck12 to Ben Crowell, whose books are not represented on WB.  If this can't be fixed immediately, there should be a wikiproject discussing reasons and options.
* Similarly: add transcripts of Khan videos from before they switched licenses
* Get professors and universities that are putting CC-BY and CC-SA material online to synch those efforts with Wikibooks (or give us programmatic access, and build scripts to maintain a version here).  

Older projects:
* Getting [[Blogging|Blogging 101]] folks to migrate their wiki here.
* Getting interesting source materials for wikibooks onto wikisource for cross-Project collab.</text>

I started my arabic project in German. [[http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabisch]]&lt;br&gt;
We can share our stuff and translate it.

==Purpose==
What is the intended level of instruction of this book?  It's not clear what the intent is in the book itself.  I think the purpose and outcomes should be made more clear in an introduction.  Also, is anyone actively working on it?  13 Dec 2011


==GARG - Gnu Arabic Grammar==
Here are the beginnings of a Modern Arabic Grammar Guide. Anybody who has an interest in helping should take part in the [[Arabic_Plan|planning section]].

[[Arabic|Collection Point]] - Articles for the Grammar Guide can be entered here. More information is on the site.

== Some lost pages ==

With the changes in History, I noticed there are some pages of an anonymous writer that were left out of your table of contents.&lt;BR&gt;
They are:
*[[Arabic_Sounds2:arabic_sound_identification_system_sumbols|Sounds - Arabic sound identification system symbols]], which seems to be orphaned, and
*[[Some_history]], which was a link on that page.&lt;BR&gt;
I deem the naming conventions should change (someone must take the responsibility of moving them), and useless stuff should be removed.

== numbers ==

added a section for arabic numerals.

==This is twoThirty==

I have been adding a lot of material to this wikiBook. The last thing I added was the new section for learning Arabic reading and writing. Once it is done, we should be able to delete the original learn to read Arabic section called &quot;Fundamentals&quot;, because it will be useless. For the new learning to read and write Arabic, excercises are needed, especially copying excercises (to practice writing, but this requires the use of pictures I assume).

After this wikibook is done, a graduated phrase book (going from basic phrases to more complex phrases, including translation and word-for-word translation) should be created for Arabic. Also, a transcription (subtitles written out) for some old Arabic cartoons would help (especially if they are downloadable off the internet (Grendizer comes to mind)). If there is already a wiki for cartoons and transcribing them, tell me (I highly doubt that there are any).

== Section, dialectical clarity ==

This section on Arabic is an unclear mix of colloquials and of MSA. It should be revised with a goal of one dialect in mind.

(Sorry for the multiple revisions, I'm new.)

==Reply to: Dialectecal clarity ==

Thank you for the comment. I agree that it should have one dialect in mind. I deleted the non-MSA sections.

The changing transliteration system has been wasting time. I'll focus on making the Arabic alphabet part high quality, and then using the Arabic alphabet only for the other parts.
This wikibook needs a great amount of planning. The task is really big. I think after the Arabic writing system, we should focus on Arabic grammar, providing examples, and vocabulary.
--[[User:TwoThirty|TwoThirty]] 07:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

==Dialectical Decision==
I have decided to omit the colloquial languages in this book. We will focus on Standard Arabic.

Perhaps, they will be included in a final chapter, to help people who have mastered the language to be able to understand most colloquialized Arabic speech.
For the following reasons:
# There is more demand for learning it than there are for the colloquials.
# The colloquials are not the general Arab language. All Arabs understand Standard Arabic.
# You need Standard Arabic to read and write.
# Most Arabs can speak Standard Arabic.
# Each colloquial is limited in dominance to a region.
# You need Standard Arabic to understand the Qur'aan.
# Understanding Standard Arabic makes it easier to understand more than one Arabic colloquial.
--[[User:TwoThirty|TwoThirty]] 00:11, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
:I second that. You can also understand the new with MSA and a lot of TV programs, so it's far from just a formal written or Quranic language. --[[User:Atitarev|Atitarev]] ([[User talk:Atitarev|talk]]) 00:06, 19 February 2008 (UTC)

== Cleaning up pages ==

I don't have a problem with major contributors trying to remove content from the Wikibooks they are working on, and I try to leave that up to the participants on each seperate Wikibook.

Every once in awhile I find a page like [[Arabic/Basic Sentences/ain't]] which has been blanked, and I'm not sure if the person who blanked the page would like it deleted or not.  Information is the key here, and simply removing all of the content does not automatically remove the page from our database.

If you really think the page is useless and will not contribute to your Wikibook, or that you have covered the content elsewhere and really don't need that page any more, please use the following &quot;page markup tag&quot; to let administrators and any other interested person know why you think the page needs to be removed:

'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|&lt;state your reason for deletion here&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''

I use this myself even to get a second opinion on semi-questionable pages, and it gives the opportunity to give a reason for its removal.  Otherwise, I have to try and form my own opinion on the matter.  It also takes me quite a bit more time to review a page that has been blanked and not marked up with the delete tag, keeping me from other items on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:33, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

== Arabic lessons ==

Arabic is becoming more and more important in today's world, so Wikibooks should definitely have lessons for it. I started learning Arabic, but only know the script and a few basic expressions so far. I'd love to see further lessons here. 

Have you seen the article on creating a language course on Wikibooks? I think it's quite useful. Also, you may want to have a look at the course format I found works best for students: [[Bite-sized language lessons]]. 

Regarding the lessons teaching how to read and write, I found it very useful to give the students words to practise that he should already be able to recognise: English words that Arabic borrowed (e. g. the one for sandwich), Arabic words that are found in English (e. g. algebra?), common personal names (e. g. Ahmed) and the names of cities and countries. Students will find it easier and more fun to read words when they can guess the meaning. Otherwise they're learning two things at once: a foreign script and foreign words, which can be discouraging.

Anyways, just my two cents. Good luck!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 15:32, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Thank you for making this &quot;book&quot;.  I like Arabic language.  It's cool.  Keep up the good work. :)

== Alphabet module is *not* complete ==

While all of the letters may be properly ''described'' in the &quot;Alphabet&quot; page, it in no way ''teaches'' the reader the letters. Specifically, there should be step-by-step exercises to transliterate/read the script, starting with a couple letters, then building to the full alphabet (because the whole thing at once simply goes in one ear and out the other), including how to pronounce each one. --[[User:RealGrouchy|RealGrouchy]] 19:16, 12 April 2007 (UTC)



==Proposed Wikibook Format==
I'm back, and ready to bring this wikibook to life.
I have reorganized the links so that it isn't so difficult to find the more complete version that teaches about four letters at a time.



Be sure to add your suggestions, or reserve a section to write on the Wikibook proposed plan, at the bottom of the main page.
I have some new suggestions about incorporating all forms of Arabic, in order to have a more realistic and more useful wikibook. But leaving it up to the user as to which dialects they need exposure to. 
--[[User:TwoThirty|TwoThirty]] 09:18, 13 August 2007 (UTC)

== Pronunciation ==

This book really needs some pronunciation .ogg files.  So, any native speakers out there want to make lessons?  As of now the easiest thing would be to read down lists: numbers, months, days, alphabet, etc.  Anything simple will do.  Hopefully if we get enough native speakers interested we can get into doing more then we can actually get real lessons.  But some basic pronunciations are needed.  Just make sure to provide as much information about accent as possible: fusha preferably but at least make it clear if you are speaking in dialect.

For those of us who can't really speak Arabic or have accents so bad it would not help anyone maybe we can make some drills that way anyone with a good accent can just read down the list and upload it instead of making the lessons themselves.

== Vowels / diacritics ==

My previous comments were a little hasty, I reviewed the pages more and clearly there is more vowel marking than I thought there was. One of my issues is that it seems inconsistent, and it certainly seems like there is a tendency to assume certain things (such as sukoon via no vowel where a vowel is expected). I will say that it is not easy to tell what standard the writer is keeping with these vowel markings. A page describing how the marking is being done, and a clear check for consistency in the policy, is in order. It is also extremely difficult where markings are visible to discern which marks belong to which lines in many places due to line-height being too small, but this is a simple matter of addressing formatting issues as time goes by. In any case, I also suggest cross-coördinating with the English and Arabic Wiktionaries (which could be abetted by Meta).

== Category IV ==

Arabic is a category IV language, not a category III.

== Orphaned page ==

[[Arabic/Some history]] is not linked to from any other page, and thus is [[Special:Lonelypages|orphaned]]. The page itself looks like it needs major cleanup. I'd like the contributors here to make a decision on what to do with the page. It looks like all the content there is already covered better on other pages, so my initial response would be to [[WB:CSD|speedy delete]] it (especially as the last edits were in 2006) but I'm instead putting up notice here in case there's material that could be merged into other articles.

I've also put up &lt;s&gt;Arabic/Arabic vowels&lt;/s&gt; for speedy deletion as it is also orphaned and doesn't seem to have any content not better covered on other pages. [[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] ([[User talk:Xerol|talk]]) 05:22, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

=Introduction=
Recursive relationships are an interesting and more complex concept than the relationships you have seen in the previous chapters. A recursive relationship occurs when there is a relationship between an entity and itself. For example, a one-to-many recursive relationship occurs when an employee is the manager of other employees. The employee entity is related to itself, and there is a one-to-many relationship between one employee (the manager) and many other employees (the people who report to the manager). Because of the more complex nature of these relationships, we will need slightly more complex methods of mapping them to a schema and displaying them in a style sheet.

=The one-to-one recursive relationship=
Continuing with the tour guide model, we will develop a schema that shows cities that have hosted the Olympics and the previous host city. Since the previous host is another city and only one city can be the previous host this is a one to one recursive relationship.

=The one-to-many recursive relationship=
A hypothetical sports team is divided into squads with each squad having a captain. Every person on the team is a player, regardless of whether they are a squad captain. Since a squad captain is a player, this situation meets the definition of a recursive relationship—a squad captain is also a player and has a one-to-many relationship with the other players. This is a one-to-many recursive relationship because one captain has many players under him/her. See the example below for how to model the relationship.

=== Natural one-to-many recursive structure ===
A more natural approach for most one-to-many recursive relationships is to use XML's heirarchical nature to directly represent the heirarchy. Consider Locations:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;location type=&quot;country&quot;&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;USA&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;sub-locations&gt;
    &lt;location type=&quot;state&quot;&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;Ohio&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;sub-locations&gt;
        &lt;location type=&quot;city&quot;&gt;&lt;name&gt;Akron&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/location&gt;
        &lt;location type=&quot;city&quot;&gt;&lt;name&gt;Columbus&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/location&gt;
      &lt;/sub-location&gt;
    &lt;/location&gt;
  &lt;/sub-locations&gt;
&lt;/location&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=The many-to-many recursive relationship=
Think you're getting a feel for recursive relationships yet? Well, there is still the third and final relationship to add to your repertoire — the many-to-many recursive. A common example of a many-to-many recursive relationship is when one item can be comprised of many items of the same data type as itself, and each of those sub-items may belong to another parent item of the same data type. Sound confusing? Let's look at the example of a product that can consist of a single item or multiple items (i.e., a packaged product). The example below describes tourist products that can be packaged together to create a new product.

&lt;SMALL&gt;'''Exhibit 6:  XML Document for Product Entity &lt;/SMALL&gt;'''

=Summary=
When the child has the same type of data as its parent in a parent-child type data relationship, this is a sign of the existence of a recursive relationship. 
The &lt;b&gt;xsd:ID&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;xsd:IDREF&lt;/b&gt;  elements can be used in a schema to create primary key-foreign key values in an XML document.

Lester Levenson
Lester's Realization 
“I was at the end of my rope. I was told not to take a step unless I absolutely had to because there was a possibility that I could drop dead at any moment.

“This was a terrible, shocking thing to suddenly be told that I couldn’t be active anymore, having been so active all my life. It was a horrible thing.

“An intense fear of dying overwhelmed me, the fear that I might drop dead any minute. This stayed with me for days. I went through a real, horrible, low, spinning period there, in the grip of intense fear of dying or of being a cripple for the rest of my life in that I wouldn’t be able to be active. How could I take care of all that, and me. I felt that life would not be worthwhile any more.

“This caused me to conclude with determination, 'Either I get the answers, or I’ll take me off this earth. No heart attack will do it!' I had a nice easy way to do it, too. I had morphine the doctors gave me for my kidney stone attacks.

“After several days of this intense fear of dying, I suddenly realized, 'Well, I’m still alive. As long as I’m alive there’s hope. As long as I’m alive, maybe I can get out of this. What do I do?'

“Well, I was always a smart boy, always made the honor roll. Even got myself a four-year scholarship to Rutgers University at a time when scholarships were very rare through competitive examinations. But what does this avail me? Nothing! Here I am with all this brilliance, as miserable and scared as can be.

“Then I said, 'Lester, you were not only not smart, you were dumb! Dumb! Dumb! There’s something wrong in your intellect. With all your knowledge, you’ve come to this bottom end! Drop all this knowledge you’ve so studiously picked up on philosophy, psychology, social science, and economics! It is of no avail! Start from scratch. Begin all over again your search for the answers.

“And with an extreme desperation and intense wanting out—not wanting to die, I began to question, 'What am I? What is this world? What is my relationship to it? What do I want from it?'

“'Happiness.'

“'Well, what is happiness?'

“'Being loved.'

“But I am loved. I know several very desirable girls with beauty, charm and intellect who want me. And I have the esteem of my friends. Yet, I’m miserable!

“I sensed that the closest thing related to happiness was love. So I began reviewing and reliving my past love affairs, looking at the points where the little happiness that I had were. I began to pull up and dissect all my high moments of loving.

“Suddenly, I got an inkling that it was when I was loving that I had the highest feeling!

“I remembered one evening, a beautiful balmy evening, in the mountains when I was camping with Virginia. We were both lying on the grass, both looking up at the sky, and I had my arm around her. The nirvana, the perfection of the height of happiness was right there. I was feeling how great is love for Virginia! How wonderful is knowing all this nature! How perfect a setting!

“Then I saw that it was my loving her that was the cause of this happiness! Not the beauty of the setting, or being with Virginia.

“Then I immediately turned to the other side. Boy it was great when she loved me! I remembered the moment when publicly this beautiful, charming girl told the world that she approved of Lester, she loved Lester—and I could feel that nice feeling of approval. But I sensed that it was not as great as what I had just discovered. It was not a lasting feeling. It was just for the moment. In order for me to have that feeling continuously, she had to continue saying that.

“So, this momentary ego approval was not as great as the feeling of loving her! As long as I was loving her, I felt so happy. But when she loved me, there were only moments of happiness when she gave me approval.

“Days of further cogitation gradually revealed to me that this was correct! I was happier when I loved her than I was when I got that momentary ego-satisfaction when she loved me. Her loving me was a momentary pleasure that needed constant showing and proving on her part, while my loving her was a constant happiness, as long as I was loving her.

“I concluded that my happiness equated to my loving! If I could increase my loving, then I could increase my happiness! This was the first inkling I had as to what brings about happiness. And it was a tremendous thing because I hadn’t had happiness. And I said, 'Gee, if this is the key to happiness, I’ve got the greatest!' Even the hope of getting more and more happiness was a tremendous thing, because this was the number one thing I wanted—happiness.

“That started me on weeks and weeks of reviewing my past love affairs. I dug up from the past, incident after incident when I thought I was loving, and I discovered that I was being nice to my girlfriends, trying to get them to love me, and that that was selfish. That was not really love. That was just wanting my ego bolstered!

“I kept reviewing incidents from the past, and where I saw that I was not loving, I would change that feeling to loving that person. Instead of wanting them to do something for me, I would change it to my wanting to do something for them. I kept this up until I couldn’t find any more incidents to work on.

“This insight on love, seeing that happiness was determined by my capacity to love, was a tremendous insight. It began to free me, and any bit of freedom when you’re plagued feels so good. I knew that I was in the right direction. I had gotten hold of a link of the chain of happiness and was determined not to let go until I had the entire chain.

“I felt a greater freedom. There was an easier concentration of my mind because of it. And I began to look better at my mind. What is my mind? What is intelligence?

“Suddenly, a picture flashed of amusement park bumper-cars that are difficult to steer so that they continually bump into each other. They all get their electrical energy from the wire screen above the cars through a pole coming down to every car.

“The power above was symbolic of the overall intelligence and energy of the universe coming down the pole to me and everyone else, and to the degree we step on the gas do we use it. Each driver of the cars is taking the amount of energy and intelligence that he wants from that wire, but he steers his car blindly and bumps into other cars, and bumps and bumps.

“I saw that if I chose to, I could take more and more of that overall intelligence.

“And so I dug into that. I began to examine thinking and its relationship to what was happening. And it was revealed that everything that was happening had a prior thought behind it and that I never before related the thought and the happening because of the element of time between the two.

“When I saw that everything that was happening to me had a thought of it before it happened, I realized that if I could grab hold of this, I could consciously determine everything that was happening to me!

“And above all, I saw that I was responsible for everything that had happened to me, formerly thinking that the world was abusing me! I saw that my whole past life, and all that tremendous effort to make money and in the end, failing, was due only to my thinking!

“This was a tremendous piece of freedom, to think that I was not a victim of this world, that it lay within my power to arrange the world the way I wanted it to be, that rather than being an effect of it, I could now be at cause over it and arrange it the way I would like it to be!

“That was a tremendous realization, a tremendous feeling of freedom!

“I was so ill when I started my searching; I had one foot in the grave. And when I saw that my thinking was cause for what was happening to me, I immediately saw my body from my chin down to my toes as perfect. And instantly, I knew it was perfect! I knew the lesions and adhesions of my intestine due to perforated ulcers were undone. I knew everything within me was in perfect running order.

“And it was.

“Discovering that my happiness equated to my loving, discovering that my thinking was the cause of things happening to me in my life gave me more and more freedom. Freedom from unconscious compulsions that I had to work, I had to make money, I had to have girls. Freedom in the feeling that I was now able to determine my destiny, I was now able to control my world, I was now able to arrange my environment to suit me. This new freedom lightened my internal burden so greatly that I felt that I had no need to do anything.

“Plus, the new happiness I was experiencing was so great! I was experiencing a joy that I had never known existed. I had never dreamed happiness could be so great.

“I determined ‘If this is so great, I’m not going to let go of it until I carry it all the way!’ I had no idea how joyous a person could be.

“So, I began digging further on how to extend this joy. I began further changing my attitudes on love. I would imagine the girl I wanted most marrying one of my friends, or the boy I would want her to marry least, and then enjoy their enjoying each other. To me, this was the extreme in loving, and if I could achieve it, it would give me more of this wonderful thing that I was experiencing.

“And so I worked on it. I took a particular fellow, Burl, and a particular girl, and I wouldn’t let go until I could really feel the joy of their enjoying each other.

“Then I knew I had it—or almost had it.

“Then later on, I had further tests of this in talking to people who were opposing me no end when I was trying to help them. I would consciously feel the greatest love for them when they were attacking me. And the joy of loving them was so wonderful, I would, without any thought, thank them so profusely for having given me the opportunity of talking with them, that it threw them into a dither.</text>

'''Spicy Chicken Casserole''' - This casserole isn't that spicy unless you make it that way.  In fact, change the ingredients to suit your own taste and it will probably taste better.

==Ingredients==
*1 pkg [[Cookbook:Tortilla|corn tortilla]]s
*1 12 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] can [[Cookbook:Chili|chili]]
*1 10 oz can condensed cream of chicken soup
*1 10 oz can condensed cream of celery soup
*8 oz [[Cookbook:Cheddar Cheese|cheddar cheese]], shredded
*2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], shredded
*1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Salsa|salsa]]

==Procedure==
#Mix all ingredients except tortillas and cheese.
#Layer in baking dish: tortillas, chicken, cheese.
#Layer twice, and finish with cheese.
#Bake at [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|375°F]] for 30-40 minutes.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">===Q3Map2-specific entity keys:===

*Let it be known that entity keys with a preceeding underscore (&quot;_&quot;) character are keys read by the compiler, and keys with no preceeding underscore are read by both the compiler and the game.

====&lt;tt&gt;_indexmap&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Path to an art file (typically .pcx or .bmp) used to guide the mapping of shaders onto a metashaded surface, such as Quake III: Team Arena-style terrain.
*The path for _indexmap should start in the same directory as is used by your game's fs_basepath switch (i.e. &quot;baseq3&quot;).  If your indexmap were found at &quot;C:\path\to\Quake III Arena\baseq3\indexmap.pcx&quot;, a value of &quot;indexmap.pcx&quot; for the _indexmap key would be sufficient.
*_indexmap used to be &quot;alphamap&quot;, though the latter is now deprecated.  A key of &quot;alphamap&quot; will still work, but (as it does not follow the underscored compiler key format) its use is not encouraged.
*_indexmap is used on func_group entities.

====&lt;tt&gt;_layers&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Number of unique root shaders found in a terrain metashader, such as those used by Quake III: Team Arena-style terrain.
*_layers used to be &quot;layers&quot;, though the latter is now deprecated.
*_layers is used on func_group entities.

====&lt;tt&gt;_shader&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Path to the metashader used to assign textures to a terrain (func_group) entity.  Omit the &quot;textures/&quot; prefix.
*_shader used to be &quot;shader&quot;, though the latter is now deprecated.
*_shader is used on func_group entities.

====&lt;tt&gt;_lightmapscale&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Floating point value scaling the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).  A _lightmapscale of 0.25 would result in four times as much lightmap detail as 1.0, while 4.0 would only have one quarter of 1.0's detail.
*_lightmapscale is used on func_group entities; though worldspawn supports _lightmapscale, use of lightmap scaling on the world is not recommended.

====&lt;tt&gt;_cs&lt;/tt&gt; ''or'' &lt;tt&gt;_castshadows&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Allows per-entity control over shadow casting.
*Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world.  0 = no shadow casting, 1 = casts shadows on world.
*Can be used in conjunction with _rs (or _receiveshadows) for tighter control of where, exactly, certain shadows fall.
*A _cs value greater than 1 (say, &quot;7&quot;) would cast shadows on the world, and on any entity with a corresponding _rs value (&quot;7&quot; again, in our case) as well.
*A _cs value less than 1 (say, &quot;-7&quot;) would cast shadows only on entities with a corresponding _rs value (&quot;-7&quot;) and not cast shadows on the world.
*_cs is used on any entity.
*misc_model entities, which are static, belongs to world.

====&lt;tt&gt;_rs&lt;/tt&gt; ''or'' &lt;tt&gt;_receiveshadows&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Allows per-entity control over shadow reception.
*Defaults to 1 on everything.  0 = receives no shadows, 1 = receives world shadows.
*Can be used in conjunction with _cs (or _castshadows) for tighter control of where, exactly, certain shadows fall.
*A _rs value greater than 1 (say, &quot;7&quot;) would receive world shadows, as well as shadows from any entity with a corresponding _cs value (&quot;7&quot; again).
*A _rs value less than 1 (say, &quot;-7&quot;) would receive shadows only from entities with a corresponding _cs value (&quot;-7&quot;) and not receive world shadows.
*_rs is used on any entity.

====&lt;tt&gt;_celshader&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Sets the cel shader used for this entity.  Omit the &quot;textures/&quot; prefix.
*_celshader is used on any entity.

====&lt;tt&gt;_targetname&lt;/tt&gt;====
*Used to attach a misc_model entity to func_whatever entities (i.e. func_bobbing, func_rotating, etc).
*_targetname is generally used on motion entities.

===Q3Map2-specific spawnflags===

====misc_model entity====

=====Spawnflag 1=====
*Toggles the model casting shadows on the map surfaces. 

=====Spawnflag 2=====
*Sets the autoclipping spawnflag, automatically assigning q3map_clipmodel to any shaders used by the model.
*Use of Q3Map2 autoclipping for models is only recommended for large models with relatively few triangles in their mesh (i.e. terrain).  The Q3Map2 autoclipping algorithm is a bit of a hack, and can hurt in-game performance (as well as produce erroneous clipping results) when used on small, dense models.

=====Spawnflag 3=====
*Spawnflag 1 plus Spawnflag 2.

=====Spawnflag 4=====
*Sets the forcemeta spawnflag, automatically adding q3map_forcemeta to any shaders used by the model (which, in turn, allows the model to become lightmapped).
*This, effectively, is the &quot;lightmapped model&quot; spawnflag.

=====Spawnflag 5=====
*Spawnflag 1 plus Spawnflag 4.

=====Spawnflag 6=====
*Spawnflag 2 plus Spawnflag 4.

=====Spawnflag 7=====
*Spawnflag 1 plus Spawnflag 2 plus Spawnflag 4.

I have converted the first several phrases to use Unicode stress marks instead of &quot;bold.&quot;  It's more consistent with traditional textbooks and references, but the down side is that cut-and-paste can be tricky.  However, if no-one objects I will convert the rest of this page, and then the other articles in this module.

:Yes, it's probably better like tha't. But it would be nicer if the accent could be placed ón the chàracter. Maybe there is an easy way to it like thís? [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 14:04, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Yes the rendering of &quot;combining diacritical marks&quot; is less than ideal, at least on Linux+Gecko.  IE does a slightly better job, at least with combinations for which pre-composed characters exist:

'a' + U+0301 = á (good, reduces to 'á')&lt;br/&gt;
'ю' + U+0301 = ю́ (not so good)

Anyway I'll go ahead with the change, and hope that font rendering gets better in the future.

==Why I came to Wikibooks==
While adding material to technical (science, mathematics) pages in the Wikipedia, I have become concerned with the readability of Wikipedia articles. In particular, I am concerned with the problem that can be summed up as:  &quot;the article is unreadable to non-experts and probably useless to experts.&quot;

In the Wikipedia I saw the suggestion that: &quot;Education material should go to Wikibooks. Reference material should stay here&quot;.

So I am starting to explore the issue of what should go in Wikipedia and what should go in Wikibooks. [[User:JWSchmidt|JWSchmidt]] 14:51, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Norman Weiner, welcome to the site and thanks for your contributions so far. Let me know if I can be of help at any time. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Welcome! I see you are writing a book on [[Electricity]]. I am the main writer for the book on [[Electronics]]. Given that Electrical Engineering is the study of Electricity and Electronics, I can see our books feeding off each other. Thus I propose a division of content. 

I see a good Electricity book talking about: coal, oil, and alternative energy, inductive power, power plants, generators, power conversion, three phase power, AC versus DC versus superconducting power transmission, plugs, motors, light bulbs, monitors, refrigerators, air conditioning, water heaters, stoves, and other appliances. And for each of these topics have a chart of the efficency involved.

I see a good Electronics book talking about charge, voltage, magnetic fields, superconductors, batteries, capacitors, radio, passive and active components, and other topics related to circuits and sensors. I also see an Electronics book desribing how to build various Electronic devices from these parts. 

In writing the [[Electronics]] book I have accumulated material that would fit better in an Electricity book. There is also [[GCSE Science/Electricity]]. 
Feel free to use or to link to any of this material. Good luck with your book Norman. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

Now you have your chance. I have devoted a whole book on Electronics to Electricity. Well, hope that helps. [[User:Wanderer|Wanderer]]

      <comment>/* Partition recommendations */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are 4 ways of &quot;installing&quot; Linux:
# &quot;no-install&quot;: a &quot;Run-from-CD&quot; [[w:LiveCD|LiveCD]] distribution. Everything runs from the CD and RAM, leaving the hard drive untouched -- completely avoiding the trickiest part of setting up Linux, &quot;hard drive partitioning&quot;. After you take out the CD and reboot, everything is restored to the way it was before. (Many of these work just as well with [[w:USB flash drive|USB flash drive]] as with CD)
# Linux on top of Windows: it's possible to keep windows applications running, and run Linux like any other application side-by-side with the Windows applications (this is an advantage compared to dual-booting, which shows either only Linux applications, or only Windows applications, and you have to reboot to get to the other one). andLinux, Portable Ubuntu, coLinux, Topologilinux, etc.
# There's a lot of information on setting up &quot;Dual-boot&quot; systems. This is not for beginners. (Experts generally don't do this either -- if they need 2 operating systems, they keep them on 2 physically separate hard drives, or better yet 2 physically separate computers).
# If you are certain there is nothing you want to keep on a computer's hard drive, you can completely erase the HD and install Linux only. This is the most fool-proof system -- Once the hard drive has been erased, the worst that can happen is erasing the hard drive again and having to start all over.
# This is rare now, but some distributions allow installation to any [[w:File Allocation Table|FAT32]] partition even if it contains an installation of Windows. This just copies files containing the Linux and uses a Floppy or a Boot Loader to load. Wubi, etc.

==Dual-booting or saving data==
===Preliminary note===
'''You most likely do not need to do this as it is integrated into the installers'''

Generally installers have excellent partitioning tools so this is all part of the install. If not, or if you are not installing it is easiest to use a live CD distro that has GParted on it, such as ubuntu. GParted does not support LVM volumes used on more complicated partitioning setups, however fedoras installer for example and debians can install and partition LVM volumes.

===Hard way===
To install Linux without erasing the contents of the hard drive requires a spare partition.  One solution is to install an extra hard drive.  However, one can also non-destructively resize an existing partition.  A FAT-type volume can be resized with FIPS and an NTFS volume with [http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfsresize.html ntfsresize].  If using FIPS, the hard drive will need to be defragmented before the resizing, but defragmentation is a good idea no matter what the file system.

===What size?===
You would be hard-pressed to fit a normal desktop Linux system in under 2GB.  It's advisable to give Linux more space than that, however, because many, many applications are available for free for Linux, and especially with a high-speed Internet connection, one is likely to install quite a lot of them.

You should plan on leaving at least 20% of each of your hard drive partitions free at all times -- modern file systems (such as NTFS, ext3 and ReiserFS) try to keep fragmentation low on their own, but they need extra space to do it with.

===Manual resizing===

====Easiest way====

(NOTE: Most of this only applies if there is already a version of Microsoft Windows on the computer)
The volume resizing is a safe process, but afterwards the hard drive must be repartitioned. An error here can destroy the data on the hard drive, so double-check all commands. A typical session with ntfsresize (&quot;/dev/hda1&quot; is the most likely name for the NTFS partition.  In this case, it is 10 GB in size.):

 paul@faust:/$ '''su'''
 Password:
''You must be root to run ntfsresize.  Under Knoppix {''what about other live CDs?'' Under Gentoo's LiveCD, you are already root, so the ''su'' will not prompt for a password. Anyone know about others? I'd assume no-password or already-root would cover most of them...}, you will not be asked for a password unless you had already set one.''

 faust:/# '''umount /dev/hda1'''
''This step is only needed if hda1 is already mounted, which is unlikely.  However, if it is not needed, it will only give an error message and not do anything.''

 faust:/# '''ntfsresize -i /dev/hda1'''

 You might resize at 4196970496 bytes or 4197 MB (freeing 6803 MB).
 Please make a test run using both the -n and -s options before real resizing!

''ntfsresize, version 1.90 and later, will automatically move files (including ones that the Windows defragmenter can't) in order to resize the partition, so defragmentation is not necessary before resizing (it might be easier to defragment while the partition is larger, though, so its a good opportunity).''

''The next step does a test run of the resizing process.  Here, the user decided to leave Windows with about 6GB of space.''

 faust:/# '''ntfsresize -n -s 6000M /dev/hda1'''

''Now, write down the exact number of megabytes passed on the command line here (in this case, 6000).  (The file system will probably not be resized to the exact size you specify, but ignore that &amp;mdash; use what you entered.)  You will need to resize the partition to the same size later.''

''Run ntfsresize with the same parameters, except leaving out the &lt;tt&gt;-n&lt;/tt&gt;.  This resizes the ntfs filesystem, but not the partition.''

&lt;!--(A real example belongs here, but someone's ntfs partition needs to be resized to collect it.)--&gt;

''Splitting the partition is the only remaining task.  Be sure to give it the hard drive (like &quot;/dev/hda&quot;) as a parameter, rather than the partition (&quot;/dev/hda1&quot;).''

 faust:/# '''cfdisk /dev/hda'''
''If you don't have cfdisk, use fdisk instead.  It has a less friendly interface, but it has exactly the same commands.  Either way, no changes are made to the disk until you tell the program to (w)rite out the new partition table.  If you accidentally write out the wrong partition structure, you should be able to save your data by replacing it with the correct one before doing anything to the affected partitions.''

&lt;!--flesh this out!--&gt;

You need to
*delete the current NTFS partition (this does not destroy the data on it)
*(N.B. In the highly unlikely event that there was unpartitioned space before the NTFS partition, you need to create a partition filling it up. ''This is false -- you can create a partition beginning anywhere on the disk. You just need to write down what the starting cylinder was.'')
*create a new partition with the same size you passed to ntfsresize earlier at the beginning of the unpartitioned space that was created.
*leave the remainder as free space.  It will be filled with Linux's partitions, but some decisions need to be made first.

==Partition recommendations==
*&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;: 
**5 GB
*&lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt;:
**Minimum 3 MB per kernel, recommended 100 MB.
**It's recommended if you have multiple HDDs, most BIOSes don't like loading kernels from disk different than the one on which bootloader resides on.
* swap partition or file = twice RAM size (Rule of thumb)
**Using old linux kernels, swap partitions were faster than swap files; that's no longer the case.
*&lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt;
**Whatever remains
**This is where the bulk of your data will reside, you will want ''lots'' of room
**It is a very good idea to avoid having &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; on one partition, if you're into that sort of thing, you know.

Note: If you're an advanced user and want to have few Linux systems installed side-by-side, or different file systems for experimenting, configuring [[w:Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)|Logical Volume Manager]] may be a good idea.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauces|Sauces]]

'''Senf''' is German for &quot;mustard&quot;. This particular senf, known as 'Süßer Senf', has a sweet, yet sharp taste that makes it great on sandwiches and crackers.  While this recipe is from a 3rd or 4th generation German American, such recipes are said to originate from the southern parts of Germany (Bavaria).

==Ingredients==
*1.7 oz. dry ground [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==
# Mix sugar, mustard, salt, and pepper together, then add water. 
# Add vinegar last, as the mustard will lose some of it's flavour if vinegar is introduced too early.
# Stir using a wire whisk to prevent lumps. 
# Add some water if too thick.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
It gets better as it cools and ages awhile.

|}
Very old compilers may not recognize some or all of the C89 keywords &lt;tt&gt;'''const'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''enum'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''signed'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''void'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''volatile'''&lt;/tt&gt;, as well as any later standards' keywords.

Keywords added to ISO C99 (supported in most new compilers):
{|
|
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Bool'''&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Complex'''&lt;/tt&gt;
|
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Imaginary'''&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'''inline'''&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; | 
* &lt;tt&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrict '''restrict''']&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

Keywords added to ISO C11 (supported only in some newer compilers):
{|
|
* &lt;tt&gt;'''alignof'''&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Alignas'''&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Atomic'''&lt;/tt&gt;
|
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Generic'''&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Noreturn'''&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Static_assert'''&lt;/tt&gt;
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* &lt;tt&gt;'''_Thread_local'''&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

Although not technically a keyword, C99-capable preprocessors/compilers additionally recognize the special preprocessor operator &lt;tt&gt;'''_Pragma'''&lt;/tt&gt;, which acts as an alternate form of the &lt;tt&gt;'''#pragma'''&lt;/tt&gt; directive that can be used from within macro expansions.  For example, the following code will cause some compilers (incl. GCC, Clang) to emit a diagnostic message:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#define EMIT_MESSAGE(str)    EMIT_PRAGMA(message(str))
#define EMIT_PRAGMA(content) _Pragma(#content)
EMIT_MESSAGE(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
Some compilers use a slight variant syntax; in  particular, MSVC supports &lt;tt&gt;'''__pragma'''&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;'''_Pragma'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

Specific compilers may also&amp;#x2014;in a non-standards-compliant mode, or with additional syntactic markers like &lt;tt&gt;'''__extension__'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;#x2014;treat some other words as keywords, including &lt;tt&gt;'''asm'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''cdecl'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''far'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''fortran'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''huge'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''interrupt'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''near'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''pascal'''&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;'''typeof'''&lt;/tt&gt;.  However, they typically allow these keywords to be overridden by declarations when operating in standards-compliant modes (e.g., by defining a variable named &lt;tt&gt;'''typeof'''&lt;/tt&gt;), in order to avoid introducing incompatibilities with existing programs.  In order to ensure the compiler can maintain access to extension features, these compilers usually have an additional set of proper keywords beginning with two underscores (&lt;tt&gt;'''__'''&lt;/tt&gt;).  For example, GCC treats &lt;tt&gt;'''asm'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''__asm'''&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;'''__asm__'''&lt;/tt&gt; somewhat identically, but the latter two are always guaranteed to have the expected meaning since they can't be overridden.

Many of the newly introduced keywords&amp;#x2014;namely, those beginning with an underscore and capital letter like &lt;tt&gt;'''_Noreturn'''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;'''_Imaginary'''&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;#x2014;are intended to be used only indirectly in most situations.  Instead, the programmer should prefer the use of standard headers such as &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stdalign.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, which typically use the preprocessor to establish an all-lower-case variant of the keyword (e.g., &lt;q&gt;&lt;tt&gt;complex&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;&lt;tt&gt;noreturn&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/q&gt;).  These headers serve the purpose of enabling C and C++ code, as well as code targeting different compilers or language versions, to interoperate more cleanly.  For example, by including &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, the tokens &lt;q&gt;&lt;tt&gt;bool&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/q&gt;, &lt;q&gt;&lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/q&gt;, and &lt;q&gt;&lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/q&gt; can be used identically in either C99 or C++ without having to explicitly use &lt;tt&gt;'''_Bool'''&lt;/tt&gt; in C99 or &lt;tt&gt;'''bool'''&lt;/tt&gt; in C++.

See also the [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v7v91/topic/com.ibm.vacpp7a.doc/language/ref/clrc02reserved_identifiers.htm list of reserved identifiers].


== C character sets ==

Programs written in C can read and write any character set.

The source program text for those programs, however, is usually limited to the following &quot;basic C source character set&quot;:

* Lowercase and uppercase letters: a–z A–Z
* Decimal digits: 0–9
* Graphic characters: ! &quot; # % &amp; ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? [ \ ] ^ _ { | } ~
* Whitespace characters: space, horizontal tab, vertical tab, form feed, newline.

(In file containing the source program text, the end of a line of text is often not a single newline character, but C compilers treat the end of each line as if it were a single newline character).

Some coding standards mandate that only the above 96 characters are allowed in source code files.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://stroustrup.com/JSF-AV-rules.pdf &quot;Joint strike fighter air vehicle C++ coding standards&quot;].
section 4.4.2 Character Sets.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Practically all compilers allow the 3 remaining printable 7-bit ASCII characters '$', '@', and '`'; at least in string literals, but they are not entirely portable.
Many compilers allow literal multibyte Unicode characters in string literals, but they are not entirely portable.

A few of the basic C source characters must be encoded to represent them in a string or character constant:

\\

\&quot;

\'

\n

\t

\f

\v

Most compilers allow an even wider &quot;basic C execution character set&quot; to be represented in string literals and otherwise used in at run time:
all the characters from the basic C source character set, along with

\r

\a

\b

\xhh , with each h replaced by a hexadecimal character, to portably represent arbitrary bytes (including \x00, the NULL byte)

\uhhhh or \Uhhhhhhhh encoding, with each h replaced by a hexadecimal character, to portably represent Unicode characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Chimpanzee-Head.jpg|left|thumbnail|Even complex processes as &quot;vision&quot; of a living organism is described in terms of simple physical laws that govern all matter, organic and inorganic]]

Living organisms are part of the physical world. The science of Biology depends upon physics and chemistry in many ways. When a chimpanzee uses its eyes, photons interact with molecules in the retina to trigger chemical reactions inside cells. The light-induced chemical changes lead to the movement of ions across cell membranes and the propagation of electrical signals along axons leading into the brain from the eyes. For vision, most animals are mainly dependent upon light that comes to the Earth from the nearest star. The photopigments in our eyes have been selected through the process of evolution to efficiently interact with just those colors of light that predominate in sunlight. 

A fruit tree can capture the energy of photons and convert that energy into chemical energy that is stored in sugar molecules. When a chimpanzee eats, food molecules become available as sources of energy inside cells for purposes like pumping ions across cell membranes. These pumped ions make possible the electrical signals of neurons that allow a chimpanzee to be consciously aware of what it sees. Most life on Earth depends on the conversion of matter to energy by fusion reactions inside the sun. 

[[Image:Sun at dusk (2007-07-28).jpg|right|thumbnail|Nuclear fusion, described by physical laws that govern nuclear forces in a hydrogen or helium, in the sun provide energy necessary for life on Earth. Nuclear fusion in older, larger stars also produced elements such as carbon and oxygen that are crucial to life.]]
Atoms such as iron that are required for the normal function of our cells were produced by nuclear reactions inside stars many billions of years ago. Many powerful tools for biology research depend on technologies that rely on the work of physicists. Scanning laser microscopes allow us to probe the structure of cells by making use of the physical fact that certain particles such as photons can be packed densely into the same physical space. Brain scanning techniques rely upon nuclear disintegrations or the magnetic properties of atoms. There is no real boundary between physics and biology; some scientists work in hybrid fields such as biophysics. It is often convenient to specialize in either biology or physics, but ultimately the results biology and physics must be consistent.

As a biology major, you are aware of the idea that human understandings of life have changed dramatically during recorded history and continue to change. It is only relatively recently that biological evolution could be understood in terms of mutations in DNA molecules. In the history of the study of life there was a dramatic conceptual reorientation from the idea that biological species were fixed forms to the current view of living organisms as dynamically evolving forms. Similarly, physics has undergone such conceptual revolutions. We now know that conservation of energy and conservation of mass do not hold when there is conversion between energy and mass. However, in biology there are many situations where it is still useful to make use of ideas like conservation of energy and conservation of mass. In Part I, we start our exploration of physics with these fundamental physical concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an introductory-level physics textbook for engineering and science students with a strong mathematical background. It is assumed that the student had a year of calculus, covering differentiation and basic integrals. For those less mathematically-inclined, there are other physics textbooks such as the [[Physics Study Guide: Contents|Physics Study Guide]]. While there are available online [[Calculus|mathematics]] resources for the mathematics required for the material, but an effort has been made to make this book self-contained in that respect. 

Where possible physical concepts will be first introduced in terms of historical context and descriptions of the significance. Basic mathematical treatments are given with an emphasis on specific examples and where mathematical abstraction is necessary, the motivation behind the manipulation of symbols will be explained. For a more mathematical and fundamental approach, try  the [[Modern Physics Text]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">under Chinese remainder theorem it says

N=m1m2...mk, then write n1=N/m1, ..., nk=N/mk.

leading to

nk=N/mk and nkmk=N (sounds right)

and

Our solution will be
x ≡ a1m1n1+...+akmknk (mod N)

leading to

Our solution will be
x ≡ (a1+...+ak)N (mod N) ≡ 0 (mod N)

which sounds wrong.  Hopefully someone can fix this, or explain better why it is right.

also, N can be lcm(m1,...,mk) when gcd(m1,...,mk)!=1

: I've always disliked the CRT, so there might be an error lurking there somewhere. I've got to review and expand that section, but I have little time nowadays... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:29, 16 Mar 2004 (UTC)</text>

A fluid is a substance that deforms continuously when subjected to a tangential or shear stress, however small the shear stress may be. Such a continuous deformation under the stress constitutes a flow. Fluid mechanics is therefore the study of mechanics of such matter. As such, it pertains mostly to the study of liquids and gases, however the general theories may be applied to the study of amorphous solids, colloidal suspensions and gelatinous materials.

Fluid mechanics is a subdivision of continuum mechanics.  Consequentially, fluids are considered continuous media for analysis, and their discrete nature is of no consequence for most applications.  This assumption is valid mostly on length scales much larger than intramolecular distances. The departure from continuum is characterised by a dimensionless parameter, the Knudsen Number, defined by 
&lt;math&gt;K_n =  \lambda/L&lt;/math&gt;, where L is a characteristic length scale of the flow. The continuum hypothesis holds good if Kn &lt; 0.01. However, recent applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology are demonstrating that the governing equations are still relevant on smaller scales, specifically when they are modified to include the effects of electrostatic, magnetic, colloidal and surface-tension driven forces. 

Some fluid mechanics problems can be solved by applying conservation laws (mass, momentum, energy) of mechanics to a finite control volume. However, in general, it is necessary to apply those laws to an infinitesimal control volume, then use the resulting differential equations.
Additionally, boundary values, initial conditions and thermodynamic state equations are generally necessary to obtain numeric or analytic solutions.

This book is a first course in the analysis of structures. Although most of the material should be accessible to all students who have had a mechanics course, a previous exposure to [[Engineering Mechanics]] would be useful. There are no mathematical prerequisites, though some elementary calculus would be useful in certain sections which can be skipped without affecting the flow of the book.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''quadrilateral''' is a [[Geometry/Polygon|polygon]] that has four sides.

==Special Types of Quadrilaterals==

*'''Parallelogram'''
**A parallelogram is a quadrilateral having two pairs of parallel sides.
**A square, a rhombus, and a rectangle are all examples of parallelograms.

*'''Rhombus'''
**A rhombus is a quadrilateral of which all four sides are the same length.

*'''Rectangle'''
**A rectangle is a parallelogram of which all four angles are 90 degrees. 

*'''Square'''
**A square is a quadrilateral of which all four sides are of the same length, and all four angles are 90 degrees. 
**A square is a rectangle, a rhombus, and a parallelogram.

*'''Trapezoid'''
**A trapezoid is a quadrilateral which has two parallel sides (U.S.)

*'''Trapezium'''
**U.S. usage: A trapezium is a quadrilateral which has no parallel sides. 
**U.K usage: A trapezium is a quadrilateral with two parallel sides (same as US trapezoid definition).

*'''Kite'''
**A kite is an quadrilateral with two pairs of congruent adjacent sides.

One of the most important properties used in proofs is that the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. This can easily be proven too:

If you draw a random quadrilateral, and one of its diagonals, you'll split it up into two triangles. Given that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees, you can sum them up, and it'll give 360 degrees.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Atbash''' is an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East. It was originally used in the Hebrew language. The name &quot;Atbash&quot; comes from the first Hebrew letter Aleph and the last Taff. The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting alphabet is backwards. Effectively Atbash is the 26th [[Cryptography/Caesar_cipher|Caesar shift]]. Atbash is also a [[Cryptography/Substitution cipher|substitution cipher]]. Since each letter corresponds to another, it offers very little security. The first letter is replaced with the last letter, the second with the second-last, and so on. The completed cypher looks like so:

 Plain:  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 Cipher: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA

An example plaintext to ciphertext using Atbash:

 Plain:  MEETMEATONE
 Cipher: NVVGNVZGLMV

As one can see, and as mentioned previously, the Atbash cipher offers no security once the cipher method is found.

== Introduction ==
In the previous chapters, you learned how to use XML to structure and format data based on one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. Because XML provides the means to model data using hierarchical parent-child relationships, the one-to-one and one-to-many relationships are relatively simple to represent in XML. However, this hierarchical parent-child structure is difficult to use to model the many-to-many relationship, a common relationship between entities in many situations.

In this chapter, we will explore the pros and cons of a few methods that are used to model a many-to-many relationship in XML; these methods offer compromises in overcoming the problems that arise when applying this relationship to XML. In particular, we will see examples of how to model the many-to-many relationship using two different methods, &quot;Eliminate&quot; and &quot;ID/IDREF.&quot; Additionally, in the XML stylesheet, we will learn how to implement the key function to display the data that was modeled using the &quot;ID/IDREF&quot; method.

== Problems: many-to-many relationship ==
In XML, the parent-child relationship is most commonly used to represent a relationship.  This can easily be applied to a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.  A many-to-many relationship is not supported directly by XML; the parent-child relationship will not work as each element may only have a single parent element.  There are couple of possible solutions to get around this.

== Solutions: many-to-many relationship ==
=== Eliminate ===
'''Create XML documents that eliminate the need for a many-to-many relationship'''&lt;br&gt;
By limiting the extent of information that is conveyed, you can get around the need for a many-to-many relationship.  Instead of trying to have one XML document encompass all of the information, separate the information where one document describes only one of the entities that participates in the many-to-many relationship.  Using our tourGuide relationship for example, one way for us to accomplish this would be creating a separate XML document for each hotel.  The relationship with amenity would ultimately then become a one-to-many. This method is more suitable for situations in which the scope of data exchange can be limited to subsets of data. However, using this method for more broadly scoped data exchange, you may repeat data several times, especially if there are many attributes. To avoid this redundancy, use the ID/IDREF method.

=== ID/IDREF ===
'''Represent the many-to-many relationship using unique identifiers'''&lt;br&gt;
Although not the most user-friendly way to handle this problem, one way of getting around the many-to-many relationship is by creating keys that would uniquely identify each entity.  To do this, an element with ID or IDREF attributes-types must be specified within the XML schema. To use a data modeling analogy, ID is similar to the primary key, and IDREF is similar to the foreign key.

== Many-to-many relationship data model ==

'''Exhibit 1: Data model for a m:m relationship'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:XML_Hotel_amenity2.png|Data Model for a m:m relationship]]

The relationship reads, ''a hotel can have many amenities, and an amenity can exist at many hotels''. 

As you will notice, in order to represent a many-to-many relationship, two entities were added. The middle entity is necessary for the data model to represent an associative entity that stores data about the relationship between hotel and amenity.  Using our Tour Guide example, &quot;Amenity&quot; was added to represent a list of possible amenities that a hotel can possess. 

The following examples illustrate methods to represent a many-to-many relationship in XML.

== Eliminate: sample solution ==
In this example, the many-to-many relationship has been converted to a one-to-many relationship.

        &lt;emailAddress&gt;naremcaravan@oz.com.au&lt;/emailAddress&gt;

            &lt;amenityCloseHour&gt;22:00:00 &lt;/amenityCloseHour&gt;
        &lt;/amenity&gt;
    &lt;/hotel&gt;
&lt;/hotelGuide&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== ID/IDREF: sample solution ==
To avoid redundancy, we create a separate element, &quot;amenity,&quot; which is included at the top of the schema along with &quot;hotel.&quot; Remember, the data types ID and IDREF are synonymous with the primary key and foreign key, respectively. For every foreign key (IDREF), there must be a matching primary key (ID). Note that the IDREF data type has to be an alphanumeric string.  

The following example illustrates the ID/IDREF approach. Notice that the ID for the amenity pool is defined as &quot;k1,&quot; and every hotel with a pool as an amenity references &quot;k1,&quot; using IDREF. If the IDREF does not match any ID, then the document will not validate.

=== Key function: XML stylesheet ===

In order to set up an XML stylesheet using the ID/IDREF method for a many-to-many relationship, the key function should be used. In the stylesheet, the &amp;lt;xsl:key&amp;gt; element specifies the index, which is used to return a node-set from the XML document.

A key consists of the following:

1. the node that has the key&lt;br&gt;
2. the name of the key&lt;br&gt;
3. the value of a key

The following XML stylesheet illustrates how to use the key function to present content that is structured in a many-to-many relationship.

=Expedia.de: XML and affiliate marketing=

{| width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|- style=&quot;horizontal-align:wraptext;&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color:lightyellow&quot; |
Expedia.de is the German subsidiary of expedia.com, the internet-based travel agency headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, USA. It offers its customers the booking of airline tickets, car rentals, vacation packages and various other attractions and services via its website and by phone. Its websites attract more than 70 million visitors each month. Currently expedia.com employs 4.600 employees serving customers in the United States, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Australia. 

For marketing purposes expedia.de set up an affiliate marketing program. Affiliate marketing is a way to reach potential customers without any financial risk for the company intending to advertise (merchant). The merchant gives website owners, which are called affiliates, the opportunity to refer to the merchant page, offering commission-based monetary rewards as incentives. In the case of Expedia.de the affiliate partners receive a commission every time users from their websites book travel on expedia.de. So the affiliates can concentrate on selling and the merchant takes care of handling the transactions.

To ease the business of the affiliate partners – and of course to make the program more attractive – Expedia.de offers its partners a service called xmlAdEd. xmlAdEd is a service providing current product information on using XML. Affiliates using this service are able to request more than 8 million of travel offerings in XML format via HTTP-request. The data is updated several times a day.
In the HTTP-request you can set certain parameters such as location, price, airport code, …

The use of XML in this case gives the affiliates several advantages:
&lt;br&gt;-	Efficient and flexible processing of the data because of separation of structure, content and style.
&lt;br&gt;-	Platform-independent processing of the data.
&lt;br&gt;-	Lossless conversion into other file formats.
&lt;br&gt;-	Easy integration in their websites.
&lt;br&gt;-	Possibility to create an own web shop in individual design

By providing their affiliates product information in XML, expedia.de not only eases the business of their partners, but also ensures that customers receive consistent, up-to-date information on their services.

|- 
| When describing a many-to-many relationship in XML, there are a few solutions available for designers to use. In choosing how to represent the many-to-many relationship, the designer not only must consider the most efficient way to represent the information, but also the audience for which the document is intended and how the document will be used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Russian}}

==Произноше́ние - Pronunciation==

Usually, Russian is pronounced as you see it. However, there are some exceptions, usually changes in the pronunciation of vowels based on where they are in relation to the stressed syllable.
:'''O''' sounds like the 'o' in 'rogue' (i.e., 'oh') when it is stressed. An '''o''' that is just before the stress is pronounced like the 'a' in far (i.e., 'ah'). Otherwise, it's pronounced like the 'a' in 'about' (i.e., 'uh'). So, the word '''хорошо́''' is pronounced: /xərɐˈʂo/.
:'''E''' is pronounced 'ye', as in y's, when stressed. When it's not stressed, '''e''' sounds like '''и''', as in the 'e' in 'piglet'.
If you pronounce these letters without reducing them you will be understandable, but will sound strange.

Voiced consonants at the end of the word become unvoiced. So, '''таз''' sounds like 'tas', '''взвод''' sounds like 'vzvot', etc. The same thing happens if a voiced consonant is followed by an unvoiced one. For example, '''подско́к''' sounds like 'patskók'.

==Диало́г - Dialogue==
Unlike English, Russian has two words for 'you': '''ты''' and '''вы'''. You use '''вы''' when the person you're talking to is someone you don't know, someone you want to show respect to (such as a teacher or elder), or a group of people. In this sense, it is both a more polite form of '''ты''', and a plural form. So you would only use '''ты''' to talk to a single person who you know well. In written Russian, a capitalised '''Вы''' is used when being respectful, while the lower-case '''вы''' is used when talking to many people.&lt;br&gt;
You can also {{Audio|Ru-dialog_1.ogg|listen}} to the audio version of this dialogue.

;Здра́вствуйте, я рад/ра́да Вас ви́деть!
:''Zdrastvuyti, ya rat/rada Vas vidjet''
:Hello, I am glad to see you!

Note: The Russian for 'glad' is '''рад''' ('rat') when spoken by a male, or '''ра́да''' (rada) when spoken by a female

;До́брый день, и я то́же.
:''Dobry denj, i ya tozhi''
:Good afternoon, me too.

;Меня́ зовут́ Джо́ан, а Вас?  
:''Minya zavut Joanne, ah Vas?''
:My name is Joanne, and yours?

Note: This literally means &quot;Me (they) call Joanne, and you?&quot;, or &quot;They call me Joanne, and you?&quot; and is the Russian construction of asking someone's name.

;О́чень прия́тно!
:''Ochin' priyatna''
:Pleased to meet you.  (Literally, &quot;[it is] very pleasant&quot;).

;А меня́ — Ма́рья Степа́новна, мо́жно про́сто Ма́ша.  
:''A minya &amp;ndash; Maryah Stipanavna, mozhna prosto Masha''
:And mine is Marya Stepanovna, one may call me just Masha. (Literally, &quot;and [they call] me Marya Stepanovna, [one] may [call me] just Masha&quot;).

;Спаси́бо, до встре́чи!  
:''Spasiba, da fstrechi''
:Thank you, see you again!  (Literally, &quot;thank you, till another meeting&quot;).

;До свида́ния.  
:''Da svidanya''
:Good bye.  (Literally, &quot;till another seeing&quot;).

=== Introduction to the Mollusks ===
Mollusks are metazoan animals that take a variety of forms. However, almost all mollusks are characterized by a body with several main regions: a muscular '''foot''', a '''visceral mass''' covered by a '''mantle''' that secretes a '''shell''', paired '''gills''' (called ctenidia) and a unique feeding organ called a '''radula'''. The radula is a tongue-like organ that is covered with a chitinous ribbon with numerous rows of teeth, which are used to tear food off substrate and bring it into the mouth. In terms of species, they are the second-most diverse phylum next to the Arthropods, but few phyla can rival their diversity in form, from giant clams to minute sea slugs to fast moving squid.

Commonly accepted molluscan classes include:&lt;br&gt;
Aplacophora &lt;br&gt;
Monoplacophora &lt;br&gt;
Polyplacophora (chitons)&lt;br&gt;
Gastropoda (snails and slugs)&lt;br&gt;
Cephalopoda (squid, octopus, nautilus)&lt;br&gt;
Bivalvia (clams, oysters, mussels)&lt;br&gt;
Scaphopoda (Tusk shells)

Voltage = potential between two charges.  
Defined as the derivative of the flux linkage:

&lt;math&gt;V(t)=\frac{d(Ni(t))}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Current = flow of electrons
Defined as the rate of change of the charge:

&lt;math&gt;I(t)=\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

There are 3 parameters in an electrical circuit:

Resistance = 

&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

In a resistor voltage and current are in sync.

&lt;math&gt;V(t)=Ri(t)&lt;/math&gt;

In capacitors voltage leads current.  Capacitors are good as a low pass filter.

&lt;math&gt;V(t)=\frac{1}{C} \int i(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

In inductors current leads voltage.  Current equals the negative derivative of the voltage.  Inductors are good as a high pass filter.

&lt;math&gt;V(t)=L\frac{di(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Ohm's law describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

Voltage and current are related such that voltage is equal to current times resistance:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V = I \cdot R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Common units used in electronics calculations are:

V = mA &amp;times; k&amp;Omega;

[[Image:Ohms law voltage source.svg|150px]]

 the current going through any point in the circuit, I, will be equal to the voltage V divided by the resistance R.

[[Image:Ohms law current source.svg|150px]]

In this example, the voltage across the resistor, V, will be equal to the supplied current, I, times the resistance R.

SUMMARY:
:V=I times R    
:I=V divided by R
:R=V divided by I

== General remarks ==
[[File:Verschiedene Kondensatoren 2.JPG|thumb|right|Some different capacitors for electronic equipment]]
'''''Capacitors are a good example of the fact that even the simplest device can become complicated given 250 years of evolution.''''' (Citation J. Ho, T. R. Jow, St. Boggs, Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology)&lt;ref name=&quot;Boggs&quot;&gt;J. Ho, T. R. Jow, S. Boggs, Historical Introduction to Capacitor Technology, PDF [http://www.ifre.re.kr/board/filedown.php?seq=179]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capacitors''', together with resistors, inductors and memristors, belong to the group of &quot;passive components&quot; for electronic equipment. Although in absolute figures the most common capacitors are integrated capacitors, e.g. in DRAMs or in flash memory structures, this article is concentrated on discrete components.

==Capacitors==
=== Theory of conventional construction ===
&lt;!--
A capacitor is a variation on a cell, with the big difference being that capacitors are discharged at once and cells are discharged over time.
--&gt;
:[[image:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|left|thumb|300px|Model of a capacitor]]
A capacitor (historically known as a &quot;condenser&quot;) is a device that stores energy in an electric field, by accumulating an internal imbalance of electric charge. It is made of two conductors separated by a dielectric (insulator).  Using the same analogy of water flowing through a pipe, a capacitor can be thought of as a tank, in which the charge can be thought of as a volume of water in the tank.  The tank can &quot;charge&quot; and &quot;discharge&quot; in the same manner as a capacitor does to an electric charge.  A mechanical analogy is that of a spring.  The spring holds a charge when it is pulled back.

When voltage exists one end of the capacitor is getting drained and the other end is getting filled with charge.This is known as charging.  Charging creates a charge imbalance between the two plates and creates a reverse voltage that stops the capacitor from charging.  As a result, when capacitors are first connected to voltage, charge flows only to stop as the capacitor becomes charged.  When a capacitor is charged, current stops flowing and it becomes an open circuit.  It is as if the capacitor gained infinite resistance.

You can also think of a capacitor as a fictional battery in series with a fictional resistance. Starting the charging procedure with the capacitor completely discharged, the applied voltage is not counteracted by the fictional battery, because the fictional battery still has zero voltage, and therefore the charging current is at its maximum. As the charging continues, the voltage of the fictional battery increases, and counteracts the applied voltage, so that the charging current decreases as the fictional battery's voltage increases. Finally the fictional battery's voltage equals the applied voltage, so that no current can flow into, nor out of, the capacitor. 

Just as the capacitor charges it can be discharged. Think of the capacitor being a fictional battery that supplies at first a maximum current to the &quot;load&quot;, but as the discharging continues the voltage of the fictional battery keeps decreasing, and therefore the discharge current also decreases. Finally the voltage of the fictional battery is zero, and therefore the discharge current also is then zero.

This is not the same as dielectric breakdown where the insulator between the capacitor plates breaks down and discharges the capacitor.  That only happens at large voltages and the capacitor is usually destroyed in the process.  A spectacular example of dielectric breakdown occurs when the two plates of the capacitor are brought into contact.  This causes all the charge that has accumulated on both plates to be discharged at once.  Such a system is popular for powering tasers which need lots of energy in a very brief period of time.

=== Theory of electrochemical construction ===
[[File:Electric double-layer (BMD model) NT.PNG|thumb|Scheme on double layer on electrode (BMD model).&lt;br/&gt; 1. IHP Inner Helmholtz Layer&lt;br/&gt; 2. OHP Outer Helmholtz Layer&lt;br/&gt; 3. Diffuse layer&lt;br/&gt; 4. Solvated ions&lt;br/&gt; '''5. Specifically adsorptive ions (Pseudocapacitance)'''&lt;br/&gt; 6. Solvent molecule.]]

Besides the conventional static storage of electric energy in an electric field, two other storage principles to store electric energy in a capacitor exist. They are so-called electrochemical capacitors. In contrast to ceramic, film and electrolytic capacitors, supercapacitors, also known as electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) or ultracapacitors do not have a conventional dielectric. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined by two high-capacity storage principles. These principles are:

* electrostatic storage within Helmholtz double layers achieved on the phase interface between the surface of the electrodes and the electrolyte '''(double-layer capacitance)''' and the
* electrochemical storage achieved by a faradaic electron charge-transfer by specifically adsorpted ions with redox reactions '''(pseudocapacitance)'''. Unlike batteries, in the faradaic redox reactions, the ions simply cling to the atomic structure of an electrode without making or braking chemical bonds, and no or negligibly small chemical modifications are involved in charge/discharge. 

The ratio of the storage resulting from each principle can vary greatly, depending on electrode design and electrolyte composition. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namisnyk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A Survey of Electrochemical Supercapacitor Technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |date=23 June 2003 |accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacitance==
The capacitance of a capacitor is a ratio of the amount of charge that will be present in the capacitor when a given potential (voltage) exists between its leads.  The unit of capacitance is the [[w:Farads|farad]] which is equal to one coulomb per volt.  This is a very large capacitance for most practical purposes; typical capacitors have values on the order of microfarads or smaller.
&lt;br&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''C'' is the capacitance in farads, ''V'' is the potential in volts, and ''Q'' is the charge measured in coulombs.  Solving this equation for the potential gives:

:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{Q}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

==Capacitor &amp; Direct Current Voltage (DC)==
Charge Building
: When a Capacitor is connected with electricity source V. Charge will build up on each plates of capacitor of the same amount of charge but different in polarity . This process is called Capacitor Charging

Storing Charge
: When both plates are charged up to voltage V then there is no difference in voltage between capacitor's plates and electricity source therefore no current flow in the circuit. This is called Storing Charge

Charge discharge
: When the capacitor is connected to ground, current will flow from capacitor to ground until the voltage on capacitor's plates are equal to zero.

Therefore, a Capacitor is a device that can Build up Charge , Store Charge and Release Charge

==Capacitor &amp; Alternating Current Voltage (AC)==
===Voltage===
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{1}{C}\int I dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Current===
: &lt;math&gt;I = C \frac{dV}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

===Reactance===
Reactance is defined as the ratio of Voltage over Current
: &lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} \angle -90 = \frac{1}{j \omega C} = \frac{1}{sC}&lt;/math&gt;

===Impedance===
Impedance is defined as the sum of Capacitor's Resistance and Reactance
: &lt;math&gt;R_C + X_C = R_C \angle 0 + \frac{1}{\omega C} \angle -90 = R_C + \frac{1}{j \omega C} = R_C + \frac{1}{sC}&lt;/math&gt;

===Angle of Difference between Voltage and Current===

For Lossless Capacitor 
: Current will lead Voltage an angle 90 degree

For Lossy Capacitor 
: Current will lead Voltage an angle θ degree where
: Tan θ = &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega CR_C} = \frac{1}{2\pi f CR_C} = \frac{t}{2\pi CR_C} &lt;/math&gt;

Changing the value of R and C will change the value of Phase Angle, Angular Frequency, Frequency and Time
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{1}{Tan \theta CR_C} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; f = \frac{1}{2\pi Tan \theta CR_C} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; t = 2\pi Tan \theta CR_C &lt;/math&gt;

==Capacitor Connection==
===Capacitors in Series===
Capacitors in series are the same as increasing the distance between two capacitor plates. As well, it should be noted that placing two 100 V capacitors in series results in the same as having one capacitor with the total maximum voltage of 200 V. This, however, is not recommended to be done in practice, especially with capacitors of different values. In a capacitor network in series, '''all capacitors can have a different voltage over them'''.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:[[Image:Capacitorsseries.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
In a series configuration, the capacitance of all the capacitors combined is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the capacitance of all the capacitors.
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \cdots +  \frac{1}{C_n}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

===Capacitors in Parallel===
Capacitors in parallel are the same as increasing the total surface area of the capacitors to create a larger capacitor with more capacitance. In a capacitor network in parallel, '''all capacitors have the same voltage over them'''.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:[[Image:Capacitorsparallel.png]]

In a parallel configuration, the capacitance of the capacitors in parallel is the sum of the capacitance of all the capacitors.
:&lt;math&gt; C_{eq} = C_1  + C_2 + \cdots + C_n \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

==RC Circuit==

===Introduction===
An '''RC''' circuit is short for 'Resistor-Capacitor' circuit. A capacitor takes a finite amount of time to discharge through a resistor, which varies with the values of the resistor and capacitor. A capacitor acts interestingly in an electronic circuit, practically speaking as a combination of a voltage source and a variable resistor.

===Basics===
Below is a simple RC Circuit:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC01.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
There is a capacitor in parallel with the resistor and current probe. The way the capacitor functions is by acting as a very low resistance '''load''' when the circuit is initially turned on. This is illustrated below:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC02.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Initially, the capacitor has a very low resistance, almost 0. Since electricity takes the path of least resistance, almost all the electricity flows through the capacitor, not the resistor, as the resistor has considerably higher resistance.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC03.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
As a capacitor charges, its resistance increases as it gains more and more charge. As the resistance of the capacitor climbs, electricity begins to flow not only to the capacitor, but through the resistor as well:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC04.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Once the capacitor's voltage equals that of the battery, meaning it is fully charged, it will not allow any current to pass through it. As a capacitor charges its resistance increases and becomes effectively infinite (open connection) and all the electricity flows through the resistor.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC05.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Once the voltage source is disconnected, however, the capacitor acts as a voltage source itself:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC06.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
As time goes on, the capacitor's charge begins to drop, and so does its voltage. This means less current flowing through the resistor:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC01.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Once the capacitor is fully discharged, you are back to square one:&lt;br&gt;

If one were to do this with a light and a capacitor connected to a battery, what you would see is the following: 

#Switch is closed. Light does not light up.
#Light gradually becomes brighter and brighter...
#Light is at full luminosity.
#Switch is released. Light continues to shine. 
#Light begins to fade...
#Light is off.

This is how a capacitor acts. However, what if you changed the values of R1? C1? The voltage of the battery? We will examine the mathematical relationship between the resistor, capacitor, and charging rate below.

===Time Constant===

In order to find out how long it takes for a capacitor to fully charge or discharge, or how long it takes for the capacitor to reach a certain voltage, you must know a few things. First, you must know the starting and finishing voltages. Secondly, you must know the '''time constant''' of the circuit you have. Time constant is denoted by the Greek letter 'tau' or '''''τ'''''. The formula to calculate this time constant is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \tau={R}{C} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Great, so what does this mean? The time constant is how long it takes for a capacitor to charge to 63% of its full charge. This time, in seconds, is found by multiplying the resistance in ohms and the capacitance in farads.

According to the formula above, there are two ways to lengthen the amount of time it takes to discharge. One would be to increase the resistance, and the other would be to increase the capacitance of the capacitor. This should make sense. It should be noted that the formula compounds, such that in the second time constant, it charges another 63%, based on the original 63%. This gives you about 86.5% charge in the second time constant. Below is a table.

For all practicality, by the 5th time constant it is considered that the capacitor is fully charged or discharged. 

'''put some stuff in here about how discharging works the same way, and the function for voltage based on time'''

&lt;math&gt;v(t)=\frac{1}{C} \int i(t)dt&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''i''(''t'') is the current flowing through the capacitor as a function of time.

This equation is often used in another form. By differentiating with respect to time:

&lt;math&gt;i(t)=C\frac{dv(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting v/r for i(t) and integrating the above equation gives you an equation used to describe the charging and discharging characteristics of RC circuits. A charging characteristic curve exponentially increases from 0% (0 volts) and approaches 100% full (maximum voltage), similarly, a discharge curve starts at the theoretical 100% (maximum voltage) and exponentially falls back to 0% (0 volts).

==Capacitors - general remarks==

=== Common capacitors and their names ===
Capacitors are divided into two mechanical groups: Fixed capacitors with fixed capacitance values and variable capacitors with variable (trimmer) or adjustable (tunable) capacitance values.

The most important group is the fixed capacitors. Many got their names from the dielectric. For a systematic classification these characteristics can't be used, because one of the oldest, the electrolytic capacitor, is named instead by its cathode construction. So the most-used names are simply historical.

The most common kinds of capacitors are:

* '''Ceramic capacitors''' have a ceramic dialectric.
* '''Film''' and '''paper capacitors''' are named for their dielectrics.
* '''Aluminum, tantalum''' and '''niobium electrolytic capacitors''' are named after the material used as the anode and the construction of the cathode
* '''Supercapacitor''' is the family name for:
** '''Double-layer capacitors''' were named for the physical phenomenon of the Helmholtz double-layer
** '''Pseudocapacitors''' were named for their ability to store electric energy electro-chemically with reversible faradaic charge-transfer
** '''Hybrid capacitors''' combine double-layer and pseudocapacitors to increase power density
* Seldom-used '''Silver mica, glass, silicon, air-gap and vacuum capacitors''' were named for their dielectric.

Capacitors in each family have similar physical design features, but vary, for example, in the form of the terminals.

[[File:Fixed capacitors overview.svg|center|600px|Overview over the most commonly used fixed capacitors in electronic equipment]]
In addition to the above shown capacitor types, which derived their name from historical development, there are many individual capacitors that have been named based on their application. They include:

* Power capacitors, motor capacitors, DC-link capacitors, suppression capacitors, audio crossover capacitors, lighting ballast capacitors, snubber capacitors, coupling, decoupling or bypassing capacitors.

Often, more than one capacitor family is employed for these applications, e.g. interference suppression can use ceramic capacitors or film capacitors.

Specialized devices such as built-in capacitors with metal conductive areas in different layers of a multi-layer printed circuit board and kludges such as twisting together two pieces of insulated wire also exist.

=== Dielectrics ===
[[File:Fixed capacitors-charge storage principles-2.png|thumb|center|350px|Principle charge storage of different capacitor types and their inherent voltage progression]]

The most common dielectrics are:

* Ceramics
* Plastic films
* [[Oxide]] layer on metal ([[Aluminum]], [[Tantalum]], [[Niobium]])
* Natural materials like [[mica]], [[glass]], [[paper]], [[air]], [[vacuum]]

All of them store their electrical charge statically within an [[electric field]] between two (parallel) electrodes.

Beneath this conventional capacitors a family of electrochemical capacitors called [[Supercapacitor]]s was developed. Supercapacitors don't have a conventional dielectric. They store their electrical charge statically in

* [[Double layer (interfacial)|Helmholtz double-layers]] (Double-layer capacitors)

and additional electrochemical with faradaic charge transfer

* with a [[Pseudocapacitor|pseudocapacitance]] (Pseudocapacitors)
* or with both storage principles together (Hybrid capacitors).

The most important material parameters of the different dielectrics used and the appr. Helmholtz-layer thickness are given in the table below.

The capacitor's plate area can be adapted to the wanted capacitance value. The permittivity and the dielectric thickness are the determining parameter for capacitors. Ease of processing is also crucial. Thin, mechanically flexible sheets can be wrapped or stacked easily, yielding large designs with high capacitance values. Razor-thin metallized sintered ceramic layers covered with metallized electrodes however, offer the best conditions for the miniaturization of circuits with SMD styles.

A short view to the figures in the table above gives the explanation for some simple facts:

* '''[[Supercapacitor]]s''' have the highest capacitance density because of its special charge storage principles
* '''[[Electrolytic capacitor]]s''' have lesser capacitance density than supercapacitors but the highest capacitance density of conventional capacitors because its thin dielectric.
* '''[[Ceramic capacitor]]s''' class 2 have much higher capacitance values in a given case than class 1 capacitors because of their much higher permittivity.
* '''[[Film capacitor]]s''' with their different plastic film material do have a small spread in the dimensions for a given capacitance/voltage value of a film capacitor because the minimum dielectric film thickness differs between the different film materials.

=== Capacitance and voltage range ===
[[File:Kondensatoren-Kap-Versus-Spg-English.svg|center|400px|Capacitance ranges vs. voltage ranges of different capacitor types]]

Capacitance ranges from picofarad to more than hundreds of farad. Voltage ratings can reach 100 kilovolts. In general, capacitance and voltage correlates with physical size and cost.

=== Miniaturization ===
[[File:Capacitor Miniaturizing 1970-2005.png|thumb|center|Capacitor volumetric efficiency increased from 1970 to 2005 (click image to enlarge)]]

As in other areas of electronics, [[volumetric efficiency]] measures the performance of electronic function per unit volume. For capacitors, the volumetric efficiency is measured with the &quot;CV product&quot;, calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum voltage rating (V), divided by the volume. From 1970 to 2005, volumetric efficiencies have improved dramatically.

=== Overlapping range of applications ===
These individual capacitors can perform their application independent of their affiliation to an above shown capacitor type, so that an overlapping range of applications between the different capacitor types exists.

==Capacitor - types and styles==

=== Ceramic capacitors ===
[[File:MLCC-Construction.png|thumb|right|Construction of a '''M'''ulti-'''L'''ayer '''C'''eramic '''C'''apacitor (MLCC)]]
{{Main|Ceramic capacitor}}

A '''[[ceramic capacitor]]''' is a non-polarized fixed capacitor made out of two or more alternating layers of ceramic and metal in which the ceramic material acts as the dielectric and the metal acts as the electrodes. The ceramic material is a mixture of finely ground granules of [[paraelectric]] or [[ferroelectric]] materials, modified by mixed [[oxides]] that are necessary to achieve the capacitor's desired characteristics. The electrical behavior of the ceramic material is divided into two stability classes:

* [[Ceramic capacitor#Class 1|Class 1]] ceramic capacitors with high stability and low losses compensating the influence of temperature in resonant circuit application. Common [[Electronic Industries Alliance|EIA]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] code abbreviations are [[C0G]]/NP0, P2G/N150, R2G/N220, U2J/N750 etc.
* [[Ceramic capacitor#Class 2|Class 2]] ceramic capacitors with high [[volumetric efficiency]] for buffer, by-pass and coupling applications Common EIA/IEC code abbreviations are: X7R/2XI, Z5U/E26, Y5V/2F4, X7S/2C1, etc.

The great plasticity of ceramic raw material works well for many special applications and enables an enormous diversity of styles, shapes and great dimensional spread of ceramic capacitors. The smallest discrete capacitor, for instance, is a &quot;01005&quot; chip capacitor with the dimension of only 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm × 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm.

The construction of ceramic multilayer capacitors with mostly alternating layers results in single capacitors connected in parallel. This configuration increases capacitance and decreases all losses and parasitic [[inductance]]s. Ceramic capacitors are well-suited for high frequencies and high current pulse loads.

Because the thickness of the ceramic dielectric layer can be easily controlled and produced by the desired application voltage, ceramic capacitors are available with rated voltages up to the 30&amp;nbsp;kV range.

Some ceramic capacitors of special shapes and styles are used as capacitors for special applications, including [[Ceramic capacitor#RFI/EMI suppression ceramic capacitor|RFI/EMI suppression capacitors]] for connection to supply mains, also known as safety capacitors,&lt;ref&gt;General technical information of (RFI/EMI)Noise suppression capacitors on AC mains [http://www.capakor.com/product/pdf/(21)General_technical_information.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/rfi-class-xy/ Vishay, Capacitors - RFI Class X/Y]&lt;/ref&gt; X2Y® capacitors for bypassing and decoupling applications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.x2y.com/ X2Y® Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; feed-through capacitors for noise suppression by low-pass filters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murata.com/products/emc/knowhow/pdf/20to22.pdf Murata, Three-terminal Capacitor Structure, No.TE04EA-1.pdf 98.3.20]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ceramic capacitor#Ceramic power capacitors|ceramic power capacitors]] for transmitters and HF applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vishay.com/docs/22071/geninfo.pdf Vishay, Ceramic RF-Power Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vishay |url=http://www.vishay.com/capacitors/ceramic-rf-power/ |title=Capacitors - RF Power |publisher=Vishay |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film capacitors ===
{{Main|Film capacitor}}
[[File:Film-Cap-Pulse-Strength-Versions.svg|thumb|right|Three examples of different film capacitor configurations for increasing surge current ratings]]

[[Film capacitor]]s or plastic film capacitors are non-polarized capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric. The dielectric films are drawn to a thin layer, provided with metallic electrodes and wound into a cylindrical winding. The electrodes of film capacitors may be metallized aluminum or zinc, applied on one or both sides of the plastic film, resulting in metallized film capacitors or a separate metallic foil overlying the film, called film/foil capacitors.

Metallized film capacitors offer self-healing properties. Dielectric breakdowns or shorts between the electrodes do not destroy the component. The metallized construction makes it possible to produce wound capacitors with larger capacitance values (up to 100&amp;nbsp;µF and larger) in smaller cases than within film/foil construction.

Film/foil capacitors or metal foil capacitors use two plastic films as the dielectric. Each film is covered with a thin metal foil, mostly aluminium, to form the electrodes. The advantage of this construction is the ease of connecting the metal foil electrodes, along with an excellent current pulse strength.

A key advantage of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes on both ends of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal [[ohm]]ic losses ([[Equivalent series resistance|ESR]]) and parasitic inductance (ESL). The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents ([[snubber]]s) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.

The plastic films used as the dielectric for film capacitors are [[Polypropylene]] (PP), [[Polyester]] (PET), [[Polyphenylene sulfide]] (PPS), [[Polyethylene naphthalate]] (PEN), and [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] or [[Teflon]] (PTFE). Polypropylene film material with a market share of something about 50% and Polyester film with something about 40% are the most used film materials. The rest of something about 10% will be used by all other materials including PPS and paper with roughly 3%, each.&lt;ref&gt;Passive component magazine, Nov./Dec. 2005, F.

=== Film power capacitors ===
[[File:MKV-Power-Capacitor-Construction.svg|thumb|right| MKV power capacitor, double-sided metallized paper (field-free mechanical carrier of the electrodes), polypropylene film (dielectric), windings impregnated with insulating oil]]

A related type is the [[Film capacitor#Power film capacitors|power film capacitor]]. The materials and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors mostly are similar to those of ordinary film capacitors. However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary film capacitors is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.

As modern electronic equipment gained the capacity to handle power levels that were previously the exclusive domain of &quot;electrical power&quot; components, the distinction between the &quot;electronic&quot; and &quot;electrical&quot; power ratings blurred. Historically, the boundary between these two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200 volt-amps.

Film power capacitors mostly use polypropylene film as the dielectric. Other types include metallized paper capacitors (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric film capacitors with polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads. Windings can be filled with an insulating oil or with [[epoxy resin]] to reduce air bubbles, thereby preventing short circuits.

They find use as converters to change voltage, current or frequency, to store or deliver abruptly electric energy or to improve the power factor. The rated voltage range of these capacitors is from approximately120&amp;nbsp;V&amp;nbsp;AC (capacitive lighting ballasts) to 100&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20081114082811/http://www.epcos.com/web/generator/Web/Sections/ProductCatalog/Capacitors/PDF/PDF__GeneralTechnicalInformation,property=Data__en.pdf;/PDF_GeneralTechnicalInformation.pdf Epcos, Capacitors for power electronics, General technical information]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrolytic capacitors ===
{{main|Electrolytic capacitor}}

[[Electrolytic capacitor]]s have a metallic anode covered with an oxidized layer used as dielectric. The second electrode is a non-solid (wet) or solid electrolyte. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized. Three families are available, categorized according to their dielectric.

* Aluminum electrolytic capacitors with [[aluminum oxide]] as dielectric
* Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with [[tantalum pentoxide]] as dielectric
* Niobium electrolytic capacitors with [[niobium pentoxide]] as dielectric.

The anode is highly roughened to increase the surface area. This and the relatively high permittivity of the oxide layer gives these capacitors very high capacitance per unit volume compared with film- or ceramic capacitors.

The permittivity of tantalum pentoxide is approximately three times higher than aluminium dioxide, producing significantly smaller components. However, permittivity determines only the dimensions. Electrical parameters, especially [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]], are established by the electrolyte's material and composition. Three general types of electrolytes are used:

* non solid (wet, liquid)—conductivity approximately 10&amp;nbsp;mS/cm and are the lowest cost
* solid manganese oxide—conductivity approximately 100&amp;nbsp;mS/cm offer high quality and stability
* solid conductive polymer ([[Polypyrrole]])—conductivity approximately 10,000&amp;nbsp;mS/cm,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090521013917/http://www.edc.sanyo.com/pdf/e_poscap/E_poscap_basic.pdf Sanyo, Capacitor lecture POSCAP (Ta) (Basic), Polymerized electrolyte]&lt;/ref&gt; offer ESR values as low as &lt;10&amp;nbsp;mΩ

Internal losses of electrolytic capacitors, prevailing used for decoupling and buffering applications, are determined by the kind of electrolyte.

&lt;/center&gt;

The large capacitance per unit volume of electrolytic capacitors make them valuable in relatively high-current and low-frequency electrical [[electrical network|circuits]], e.g. in [[power supply]] filters for decoupling unwanted AC components from DC power connections or as coupling capacitors in audio amplifiers, for passing or bypassing low-frequency signals and storing large amounts of energy. The relatively high capacitance value of an electrolytic capacitor combined with the very low ESR of the polymer electrolyte of [[polymer capacitor]]s, especially in SMD styles, makes them a competitor to MLC chip capacitors in personal computer power supplies.

Bipolar electrolytics (also called Non-Polarized capacitors) contain two anodized aluminium foils, behaving like two capacitors connected in series opposition.

Electolytic capacitors for special applications include motor start capacitors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.com/catalogs/PSU.pdf CDE, Motor Start Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt; flashlight capacitors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rubycon.co.jp/en/catalog/e_pdfs/aluminum/e_CDF.pdf Rubycon, Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors for Strobe Flash]&lt;/ref&gt; and audio frequency capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftcap.de/index.php/audio-frequency-archiv.html Fischer &amp; Tausche, Electrolytic capacitor for audio frequency]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supercapacitor, sometimes called '''ultracapacitor''' is a generic term for [[electric double-layer capacitor]]s (EDLC), [[pseudocapacitor]]s and hybrid capacitors. They don't have a conventional solid [[dielectric]]. The capacitance value of an electrochemical capacitor is determined by two storage principles, both of which contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor:&lt;ref name=&quot;Halper&quot;&gt;{{cite techreport|author= Marin S.

* [[Double layer (interfacial)|Double-layer capacitance]] – Storage is achieved by separation of charge in a [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]] [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] at the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] between the surface of a conductor and an electrolytic solution. The distance of separation of charge in a double-layer is on the order of a few [[Angstrom]]s (0.3–0.8&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]]). This storage is [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namisnyk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= Adam Marcus Namisnyk |title= A Survey of Electrochemical Supercapacitor Technology |url= http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/cempe/subjects_JGZ/eet/Capstone%20thesis_AN.pdf |date=23 June 2003 |accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pseudocapacitor|Pseudocapacitance]] – Storage is achieved by [[Redox|redox reactions]], electrosorbtion or [[Intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] on the surface of the electrode or by specifically adsorpted [[ion]]s that results in a reversible [[Faradaic current|faradaic]] [[Charge-transfer complex|charge-transfer]]. The pseudocapacitance is faradaic in origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Namisnyk&quot; /&gt;

The ratio of the storage resulting from each principle can vary greatly, depending on electrode design and electrolyte composition. Pseudocapacitance can increase the capacitance value by as much as an order of magnitude over that of the double-layer by itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;conway1&quot; /&gt;

Supercapacitors are divided into three families, based on the design of the electrodes:

*  '''Double-layer capacitors''' – with [[carbon]] electrodes or derivates with much higher static double-layer capacitance than the faradaic pseudocapacitance
* '''Pseudocapacitors''' – with electrodes out of metal oxides or conducting polymers  with a high amount of faradaic pseudocapacitance 
* '''Hybrid capacitors''' – capacitors with special and asymmetric electrodes that exhibit both significant double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, such as [[lithium-ion capacitor]]s

Supercapacitors bridge the gap between conventional capacitors and [[Rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. They have the highest available capacitance values per unit volume and the greatest [[energy density]] of all capacitors. They support up to 12,000 [[Farad]]s/1.2 Volt,&lt;ref name=Elton&gt;[http://www.elton-cap.com/products/capacitor-cells/ Elton]&lt;/ref&gt; with capacitance values up to 10,000 times that of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;conway1&quot; /&gt; While existing supercapacitors have energy densities that are approximately 10% of a conventional battery, their [[power density]] is generally 10 to 100 times greater. Power density is defined as the product of energy density, multiplied by the speed at which the energy is delivered to the [[Electric load|load]]. The greater power density results in much shorter charge/discharge cycles than a battery is capable, and a greater tolerance for numerous charge/discharge cycles. This makes them well-suited for parallel connection with batteries, and may improve battery performance in terms of power density. 

Within electrochemical capacitors, the electrolyte is the conductive connection between the two electrodes, distinguishing them from electrolytic capacitors, in which the electrolyte only forms the cathode, the second electrode.

Supercapacitors are polarized and must operate with correct polarity. Polarity is controlled by design with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied during the manufacturing process.

Supercapacitors support a broad spectrum of applications for power and energy requirements, including:
* Low supply current during longer times for memory backup in ([[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]s) in electronic equipment
* Power electronics that require very short, high current, as in the [[Kinetic energy recovery system|KERS]]system in [[Formula 1]] cars
* Recovery of braking energy for vehicles such as buses and trains

Supercapacitors are rarely interchangeable, especially those with higher energy densities. IEC standard 62391-1 ''Fixed electric double layer capacitors for use in electronic equipment'' identifies four application classes:

* Class 1, Memory backup, discharge current in mA = 1 • C (F)
* Class 2, Energy storage, discharge current in mA = 0.4 • C (F) • V (V)
* Class 3, Power, discharge current in mA = 4 • C (F) • V (V)
* Class 4, Instantaneous power, discharge current in mA = 40 • C (F) • V (V)
Exceptional for electronic components like capacitors are the manifold different trade or series names used for supercapacitors like: ''APowerCap, BestCap, BoostCap, CAP-XX, DLCAP, EneCapTen, EVerCAP, DynaCap, Faradcap, GreenCap, Goldcap, HY-CAP, Kapton capacitor, Super capacitor, SuperCap, PAS Capacitor, PowerStor, PseudoCap, Ultracapacitor'' making it difficult for users to classify these capacitors.

=== Miscellaneous capacitors ===
Beneath the above described capacitors covering more or less nearly the total market of discrete capacitors some new developments or very special capacitor types as well as older types can be found in electronics.

==== Integrated capacitors ====
* Integrated capacitors—in [[integrated circuits]], nano-scale capacitors can be formed by appropriate patterns of metallization on an isolating substrate. They may be packaged in multiple capacitor arrays with no other semiconductive parts as discrete components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipdia.com/index.php?page=our_products&amp;cat_id=2 IPDiA, 3D Silicon Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Glass capacitors—First [[Leyden jar]] capacitor was made of glass, {{as of|2012}} glass capacitors were in use as SMD version for applications requiring ultra-reliable and ultra-stable service.

==== Power capacitors ====
* [[Vacuum capacitor]]s—used in high power [[radio frequency|RF]] transmitters
* [[Sulfur hexafluoride|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas filled capacitors—used as capacitance standard in measuring bridge circuits

==== Special capacitors ====
* [[Printed circuit board]]s—metal conductive areas in different layers of a multi-layer printed circuit board can act as a highly stable capacitor. It is common industry practice to fill unused areas of one PCB layer with the ground conductor and another layer with the power conductor, forming a large distributed capacitor between the layers.
* Wire—2 pieces of insulated wire twisted together. Capacitance alues usually range from 3 pF to 15 pF. Used in homemade [[VHF]] circuits for oscillation feedback.

==== Obsolete capacitors ====
* [[Silver mica capacitor|Mica capacitor]]s—the first capacitors with stable frequency behavior and low losses, used for military radio applications during [[World War II]]
* [[Air]]-gap capacitors—used by the first [[spark-gap transmitter]]s

Variable capacitors may have their capacitance changed by mechanical motion. Generally two versions of variable capacitors has to be to distinguished

* Tuning capacitor – variable capacitor for intentionally and repeatedly tuning an oscillator circuit in a radio or another tuned circuit
* Trimmer capacitor – small variable capacitor usually for one-time oscillator circuit internal adjustment

Variable capacitors include capacitors that use a mechanical construction to change the distance between the plates, or the amount of plate surface area which overlaps. They mostly use air as dielectric medium.

Semiconductive [[Varicap|variable capacitance diodes]] are not capacitors in the sense of passive components but can change their capacitance as a function of the applied reverse bias voltage and are used like a variable capacitor. They have replaced much of the tuning and trimmer capacitors.

===Market===


Discrete capacitors today are industrial products produced in very large quantities for use in electronic and in electrical equipment. Globally, the market for fixed capacitors was estimated at approximately US$18 billion in 2008 for 1,400 billion (1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/equipment/electronic-capacitors highbeam business, Electronic Capacitors SIC 3675, Industry report]&lt;/ref&gt; This market is dominated by ceramic capacitors with estimate of approximately one trillion (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) items per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boggs&quot;/&gt;

Detailed estimated figures in value for the main capacitor families are:

* [[Ceramic capacitor]]s—US$8.3 billion (46%);
*  [[Electrolytic capacitor|Aluminum electrolytic capacitors]]—US$ 3.9 billion (22%);
* [[Film capacitor]]s and Paper capacitors—US$ 2.6 billion, (15%);
* [[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]]—US$ 2.2 billion (12%);
* [[Super capacitor]]s ([[Double-layer capacitor]]s)—US$ 0.3 billion (2%); and
* Others like [[silver mica capacitor|silver mica]] and [[Vacuum variable capacitor|vacuum capacitors]]—US$ 0.7 billion (3%).

All other capacitor types are negligible in terms of value and quantity compared with the above types.


==Capacitor - Electrical characteristics ==
=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Capacitor-Series-Equivalent-Circuit-.png|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of a capacitor]]

Discrete capacitors deviate from the ideal capacitor. An ideal capacitor only stores and releases electrical energy, with no dissipation. Capacitor components have losses and parasitic inductive parts. These imperfections in material and construction can have positive implications such as linear frequency and temperature behavior in class 1 ceramic capacitors. Conversely, negative implications include the non-linear, voltage-dependent capacitance in class 2 ceramic capacitors or the insufficient dielectric insulation of capacitors leading to leakage currents.

All properties can be defined and specified by a series equivalent circuit composed out of an idealized capacitance and additional electrical components which model all losses and inductive parameters of a capacitor. In this series-equivalent circuit the electrical characteristics are defined by:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;insul&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation resistance]] of the dielectric, not to be confused with the insulation of the housing
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as &quot;ESR&quot;
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as &quot;ESL&quot;.

Using a series equivalent circuit instead of a parallel equivalent circuit is specified by [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/EN 60384-1.

=== Standard values and tolerances ===
The &quot;rated capacitance&quot; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or &quot;nominal capacitance&quot; C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is the value for which the capacitor has been designed. Actual capacitance depends on the measured frequency and ambient temperature. Standard measuring conditions are a low-voltage AC measuring method at a temperature of 20 °C with frequencies of

* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (preferred) or 10&amp;nbsp;MHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 nF:
* 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with 1 nF &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 10 μF
* 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for electrolytic capacitors
* 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 10 μF

For supercapacitors a voltage drop method is applied for measuring the capacitance value. .

Capacitors are available in geometrically increasing [[Preferred number|preferred values]] ([[E48 series|E series]] standards) specified in IEC/EN 60063. According to the number of values per decade, these were called the E3, E6, E12, E24 etc. series. The range of units used to specify capacitor values has expanded to include everything from pico- (pF), nano- (nF) and microfarad (µF) to farad (F). Millifarad and kilofarad are uncommon.

The percentage of allowed deviation from the rated value is called [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. The actual capacitance value should be within its tolerance limits, or it is out of specification. IEC/EN 60062 specifies a letter code for each tolerance.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

The required tolerance is determined by the particular application. The narrow tolerances of E24 to E96 are used for high-quality circuits such as precision oscillators and timers. General applications such as non-critical filtering or coupling circuits employ E12 or E6. Electrolytic capacitors, which are often used for [[Electronic filter|filtering]] and [[Decoupling capacitor|bypassing]] capacitors mostly have a tolerance range of ±20% and need to conform to E6 (or E3) series values.

=== Temperature dependence ===
Capacitance typically varies with temperature. The different dielectrics express great differences in temperature sensitivity. The temperature coefficient is expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm) per degree Celsius for class 1 ceramic capacitors or in % over the total temperature range for all others.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Frequency dependence ===
Most discrete capacitor types have more or less capacitance changes with increasing frequencies. The dielectric strength of class 2 ceramic and plastic film diminishes with rising frequency. Therefore their capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. This phenomenon for ceramic class 2 and plastic film dielectrics is related to [[dielectric relaxation]] in which the time constant of the electrical dipoles is the reason for the frequency dependence of [[permittivity]]. The graphs below show typical frequency behavior of the capacitance for ceramic and film capacitors.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Frequency dependence of capacitance for ceramic and film capacitors &quot; class=&quot;float-right&quot; style=&quot;margin:3em&quot;&gt;
File:MLCC-Kap-versus-Frequenz-engl.svg | Frequency dependence of capacitance for ceramic class 2 capacitors (NP0 class 1 for comparisation)
File:Folko-Kurve-C-f-Frequenz-4.png| Frequency dependence of capacitance for film capacitors with different film materials
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, mechanical motion of the [[ion]]s occurs. Their movability is limited so that at higher frequencies not all areas of the roughened anode structure are covered with charge-carrying ions. As higher the anode structure is roughned as more the capacitance value decreases with increasing frequency. Low voltage types with highly-roughened anodes display capacitance at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz approximately 10 to 20% of the value measured at 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.

=== Voltage dependence ===
Capacitance may also change with applied voltage. This effect is more prevalent in class 2 ceramic capacitors. The permittivity of ferroelectric class 2 material depends on the applied voltage. Higher applied voltage lowers permittivity. The change of capacitance can drop to 80% of the value measured with the standardized measuring voltage of 0.5 or 1.0&amp;nbsp;V. This behavior is a small source of non-linearity in low-distortion filters and other analog applications. In audio applications this can be the reason for [[Total harmonic distortion|harmonic distortion]].

Film capacitors and electrolytic capacitors have no significant voltage dependence.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

=== Rated and category voltage ===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated and category temperature range and applied voltage]]

The voltage at which the dielectric becomes conductive is called the breakdown voltage, and is given by the product of the dielectric strength and the separation between the electrodes. The dielectric strength depends on temperature, frequency, shape of the electrodes, etc. Because a breakdown in a capacitor normally is a short circuit and destroys the component, the  operating voltage is lower than the breakdown voltage. The operating voltage is specified such that the voltage may be applied continuously throughout the life of the capacitor.

In IEC/EN 60384-1 the allowed operating voltage is called &quot;rated voltage&quot; or &quot;nominal voltage&quot;. The rated voltage (UR) is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range.

The voltage proof of nearly all capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specify a second &quot;temperature derated voltage&quot; for a higher temperature range, the &quot;category voltage&quot;. The category voltage (UC) is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range.

The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture right.

=== Impedance ===
[[File:Kondensator Zeigerdiagramm-1-.svg|thumb|right|150px|Simplified series-equivalent circuit of a capacitor for higher frequencies (above); vector diagram with electrical reactances X&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and resistance ESR and for illustration the impedance Z and dissipation factor tan δ]]

In general, a capacitor is seen as a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[resistor]]. In many cases the capacitor is used as a [[decoupling capacitor]] to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for [[capacitive coupling]] of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] is as important as the capacitance value.

The frequency dependent AC resistance is called [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; and is the [[Complex number|complex]] ratio of the voltage to the current in an AC circuit. Impedance extends the concept of resistance to AC circuits and possesses both magnitude and [[Phasor|phase]] at a particular frequency. This is unlike resistance, which has only magnitude.

: &lt;math&gt;\ Z = |Z| e^{j\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitude &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle |Z|&lt;/math&gt; represents the ratio of the voltage difference amplitude to the current amplitude, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary unit]], while the argument &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta&lt;/math&gt; gives the phase difference between voltage and current.

In capacitor data sheets, only the impedance magnitude |Z| is specified, and simply written as &quot;Z&quot; so that the formula for the impedance can be written in [[Cartesian plane|Cartesian form]]

: &lt;math&gt;\ Z = R + jX&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[real part]] of impedance is the resistance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R&lt;/math&gt; (for capacitors &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle ESR&lt;/math&gt;) and the [[imaginary part]] is the [[Reactance (electronics)|reactance]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X&lt;/math&gt;.

As shown in a capacitor's series-equivalent circuit, the real component includes an ideal capacitor &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, an inductance &lt;math&gt;L (ESL)&lt;/math&gt; and a resistor &lt;math&gt;R (ESR)&lt;/math&gt;. The total reactance at the angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; therefore is given by the geometric (complex) addition of a capacitive reactance ([[Capacitance]]) &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; and an inductive reactance ([[Inductance]]): &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;.

To calculate the impedance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z&lt;/math&gt; the resistance has to be added geometrically and then &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z=\sqrt{{ESR}^2 + (X_\mathrm{C} + (-X_\mathrm{L}))^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The impedance is a measure of the capacitor's ability to pass alternating currents. In this sense the impedance can be used like Ohms law
: &lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{\hat u}{\hat \imath} = \frac{U_\mathrm{eff}}{I_\mathrm{eff}}.&lt;/math&gt;

to calculate either the peak or the effective value of the current or the voltage.

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances

: &lt;math&gt; X_C= -\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X_L=\omega L_{\mathrm{ESL}}&lt;/math&gt;

have the same value (&lt;math&gt;X_C=X_L&lt;/math&gt;), then the impedance will only be determined by &lt;math&gt;{ESR}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Kondensator-Impedanzverläufe-Wiki-1.jpg|thumb|right|Typical impedance curves for different capacitance values over frequency showing the typical form with a decreasing impedance values below resonance and increasing values above resonance. As higher the capacitance as lower the resonance.]]
The impedance specified in the datasheets often show typical curves for the different capacitance values. With increasing frequency as the impedance decreases down to a minimum. The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can be passed through the capacitor. At the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], the point of resonance, where XC has the same value than XL, the capacitor has the lowest impedance value. Here only the ESR determines the impedance. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ESL of the capacitor. The capacitor becomes to an inductance.

As shown in the graph, the higher capacitance values can fit the lower frequencies better while the lower capacitance values can fit better the higher frequencies.

Aluminum electrolytic capacitors have relatively good decoupling properties in the lower frequency range up to about 1&amp;nbsp;MHz due to their large capacitance values. This is the reason for using electrolytic capacitors in standard or [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]] behind the [[rectifier]] for smoothing application.

Ceramic and film capacitors are already out of their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100&amp;nbsp;MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often an electrolytic capacitor is connected in parallel with a ceramic or film capacitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murata.com/products/emicon_fun/2011/04/cap_en14.html Murata: Basics of capacitors, lesson 2] Includes graph showing impedance as a function of frequency for different capacitor types; electrolytics are the only ones with a large component due to ESR&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new developments are targeted at reducing parasitic inductance (ESL). This increases the resonance frequency of the capacitor and, for example, can follow the constantly increasing switching speed of digital circuits. Miniaturization, especially in the SMD multilayer ceramic chip capacitors ([[Multi-Layer Ceramic Capacitor|MLCC]]), increases the resonance frequency. Parasitic inductance is further lowered by placing the electrodes on the longitudinal side of the chip instead of the lateral side. The &quot;face-down&quot; construction associated with multi-anode technology in tantalum electrolytic capacitors further reduced ESL. Capacitor families such as the so-called MOS capacitor or silicon capacitors offer solutions when capacitors at frequencies up to the GHz range are needed.

=== Inductance (ESL) and self-resonant frequency ===
ESL in industrial capacitors is mainly caused by the leads and internal connections used to connect the capacitor plates to the outside world. Large capacitors tend to have higher ESL than small ones because the distances to the plate are longer and every mm counts as an inductance.

For any discrete capacitor, there is a frequency above DC at which it ceases to behave as a pure capacitor. This frequency, where &lt;math&gt;X_C&lt;/math&gt; is as high as &lt;math&gt;X_L&lt;/math&gt;, is called the self-resonant frequency. The self-resonant frequency is the lowest frequency at which the impedance passes through a minimum. For any AC application the self-resonant frequency is the highest frequency at which capacitors can be used as a capacitive component.

This is critically important for [[decoupling]] high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The decoupling capacitor supplies [[Transient (oscillation)|transient]] current to the chip. Without decouplers, the IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of the circuit rapidly switch on and off. To counter this potential problem, circuits frequently use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors rated for high frequencies, a large electrolytic capacitor rated for lower frequencies and occasionally, an intermediate value capacitor.

=== Ohmic losses, ESR, dissipation factor, and quality factor ===
The summarized losses in discrete capacitors are ohmic [[Alternating current|AC]] losses. [[Direct current|DC]] losses are specified as &quot;[[leakage current]]&quot; or &quot;insulating resistance&quot; and are negligible for an AC specification. AC losses are non-linear, possibly depending on frequency, temperature, age or humidity. The losses result from two physical conditions:

* line losses including internal supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, line resistance of the electrodes, and in &quot;wet&quot; aluminum electrolytic capacitors and especially supercapacitors, the limited conductivity of liquid electrolytes and
* [[Loss tangent|dielectric losses]] from [[Dipolar polarization|dielectric polarization]].

The largest share of these losses in larger capacitors is usually the frequency dependent ohmic dielectric losses. For smaller components, especially for wet electrolytic capacitors, conductivity of liquid electrolytes may exceed dielectric losses. To measure these losses, the measurement frequency must be set. Since commercially available components offer capacitance values cover 15 orders of magnitude, ranging from pF (10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;F) to some 1000&amp;nbsp;F in supercapacitors, it is not possible to capture the entire range with only one frequency. IEC 60384-1 states that ohmic losses should be measured at the same frequency used to measure capacitance. These are:

* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz, 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (preferred) or 10&amp;nbsp;MHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 nF:
* 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz for non-electrolytic capacitors with 1 nF &lt; C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 10 μF
* 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for electrolytic capacitors
* 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz or 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz for non-electrolytic capacitors with C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 10 μF

A capacitor's summarized resistive losses may be specified either as ESR, as a [[dissipation factor]](DF, tan δ), or as [[quality factor]] (Q), depending on application requirements.

Capacitors with higher ripple current &lt;math&gt;I_R&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;loads, such as electrolytic capacitors, are specified with [[equivalent series resistance]] ESR. ESR can be shown as an ohmic part in the above vector diagram. ESR values are specified in datasheets per individual type.

The losses of film capacitors and some class 2 ceramic capacitors are mostly specified with the dissipation factor tan δ. These capacitors have smaller losses than electrolytic capacitors and mostly are used at higher frequencies up to some hundred MHz. However the numeric value of the dissipation factor, measured at the same frequency, is independent on the capacitance value and can be specified for a capacitor series with a range of capacitance. The dissipation factor is determined as the tangent of the reactance (&lt;math&gt;X_C - X_L&lt;/math&gt;)&amp;nbsp;and the ESR, and can be shown as the angle δ between imaginary and the impedance axis.

If the inductance &lt;math&gt; ESL &lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;is small, the dissipation factor can be approximated as:

: &lt;math&gt;\tan \delta = ESR \cdot \omega C&lt;/math&gt;

Capacitors with very low losses, such as ceramic Class 1 and Class 2 capacitors, specify resistive losses with a [[Q factor#Electrical systems|quality factor]] (Q). Ceramic Class 1 capacitors are especially suitable for LC resonant circuits with frequencies up to the GHz range, and precise high and low pass filters. For an electrically resonant system, Q represents the effect of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] and characterizes a resonator's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; relative to its center or resonant frequency &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt;. Q is defined as the reciprocal value of the dissipation factor.

: &lt;math&gt; Q = \frac{1}{tan \delta} = \frac{f_0}{B} \ &lt;/math&gt;

A high Q value is for resonant circuits a mark of the quality of the resonance.

=== Limiting current loads ===
A capacitor can act as an AC resistor, coupling AC voltage and AC current between two points. Every AC current flow through a capacitor generates heat inside the capacitor body. These dissipation power loss &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is caused by &lt;math&gt;ESR&lt;/math&gt; and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) current &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;P = I^2 \cdot ESR&lt;/math&gt;

The same power loss can be written with the dissipation factor &lt;math&gt;tan \delta&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt; P = \frac{U^2 \cdot tan \delta}{2\pi f \cdot C}&lt;/math&gt;

The internal generated heat has to be distributed to the ambient. The temperature of the capacitor, which is established on the balance between heat produced and distributed, shall not exceed the capacitors maximum specified temperature. Hence, the ESR or dissipation factor is a mark for the maximum power (AC load, ripple current, pulse load, etc.) a capacitor is specified for.

AC currents may be a:

* ripple current—an effective (RMS) AC current, coming from an AC voltage superimposed of an DC bias, a
* pulse current—an AC peak current, coming from an voltage peak, or an
* AC current—an effective (RMS) sinusoidal current

Ripple and AC currents mainly warms the capacitor body. By this currents internal generated temperature influences the breakdown voltage of the dielectric. Higher temperature lower the voltage proof of all capacitors. In wet electrolytic capacitors higher temperatures force the evaporation of electrolytes, shortening the life time of the capacitors. In film capacitors higher temperatures may shrink the plastic film changing the capacitor's properties.

Pulse currents, especially in metallized film capacitors, heat the contact areas between end spray (schoopage) and metallized electrodes. This may reduce the contact to the electrodes, heightening the dissipation factor.

For safe operation, the maximal temperature generated by any AC current flow through the capacitor is a limiting factor, which in turn limits AC load, ripple current, pulse load, etc.

==== Ripple current ====
A &quot;ripple current&quot; is the [[Root mean square|RMS]] value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation at a specified temperature. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor. The &quot;rated ripple current&quot; shall not exceed a temperature rise of 3, 5 or 10&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the capacitor type, at the specified maximum ambient temperature.

Ripple current generates heat within the capacitor body due to the ESR of the capacitor. The ESR, composed out of the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength in the dielectric and the losses resulting out of the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte depends on frequency and temperature. Higher frequencies heighten the ESR and higher temperatures lower the ESR slightly.

The types of capacitors used for power applications have a specified rated value for maximum ripple current. These are primarily aluminum electrolytic capacitors, and tantalum as well as some film capacitors and Class 2 ceramic capacitors.

Aluminium electrolytic capacitors, the most common type for power supplies, experience shorter life expectancy at higher ripple currents. Exceeding the limit tends to result in explosive failure.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid manganese dioxide electrolyte are also limited by ripple current. Exceeding their ripple limits tends to shorts and burning components.

For film and ceramic capacitors, normally specified with a loss factor tan δ, the ripple current limit is determined by temperature rise in the body of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Exceeding this limit may destroy the internal structure and cause shorts.

==== Pulse current ====
The rated pulse load for a certain capacitor is limited by the rated voltage, the pulse repetition frequency, temperature range and pulse rise time. The  &quot;pulse rise time&quot; &lt;math&gt;dv/dt&lt;/math&gt;, represents the steepest voltage gradient of the pulse (rise or fall time) and is expressed in volts per μs (V/μs).

The rated pulse rise time is also indirectly the maximum capacity of an applicable peak current &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt;. The peak current is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;I_p = C \cdot dv/dt &lt;/math&gt;

where: &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt; is in A; &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; in µF; &lt;math&gt;dv/dt&lt;/math&gt; in V/µs

The permissible pulse current capacity of a metallized film capacitor generally allows an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10 °K.

In the case of metallized film capacitors, pulse load depends on the properties of the dielectric material, the thickness of the metallization and the capacitor's construction, especially the construction of the contact areas between the end spray and metallized electrodes. High peak currents may lead to selective overheating of local contacts between end spray and metallized electrodes which may destroy some of the contacts, leading to increasing ESR.

For metallized film capacitors, so-called pulse tests simulate the pulse load that might occur during an application, according to a standard specification. IEC 60384 part 1, specifies that the test circuit is charged and discharged intermittently. The test voltage corresponds to the rated DC voltage and the test comprises 10000 pulses with a repetition frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. The pulse stress capacity is the pulse rise time. The rated pulse rise time is specified as 1/10 of the test pulse rise time.

The pulse load must be calculated for each application. A general rule for calculating the power handling of film capacitors is not available because of vendor-related internal construction details. To prevent the capacitor from overheating the following operating parameters have to be considered:

* peak current per µF
* Pulse rise or fall time dv/dt in V/µs
* relative duration of charge and discharge periods (pulse shape)
* maximum pulse voltage (peak voltage)
* peak reverse voltage;
* Repetition frequency of the pulse
* Ambient temperature
* Heat dissipation (cooling)

Higher pulse rise times are permitted for pulse voltage lower than the rated voltage.

Examples for calculations of individual pulse loads are given by many manufactures, e.g. WIMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wima.de/EN/pulseselection.htm WIMA, Selection of Capacitors for Pulse Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; and Kemet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kechome.nsf/weben/CF9A77B25D8A4E0F852576AE007F3F0B/$file/F9000_GenInfo_DCFilm.pdf Kemet, General information DC Film Capacitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== AC current ====
[[File:Capacitors-AC limiting conditions.png|thumb|right|Limiting conditions for capacitors operating with AC loads]]

An AC load only can be applied to a non-polarized capacitor. Capacitors for AC applications are primarily film capacitors, metallized paper capacitors, ceramic capacitors and bipolar electrolytic capacitors.

The rated AC load for an AC capacitor is the maximum sinusoidal effective AC current (rms) which may be applied continuously to a capacitor within the specified temperature range. In the datasheets the AC load may be expressed as

* rated AC voltage at low frequencies,
* rated reactive power at intermediate frequencies,
* reduced AC voltage or rated AC current at high frequencies.

[[File:Folko-U-eff-f-Frequenz.png|thumb|right| Typical rms AC voltage curves as a function of frequency, for 4 different capacitance values of a 63 V DC film capacitor series]]
The rated AC voltage for film capacitors is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10&amp;nbsp;°K is the allowed limit for safe operation. Because dielectric losses increase with increasing frequency, the specified AC voltage has to be derated at higher frequencies. Datasheets for film capacitors specify special curves for derating AC voltages at higher frequencies.

If film capacitors or ceramic capacitors only have a DC specification, the peak value of the AC voltage applied has to be lower than the specified DC voltage.

AC loads can occur in AC Motor run capacitors, for voltage doubling, in [[snubber]]s, lighting ballast and for [[power factor correction]] PFC for phase shifting to improve transmission network stability and efficiency, which is one of the most important applications for large power capacitors. These mostly large PP film or metallized paper capacitors are limited by the rated reactive power VAr.

Bipolar electrolytic capacitors, to which an AC voltage may be applicable, are specified with a rated ripple current.

=== Insulation resistance and self-discharge constant ===
The resistance of the dielectric is finite, leading to some level of [[Direct current|DC &quot;leakage current&quot;]] that causes a charged capacitor to lose charge over time. For ceramic and film capacitors, this resistance is called &quot;insulation resistance R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;. This resistance is represented by the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;ins&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of capacitors.
Insulation resistance must not be confused with the outer isolation of the component with respect to the environment.

The time curve of self-discharge over insulation resistance with decreasing capacitor voltage follows the formula

: &lt;math&gt;u(t) = U_0 \cdot \mathrm{e}^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{s}},&lt;/math&gt;

With stored DC voltage &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;and self-discharge constant

: &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{s} = R_\mathrm{ins} \cdot C&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, after &lt;math&gt;\tau_\mathrm{s}\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;voltage &lt;math&gt;U_0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;drops to 37% of the initial value.

The self-discharge constant is an important parameter for the insulation of the dielectric between the electrodes of ceramic and film capacitors. For example, a capacitor can be used as the time-determining component for time relays or for storing a voltage value as in a [[sample and hold]] circuits or [[operational amplifier]]s.

Class&amp;nbsp;1 ceramic capacitors have an insulation resistance of at least 10&amp;nbsp;GΩ, while class&amp;nbsp;2 capacitors have at least 4&amp;nbsp;GΩ or a self-discharge constant of at least 100&amp;nbsp;s. Plastic film capacitors typically have an insulation resistance of 6 to 12&amp;nbsp;GΩ. This corresponds to capacitors in the uF range of a self-discarge constant of about 2000–4000&amp;nbsp;s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wima.de/EN/insulation.htm Wima,Insulation Resistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

Insulation resistance respectively the self-discharge constant can be reduced if humidity penetrates into the winding. It is partially strongly temperature dependent and decreases with increasing temperature. Both decrease with increasing temperature.

In electrolytic capacitors, the insulation resistance is defined as leakage current.

=== Leakage current ===
[[File:Leakage current curves.png|thumb|right|The general leakage current behavior of electrolytic capacitors depend on the kind of electrolyte]]

For electrolytic capacitors the insulation resistance of the dielectric is termed &quot;leakage current&quot;. This [[Direct current|DC current]] is represented by the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt; in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of electrolytic capacitors. This resistance between the terminals of a capacitor is also finite. R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt; is lower for electrolytics than for ceramic or film capacitors.

The leakage current includes all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage. It is also the DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage. It depends on the interval without voltage applied (storage time), the thermic stress from soldering, on voltage applied, on temperature of the capacitor, and on measuring time.

The leakage current drops in the first minutes after applying DC voltage. In this period the dielectric oxide layer can self-repair weaknesses by building up new layers. The time required depends generally on the electrolyte. Solid electrolytes drop faster than non-solid electrolytes but remain at a slightly higher level.

The leakage current in non-solid electrolytic capacitors as well as in manganese oxide solid tantalum capacitors decreases with voltage-connected time due to self-healing effects. Although electrolytics leakage current is higher than current flow over insulation resistance in ceramic or film capacitors, the self-discharge of modern non solid electrolytic capacitors takes several weeks.

A particular problem with electrolytic capacitors is storage time. Higher leakage current can be the result of longer storage times. These behaviors are limited to electrolytes with a high percentage of water. Organic solvents such as [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]] do not have high leakage with longer storage times.

Leakage current is normally measured 2 or 5 minutes after applying rated voltage.

=== Microphonics ===
All ferroelectric materials exhibit [[piezoelectricity]] a piezoelectric effect. Because Class 2 ceramic capacitors use ferroelectric ceramics  dielectric, these types of capacitors may have electrical effects called [[microphonics]]. Microphonics (microphony) describes how electronic components transform mechanical [[vibration]]s into an undesired electrical signal ([[Noise (electronics)|noise]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/118EBDDDFA5D532C852572BF0046B776/$file/2007%20CARTS%20-%20Reduced%20Microphonics%20and%20Sound%20Emissions.pdf], Capacitors for reduced sound emissions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dielectric  may absorb mechanical forces from shock or vibration by changing thickness and changing the electrode separation, affecting the capacitance, which in turn induces an AC current. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording.

In the reverse microphonic effect, varying the electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, turning them into an audio speaker. High current impulse loads or high ripple currents can generate audible sound from the capacitor itself, draining energy and stressing the dielectric.&lt;ref&gt;Kemet, Are your military ceramic capacitors subject to the piezoelectric effect?
[http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/242F5F2E69DCEC7485256EDF004CA495]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dielectric absorption (soakage) ===
{{main|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], &quot;soakage&quot; or &quot;battery action&quot;.

In many applications of capacitors dielectric absorption is not a problem but in some applications, such as long-[[time constant|time-constant]] [[integrator]]s, [[sample-and-hold]] circuits, switched-capacitor [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, and very low-distortion [[Electronic filter|filter]]s, it is important that the capacitor does not recover a residual charge after full discharge, and capacitors with low absorption are specified.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Understand Capacitor Soakage to Optimize Analog Systems&quot; by Bob Pease 1982 [http://www.national.com/rap/Application/0,1570,28,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The voltage at the terminals generated by the dielectric absorption may in some cases possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit or can be a safety risk to personnel. In order to prevent shocks most very large capacitors are shipped with shorting wires that need to be removed before they are used.&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.designers-guide.org/Modeling/da.pdf &quot;Modeling Dielectric Absorption in Capacitors&quot;, by Ken Kundert]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy density ===
The capacitance value depends on the dielectric material (ε), the surface of the electrodes (A) and the distance (d) separating the electrodes and is given by the formula of a plate capacitor:

: &lt;math&gt;C \approx \frac{\varepsilon A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

The separation of the electrodes and the voltage proof of the dielectric material defines the breakdown voltage of the capacitor. The breakdown voltage is proportional to the thickness of the dielectric.

Theoretically, given two capacitors with the same mechanical dimensions and dielectric, but one of them have half the thickness of the dielectric. With the same dimensions this one could place twice the parallel-plate area inside. This capacitor has theoretically 4 times the capacitance as the first capacitor but half of the voltage proof.

Since the energy density stored in a capacitor is given by:

: &lt;math&gt; E_\mathrm{stored} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2,&lt;/math&gt;

thus a capacitor having a dielectric half as thick as another has 4 times higher capacitance but ½ voltage proof, yielding an equal maximum energy density.

Therefore, dielectric thickness does not affect energy density within a capacitor of fixed overall dimensions. Using a few thick layers of dielectric can support a high voltage, but low capacitance, while thin layers of dielectric produce a low breakdown voltage, but a higher capacitance.

This assumes that neither the electrode surfaces nor the permittivity of the dielectric change with the voltage proof. A simple comparison with two existing capacitor series can show whether reality matches theory. The comparison is easy, because the manufacturers use standardized case sizes or boxes for different capacitance/voltage values within a series.

In reality modern capacitor series do not fit the theory. For electrolytic capacitors the sponge-like rough surface of the anode foil gets smoother with higher voltages, decreasing the surface area of the anode. But because the energy increases squared with the voltage, and the surface of the anode decreases lesser than the voltage proof, the energy density increases clearly. For film capacitors the permittivity changes with dielectric thickness and other mechanical parameters so that the deviation from the theory has other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Metallized Polypropylene Film Energy Storage Capacitors For Low Pulse Duty, Ralph M. Kerrigan, NWL Capacitor Division [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTSUSA07/2_4097.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

For this, the capacitor 25&amp;nbsp; F/2.3&amp;nbsp;V in dimensions D × H = 16&amp;nbsp;mm × 26&amp;nbsp;mm from Maxwell HC Series, compared with the electrolytic capacitor of approximately equal size in the table. This supercapacitor has roughly 5000 times higher capacitance than the 4700/10 electrolytic capacitor but ¼ of the voltage and has about 66,000&amp;nbsp;mWs (0.018&amp;nbsp;Wh) stored electrical energy,&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell HC Series [http://www.maxwell.com/products/ultracapacitors / docs/datasheet_hc_series_1013793.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 100 times higher energy density (40 to 280 times) than the electrolytic capacitor.

=== Long time behavior, aging ===
Electrical parameters of capacitors may change over time during storage and application. The reasons for parameter changings are different, it may be a property of the dielectric, environmental influences, chemical processes or drying-out effects for non-solid materials.

==== Aging ====
[[File:Delta-Cap-versus-Zeit-engl.png|thumb|right|Aging of different Class 2 ceramic capacitors compared with NP0-Class 1 ceramic capacitor]]

In [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] Class 2 ceramic capacitors, capacitance decreases over time. This behavior is called &quot;aging&quot;. This aging occurs in ferroelectric dielectrics, where domains of polarization in the dielectric contribute to the total polarization. Degradation of polarized domains in the dielectric decreases permittivity and therefore capacitance over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Literatur| Titel = Ageing of the Dielectric Properties of Barium Titanate Ceramics | Band= 69 |Sammelwerk = Proceedings of the Physical Society. Section B | Autor = K. W. Plessner | Jahr = 1956 | Seiten = 1261–1268 | DOI = 10.1088/0370-1301/69/12/309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takaaki Tsurumi &amp; Motohiro Shono &amp; Hirofumi Kakemoto &amp; Satoshi Wada &amp; Kenji Saito &amp; Hirokazu Chazono, Mechanism of capacitance aging under DC-bias field in X7R-MLCCs
Published online: 23 March 2007, # Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007
[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10832-007-9071-0?LI=true#page-1]&lt;/ref&gt; The aging follows a logarithmic law. This defines the decrease of capacitance as constant percentage for a time decade after the soldering recovery time at a defined temperature, for example, in the period from 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;hours at 20&amp;nbsp;°C. As the law is logarithmic, the percentage loss of capacitance will twice between 1&amp;nbsp;h and 100&amp;nbsp;h and 3 times between 1&amp;nbsp;h and 1,000&amp;nbsp;h and so on. Aging is fastest near the beginning, and the absolute capacitance value stabilizes over time.

The rate of aging of Class 2 ceramic capacitors depends mainly on its materials. Generally, the higher the temperature dependence of the ceramic, the higher the aging percentage. The typical aging of X7R ceramic capacitors is about 2.5&amp;nbs;% per decade.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher England, Johanson dielectrics, Ceramic Capacitor Aging Made Simple [http://www.johansondielectrics.com/technical-notes/general/ceramic-capacitor-aging-made-simple.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The aging rate of Z5U ceramic capacitors is significantly higher and can be up to 7% per decade.

The aging process of Class 2 ceramic capacitors may be reversed by heating the component above the [[Curie point]].

Class 1 ceramic capacitors and film capacitors do not have ferroelectric-related aging. Environmental influences such as higher temperature, high humidity and mechanical stress can, over a longer period, lead to a small irreversible change in the capacitance value sometimes called aging, too.

The change of capacitance for P&amp;nbsp;100 and N&amp;nbsp;470 Class 1 ceramic capacitors is lower than 1%, for capacitors with N&amp;nbsp;750 to N&amp;nbsp;1500 ceramics it is ≤&amp;nbsp;2%. Film capacitors may lose capacitance due to self-healing processes or gain it due to humidity influences. Typical changes over 2 years at 40&amp;nbsp;°C are, for example, ±3&amp;nbsp;% for PE film capacitors and ±1&amp;nbsp;% PP film capacitors.

==== Life time ====
[[File:Lebensdauer-Testergebnisse-english.png|thumb|right|The electrical values of electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte changes over the time due to evaporation of electrolyte. Reaching specified limits of the parameters the capacitors will be count as &quot;wear out failure&quot;.]]

Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte age as the electrolyte evaporates. This evaporation depends on temperature and the current load the capacitors experience. Electrolyte escape influences capacitance and ESR. Capacitance decreases and the ESR increases over time. In contrast to ceramic, film and electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes, &quot;wet&quot; electrolytic capacitors reach a specified &quot;end of life&quot; reaching a specified maximum change of capacitance or ESR. End of life, &quot;load life&quot; or &quot;lifetime&quot; can be estimated either by formula or diagrams&lt;ref&gt;Electrolytic Capacitor Lifetime Estimation, Dr. Arne Albertsen, Jianghai Europe, [http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/1-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Lifetime-Estimation-long-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; or roughly by a so-called &quot;10-degree-law&quot;. A typical specification for an electrolytic capacitor states a lifetime of 2,000 hours at 85&amp;nbsp;°C, doubling for every 10 degrees lower temperature, achieving lifespan of approximately 15 years at room temperature.

Supercapacitors also experience electrolyte evaporation over time. Estimation is similar to wet electrolytic capacitors. Additional to temperature the voltage and current load influence the life time. Lower voltage than rated voltage and lower current loads as well as lower temperature extend the life time.

=== Failure rate ===
[[File:Elko-Badewannenkurve-english.png|thumb|right|The life time (load life) of capacitors correspondents with the time of constant random failure rate shown in the [[bathtub curve]]. For electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte and supercapacitors ends this time with the beginning of wear out failures due to evaporation of electrolyte]]

Capacitors are [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] components with low [[failure rate]]s, achieving life expectancies of decades under normal conditions. Most capacitors pass a test at the end of production similar to a &quot;[[burn in]]&quot;, so that early failures are found during production, reducing the number of post-shipment failures.

Reliability for capacitors is usually specified in numbers of [[Failure rate|Failures In Time]] (FIT) during the period of constant random failures. FIT is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) component-hours of operation at fixed working conditions (e.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, at 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5 U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;). For other conditions of applied voltage, current load, temperature, mechanical influences and humidity the FIT can recalculated with terms standardized for industrial&lt;ref&gt;IEC/EN 61709, Electric components. Reliability. Reference conditions for failure rates and stress models for conversion&lt;/ref&gt; or military&lt;ref&gt;MIL-HDBK-217F Reliability Prediction of Electronic Equipment&lt;/ref&gt; contexts.

== Additional information ==
=== Soldering ===
Capacitors may experience changes to electrical parameters due to environmental influences like soldering, mechanical stress factors (vibration, shock) and humidity. The greatest stress factor is soldering. The heat of the solder bath, especially for SMD capacitors, can cause ceramic capacitors to change contact resistance between terminals and electrodes; in film capacitors, the film may shrink, and in wet electrolytic capacitors the electrolyte may boil. A recovery period enables characteristics to stabilize after soldering; some types may require up to 24 hours. Some properties may change irreversibly by a few per cent from soldering.

=== Electrolytic behavior from storage or disuse ===
Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte are &quot;aged&quot; during manufacturing by applying rated voltage at high temperature for a sufficient time to repair all cracks and weaknesses that may have occurred during production. Some electrolytes with a high water content react quite aggressively or even violently with unprotected aluminum. This leads to a &quot;storage&quot; or &quot;disuse&quot; problem of electrolytic capacitors manufactured before the 1980s. Chemical processes weaken the oxide layer when these capacitors are not used for too long. New electrolytes with &quot;inhibitors&quot; or &quot;passivators&quot; were developed during the 1980s to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Stevens, T. R. Marshall, A. C. Geiculescu M., C. R.

Strange, Carts USA 2006, The Effects of Electrolyte Composition on the Deformation Characteristics of Wet Aluminum ICD Capacitors, [http://ecadigitallibrary.com/pdf/CARTS06/5_2zxm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Berduque, Zongli Dou, Rong Xu, BHC Components Ltd (KEMET), Electrochemical Studies for Aluminium Electrolytic Capacitor Applications: Corrosion Analysis of Aluminium in Ethylene Glycol-Based Electrolytes [http://www.kemet.com/kemet/web/homepage/kfbk3.nsf/vaFeedbackFAQ/9A3F15E8C67C5305852576F80076DBA3/$file/2009-10%20CARTS%20-%20Al-Electrolytic%20Corrosion%20of%20Al%20in%20Ethylen-Glycol%20Electrolytes.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2012 the standard storage time for electronic components of two years at room temperature substantiates (cased) by the oxidation of the terminals will be specified for electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes, too. Special series for 125&amp;nbsp;°C with organic solvents like [[gamma-Butyrolactone|GBL]] are specified up to 10 years storage time ensure without pre-condition the proper electrical behavior of the capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;Vishay BCcomponents, Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, paragraph &quot;Storage&quot;, Revision: 10-May-12, Document Number: 28356, [http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

For antique radio equipment, &quot;pre-conditioning&quot; of older electrolytic capacitors may be recommended. This involves applying the operating voltage for some 10 minutes over a current limiting resistor to the terminals of the capacitor. Applying a voltage through a safety resistor repairs the oxide layers.

=== IEC/EN standards ===
The tests and requirements to be met by capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the generic specification [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[European Committee for Standardization|EN]] 60384-1 in the following sections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beuth.de/de/ IEC/EN/DIN Standards, Beuth-Verlag]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Markings ===
==== Imprinted ====
Capacitors, like most other electronic components and if enough space is available, have imprinted markings to indicate manufacturer, type, electrical and thermal characteristics, and date of manufacture. If they are large enough the capacitor is marked with:

* manufacturer's name or trademark;
* manufacturer's type designation;
* polarity of the terminations (for polarized capacitors)
* rated capacitance;
* tolerance on rated capacitance
* rated voltage and nature of supply (AC or DC)
* climatic category or rated temperature;
* year and month (or week) of manufacture;
* certification marks of safety standards (for safety EMI/RFI suppression capacitors)

Polarized capacitors have polarity markings, usually &quot;-&quot; (minus) sign on the side of the negative electrode for electrolytic capacitors or a stripe or &quot;+&quot; (plus) sign, see [[#Polarity marking]]. Also, the negative lead for leaded &quot;wet&quot; e-caps is usually shorter.

Smaller capacitors use a shorthand notation. The most commonly used format is: XYZ J/K/M VOLTS V, where XYZ represents the capacitance (calculated as XY × 10&lt;sup&gt;Z&lt;/sup&gt; pF), the letters J, K or M indicate the tolerance (±5%, ±10% and ±20% respectively) and VOLTS V represents the working voltage.

Examples:

* 105K 330V implies a capacitance of 10 × 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 1 µF (K = ±10%) with a working voltage of 330 V.
* 473M 100V implies a capacitance of 47 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; pF = 47 nF (M = ±20%) with a working voltage of 100 V.

Capacitance, tolerance and date of manufacture can be indicated with a short code specified in IEC/EN 60062. Examples of short-marking of the rated capacitance (microfarads): µ47 = 0,47 µF, 4µ7 = 4,7 µF, 47µ = 47 µF

The date of manufacture is often printed in accordance with international standards.

* Version 1: coding with year/week numeral code, &quot;1208&quot; is &quot;2012, week number 8&quot;.
* Version 2: coding with year code/month code. The year codes are: &quot;R&quot; = 2003, &quot;S&quot;= 2004, &quot;T&quot; = 2005, &quot;U&quot; = 2006, &quot;V&quot; = 2007, &quot;W&quot; = 2008, &quot;X&quot; = 2009, &quot;A&quot; = 2010, &quot;B&quot; = 2011, &quot;C&quot; = 2012, &quot;D&quot; = 2013, etc. Month codes are: &quot;1&quot; to &quot;9&quot; = Jan. to Sept., &quot;O&quot; = October, &quot;N&quot; = November, &quot;D&quot; = December. &quot;X5&quot; is then &quot;2009, May&quot;

For very small capacitors like MLCC chips no marking is possible. Here only the traceability of the manufacturers can ensure the identification of a type.

====Colour coding====
{{Main|Electronic color code}}
{{as of|2013}} Capacitors do not use color coding.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Aluminum e-caps with non-solid electrolyte have a polarity marking at the cathode (minus) side. Aluminum, tantalum, and niobium e-caps with solid electrolyte have a polarity marking at the anode (plus) side. Supercapacitor are marked at the minus side.

==Resistor==
:[[Image:Resistors2.jpg|300px]]

A resistor is a block or material that limits the flow of current. The greater the resistance, the lower the current will be, assuming the same voltage imposed on the resistor. The hydraulic analogy of a resistor would be the pipe with water flowing through it. The wider the diameter of a pipe, the higher the water flow through the pipe, assuming the same pressure difference on the terminals of a pipe.

==Resistor's Symbol==
Resistors have two leads (points of contact) to which the resistor can be connected to an electrical circuit.  A symbol for a resistor used in electrical circuit diagrams is shown below.  

:[[Image:Resistor symbol America.svg|60px]]

The endpoints at the left and right sides of the symbol indicate the points of contact for the resistor.  The ratio of the voltage to current will always be positive, since a higher voltage on one side of a resistor is a positive voltage, and a current will flow from the positive side to the negative side, resulting in a positive current.  If the voltage is reversed, the current is reversed, leading again to a positive resistance.


==Resistance==
Resistance is a characteristic of Resistor indicates the measurement of current opposition . Resistance has a symbol R measured in Ohm (Ω) . The ratio of voltage to current is referred to as Ohm's Law, and is one of the most basic laws that govern electronics.
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

An ohm is the amount of resistance which passes one ampere of current when a one volt potential is placed across it.  (The ohm is actually defined as the resistance which dissipates one watt of power when one ampere of current is passed through it.)
: &lt;math&gt;1 \Omega = \frac{1 \mbox{ V}}{1 \mbox{ A}}&lt;/math&gt;

Resistance can vary from very small to very large.  A superconductor has zero resistance, while something like the input to an op-amp can have a resistance near 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega;, and even higher resistances are possible.  

===Resistance and Temperature===
For most materials, resistance increases with increasing Temperature 
: For Conductor . &lt;math&gt;R = R_o (1+nT)&lt;/math&gt; 
: For Semi Conductor . &lt;math&gt;R = R_o e^nT&lt;/math&gt; 

===Resistance and Electric Power Loss===
Resistance converts Electrical Energy into Heat this causes Electric Energy Loss.  
:&lt;math&gt;P_r = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

NOTE : Resistors which dissipate large amounts of power are cooled so that they are not destroyed, typically with finned heatsinks.


If Electric Energy Supply is P&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; and Electric Energy Loss is P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; Then, Electric Energy Delivered is
:&lt;math&gt;P = p_v - P_r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = VI - I^2 R = I (V - IR)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = VI - \frac{V^2}{R} = V (I - \frac{V}{R})&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio of Electric Energy Delivered over Electric Energy Supplied indicates the Efficiency of Electric Power Supply
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{P}{P_v} = \frac{V - IR}{V} = \frac{I - \frac{V}{R}}{I} = \frac{P_v Cos \theta}{P_v} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n = Cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistor's Labeling (See also [[Electronics/Component Identification|Identification]])==
A manufactured resistor is usually labeled with the nominal value (value to be manufactured to) and sometimes a tolerance.  Rectangular resistors will usually contain numbers that indicate a resistance and a multiplier.  If there are three or four numbers on the resistor, the first numbers are a resistance value, and the last number refers to the number of zeroes in the multiplier.  If there is an R in the value, the R takes the place of the decimal point.

:'''Examples'''
:2003 means 200×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  = 200k&amp;Omega;
:600 means 60×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 60&amp;Omega;
:2R5 means 2.5&amp;Omega;
:R01 means 0.01&amp;Omega;

Cylindrical resistors (axial) usually have colored bands that indicate a number and a multiplier.  Resistance bands are next to each other, with a tolerance band slightly farther away from the resistance bands.  Starting from the resistance band side of the resistor, each colour represents a number in the same fashion as the number system shown above.

'''Additional Colours''': A gold band in the multiplier position means 0.1, but means a 5% tolerance in the tolerance position.  A silver band in the multiplier position means 0.01, but means 10% in the tolerance position.

==Resistor's Construction==
The resistance ''R'' of a component is dependent on its physical dimension and can be calculated using:

:&lt;math&gt; R = {\rho L \over A} \;  &lt;/math&gt;

where 
: ''&amp;rho;'' is the electrical resistivity (resistance to electricity) of the material, 
: ''L'' is the length of the material
: ''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the material.

If you increase ''&amp;rho;'' or ''L'' you increase the resistance of the material, but if you increase ''A'' you decrease the resistance of the material.

===Resistivity of the Material===
Every material has its own resistivity, depending on its physical makeup. Most metals are conductors and have very low resistivity; whereas, insulators such as rubber, wood, and air all have very high resistivity. The inverse of resistivity is conductivity, which is measured in units of Siemens/metre (S/m) or, equivalently. mhos/metre.

In the following chart, it is not immediately obvious how the unit ohm-meter is selected. Considering a solid block of the material to be tested, one can readily see that the resistance of the block will decrease as its cross-sectional area increases (thus widening the conceptual &quot;pipe&quot;), and will increase as the length of the block increases (lengthening the &quot;pipe&quot;). Given a fixed length, the resistance will increase as the cross-sectional area decreases; the resistance, multiplied by the area, will be a constant. If the cross-sectional area is held constant, as the length is increased, the resistance increases in proportion, so the resistance divided by the length is similarly a constant.  Thus the bulk resistance of a material is typically measured in ohm meters squared per meter, which simplifies to ohm - meter (&amp;Omega;-m).

Silver, copper, gold, and aluminum are popular materials for wires, due to low resistivity.  Silicon and germanium are used as semiconductors. Glass, rubber, quartz crystal, and air are popular dielectrics, due to high resistivity.  

Many materials, such as air, have a non-linear resistance curve.  Normal undisturbed air has a high resistance, but air with a high enough voltage applied will become ionized and conduct very easily.

The resistivity of a material also depends on its temperature.  Normally, the hotter an object is, the more resistance it has.  At high temperatures, the resistance is proportional to the absolute temperature. At low temperatures, the formula is more complicated, and what counts as a high or low temperature depends on what the resistor is made from.  In some materials the resistivity drops to zero below a certain temperature.  This is known as superconductivity, and has many useful applications.

(Some materials, such as silicon, have less resistance at higher temperatures.)

For all resistors, the ''change'' in resistance for a ''small'' increase in temperature is ''directly proportional'' to the ''change'' in temperature.

Current passing through a resistor will warm it up.
Many components have heat sinks to dissipate that heat. The heatsink keeps the component from melting or setting something on fire.

===Length===
The length of an object is directly proportional to its resistance. As shown in the diagram below, 1 unit cubed of material has 1 ohm of resistance. However, when 4 units are stacked lengthwise and a connection is made to the front and back sides respectively, the total resistance is 4 ohms. This is because the length of the unit is 4, whereas the cross-sectional area remains 1. However, if you were to make connections on the sides, the exact opposite would be true: the cross-sectional area would be 4 and the length 1, resulting in 0.25 ohms total resistance.

[[Image:Electronics ResistanceEX1.PNG]]

===Cross-Sectional Area===
Increasing area is the same as having resistors in parallel, so as you increase the area you add more paths for current to take.

The resistance of a material is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area. This is shown in the diagram below, where 1 unit cubed has one ohm of resistance. However, if 4 units cubed are stacked on top of each other in the fashion such that there is 4 units squared of cross-sectional area, and the electrical connections are made to the front and back such that the connections are on the largest sides, the resultant resistance would be 0.25 ohms.

Additional note: There are two reasons why a small cross-sectional area tends to raise resistance. One is that the electrons, all having the same negative charge, repel each other. Thus there is resistance to many being forced into a small space. The other reason is that they collide, causing &quot;scattering,&quot; and therefore they are diverted from their original directions. (More discussion is on page 27 of &quot;Industrial Electronics,&quot; by D. J. Shanefield, Noyes Publications, Boston, 2001.)

[[Image:Electronics ResistanceEX2.PNG]]

===Example===
For instance, if you wanted to calculate the resistance of a 1 cm high, 1 cm wide, 5 cm deep block of copper, as shown in the diagram below:

[[Image:Electronics_Resistance_Copper.PNG]]

You would first need to decide how it's oriented. Suppose you want to use it from front to back (lengthwise), like a piece of wire, with electrical contacts on the front and rear faces. Next you need to find the length, L. As shown, it is 5 cm long (0.05 m). Then, we look up the resistivity of copper on the table, 1.6&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega;-meters. Lastly, we calculate the cross-sectional area of the conductor, which is 1 cm &amp;times; 1 cm = 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.0001 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Then, we put it all in the formula, converting cm to m:

&lt;math&gt;{0.05 \ \mbox{m} \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-8} \ \Omega \cdot \mbox{m} \over 0.0001 \ \mbox{m}^2} = {0.08 \times 10^{-8} \ \Omega \cdot\mbox{m}^2 \over 0.0001\ \mbox{m}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

units m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; cancel:

&lt;math&gt;{0.08 \times 10^{-8}\ \Omega \over 0.0001}&lt;/math&gt;

Which, after evaluating, gives you a final value of 8.0&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;Omega;, or 8 microohms, a very small resistance. The method shown above included the units to demonstrate how the units cancel out, but the calculation will work as long as you use consistent units.

:Internet Hint: Google calculator can do calculations like this for you, automatically converting units.  This example can be calculated with this link: [http://www.google.com/search?q=%281.6*10%5E-8+ohm+meter%29+*+%285+cm%29+%2F+%281+cm%29%5E2&amp;]

===Properties of the material===
*'''Wirewound''': Used for power resistors, since the power per volume ratio is highest.  These usually have the lowest noise.

*'''Carbon Film''': These are easy to produce, but usually have lots of noise because of the properties of the material.

*'''Metal Film''': These resistors have thermal and voltage noise attributes that are between carbon and wirewound.

*'''Ceramic''': Useful for high frequency applications.

==Resistor Connection==
===Resistors in Series===
:[[Image:Resistorsseries.png]]

Resistors in series are equivalent to having one long resistor.  If the properties of two resistors are equivalent, except the length, the final resistance will be the sum of the two construction methods:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{EQ} = \frac{\rho L_{EQ}}{A} =  \frac{\rho L_1}{A} + \frac{\rho L_2}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the resistors add when in series.

:&lt;math&gt;R_{EQ} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

* Christmas tree lights are usually connected in series, with the unfortunate effect that if one light blows, the others will all go out (This happens because the circuit is not complete, if a circuit is not complete then the current cannot flow, hence the light bulbs all go out).  However, most modern Christmas light strings have built in shunt resistors in parallel to the bulb, so that current will flow past the blown light bulb.

===Resistors in Parallel===
:[[Image:Resistorsparallel.png]]

In a parallel circuit, current is divided among multiple paths. This means that two resistors in parallel have a lower equivalent resistance than either of the parallel resistors, since both resistors allow current to pass.  Two resistors in parallel will be equivalent to a resistor that is twice as wide:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{EQ} = \frac{\rho L}{A_{EQ}} = \frac{\rho L}{A_1} + \frac{\rho L}{A_2}&lt;/math&gt;

Since conductances (the inverse of resistance) add in parallel, you get the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R_{EQ}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, two 4 &amp;Omega; resistors in parallel have an equivalent resistance of only 2 &amp;Omega;.

To simplify mathematical equations, resistances in parallel can be represented with two vertical lines &quot;||&quot; (as in geometry).  For two resistors the parallel formula simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt; R_{EQ} = R_1 \| R_2 = {R_1 R_2 \over R_1 + R_2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Combinations of series and parallel===
:[[Image:Resistorscombo.png]]

Resistors in parallel are evaluated as if in a mathematical set of &quot;parentheses.&quot;  The most basic group of resistors in parallel is evaluated first, then the group in series with the new equivalent resistor, then the next group of resistors in parallel, and so on.  For example, the above portion would be evaluated as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{EQ} = (R_1 \| R_2) + R_3 = {R_1R_2 \over R_1 + R_2} +R_3&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistor variations==
* '''Variable Resistor''' or '''Potentiometer'''
: Variable resistors are tunable, meaning you can turn a dial or slide a contact and change the resistance. They are used as knobs to control the volume of a stereo, or as a dimmer for a lamp. The term Potentiometer is often abbreviated as 'pot'. It is constructed like a resistor, but has a sliding tap contact. Potentiometers are used as [[Electronics/Voltage Dividers|Voltage Dividers]].  It is rare to find a variable resistor with only two leads.  Most are potentiometers with three leads, even if one is not connected to anything.

* '''Rheostat'''
: A variation of the potentiostat with a high current rating, which is used to control the amount of power going through a load, such as a motor.

* '''Thermistor'''
: Temperature-sensitive resistor, in which the resistance decreases as the temperature rises. They are used in fire alarms, so if things get too hot the current rises and trips a switch that sounds an alarm.

* '''LDR''' (Light Dependent Resistor) or '''Photoresistor'''
: A resistor which changes values depending on the amount of light shining on its surface. The resistance decreases as the amount of light increases. They are used in street lamps, so when it gets dark the current decreases and turns on the street lamp.

==Applications==
* '''Voltage division / Attenuation''': Sometimes a voltage will be too large to measure, so a means to linearly reduce the voltage is required.  Placing two resistors in series to ground will provide a point in the middle to tap.  Resistor R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is placed between the input voltage and the output node, and the resistor R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is placed between the output node and ground.  This creates a voltage divider to lessen the output voltage.  Typically, the resistors are near the value of ~10k&amp;Omega;.  The Thevenin model of the circuit gives an output  resistance R&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;||R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. A larger output resistance will more likely be affected by the input resistance of the measuring circuit (this is a desired effect in the transistor biasing circuits).  Placement of the voltage divider should be close to the measuring circuit, to minimize noise (in this arrangement, it will be also lessened Rb/(Ra + Rb) times).  &lt;!-- Is this really true? Yes, it is true as the noise will be lessened K times --&gt; The output voltage of the voltage divider is

:&lt;math&gt;V_{output} = \frac{R_B}{R_A + R_B}V_{input}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Pull-up / Pull-down''': If there is nothing to drive a signal node, the node will be left &quot;floating&quot; (for example, such a situation occurs at the trigger input of a car alarm system when the driver has switched off the internal lamp).  This may lead to unintended values being measured, or causing side-effects when the voltage is propagated down the remainder of the circuit.  To prevent this, a relatively high value resistor (usually ~10k&amp;Omega; to ~1M&amp;Omega;) is placed between the node and ground (pull-down) or a high voltage (pull-up) to bring the voltage of the &quot;floating&quot; node near to the voltage it is being pulled. A resistive voltage divider is another example where the upper resistor &quot;pulls&quot; the output point up toward the input voltage while the lower resistor &quot;pulls&quot; the output point toward the ground. This idea is evolved in the circuit of a resistive voltage summer (for example, the resistors R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of an op-amp inverting amplifier) supplied by two voltages (V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and -V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;) having opposite polarities. The two voltage sources &quot;pull&quot; the output point in opposite directions; as a result, if R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = -V&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;, the point becomes a virtual ground. Placement of a pull-up or pull-down resistor does not have a significant effect on the performance of the circuit, if they have high resistances. 
 
* '''Current limiting / Isolation''': In order to protect circuits from conditions that may cause too much current in a device, a current limiting resistor is inserted in the middle of the circuit.  A digital input to a microcontroller &lt;!-- link this? --&gt; may benefit from a current limiting resistor.  The inputs to modern microcontrollers have protection circuitry built in that will protect the input from an overvoltage condition, provided that the current is small enough.  For instance, a common microcontroller will be capable of withstanding 20mA.  If there are 12V nets on a circuit board, or in a system, the digital input will benefit from a 350&amp;Omega; resistor (refer to calculation below).  Usually a slightly larger resistance is used in practice, but too large of a resistor will cause noise, and may prevent the input from being able to read the voltage.  It is good practice to place the resistor as close as possible to the microcontroller input, so that an accidental short on the board will mean that the microcontroller input is likely still protected.

:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{12V}{20mA} = 600\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Line termination / Impedance matching''': The properties of an electric wave propagating through a conductor (such as a wire) create a reflection, which can be viewed as unwanted noise.  A reflection can be eliminated by maximizing the power transfer between the conductor and the termination resistor.  By matching the resistance (more importantly the impedance &lt;!-- insert link --&gt;), the wave will not cause a reflection.  The voltage of the echo V_r is calculated below in reference to the original signal V_o as a function of the conductor impedance Z_C and the terminator impedance Z_T.  As the name implies, the termination resistor goes at the end of the conductor.

:&lt;math&gt; V_r = V_o\frac{Z_C - Z_T}{Z_C + Z_T}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''Current sensing''': Measurement of a current cannot be done directly.  There are three major ways to measure a current: a resistor, a hall sensor, and an inductor.  The hall sensor and inductor use a property of  the magnetic field to sense the current through a nearby conductor.  According to Ohm's law, if a current I flows through a resistor R, a voltage V = R.I appears across the resistor. Therefore, the resistor can act as a passive current-to-voltage converter.  In this arrangement, the resistor should have a very low value (sometimes on the order of ~0.01&amp;Omega;), so it does not affect the current flow or heat up; however, a smaller value has a lower voltage to read, which means more noise may be introduced.  This contradiction is  solved in the circuit of an active current-to-voltage converter where the resistor may have a significant resistance as an op-amp compensates the &quot;undesired&quot; voltage drop across it (unfortunately, this remedy may be applied only in low-current measurements). The current sense resistor should be placed as close as possible to where the measurement occurs, in order not to disturb the circuit.

* '''Filtering''': Filtering is discussed later, after an introduction to capacitors and inductors.  Filters are best placed close to where measurement takes place.

==Specifications==
Resistors are available as pre-fabricated, real-world components. The behavior of such components deviates from an ideal resistor in certain ways. Therefore, real-world resistors are not only specified by their resistance, but also by other parameters. In order to select a manufactured resistance, the entire range of specifications should be considered.  Usually, exact values do not need to be known, but ranges should be determined.

===Nominal Resistance===
The nominal resistance is the resistance that can be expected when ordering a resistor.  Finding a range for the resistance is necessary, especially when operating on signals.  Resistors do not come in all of the values that will be necessary.  Sometimes resistor values can be manipulated by shaving off parts of a resistor (in industrial environments this is sometimes done with a LASER to adjust a circuit), or by combining several resistors in series and parallel.

Available resistor values typically come with a resistance value from a so called resistor series. Resistor series are sets of standard, predefined resistance values. The values are actually made up from a geometric sequence within each decade. In every decade there are supposed to be &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; resistance values, with a constant step factor. The standard resistor values within a decade are derived by using the step factor &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;i = \sqrt[n]{10};  n = 6, 12, 24, 48&lt;/math&gt;

rounded to a two digit precision. Resistor series are named E&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, according to the used value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the above formula.   

  n Values/Decade  Step factor i  Series
 ----------------------------------------
         6             1.47         E6
        12             1.21         E12
        24             1.10         E24
        48             1.05         E48

For example, in the E12 series for &lt;math&gt;n = 12&lt;/math&gt;, the resistance steps in a decade are, after rounding the following 12 values:

 1.00, 1.20, 1.50, 1.80, 2.20, 2.70, 
 3.30, 3.90, 4.70, 5.60, 6.80, and 8.20

and actually available resistors from the E12 series are for example resistors with a nominal value of 120Ω or 4.7kΩ.

===Tolerances===
A manufactured resistor has a certain tolerance to which the resistance may differ from the nominal value.  For example, a 2k&amp;Omega; resistor may have a tolerance of &amp;plusmn;5%, leaving a resistor with a value between 1.9k&amp;Omega; and 2.1k&amp;Omega; (i.e. 2k&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;100&amp;Omega;). The tolerance must be accounted for when designing circuits.  A circuit with an absolute voltage of 5V&amp;plusmn;0.0V in a voltage divider network with two resistors of 2k&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;5% will have a resultant voltage of 5V&amp;plusmn;10% (i.e. 5V&amp;plusmn;0.1V).  The final resistor tolerances are found by taking the derivative of the resistor values, and plugging the absolute deviations into the resulting equation.

The above mentioned E-series which are used to provide standardized nominal resistance values, are also coupled to standardized nominal tolerances. The fewer steps within a decade there are, the larger the allowed tolerance of a resistor from such a series is. More precises resistors, outside of the mentioned E-series are also available, e.g. for high-precision measurement equipment. Common tolerances, colors and key characters used to identify them are for example:

  Series  Values/Decade  Tolerance  Color Code  Character Code
 --------------------------------------------------------------
    E6          6          ±20%       [none]        [none]
    E12        12          ±10%       silver          K
    E24        24           ±5%       gold            J
    E48        48           ±2%       red             G
     -         -            ±1%       brown           F
     -         -            ±0.5%       -             D
     -         -            ±0.25%      -             C
     -         -            ±0.1%       -             B

Resistor manufacturers can benefit from this standardization. They manufacture resistors first, and afterwards they measure them. If a resistor does not meet the nominal value within the defined tolerance of one E-series, it might still fit into a lower series, and doesn't have to be thrown away, but can be sold as being compliant to that lower E-series standard. Although typically at a lower price. 

'''Series''':  Resistors that combine in series add the nominal tolerances together.
:Derivation: &lt;math&gt;dR_T = dR_A + dR_B&lt;/math&gt;

:Example: For two resistors in series R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5k&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;130&amp;Omega; and R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 500&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;25&amp;Omega;, the tolerance is 130&amp;Omega; + 25&amp;Omega;, resulting in a final resistor value R&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; = 2k&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;155&amp;Omega;.

'''Parallel''': Resistors that combine in parallel have a combined tolerance that is slightly more complex.
:Derivation: &lt;math&gt;dR_P = \frac{dR_A R_B^2 + R_A^2 dR_B}{(R_A+R_B)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:Example: For two resistors in parallel R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5k&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;130&amp;Omega; and R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 500&amp;Omega;&amp;plusmn;25&amp;Omega;.

===Power Rating===
Because the purpose of a resistor is to dissipate power in the form of heat, the resistor has a rating (in watts) at which the resistor can continue to dissipate before the temperature overwhelms the resistor and causes it to overheat.  When a resistor overheats, the material begins to melt away, which will cause the resistance to increase (usually), until the resistor breaks.

===Operating Temperature===

Related to power rating, the operating temperature is the temperature that the resistor can continue to operate before being destroyed.

===Maximum Voltage===

In order to avoid sparkovers or material breakdown a certain maximum voltage over a resistor must not be exceeded. The maximum voltage is part of a resistor's specification, and typically a function of the resistor's physical length, distance of the leads, material and coating. 

For example, a resistor with a maximum operating voltage of 1kV can have a length in the area of 2&quot;, while a 0.3&quot; resistor can operate under up to several tens of volts, probably up to a hundred volts. When working with dangerous voltages it is essential to check the actual specification of a resistor, instead of only trusting it because of the length.

===Temperature Coefficient===

This parameter refers to the constant in which the resistance changes per degree Celsius (units in C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;).  The change in temperature is not linear over the entire range of temperatures, but can usually be thought of as linear around a certain range (usually around room temperature).  However, the resistance should be characterized over a large range if the resistor is to be used as a thermistor in those ranges.  The simplified linearized formula for the affect on temperature to a resistor is expressed in an equation:

:&lt;math&gt;R = R_0 [1+\alpha(T-T_0)]&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacity and Inductance ===

Real world resistors not only show the physical property of resistance, but also have a certain capacity and inductance. These properties start to become important, if a resistor is used in some high frequency circuitry. Wire wound resistors, for example, show an inductance which typically make them unusable above 1kHz.

===Packaging===

Resistors can be packaged in any way possible, but are divided into surface mount, through hole, soldering tag and a few more forms.  Surface mount is connected to the same side that the resistor is on.  Through hole resistors have leads (wires) that typically go through the circuit board and are soldered to the board on the side opposite the resistor, hence the name. Resistors with leads are also used in point-to-point circuits without circuit boards. Soldering tag resistors have lugs to solder wires or high current connectors onto.

Usual packages for surface mount resistors are rectangular, referenced by a length and a width in mils (thousands of an inch). For instance, an 0805 resistor is a rectangle with length .08&quot; x .05&quot;, with contacts (metal that connects to the resistor) on either side. Typical through hole resistors are cylindrical, referenced either by the length (such as 0.300&quot;) or by a typical power rating that is common to the length (a 1/4W resistor is typically 0.300&quot;). This length does not include the length of the leads.

==RC Circuits==

==Introduction==

An '''RC''' circuit is short for 'Resistor-Capacitor' circuit. A capacitor takes an infinite amount of time to discharge through a resistor, which varies with the values of the resistor and capacitor. A capacitor acts interestingly in an electronic circuit, practically speaking as a combination of a voltage source and a variable resistor.

==Basics==

Below is a simple RC Circuit:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC01.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
There is a capacitor in parallel with the resistor and current probe. The way the capacitor functions is by acting as a very low resistance '''load''' when the circuit is initially turned on. This is illustrated below:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC02.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Initially, the capacitor has a very low resistance, almost 0. Since electricity takes the path of least resistance, almost all the electricity flows through the capacitor, not the resistor, as it has considerably higher resistance. As a capacitor charges, it's resistance increases as it gains more and more charge. As the resistance of the capacitor climbs, electricity begins to flow not only to the capacitor, but through the resistor as well:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC03.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Once the capacitor's voltage equals that of the battery, meaning it is fully charged, it will not allow any current to pass through it. All the electricity eventually flows through the resistor.&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC04.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
A capacitor's resistance becomes higher and higher as it becomes more charged. Once it is fully charged, for all practical reasons, it has infinite resistance (an open connection). Once the voltage source is disconnected, however, the capacitor acts as a voltage source itself:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC05.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
As time goes on, the capacitor's charge begins to drop, and so does its voltage. This means less current flowing through the resistor:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC06.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;
Once the capacitor is fully discharged, you are back to square one:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_RC01.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;

If one were to do this with a light and a capacitor connected to a battery, what you would see is the following: 

#Switch is hit. Light does not light up.
#Light gradually becomes brighter and brighter...
#Light is at full luminosity.
#Switch is released. Light continues to shine. 
#Light begins to fade...
#Light is off.

This is how a capacitor acts. However, what if you changed the values of R1? C1? The voltage of the battery? We will examine the mathematical relationship between the resistor, capacitor, and charging rate below.

==The Time Constant==

In order to find out how long it takes for a capacitor to fully charge or discharge, or how long it takes for the capacitor to reach a certain voltage, you must know a few things. First, you must know the starting and finishing voltages. Secondly, you must know the '''time constant''' of the circuit you have. Time constant is denoted by the Greek letter 'tau' or '''τ'''. The general formula for percentage change is:&lt;br&gt;

(Regarding above, don't dive so shallow in to it.. DNA in all animal/plant/fungi/protist/bacterial enviroments exsists only as a double helix but does occur s a single helix in   many viruses DNA is found as a single strand. Further more RNA will fold back on it's self when ever it can, and not too oftenly will it exsist as a single strand, in most (yes accuratly most.) cases RNA is found it be in a complex folded arrangement that provideds structural and enzymatic activity. Even as a double helix in some viruses!!!)

----
Three men stop at a hotel.  There's only one room left, so they agree to share.  The desk clerk charges them thirty dollars, and they each give him ten dollars.

Later, the clerk realizes he's over-charged them by five dollars.  He gives the bell-boy five one-dollar bills, and tells him to return the money to the three men.  The bell-boy keeps two dollars for himself, and gives one dollar to each of the three men.  

So, the men paid nine dollars each for the room, for a total of twenty-seven dollars.  The bell-hop has two dollars,  and that makes twenty-nine.  What happened to the other dollar?

----

'''And another thing.''' Two men stop at the same hotel.  There's only one room left, so they agree to share.  The desk clerk charges them thirty dollars, and they each give him fifteen dollars.

Later, the clerk realizes that once ''again'' he has over-charged by five dollars.  He gives the bell-boy five one-dollar bills, and tells him to return the money to the two men.  The bell-boy, feeling slightly more daring, keeps three dollars for himself, and gives one dollar to each of the two men.  

So, the men paid fourteen dollars each for the room, for a total of twenty-eight dollars.  The bell-boy has three dollars,  and that makes thirty-one.  Where did the other dollar come from?  And, no, you better not answer that it came from the first puzzle.

----

The men paid $27 dollars.  The desk clerk has $25 dollars and the bell-hop pocketed $2.

The mistake is expecting that what the men paid and what the bell-boy kept to add up to what the men initially gave the desk clerk.  In fact, it is the amount that the room effectively cost them, plus the amount they received back, that should add to $30.

----

The second puzzle is very similar:  $25 is sitting with the clerk, $2 with the men, and $3 with the bellhop.  That adds to the required $30.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Some History of the development of understanding of the Cell==

The origin of the idea that living organisms are made of cells is often traced back to observations of thin slices of cork.  In 1665 the book ''Micrographia: Some physiological descriptions of minute bodies made by magnifying glasses'' was published by Robert Hooke. He wrote: 
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Cork_Micrographia_Hooke.png|120px]]&lt;/div&gt;
:. . . I could exceedingly plainly perceive it to be all perforated and porous, much like a Honey-comb, but that the pores of it were not regular. . . . these pores, or cells, . . . were indeed the first microscopical pores I ever saw, and perhaps, that were ever seen, for I had not met with any Writer or Person, that had made any mention of them before this. . .

We now know that the &quot;cells&quot; Hooke observed were an indication of the cellular structure of multi-cellular organisms. During the 1670s, Antony van Leeuwenhoek used microscopes to observe sperm, red blood cells, and protozoa. While many cells are about 10 microns in diameter, some protozoa are visible to the naked eye, reaching over 1 millimeter in length. Leewenhoek is the inventor of the microscope. Thus, while it is true that the small size of most cells made it difficult to develop the theory that all living organisms are composed of cells, it was also difficult to recognize that living cells have certain functional components such as the nucleus and a surface membrane that allow cells to exist as the basic functional components of all living organisms. In 1833 Robert Brown published a report describing microscopic observations of plant cells in which he used first used the term &quot;cell nucleus&quot;:
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Chromosomes2.jpg|mouse chromosomes]]&lt;/div&gt;
: In the compressed cells of the epidermis the nucleus is in a corresponding degree flattened; but in the internal tissue it is often nearly spherical, more or less firmly adhering to one of the walls, and projecting into the cavity of the cell.

Such observations of the microscopic cellular components of cells helped make it possible for	Schleiden and Schwann to propose a cell theory specifying that nucleated cells are key structural and functional units in plants and animals (1832-1838). However, they did not understand cell reproduction. About this time microscopists such as the Belgian botanist Barthelemy C. Dumortier observed and reported the binary fission of cells. By 1879 the zoologist Walther Flemming was using chemical staining of &quot;fixed&quot; cells to allow clear visualization of chromosomes during cell division. 

During the 1890s, Ernest Overton, developed a theory of lipid membrane structure and function, based largely on the [[w:en:Osmosis|osmotic]] properties of cells. Visualization of lipid bilayer membranes at the surface of cells had to wait until the development of electron microscopy.

I was thinking a fun exercise would be to get people to write English words in Arabic.  This would be useful because 1) people don't have an English vocabulary 2) it would help them dissociate writing system from spoken languages (although this isn't always possible).  Of course we could be cheeky and say, &quot;since we don't know any arabic words, let's borrow a few from English&quot;, those being Alcohol, algorithm, etc, etc.  Maybe we could even have them read an English sentence like: اف يو كن ريد ثيس، يو رد اربيك  (this is meant to say &quot;if you can read this, you can read arabic&quot;)

Anyone care to propose a list of exercise-words? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:52, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Arabic letter size ==

Is there any possibility in increasing the arabic letter size? It's really hard to copy even with the text sized turned up. 

Maybe also any chance of a printable &quot;copy along&quot; page like those in most hiragana/katakana self learn books?

:Well... i tried, but cranking up the font size doesn't seem to make a difference (i.e. from +2 to +5 is the same).  Maybe somebody else knows how? Can't help you on the &quot;copy along&quot; pages... my Arabic book doesn't show how to write the letters.  I've sort of given up on learning the language for now though.  Looks like somebody else will have to take over.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:08, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Isolated forms ==

=== Isolated ===

An anonymous editor (hi!) made some changes to the table: but the formatting to these changes is messed up, so it would be useful to correct it first.  Also, I've recently set aside the Arabic, but I think the point of the extra _ is to show context, i.e. where other letters go.  It is not intended to represent the letter shape itself.  But maybe I misunderstood your comment.  Best -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 10:39, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

==Static Electricity==

''This is a rough draft.''

''As this is a book, it should have historical stories and stuff to make it more interesting.  Greeks and amber in this section, for instance.''

When a solitary atom has the same number of electrons and protons, it has no overall charge.  The individual charges cancel out.  It is said to be ''neutral''.

An atom that has more electrons than protons is negatively charged.  The atom will have a tendency to attract other particles that have a positive charge, and repel particles with a negative charge.

An atom that has less electrons than protons is positively charged.  The atom will attract negative particles (like solitary electrons or negatively charged atoms) and repel positive particles (like solitary protons or positively charged atoms).

If a solitary proton and electron are placed near each other (or even far away, as long as nothing else is nearby), they will move closer together, until the electron becomes &quot;attached&quot; to the proton and they form a hydrogen atom.  An atom of metal that is positively charged (missing electrons) and a free electron will behave the same way.

The same goes for macroscopic objects.  A metal sphere that has a significant amount of atoms that have the same number of electrons and protons is neutral.  Also, if there are several atoms that are positively charged or negatively charged, it is said that the whole object is charged. This may not be noticeable if only a few atoms on the object are charged.

Charged metal spheres will attract and repel each other according to the same rules as individual particles.  

A solitary metal sphere with an excess of electrons will tend to have the extra electrons spread out evenly across the surface of the sphere (not in the interior).  This is because the electrons repel each other, and try to get as far apart as possible.  On a positively charged sphere, the positive charge (absence of electrons) also spreads evenly across the surface due to its lack of electrons. (Talk about the neat shielding properties of Faraday cages)  In the space inside to the sphere there is no charge.

In the case of insulating spheres charge does not move throughout the object, it just sits there.  The electrons in this object are not constantly moving from atom to atom, so the empty holes have no way to be filled by their neighbors. 

A Van de Graaff generator is basically a pump for electrons (or a &quot;charge pump&quot;).  It uses the triboelectric effect to take electrons from one conductor and deposit them on another.  The triboelectric effect is caused when two different materials are brought into contact and then separated.  One material will have more of a tendency to attract extra electrons, and some of the electrons will transfer from one material to the other.  The Van de Graaff generator accomplishes this with a silk or rubber belt held tightly between two rollers of different materials.  As the belt comes into contact with one roller and then separates, it picks up charge from the roller.  When it comes into contact with the other roller and then separates, it deposits the charge.  

It thus makes one roller positively charged and the other negatively charged.  The electrons are supplied to one roller and extracted from the other by metal brushes, connected to the large conductors.  This creates a voltage between the conductors, due to their distance.

''(Should we really be going into so much detail about it though?...  I guess as an example of a very basic electric circuit, it is a good example.  Maybe we could just link to Wikipedia triboelectric effect?  That's the thing I don't like about wikibooks.  You have to provide all of the background instead of just directing them to it.)''

: &lt;math&gt;P = I \cdot V&lt;/math&gt;

==Power Delivered==
Electric Power delivered through resistive network is equal to Electric Power Supply minus Electric Power Loss as Heat through resistance of the resistive network

;Electric Power Supply
: &lt;math&gt;P_v = I V&lt;/math&gt;

;Electric Power Loss
: &lt;math&gt;P_r = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

;Electric Power Delivered
:&lt;math&gt;P = P_v - P_r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = IV - I^2 R = I (V - IR)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P = IV - \frac{V^2}{R} = V (I - \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Work Done==
: &lt;math&gt;W = P \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;W = F \cdot s&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;W = F \cdot s \cdot \cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;

'''Peas''' are cooked as a vegetable in many cultures. 

==Types of pea==
The immature pea is called the ''garden pea''.  It is sold fresh (usually in the pod), tinned, or frozen.

The mature pea, which dries naturally in the field, is known as the ''marrowfat pea''.  This name is recorded by the OED as early as 1733.  It is grown mainly in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Britain]], but many are exported to the [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Far East]].  One of the oldest export varieties, popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]] for the last hundred years, is called ''Maro''.  This has led some people to assume mistakenly that the English name ''marrowfat'' is derived from Japanese.  In Japan and other Far Eastern countries, such as [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thailand]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]], the peas are roasted and salted, and eaten as snacks.  In the UK, marrowfat peas are used to make pease pudding, a traditional dish.

==Ways of eating peas==

Dried peas are often made into a [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] or simply eaten on their own. Fresh peas are often eaten [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] and flavored with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] as a side dish vegetable. Fresh peas are also used in pot pies, [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]] and [[:Category:Casserole recipes|casseroles]]. Pod peas (particularly sweet varieties called ''mangetout'' and ''sugar peas'') are used in [[Cookbook:Stir-fry|stir fried]] dishes. 

In the UK, dried, rehydrated and mashed marrowfat peas, sold as &quot;processed peas&quot; but usually known by the public as &quot;[[Cookbook:Mushy Peas|mushy peas]]&quot;, are popular, originally in the north of England but now ubiquitously, and especially as an accompaniment to [[Cookbook:Fish and Chips|fish and chips]] or [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]], particularly in &quot;chippies&quot; or fish and chip shops.  [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|Sodium bicarbonate]] is sometimes added to soften the peas.

==Introduction==
&lt;br&gt;
'''TTL''' stands for '''Transistor-Transistor Logic'''. It is the system based on combining transistors in such a way that they can be used for logic gates. Transistors have the capability of becoming parts of very complex devices when combined. An average microprocessor uses upwards of 40 million transistors. Transistors in microprocessors, however, are microscopic as opposed to the discrete components used in consumer electronics and circuitboards.

==The NOT Gate==
The NOT gate works by inverting the input.  The TTL version of the NOT gate contains one transistor, seen below: &lt;br&gt;

:[[Image:Electronics_TTLNOT.PNG]]

When the input, A, is '''high''' (+5V), the base of the transistor is saturated, allowing current to flow from the collector of the transistor to the emitter. Since this is possible, the current does not take the higher resistance path through the output (assuming it has a resistive load attached to it such as an LED). When the input is '''low''' (0V), the current has no choice but to flow out of the inverted A output (the A with the line overtop to indicate it is negated). The two resistors in the circuit are for limiting current as to not destroy the transistor, and sometimes may not even be required depending on the transistor. 


(note: this image is considered *Resistor-Transistor Logic* The proper TTL representation is below.)

[[File:TTL_NOT_gate.svg|left|thumb|TTL Inverter (NOT Gate)]]
To further explain, the NOT gate has been integrated into a circuit by connecting it to a current probe and a battery. When the switch for the input of the not gate is not hit, the current flows in the path indicated by the red diagram below. The current flows through the resistor because the transistor does not conduct when the base is not saturated.:&lt;br&gt;


[[Image:Electronics_TTLNOTPRAC01.PNG]]


However, when the switch is hit, making the input '''high''', the circuit is shorted and current flows directly from one terminal of the battery through the transistor, to the other terminal. This is illustrated further in the next figure:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Electronics_TTLNOTPRAC02.PNG]]
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In real logic gates, several more transistors are used in order to stabilize the input and output. Although this may seem like a large hike in complexity and price, creating transistors in ICs is a lot cheaper and easier to do, as they do not have to even have a shell or casing, and are a lot smaller.

[[Image:KohlrabiinMarket.jpg|thumb|Kohlrabi]]

'''Kohlrabi''' (also '''kohl-rabi''') is a low and stout biennial. It originated in Germany around 4,000 years ago and is a member of the [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] family (Gongylodes group). It is a cabbage that was selected for its swollen stems -- in German 'kohl' is cabbage and 'rabi' is [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]] and it is so called because it has cabbage-like leaves and a turnip-like bulb above ground. 

Varieties include White Vienna and Purple Vienna.  Some varieties are food for cattle.

''Cymbopogon winterianus'' Jowitt  '''Citronella grass'''&lt;br&gt;
''Cymbopogon martini''

'''Lemon grass''' or '''lemongrass''' is a perennial [[Cookbook:Herbs|herb]] used in Asian (particularly [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Thailand|Thai]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Vietnam|Vietnamese]]) and [[Cookbook:Caribbean_cuisines|Caribbean]] cooking.  It has a [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]y flavor and can be dried and powdered, or used fresh.  Commonly used in teas, [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]s, and [[Cookbook:Curry|curries]] it is also suitable for poultry, fish and sea food.

There are over 50 species of ''Cymbopogon''. The East-Indian lemon grass (''Cymbopogon flexuosus'') is native to India, Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand while the West-Indian lemon grass (''Cymbopogon citratus'') is assumed to have its origins in Malaysia. While they both can be used interchangably ''C. citratus'' is more suited for cooking. In India ''C. citratus'' is used both as a medicinal herb and in perfumes.

Other species used in the perfume industry are ''Cymbopogon martini'' distilled into palmarosa oil and '''citronella grass''' (''Cymbopogon winterianus'' Jowitt).

[[Image:Bucket of raw okra pods.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A bucketful of raw okra]]

'''Okra''' is also known as '''lady fingers''', '''gumbo''' and, in [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|south Asia]], as '''bhindi''' (and, less commonly, '''bamia''' and '''bindi'''). [[Cookbook:Gumbo|Gumbo]] is also the name of a stew that usually contains okra.

Okra grows in an elongated, lantern shape [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]]. It is a fuzzy, green, ribbed, fibrous pod. It is usually two to four [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long, but it can grow to fourteen inches long. When cut open on the bias, it has rows of tiny seeds and a slimy or sticky texture.

The seeds of an okra can be toasted, ground, and served as a coffee substitute. Okra is common in [[Cookbook:African cuisines|African]], [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle Eastern]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Turkey|Turkish]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]], [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]], and [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South American cuisines]]. Okra is commonly associated with [[Cookbook:Southern cuisine|US Southern]], Creole, and [[Cookbook:Cajun cuisine|Cajun]] cooking since it was initially introduced into the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] in the US South. Okra is one of the most popular vegetables in late 20th century [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese cuisine]].

Along with [[Cookbook:Roux|roux]], okra is the normal thickening agent in gumbo.

The best okra, like almost all vegetables, is young and fresh right out of the garden. Okra is easy to grow, prolific, and beautiful. Okra is in the hibiscus family, and has very pretty yellow flowers. Okra gets very woody when it gets too mature, so be sure to pick often, even if you stick it in the refrigerator for a few days until you are ready to eat it. Fresh okra should be used the same day that it was purchased or stored paper bag in the warmest part of the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Severe cold temperatures will speed up okra decay.

[[Cookbook:Steaming|Steam]] okra until tender, either whole or sliced about ½ [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] thick. Smother it with [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]. Okra can also be boiled with [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|fried]] in a [[Cookbook:Cornmeal|cornmeal]] [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]]. Okra can be [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]]. Okra is a sensitive vegetable and should not be cooked in pans made of iron, copper or brass since the chemical properties turns okra black.

==Slime==
If you are not fond of the slime characteristic to okra, you can take a few measures: 

* Before cooking the okra, trim off the ends, being careful not to cut so deeply you expose hollow space inside and seeds.
* Avoid washing the okra pods too early before you cook. 
* Do not puncture the okra capsule before or during cooking. 
* Do not overcook the okra. 
* Cook the okra with tomatoes or some other acid.

When my dad makes Bhindi (an indian dish), it is, as you say, slimy.  It is also delicious.  I think that the paragraph on &quot;Slime&quot; is too western a perspective (for an oriental/african food) and should probably be redone.

: looks like some anon put in the slime thing and it was toned down by a bunch of people.  I'm going to change it.

How is okra &quot;less commonly&quot; known as &quot;gumbo&quot;? Last I checked, that's how it's known to quite a large number of people in Louisiana, the Carribean, and Africa. Do we not count? :) [[User:Alainna|Alainna]] 06:11, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Illustration Allium schoenoprasum0.jpg|thumb|right|Chives]]
'''Chives''' (Allium schoenoprasum) are a member of the onion family (Alliaceae) grown for their leaves, which are used as an herb. Chives have a much milder flavor than onions or garlic. They are referred to only in the plural, because they grow in clumps rather than alone.

Chives are chopped raw and typically used for seasoning salads and omelettes, or as a topping for baked potatoes.

'''Daikon''' (&amp;#22823;&amp;#26681;) is a mild-flavored Japanese giant white [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]] usually called ''daikon radish'' in United States supermarkets. Although there are many varieties of daikon, the most common is carrot shaped, approximately 8-14 inches long and 2-4 inches in diameter.

Daikon is an essential part of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese Cuisine]] being used as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]] for many dishes like [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]] or as a simmered vegetable served by itself. Daikon is also commonly grated and served either as a garnish or as an accent in [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]s. Pickled daikon is called takuan (&amp;#27810;&amp;#24245;), and has a bright yellow color.

In Hindi, Daikon is referred to as &quot;mooli&quot;.</text>

[[Image:Lao cuisine rabbit.jpg|right|thumb|Rabbit for scraping flesh from inside coconut]]
All parts of the coconut plant are useful and the trees have a comparatively high yield (up to 75 &quot;nuts&quot; per year). The plant therefore has significant economic value. Indeed in Sanskrit the name for the coconut palm is ''kalpa vriksha'', which translates as &quot;the tree which provides all the necessities of life&quot;. Uses of the various parts of the palm include:

# The white, fleshy part of the seed is edible and used fresh or dried (desiccated) in cooking.
# The cavity is filled with &quot;coconut water&quot; containing sugars which are used as a refreshing drink.
# Coconut milk (approximately 17% fat) is made by processing grated coconut with hot water which extracts the oil and aromatic compounds.
# The sap derived from incising the flower clusters of the coconut form a drink known as &quot;toddy&quot; or, in the Philippines, ''tuba''.
# Apical buds of adult plants are edible and are known as &quot;palm-cabbage&quot;.
# The interior of the growing tip is called heart-of-palm and eaten in salads sometimes called &quot;millionaire's salad&quot;.
# Copra is the dried meat of the seed which is the source of coconut oil.

The most commonly used part of the coconut in cookery is the fruit, which can be either fresh or dried. The coconut flesh is flaked or shredded and dried, then packaged for sale.

:Я студeнт.

This means &quot;I am a student&quot; in Russian.

* &quot;Я&quot; means &quot;I&quot;.
* &quot;студе́нт&quot;, as you may remember from [[Russian/Lesson_1|Lesson 1]], means &quot;student&quot;.
* Russian does not distinguish &quot;''a'' student&quot; from &quot;''the'' student&quot;; that is, it does not use ''articles'' (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;the&quot;).  So the above sentence could also be translated as &quot;I am ''the'' student.&quot;
* Russian does not use the verb ''to be'' in the present tense.  Instead, a dash separates the subject of the sentence from the predicate (but the dash is not put between a ''pronoun'' and a verb).

Examples
{|
| style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot; | You
| style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot; | not
| style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot; | student.
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot; | (&quot;You are not a student.&quot;)
|-
| Ты
| ''не''
| студeнт.
|}

{|
| style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot; | This
| style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot; | boy &amp;ndash;
| style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot; | student.
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot;  | (&quot;This boy is a student.&quot;)
|-
| Этот
| мальчик &amp;ndash;
| студeнт.
|}


Russian has eight personal pronouns altogether:

&lt;!-- not counting the other cases, but trying not to scare the reader --&gt;


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| я (I) || мы (we)
|-
| ты (you, singular) || вы (you, plural)
|-
| он (he), она́ (she), оно́ (it) || они́ (they)
|}

==Grammar vs. vocabulary; &quot;getting by&quot; vs. &quot;good Russian&quot;==
Are you learning Russian to &quot;get by&quot; on a one-week business trip to Moscow? Or do you want to learn &quot;good Russian&quot;? 

To &quot;get by&quot; you need basic grammar, but not the byzantine grammar of &quot;good Russian.&quot; You could treat all nouns as if they were masculine, and all verbs as if you are the person doing the action, and Russians would understand your meaning. But you should read over the many grammar rules so that you have a clue what Russians are saying. E.g., you should be able to recognize when a Russian uses the prepositional case, even if you only use the nominative case.

If you want to marry a Russian, learn good Russian. Russians (and people all over the world) are impressed by good language skills. Note that in English the words &quot;conjugate&quot; (to produce the different forms of a verb) and &quot;conjugal&quot; (relating to marriage) come from the same root word (meaning &quot;to join together&quot;). In other words, Russians think that someone who can say &quot;I study, you study, he studies, she studies, we study, they study&quot; correctly (in Russian) will make a good spouse!

Native speakers learn grammar as children, by listening to adults talk, and being corrected by their peers. A child who reads a lot, and whose parents speak correctly, doesn't need to learn grammar rules. As an adult learning Russian, you'll learn best if a native Russian listens to you and corrects your mistakes. But the grammar rules will act as shortcuts, to help you learn faster.

When learning anything, some people are auditory learners, some are visual, and some are movement learners. (See &quot;The Open Mind,&quot; by Dawna Marcova, for more about this.) But all three learning styles are needed for organizing and committing to long-term memory. You may prefer to hear spoken Russian, or see written Russian, or (for movement learners) write a Russian word and then write how it sounds in English. You may need to do an activity, such as cooking dinner, to pay attention. But all of us need to do all of these things to learn well.

==Gender==
&lt;!-- The following grammar sections should be broken up into additional lessons. --&gt;
You may guess correctly that the correct way to say &quot;''He'' is a student&quot; in Russian is &quot;Он студент.&quot;  However, things change a bit when talking about &quot;она&quot;.  As in many Indo-European languages&amp;mdash;including English until several hundred years ago&amp;mdash;''gender'' is an important feature of Russian grammar.  Every noun, as well as the three third-person singular pronouns, has a characteristic gender: masculine, feminine, or neuter.

Masculine nouns end in a consonant. Remember that й is a consonant.

Feminine nouns end in а or я. 

Neuter nouns end in о or е.

Nouns ending in ь can be masculine or feminine. There's no rule, you just have to memorize these words.

===quiz===
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{Она Арти́стка
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- masculine
+ feminine
- neuter
&lt;/quiz&gt;

&lt;!-- ... студентка ... --&gt;

==Formal and Informal==

Russians differentiate between formal and informal social relationships. Two words translate to &quot;you&quot;: Вы (pronounced &quot;vee&quot; but make it short, don't draw out the vowel) is how you say &quot;you&quot; to a teacher, police officer, etc. Ты (pronounced &quot;tee&quot;) is how you say &quot;you&quot; to a friend or family member. Russians are more formal than Americans, so if in doubt use Вы!

Вы is also &quot;you plural&quot; or &quot;you all.&quot; In other words, you address a superior person as if he or she were several people.

The greeting здравствуйте (formal) and здравствуй (informal) has two forms.

The word &quot;your&quot; also comes in formal and informal: ваш (formal) and твой (informal).

===quiz===
&lt;quiz display=simple&gt;
{Привет ! Меня зовут Андрей. А тебя?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- formal
+ informal


{Здравствуйте! Меня зовут Петя, а Вас?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ formal
- informal
&lt;/quiz&gt;

==Russian names==

Russians use three names: first name, or имя; middle or patronymic name, or отчество, which is their father's first name plus a suffix meaning &quot;son of&quot; (ович) or &quot;daughter of&quot; (овна); and the last name or family name, or фамилия. Women's last names add an а to the masculine form of the name.

To address a Russian formally, don't use &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot; Instead, address the person using his or her first name and patronymic.

Russians use relatively few first names. There are only a dozen or so men's first names, and maybe three dozen women's first names. Creativity in baby-naming isn't encouraged.

Russians also use diminutives or nicknames&amp;#151;lots! Each name typically has a version used by your best friend, another used by your other friends, another used by your teachers, another used by your grandmother, another used when you are scolded, etc.

==Noun Cases==
English uses word order to indicate a sentence's subject and object. E.g., &quot;Bob eats lunch&quot; and &quot;Lunch eats Bob&quot; have different meanings in English. Word order is less important in Russian. Instead, meaning is conveyed by suffixes. It would be like an eaten lunch becoming &quot;lunchoo,&quot; so you could say &quot;Bob eats lunchoo&quot; or &quot;Lunchoo eats Bob,&quot; and still make it clear that it's the lunch that is eaten (not Bob).

This would be straightforward enough if there were simply one case for the subject of a sentence, and a second case for the object of the sentence. Instead, Russian has six cases, conveying such meanings as where you are vs. where you're going, or whether the object of the sentence is animate or inanimate!

===Nominative case===
The primary case, used for the subject of the sentence (&quot;Bob&quot;), is called the nominative case. This is the case you find in dictionaries.

===Accusative case===
&quot;Lunch&quot; is the direct object of &quot;Bob eats lunch.&quot; The direct object is used in the accusative case. Inanimate masculine and neuter nouns in the accusative case are the same as nouns in the nominative case. Feminine nouns change their а or я ending to у or ю, respectively. E.g., &quot;car&quot; is машина (pronounced &quot;masheena&quot;) in nominative case, and машину (pronounced &quot;masheenoo&quot;)in the accusative case.

===Prepositional case===
When a sentence contains a complement of location, the noun is in the prepositional case. In general, you add е (pronounced &quot;yeh&quot;) to end of the word. E.g., &quot;I live in Michigan&quot; becomes &quot;I live in Michigane.&quot; If the word ends in й, а, or я, replace that letter with е. E.g., &quot;She works in Minnesota&quot; becomes &quot;She works in Minnesote.&quot;

There are two exceptions to the е ending. Never write ие, instead write ии (yes, Russians pronounce both, like &quot;ee-ee&quot;). The other exception is foreign nouns ending in о, и, or у. These look the same as the nominative case. E.g., Colorado, Kentucky, and Peru don't change.

Nouns in the prepositional case are always preceded by &quot;in&quot; or &quot;about.&quot; Each word comes in two versions. If &quot;in&quot; is an activity, or a place where an activity is done (for example, the ballet) use на (pronounced &quot;na&quot;). For other places, use в (pronounced &quot;veh&quot; or pronounced with the next word if it starts with a vowel, e.g., &quot;in Atlante&quot; would be &quot;vatlante&quot;). 

&quot;About&quot; is о, or, if the following word starts with a vowel, об. There are several cases when &quot;about&quot; is обо, e.g. обо мне.

====Куда vs. где====
Куда asks &quot;where are [you/he/she/etc.] going?&quot; It's pronounced &quot;koodá.&quot;.

Где asks &quot;where are [you/he/she/etc.]?&quot; I.e., куда is moving, где is static. It's pronounced &quot;gdye,&quot; with the d palatalized.

Statements that could answer the question куда are in the accusative case. E.g., &quot;We're driving to St. Petersburg, Florida&quot; would be in the accusative case, if you said it in Russian.

Statements that could answer the question где are in the prepositional case. E.g., &quot;We live in Moscow, Idaho&quot; would be in the prepositional case. 

This is easy to remember because the vowels in Куда are у and а&amp;#151;nouns that end in а (feminine nouns) change to у in the accusative case. The vowel in где is е, the letter you add to end nouns in the prepositional case.

===Genitive case===

The genitive case is used with numbers. E.g., &quot;I have six chairs&quot; (У меня есть шесть стульев) is plural both in English and in Russian! It's genitive case.

====Genitive nouns====

Masculine and neuter nouns form the genitive case the same way: add а at the end. E.g., стол (sing. table) becomes стола́, but столы́ (pl. tables) becomes столо́в. The exceptions are masculine words ending in й or ь add я. if the word ends in a vowel, drop the vowel then add a.

Feminine nouns drop the а and add ы. E.g., лампа (lamp) becomes лампы. The exceptions are if the word ends in я or ь, or for the 7-letter spelling rule, add и.

====Genitive adjectives====

Masculine and neuter adjectives form the genitive case the same way: change the ending to ого. This is pronounced &quot;ovo&quot;! The exceptions are masculine words ending in й or ь, or for the 5-letter spelling rule with the ending unstressed, change to его (pronounced &quot;yevo&quot;).

Feminine adjectives change the ending to ой (rhymes with &quot;boy&quot;). The exceptions are feminine words ending in й or ь, or for the 5-letter spelling rule with the ending unstressed, change to ей (pronounced &quot;yay&quot;).

====Genitive case of possessive pronouns====

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Nominative&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Genitive&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Meaning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;мой, моё (masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;моег'о &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;my&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;твой, твоё (masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;твоег'о &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;your (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;наш, на́ше (masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;на́шего&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;our&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;ваш, ва́ше (masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ва́шего&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;your (formal, plural)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;моя́ (feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;мое́й&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;my&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;твоя́ (feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;твое́й&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;your (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;на́ша (feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;на́шей&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;our&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;ва́ша (feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ва́шей&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;your (formal, plural)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The possessive pronouns его́, её, and их (his, hers, theirs) never change.

====Genitive case of demonstrative pronouns====

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Nominative&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Genitive&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Meaning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;тот, то (masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;того́&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;that&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;э́то, э́тот (masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;э́того&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;this&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;та (feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;той&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; that &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;э́та (feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;э́той&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;this&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;те (plural)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тех&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; those &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;э́ти (plural)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;э́тих&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;these&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Genitive case of &quot;one&quot; and &quot;third&quot;====

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;Nominative&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Genitive&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Meaning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; оди́н, одно́(masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;одного́&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;one&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; тре́тий, тре́тье(masc., neut.)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тре́тьего&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;third&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; одна́(feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;одно́й&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; one &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; тре́тья(feminine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;тре́тьей&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;third&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====&quot;I have something&quot;====
Genitive case is also used for saying you have something, or you don't have something. To say that you have something, start with У (means &quot;by&quot; or &quot;next to&quot;). Then change the pronoun (я, ты, вы, etc.) to the following:

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Nominative&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Genitive&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Pronounciation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Meaning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;кто&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у кого́&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo kovo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;who&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;я&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у меня́&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo myehnyah&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I have&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ты&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у тебя́&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo tyebyah&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;you have (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;он&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у него́&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;oo nyehvo&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;he has&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;она&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у неё&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo nyehyo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;she has&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;мы&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у нас&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo nas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;we have&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;вы&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у вас&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo vas&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;you have (formal or plural)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;они&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;у них&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;oo neekh&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;they have&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
In many cases, the genitive ого́ ending is irregularly pronounced ovo.

In other words, Russians don't say &quot;Ivan has a dacha,&quot; but rather say &quot;By Ivan is dacha.&quot;

====&quot;No something&quot;====
In Russian, you use genitive instead of nominative with negative word нет ''n'et'' &quot;no&quot; when you want to say that there isn't something or one does not have something. If there is none of it, it can't be the subject, right?
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Positive&lt;th&gt;Negative
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;В городе есть аэропорт.&lt;br/&gt;
''vgorradi yest' aihruhporrt''&lt;br/&gt;
In (the) city there is an airport.
&lt;td&gt;В городе нет аэропорта.&lt;br/&gt;
''vgorradi n'et aihruhporrta''&lt;br/&gt;
In (the) city there is no airport.
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;У меня есть кошка.&lt;br/&gt;
''oo mehn'ah yest' koshka''&lt;br/&gt;
I have a cat.
&lt;td&gt;У меня нет кошки.&lt;br/&gt;
''oo mehn'ah n'et koshki''&lt;br/&gt;
I have no cat.
&lt;/table&gt;

===Dative case===

Dative case is used with the indirect object of a sentence. It is, when people want &quot;to say something to her&quot; or &quot;to give(to sell, to show and etc.) something to him&quot;, etc. (for example: He shows to her this beautiful picture (Он пока́зывает ей э́ту прекра́сную карти́ну). Note here the difference between the direct object from earlier and the indirect object: Ivan gives a &lt;i&gt;letter&lt;/i&gt; (direct object, accusative case) to his &lt;i&gt;sister&lt;/i&gt; (indirect object, dative case; also depending on the vowel. If it is silent or not. But that rarely happens in modern Russian)

&lt;table&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Nominative&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Dative &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Pronounciation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Meaning&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;кто&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ком'у&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;komoo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to whom&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;я&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;мне&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;mnye&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to me&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;ты&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;теб'е&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;tyebye&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to you (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;он&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ем'у&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;yemoo&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;to him&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;она&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;ей&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;yey&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to her&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;мы&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;нам&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;nam*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to us&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;вы&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;вам&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;vam*&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to you (formal or plural)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;они&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;им&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;eem&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;to them&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

* The letter &quot;а&quot; in нам and вам is pronouncing as &quot;U&quot; in pronoun &quot;Us&quot;.

===Instrumental case===

==Russian lacks &quot;a,&quot; &quot;the,&quot; and &quot;to be&quot;==
Russian lacks the articles &quot;a,&quot; &quot;an,&quot; and &quot;the.&quot; English uses the definite article &quot;the&quot; to indicate a specific place, thing, etc.: &quot;I ate the orange&quot; suggests there was only one orange, or it was special or something. English uses the indefinite articles &quot;a&quot; and &quot;an&quot; to indicate that the following noun is not a specific, e.g., &quot;I ate an orange&quot; suggests there were several oranges.

Russian also lacks the verb &quot;to be,&quot; and its conjugations &quot;am,&quot; &quot;are,&quot; and &quot;is.&quot;

Thus the English four-word sentence &quot;I am a student&quot; is just two words in Russian: &quot;Я студент.&quot; In written Russian, when a sentence has two nouns in a row, a &amp;#151; is written between the nouns to indicate the verb &quot;to be.&quot; E.g., &quot;Tanya is a student&quot; translates to &quot;Таня &amp;#151; студентка.&quot;

==&quot;This,&quot; &quot;these,&quot; and &quot;those&quot;==
Russian has the adjectives &quot;this&quot; and &quot;these.&quot; To &quot;get by&quot; in Russian use это (pronounced &quot;eto&quot;) for both &quot;this&quot; (singular) and &quot;these&quot; (plural). To speak &quot;good Russian&quot; it gets confusing. If a word is between &quot;this&quot; (or &quot;these&quot;) and the noun (&quot;This is my suitcase&quot;) then это doesn't change. But if the noun immediately follows &quot;this&quot; or &quot;these&quot; (&quot;This suitcase is mine&quot;) then, if the noun is masculine, это changes to этот (pronounced &quot;etot&quot;) ; if the noun is feminine then это changes to эта (pronounced &quot;eta&quot;) ; if the noun is neuter then это doesn't change; and if the noun is plural (&quot;these&quot;) then  это changes to эти (pronounced &quot;etee&quot;) .

Russian also has the adjective &quot;those&quot;: те. This follows the conjugation for 'that', implying that the noun is in a remote location (not here). Masculine is тот, Feminine is та, Neuter is то, and Plural is те.

===this these and those quiz===
[[Russian Lesson 3 this these and those quiz]]

==Plural nouns==
In English we add &quot;s&quot; (or &quot;es&quot;) to indicate that a noun is plural. Russian isn't so simple.

Masculine nouns ending in a &quot;hard&quot; consonant add '''ы'''. E.g., студент (student) becomes студенты (students).
Masculine nouns ending in the &quot;soft&quot; consonants '''й''' or '''ь''' add '''и'''. E.g., словарь (dictionary) becomes словари (dictionaries).
If you speak Russian (without writing) you can &quot;get by&quot; without learning this distinction, as '''ы''' and '''и''' sound similar.

Feminine nouns ending in '''а''' change the '''а''' to '''ы'''. This is not always the case. Sometimes '''а''' is replaced by '''и''' e.g. '''груша''' → '''груши'''.
Feminine nouns ending in '''я''' change the '''я''' to '''и'''.
Thus masculine and feminine nouns follow a similar pattern for plural. Again, if you only want to speak &quot;get by&quot; Russian you can ignore this distinction because '''a''' and '''я''' sound similar.

Neuter nouns have a different pattern for plural.
Neuter nouns ending in '''o''' change the '''o''' to '''a'''. This is not always the case. Sometimes '''o''' is replaced by '''и''' e.g. '''яблоко''' → '''яблоки'''.
Neuter nouns ending in e change the '''e''' to '''я'''.
Thus, neuter plural nouns look like feminine singular nouns.

Note that these rules are for plural nouns. Plural adjectives follow different rules.

===The 7-letter spelling rule===
Now it gets complicated.
After the letters '''к''', '''г''', '''х''', '''ш''', '''щ''', '''ж''', and '''ч''', always add (or change '''a''' or '''я''' to) '''и''', not '''ы'''. E.g., книга (book) becomes книги (books).

===Exceptional plurals===

Some masculine nouns drop the last vowel before adding '''ы''' or '''и'''. E.g., подарок (present or gift) becomes подарки.

Some masculine nouns add '''a''' for plural. E.g., дом (house) becomes дома (houses).

Words of foreign origin ending in '''o''', '''и''', or '''у''' don't change between singular and plural. E.g., радио means &quot;radio&quot; or &quot;radios.&quot; Note that foreign nouns with these endings also don't change in prepositional case (e.g., Colorado, Kentucky, and Peru).

==The personal pronouns &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; and &quot;it&quot;==
The personal pronouns are straightforward:

&quot;He&quot; (masculine) is он.

&quot;She&quot; (feminine) is она.

&quot;It&quot; (neuter) is оно.

&quot;They&quot; (plural) is они.

Note that in English we use &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; for animate objects (people and animals) and &quot;it&quot; for everything else, but Russians use &quot;he&quot; for all masculine nouns, &quot;she&quot; for all feminine nouns, and &quot;it&quot; for all neuter nouns. Thus, a car (машина) is always &quot;she&quot; because машина is feminine.

==&quot;Whose?&quot;==
The English question word &quot;whose&quot; translates to four Russian words, depending on gender:

чей (pronounced &quot;chey&quot;) is masculine.

чья (pronounced &quot;chyah&quot;) is feminine.

чьё (pronounced &quot;chyo&quot;) is neuter.

чьи (pronounced &quot;chyee&quot;) is plural.

If you just want to &quot;get by,&quot; say &quot;chee&quot; and you'll be right about 50% of the time.

==The possessive pronouns &quot;my,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; &quot;his,&quot; &quot;her,&quot; and &quot;their&quot;==

To learn to conjugate verbs as well as possessive pronouns, memorize the following order of pronouns:

я (I)
ты (you, informal)
он/она (he/she)
мы (we)
вы (you, formal and plural)
они (they)

In this order, in English the possessive pronouns are &quot;my, your, his, her, our, (no formal your), their.&quot; Russian makes this complicated because four of these words change depending on whether the following noun is masculine, feminine, neuter, or plural. Three don't change.

The three possessive pronouns that don't change are &quot;his,&quot; &quot;her,&quot; and &quot;their.&quot; In Russian these are его (&quot;his&quot;), pronounced &quot;yehvo&quot; (not &quot;yehgo&quot;); её, pronounced &quot;yehyo&quot; (&quot;her yo-yo&quot; would sound like &quot;yeh-yo yo-yo&quot;); and их (pronounced &quot;eech,&quot; like the German word for &quot;I&quot;).

The four possessive pronouns that change are &quot;my,&quot; &quot;your&quot; (informal and formal), and &quot;our.&quot;

&quot;My&quot; is мой (masculine, pronounced &quot;moy,&quot; which sounds vaguely like a New York Yiddish version of &quot;my&quot;); моя (feminine, pronounced &quot;mo-yah&quot;); моё (neuter, pronounced &quot;mo-yo&quot;), and мои (plural, pronounced &quot;mo-ee&quot;).

&quot;Your&quot; (informal Ты) is твой (masculine, pronounced &quot;tvoy&quot;); твоя (feminine, pronounced &quot;tvo-yah&quot;); твоё (neuter, pronounced &quot;tvo-yo&quot;), and твои (plural, pronounced &quot;tvo-ee&quot;).

&quot;Our&quot; (Мы) is наш (masculine, pronounced &quot;nash,&quot; not like &quot;Nashville&quot; but rhymes with &quot;wash&quot;); наша (feminine, pronounced &quot;nasha&quot;); наше (neuter, pronounced &quot;nashyeh&quot;), and наши (plural, pronounced &quot;nashee&quot;).

&quot;Your&quot; (formal Вы) is ваш (masculine, pronounced &quot;vash&quot;, rhymes with &quot;wash&quot;); ваша (feminine, pronounced &quot;vasha&quot;); ваше (neuter, pronounced &quot;vash-yeh&quot;), and ваши (plural, pronounced &quot;vashee&quot;). A memory aid is &quot;your car is a washing machine.&quot; Picture opening the hood of a car and finding a washing machine where the engine should be. &quot;Your car&quot; is ваша машина (sounds like &quot;washing machine&quot;).

==Adjective endings (nominative case)==
Russian adjectives agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case. Here we will learn the adjective endings for gender and number (singular vs. plural). (Cases will be later.)

The dictionary form of adjectives end in ый (pronounced &quot;ee&quot;). This is the ending with masculine nouns. E.g., &quot;new pencil&quot; is новый карандаш (pronounced &quot;no-vee karandash&quot;).

With feminine nouns, the adjective ends in ая. E.g., &quot;new car&quot; is новая машина (pronounced &quot;no-vah-yah masheena&quot;).

With neuter nouns, the adjective ends in ое. E.g., &quot;new dress&quot; is новое платье (pronounced &quot;no-vo-yeh plat-yeh&quot;). As a memory aid, think of &quot;oh yeah.&quot;

With plural nouns, the adjective ends in ые. E.g., &quot;new students&quot; is новые студенты (pronounced &quot;no-vih-yeh studentih&quot;). As a memory aid, think of plural as one masculine and one neuter object. Take the first letter from the masculine ending (ы) and the second letter from the neuter ending (е) and you get ые.

Adjectives with &quot;soft endings&quot; (й or ь) have the same second letter in their' endings, but the first letter of the endings change. The masculine ending ый becomes ий, the feminine ending ая becomes яя, the neuter ending ое becomes ее (like the &quot;yeah-yeah&quot; chorus of 1965 Beatles songs), and the plural ending ые becomes ие (maintaining the memory aid that you take a masculine object and a neuter object to get two objects).

===5- and 7-letter spelling rules===
Recall that with plurals, after the letters г, ж, к, х, ч, ш, and щ, you use и, not ы. This 7-letter spelling rule also applies to adjectives. As a memory aid, ч, ш, and щ are together in the alphabet.

The 5-letter spelling rule is that after the letters ж, ц, ч, ш, and щ, don't write an unstressed o, but instead write e. As a memory aid, ц, ч, ш, and щ are together in the alphabet.

==&quot;What?&quot; and &quot;which?&quot;==
Что (pronounced &quot;shto,&quot; not &quot;chto&quot;) and какой both mean &quot;what.&quot; As a loose rule, какой means &quot;which.&quot; The correct rule is that if a noun follows &quot;what,&quot; use какой. If no noun follows &quot;what,&quot; use что.

As a memory aid, the following noun's gender and number change какой. Какой precedes masculine nouns, какая precedes feminine nouns, какое precedes neuter nouns, and какие precedes plural nouns. Because что does not modify nouns, it does not change according to gender.

If you just want to &quot;get by,&quot; always use что for &quot;what.&quot;

==Showing Ownership==
In English, &quot;my&quot; and &quot;I have&quot; are different, just as &quot;your&quot; and &quot;you have&quot; are different. Russian makes a similar distinction&amp;#151;but it's more complicated.

First, the pronoun is in the genitive case (меня, тебя etc.), which indicates possession/ownership. The preposition used with the genitive pronouns to indicate ownership is У (pronounced &quot;oo&quot;), meaning roughly &quot;with&quot;.

The forms are as follows:

&quot;I have&quot;: У меня (pronounced &quot;oo meen-yah&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;with me&quot;)

&quot;You have&quot; (informal): У тебя (pronounced &quot;oo teeb-yah&quot;, meaning roughly &quot;with you&quot;)

&quot;You have&quot; (formal): у вас (pronounced &quot;oo vas&quot;)

&quot;He has&quot;: у него (pronounced &quot;oo nee-go&quot;, meaning &quot;with him&quot;)

&quot;She has&quot;: у неё (pronounced &quot;oo nee-yo&quot;, meaning &quot;with her&quot;)

&quot;We have&quot;: у нас (pronounced &quot;oo nas&quot;, meaning &quot;with us&quot;)

&quot;They have&quot;: у них (pronounced &quot;oo neech&quot;, meaning &quot;with them&quot;)


Thus the question &quot;У тебя есть карандаш?&quot; when interpreted rather literally, means &quot;With you is a pencil?&quot; It is easy to see how this can be correctly interpreted as &quot;Do you have a pencil (with you)?&quot; or even just &quot;Do you own a pencil?&quot;

These three phrases are sometimes followed by есть (pronounced &quot;yehst&quot;, meaning &quot;is&quot;). Есть questions the existance of something, e.g.,  У вас есть синий костюм? (&quot;Do you have a blue suit?&quot;).

==Verb conjugation, present tense==

In English we say, &quot;I study,&quot; &quot;you study,&quot; &quot;he studies,&quot; &quot;she studies,&quot; &quot;we study,&quot; &quot;they study.&quot; Note that some pronouns use &quot;study,&quot; while other pronouns use &quot;studies.&quot; &quot;Verb conjugation&quot; is how verbs change with pronouns. English has simple two-form verb conjugation for the present tense.

Russian verbs conjugate in six forms, for &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you (singular and informal)&quot;, &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;you (plural and formal singular)&quot; and &quot;they&quot;. In addition, Russian verbs conjugate in either of two ways. In other words, some verbs are first conjugation, when others are second conjugation.

All verbs have an infinitive form, which is listed in dictionaries. Typically this form ends in -ть.

First-conjugation verbs usually end in something other than -ить (e.g. in -ать). These verbs conjugate by dropping the ть and replacing it with the following endings:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;я&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;I&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ю or у&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;чит'аю (&quot;read,&quot; pronounced &quot;cheet-a-you&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;жив'у (&quot;live,&quot; pronounced &quot;zheevoo&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ты&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;you&quot; (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ешь or ёшь&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;чит'аешь (&quot;read,&quot; pronounced &quot;cheet-a-yesh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;живёшь (&quot;live,&quot; pronounced &quot;zheevyosh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;он/она&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;he,&quot; &quot;she&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ет or ёт&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;чит'ает (&quot;reads,&quot; pronounced &quot;cheet-a-yet&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;живёт (&quot;live,&quot; pronounced &quot;zheevyot&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;мы&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;we&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ем or ём&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;чит'аем (&quot;read,&quot; pronounced &quot;cheet-a-yem&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; живём (&quot;live,&quot; pronounced &quot;zheevyom&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;вы&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;you&quot; (formal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ете or ёте&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;чит'аете (&quot;read,&quot; pronounced &quot;cheet-a-yehta&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; живёте (&quot;live,&quot; pronounced &quot;zheevyota&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;они&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;they&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ют or ут&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;чит'ают (&quot;read,&quot; pronounced &quot;cheet-a-yout&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; жив'ут (&quot;live,&quot; pronounced &quot;zheevoot&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Second-conjugation verbs usually end in -ить. These verbs conjugate by dropping the -ть and replacing it with the following endings:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;я&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;I&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ю&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;говор'ю (&quot;talk,&quot; pronounced &quot;govor-you&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ты&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;you&quot; (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ишь&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;говор'ишь (&quot;talk,&quot; pronounced &quot;govor-eesh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;он/она&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;he,&quot; &quot;she&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ит&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;говор'ит (&quot;talks,&quot; pronounced &quot;govor-eet&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;мы&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;we&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;им&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;говор'им (&quot;talk,&quot; pronounced &quot;govor-eem&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;вы&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;you&quot; (formal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ите&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;говор'ите (&quot;talk,&quot; pronounced &quot;govor-eetyeh&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;они&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;they&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ят&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; говор'ят (&quot;talk,&quot; pronounced &quot;govor-yat&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Verb conjugation, past tense==

Past tense verbs are somewhat simpler. They conjugate with the gender (or number) of the pronoun. Thus, &quot;I understood&quot; changes depending on whether the speaker is a man or a woman. But the verb is the same for &quot;he understood&quot; or for &quot;I understood,&quot; where the speaker is a man. &quot;We understood&quot; and &quot;they understood&quot; are the same.

To form a past tense verb, drop the ть and add л (pronounced &quot;l&quot;) for masculine pronouns (&quot;I,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; &quot;he&quot;), ла (pronounced &quot;la&quot;) for feminine pronouns (&quot;I,&quot; &quot;you,&quot; &quot;she&quot;), and ли (pronounced &quot;lee&quot;) for plural pronouns (мы, они, &quot;we,&quot; &quot;they&quot;). (Neuter subjects can't talk.)

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Masculine pronoun&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;л&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;понимал (&quot;understood,&quot; pronounced &quot;poneemal&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Feminine pronoun&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;ла&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;понимала (&quot;understood,&quot; pronounced &quot;poneemala&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Plural pronoun&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;ли&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;понимали (&quot;understood,&quot; pronounced &quot;poneemalee&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Verb conjugation, future tense==

Russian future tense is incredibly more complex in meaning than English future tense.  Russian future tense also contains information pertaining to the [[w:Grammatical aspect|aspect]] of the verb.  

'''Imperfective Aspect'''

The simplest, and imperfective aspect of a verb can be attained by the use of the verb &quot;быть.&quot;  By placing the correct form of &quot;быть,&quot; in front of a Russian infinitive, you can create a verb in imperfective future tense.

Form будь is imperative of to be, but in this case it roughly means &quot;will&quot;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;я бу́ду&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;мы бу́дем&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;ты бу́дешь&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;вы бу́дете&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;он/она́/оно́ бу́дет&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;они́ бу́дут&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Can you decipher these?

* Я буду играть.
* Ты будешь говорить.

As an FYI, the imperfective aspect in Russian refers to a habitual action that we would not go out of our way to delineate. While &quot;Я играю в игру&quot; (I am playing the game) shows current action in a way not unlike Еnglish, &quot;Я играла в игру&quot; (I played-feminine the game) relates a habitual action to the playing of the game in the past.  English leaves this ambiguous.

'''Perfective aspect'''
For perfective aspect verbs, just use the table above for present tence endings, and you will get future tence (do you remember that perfective verbs have no present tence?) E.g. заиграть 'to begin playing' - я заиграю 'I shall begin to play'.

==Prepositional case adjectives==
Recall that the prepositional case is used when the object of a sentence is a location. Earlier you learned how to modify nouns (usually by adding е).

Russian adjectives must agree with their following noun in gender, number, and case. 

With a masculine noun in the prepositional case, a preceding adjective usually ends in ом. The ending is ем for the 5-letter spelling rule, and for soft-ending (й or ь) adjectives.

With a feminine noun in the prepositional case, a preceding adjective usually ends in ой (pronounced &quot;oy&quot;). The ending is ей (pronounced (&quot;yee&quot;) for the 5-letter spelling rule, and for soft-ending (й or ь) adjectives.

===Prepositional case plural adjectives and nouns===

With a plural noun in the prepositional case, a preceding adjective usually ends in ых (pronounced &quot;eeh&quot;). The ending is их (pronounced (&quot;ih&quot;) for the 7-letter spelling rule, and for soft-ending (й or ь) adjectives.

Plural nouns in the prepositional case usually end in ах (pronounced &quot;ach&quot;). The ending is ях (pronounced (&quot;yach&quot;) for soft-ending (й or ь) nouns.

===Prepositional case personal pronouns===
The personal pronouns change (considerably!) in the prepositional case. 

Я (&quot;I&quot;) becomes обо мне (pronounced &quot;obo mnyeh&quot;). 

Ты (&quot;you&quot; informal) becomes о тебе (pronounced &quot;o tyehbyeh&quot;). 

Он (&quot;he&quot;) becomes о нём (pronounced &quot;o nyom&quot;). 

Она (&quot;she&quot;) becomes о ней (pronounced &quot;o nyee&quot;). 

Мы (&quot;we&quot;) becomes о нас (pronounced &quot;o nas&quot;). 

Вы (&quot;you&quot; formal) becomes о вас (pronounced &quot;o vas&quot;). 

Они (&quot;they&quot;) becomes о них (pronounced &quot;o neech&quot;).

===Prepositional case possessive pronouns===
If the object possessed is masculine or neuter, use the following possessive pronouns: моём (&quot;my&quot;), твоём (&quot;your&quot; informal), нашем (&quot;our'), вашем (&quot;your&quot; formal), чьём (&quot;whose?&quot;), этом (&quot;this&quot;).

If the object possessed is feminine, use the following possessive pronouns: моей (&quot;my&quot;), твоей (&quot;your&quot; informal), нашей (&quot;our'), вашей (&quot;your&quot; formal), чьей (&quot;whose?&quot;), этой (&quot;this&quot;).

If the objects possessed are plural, use the following possessive pronouns: моих (&quot;my&quot;), твоих (&quot;your&quot; informal), наших (&quot;our'), ваших (&quot;your&quot; formal), чьих (&quot;whose?&quot;), этих (&quot;this&quot;).

(Russian schools teach all that to second-graders! Now you understand why Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union the &quot;evil empire&quot;!)

===Prepositional case question words===
Some question words change in the prepositional case. Что (&quot;what,&quot; pronounced &quot;shto&quot;) changes to о чём (pronounced &quot;o chyom&quot;). Кто (&quot;who,&quot; pronounced &quot;kto&quot;) changes to о ком.

==Conjunctions: &quot;and,&quot; &quot;yes but,&quot; and &quot;but&quot;==
Let's do something simpler. 

И (pronounced &quot;ee&quot;) means &quot;and.&quot;

А (pronounced &quot;ah&quot;) means &quot;yes, but.&quot;

Но (pronounced &quot;no&quot;) means &quot;but.&quot;

==Reflexive verbs==
In English we add &quot;self&quot; to a pronoun to indicate reflexive action. E.g., &quot;I wash myself&quot; is different from &quot;I wash my dog.&quot; In Russian, reflexive action is in the verb, not in the pronoun. E.g., a Russian would say something like &quot;I washself.&quot;

This reflexive action is indicated by the suffix ся added to the verb, if the verb ends in a consonant. But if the verb ends in a vowel you instead add сь. Note that the former adds a syllable but the latter doesn't!

The verb учиться means &quot;study&quot; (pronounced &quot;oo-cheet-syah&quot;). The verb conjugates:

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;я&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;I&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; учусь (pronounced &quot;oochoos&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ты&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;you&quot; (informal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; учишься (pronounced &quot;oocheesh-syah&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;он/она&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;he,&quot; &quot;she&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; учится (pronounced &quot;oocheet-syah&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;мы&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;we&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; учимся (pronounced &quot;oocheem-syah&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;вы&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;you&quot; (formal)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; учитесь (pronounced &quot;oocheetyes&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;они&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&quot;they&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; учатся (pronounced &quot;oochat-syah&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Three words for &quot;study&quot;==
Russia has three words that translate to &quot;study.&quot; (You can imagine that Russians must study three times harder than Americans to learn language skills!)

Учиться (pronounced &quot;oo-cheet-syah&quot;) usually refers to where you go to school, e.g., &quot;I go to Harvard University.&quot; As a memory aid, picture that Russians students cheat.

Изучать (pronounced &quot;ee-zoo-chat&quot;) usually refers to the subject you study, e.g., &quot;I study physics.&quot; As a memory aid, think that the zoo is where you study subjects such as monkeys, elephants, etc.

заниматься (pronounced &quot;zan-ee-mat-syah&quot;) usually refers to doing homework, e.g., &quot;I'm studying at the library.&quot; As a memory aid, think that your &quot;zany mother makes you do your homework.&quot;

There is also a fourth verb, готовиться (perf. подготовиться), which means to prepare yourself, in this case to study for something, e.g. an exam. This is used with the preposition к + dative case. Например: Я готовлюсь к экзамену по русскому языку.

==Two words for &quot;also&quot;==
Russian has two words that translate to &quot;also.&quot; 

Тоже (pronounced &quot;to-zheh&quot;) means that two people are doing the same thing (e.g., &quot;I'm a student and my sister is also a student&quot;). 

Также (pronounced &quot;takzheh&quot;) means that one person does two different things (e.g., &quot;I'm a student and I also work part-time&quot;).

As a memory aid, picture that Emperor Tojo of Japan is also the emperor of Russia. He has a reclusive brother Takzhye who only does things by himself.

==Going by foot, by car, and going regularly==
Russian has three words that translate to &quot;going.&quot;

Идти (pronounced &quot;eed-tee&quot;) means to go by foot. As a memory aid, think the conjugation он идёт (&quot;he walks,&quot; pronounced &quot;on eed-dyot&quot;) which sounds like &quot;he's an idiot to walk (with the traffic so dangerous).&quot;

ехать (pronounced &quot;ee-hot&quot;) means to go by car, bus, etc. Note that conjugations are еду, едешь, едет, едем, едете, едут&amp;#151;none have the х!

ходить (pronounced &quot;hod-deet&quot;) means to go back and forth habitually, e.g., &quot;I go to school every day.&quot; As a memory aid, think of hod carriers going back and forth up and down ladders (a hod carrier carries morter to a bricklayer).

==Necessity and freedom==
&quot;I have to&quot; translates to я должен (pronounced &quot;dol-zhen,&quot; sort of like &quot;dolphin&quot;)&amp;#151;if the subject is masculine! If the subject is feminine, it's должна. If the subject is neuter, it's должно. If the subject is plural, it's должны.

Remember that &quot;have to&quot; is an adjective, not a verb! Don't try to conjugate it as a verb.

The opposite of &quot;have to&quot; is freedom. E.g., &quot;I'm free this evening&quot; means there's nothing you have to do. The adjectives are свободен (masculine, pronounced &quot;sva-bod-den&quot;), свободна (feminine, pronounced &quot;sva-bod-na&quot;), свободно (neuter, pronounced &quot;sva-bod-no&quot;) and свободны (plural, pronounced &quot;sva-bod-nih&quot;).

Note that вы (&quot;you&quot; formal, and &quot;y'all&quot;) uses the plural forms, regardless of the gender of the person you're addressing.

Note that кто (&quot;who&quot;) uses the masculine form, regardless of the gender of the person you're asking about

Guinea Pigs (also called cavies after their scientific name) are rodents belonging to the family Caviidae and the genus Cavia. Despite their common name, the animals are not pigs, nor do they come from Guinea. Male guinea pigs are called ''boars'', females ''sows'' and babies are called ''pups''. They are originally native to the Andes, and while they are no longer extant in the wild, they are closely related to several species which are commonly found in the grassy plains and plateaus of this region. The guinea pig plays an important role in the folk culture of indigenous South Americans, especially as a food source, but also in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies. Since the 1960s, the guinea pig has become increasingly important as a staple food in the Andes, and efforts have been made to increase consumption of the animal outside South America. See the [[Cookbook:Guinea Pig|cookbook entry]] for links to recipes.

In Western societies, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the sixteenth century. Because of its docile nature, the relative ease of caretaking, and its responsiveness to handling and feeding, the guinea pig remains a popular pet choice. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and a large number of specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders. 

==Choosing a Guinea Pig==
[[Image:Rene_the_long-haired_Satin_Peruvian_Guinea_pig.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A long-haired cavy such as this Peruvian may be cute, but it takes extensive daily grooming to keep them healthy and happy.]]
Taking care in choosing your guinea pig and its possible companions is the first, and possibly the most important, step in keeping guinea pigs. Make sure your guinea pigs are either of the same sex or neutered/spayed.

===Health===
As prey animals, guinea pigs have evolved to hide any signs of illness, as long as possible in order to avoid becoming the main targets of the dangerous predation. This can make it difficult to recognize an illness or ailment. The best way to check for them is to place the cavy carefully on its back and check the belly. Their feet should be clean-looking and not red or irritated; with no broken or extraordinarily long nails. Check their teeth for length and evenness (see section below). It is also important to check their eyes and nose, to make sure that there is no mucus or crust there. These are signs of an upper respiratory infection, or URI, and can be deadly if left untreated.

===Breed===
The most common kinds of guinea pig (especially in pet stores) are the short-haired &quot;American&quot; or &quot;Self&quot; breed and the &quot;Abyssinian&quot;, which has curly, cow-licked hair. Long-haired guinea pigs (the Sheltie/Silky and Peruvian breeds) are very beautiful pets, but they need daily grooming to be healthy, thus making them not usually suitable for children.  The hair near the rear of the Guinea Pig must be cut and cleaned on a regular basis, or it will get caked with feces and the bedding from the cage.  Short hair guinea pigs take less effort in the hygienic and cosmetic categories, but still need to be properly cared for. Therefore, the Peruvian guinea pig breed is the most difficult breed to care for due to the long hair. It gets tangled extremely easily, and is not recommended for anyone without extensive time to care for the cavy's hair every day.

===How many?===
The vast majority of rescues, knowledgeable vets, household breeders and scientists will tell you that guinea pigs should be housed in groups of two or more. Not only is making sure your guinea pigs have companions important for their health and happiness, keeping multiple guinea pigs will improve the fun of having these animals as pets as you watch them interact. In practice, the best option is usually a pair of guinea pigs. Of course, the most important factor in choosing groups is to make sure you will not have any unwanted babies, so make sure your pets are either of the same gender or spayed/neutered. If you are not confident in sexing guinea pigs, buy/adopt whatever guinea pigs you so desire, and then take it to your vet or a cavy-specific rescue to have its gender confirmed ''before introducing them at all''. [[Image:Nibbles and strips 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A pair of Abyssinian guinea pigs]]While groups of boars might get along (provided no females are present and they are carefully introduced), and groups of females are often fine, the easiest combination is one neutered boar (neutering is cheaper and safer than spaying) and one or more females. The personality of individual guinea pigs varies; with some being very amicable to company and others incapable of showing anything but hostility to other cavies.

==Behavior==
Guinea pigs are active during the day, but are actually crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk). Guinea pigs are very gentle, and even untamed guinea pigs will not bite unless you are causing them pain or they have been abused in the past.

Guinea pigs have a poor sense of sight, but well-developed senses of hearing and smell. Vocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species.

* '''Wheek''' - A loud noise that is essentially onomatopoeic, also known as a '''Whistle'''.  An expression of general excitement, it may occur in response to the presence of its owner or to feeding. It is sometimes used to find other guinea pigs if they are running. If a guinea pig is lost, it may wheek for assistance. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Feeding_Wheek.ogg|listen}}
* '''Bubbling''' or '''Purring''' - This sound is made when the guinea pig is enjoying itself, such as when being petted or held. They may also make this sound when grooming, crawling around to investigate a new place, or when given food. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Happy.ogg|listen}}‎ 
* '''Rumbling''' - This sound is normally related to dominance within a group, though it can also come as a response to comfort or contentment. While courting, a male usually purrs deeply, while swaying from side to side and circling the female. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Keep_Away.ogg‎|listen}}
* '''Chutting''' and '''Whining''' - These are sounds made in pursuit situations, by the pursuer and pursued, respectively. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Angry.ogg‎|listen}}
* '''Chattering''' - This sound is made by rapidly gnashing the teeth together, and is generally a sign of warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.
* '''Squealing''' or '''Shrieking''' - A high-pitched sound of discontent, in response to pain or danger. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_In_Distress.ogg‎‎|listen}}
* '''Chirping''' - This less-common sound seems to be related to stress. {{Audio|Guinea_Pig_Chirping.ogg‎|listen}}

==The Cage or Living Environment==
While some older guinea pig resources may say that housing them outdoors is acceptable, this is simply not the case. Wind can blow a hutch over easily; it is also the perfect place for molds to grow. Spiders and insects may bite guinea pigs left outside. There is also no guarantee that temperatures will be acceptable for your guinea pigs to live in. It is also very hard to notice signs of disease in guinea pigs  if they are constantly out of sight, and out of mind. Even indoors, sudden drafts or radical shifts in temperature may adversely affect the health of your guinea pig. Outdoors, guinea pigs may still be subject to predators such as raccoons, opossums, birds of prey and cats. Even a guinea pig physically protected from a predator may suffer from the ill effects of stress from the presence of a predator. Guinea pigs in the Andean region of South America are often kept outside on roofs or in milk crates. But these are livestock, not pets. A pet guinea pig is a member of your family and will benefit from the most interaction available. Being inside your home will make it easier and more appealing to care for and play with your guinea pig. Additionally, most secure hutches are designed for rabbits, and as such have mostly wood or wire floors that are unsuitable for guinea pigs. These wire floors are extremely painful for rabbits and cavies alike, and will damage their delicate feet. 

Indoor housing can consist of a large cage, with a plastic base (not metal mesh, this can damage the guinea pig's feet; wood will soak up urine permanently) and a large metal top half. As guinea pigs are not climbers, a top is only absolutely necessary if other pets are present in the house. A pet store cage is nowhere near adequate size for a happy guinea pig, and will cost in upwards of $45-50. The minimum size cage for 1-2 guinea pigs is 7.5 square feet. A good cheap option is buying or making a &quot;C&amp;C&quot; cage made of metal mesh cubes (the organizer kind with small plastic connectors, for the outside) and Coroplast (the floor and walls) which is basically plastic cardboard you can buy at any sign store for a very low price.  There are instructions at [http://www.cavycages.com Cavy Cages] 

===Bedding===
The housing should be lined with bedding at a minimum of 1 inch deep, ideally deeper in the sleeping areas. You should never use softwoods such as pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these emit harmful odors called phenols that cause your guinea pig respiratory problems. Hardwoods such as aspen are fine. Other options for bedding are recycled paper products such as Carefresh; these are more expensive, but also stay clean for longer than shavings and are easier on a guinea pig's feet. A cage needs to be cleaned generally every week at the very minimum, but more often as needed. 

A newer form of guinea pig bedding is polar or anti-pill fleece. While this may seem strange at first, it is a very hygienic and cost-effective form of bedding. First, an absorbent layer must be in the bottom of the cage, because the function of fleece is to wick the urine away from the guinea pigs' feet. Most fleece users are happy to use 1-2 layers of towels on the bottom of their cage, topped with a single layer of fleece. So, when a guinea pig urinates on fleece bedding, the urine is wicked through the fleece and into the towels, where it is absorbed. Fleece needs to be washed at least once weekly, '''without''' fabric softener; it inhibits the fleece's ability to wick urine. It is also a good idea to wash it with an unscented detergent, and some white vinegar to absorb odors. For more information on using fleece as a bedding, please visit [http://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/fleece/21568-fleece-project-study.html]

===Other essential accessories===
Other items needed for your guinea pig's home will be a gravity-fed water bottle (cavies tend to spill and defecate in water bowls), a small bowl for pellets and other food, and &quot;hidey houses&quot;. Wild cavy species and feral guinea pigs naturally use dens made by other animals, and all domestic guinea pigs should be provided a safe place to hide in. As they are prey animals, they will feel much more secure in their environments if they have places to hide. This can be a plastic &quot;igloo&quot; or wood house from a pet store, or simply a towel tent. Be aware that some cardboard is put together using glues that can be harmful to your guinea pig, so it is best to avoid these if you can. If you have more than one guinea pig, having both an entrance and an exit to any hiding places can prevent fights between cornered guinea pigs. The more hiding places, the merrier! It is also better for your guinea pigs to keep borders around the cage clear, so that they can run laps.

===Toys===
Unlike hamsters or rats, guinea pigs don't need fancy toys such as  running balls or exercise wheels. Wheels and balls may have a picture of a guinea pig on the box, but you should not buy one for them to play with. A cavy's spine (and other bones) is much more fragile than other pet rodents, its feet are too soft, the balls are not properly ventilated for a larger animal such as a cavy.  Mostly they like simple things like cardboard shoe boxes, towel tents, oatmeal tubes, paper bags and other tunnels or places to hide and chew on. Some owners give bird toys, but chewing the plastic is very bad for guinea pigs. Mirrors can be hung from outside the cage, however.

An item that is very dangerous and should be avoided is a guinea pig leash. Guinea pigs cannot be trained to walk, and it shouldn't be attempted. While this may seem like a good way to let them run about the yard safely, it is merely dangerous. They have very delicate spines and bones, which are easily damaged by a leash or harness.  

An alternative way to get fresh air and fresh grass is an outdoor pen, but it should be used when you will be outside with the guinea pig the entire time. It is good to place their igloo/hut in there with them so if they become startled, they can hide. The igloo/hut will not suffice for sun protection, however, as it will keep in too much heat. You must be careful where you place the pen and must stay with the guinea pig at all times while they are outside in it. Also, it should be noted that if a guinea pig is to be outside, the grass it will be on cannot have had any pesticides or fertilizers on it. These chemicals will kill your guinea pig, and are very dangerous.

==Food==
[[File:Hausmeerschweine bunt.jpg|thumb|left|A guinea pig trio enjoying some dandelion leaves]]
A guinea pig's diet should be comprised of three basic groups; grass hay, pellets, and fresh treats. Most importantly, a guinea pig cannot make their Vitamin C (just like people) and will need it either in vitamin supplements (not droplets, these don't work as the C dissolves too rapidly in water) or in plenty of the right fruits and veggies. Of course, every guinea pig needs a water bottle (they tend to poop in water bowls, and it could get very unhealthy).

;Pellets
You should give one adult guinea pig approximately 1/8 cup pellets every day, possibly more for young ones. Pellets should be Timothy hay-based (little green ones), and not a seed mix. They can easily choke on seeds, and seeds are too fatty. Alfalfa-based hay pellets have too much calcium, and should not be fed for guinea pigs over 6 months of age.

;Hay
Providing your guinea pig as much Timothy hay or orchard grass as it can eat is very important for its health and happiness. Hay provides important digestive fiber and can prevent a condition in older boars where they lose the ability to defecate properly. Also, guinea pigs have a natural inclination to forage for food almost constantly, not giving them proper hay can cause them stress and result in barbering (chewing their own hair) and other behavioral problems. Alfalfa hay can be fed to guinea pigs younger than 6 months, but should not be fed to older guinea pigs other than the occasional treat. If you do not know the age of your guinea pig, or are unsure, use a different hay that is safe.

;Fruits and vegetables
If you ever have a question about whether your guinea pig can eat a certain vegetable or fruit, and in which quantities, please visit this link: [http://www.guineapigcages.com/forum/diet-nutrition/22156-read-me-cavy-nutrition-charts-poisonous-plants-list.html] . It was made by a guinea pig dietary specialist, and is very helpful!

Guinea pigs like to eat lots of green veg, and on the whole this is very good for them, but there are a few things that should be left off your pets menu. Iceberg Lettuce causes bloat and gas, and so should be avoided, no exception. Tomato leaves are also not good for piggies. Carrot in excess can cause liver problems due to the excessive amounts of vitamin A, and in the pregnant cavy can cause birth defects. However, in small amounts to a non pregnant guinea pig, this is fine. Mushrooms and Rhubarb are poisonous. The best fruits and veggies for Vitamin C are Romaine lettuce, Carrot, Kale, Mustard greens, Red bell pepper, Spinach and many others. Oddly, oranges do not have very much vitamin C and can even cause the runs in guinea pigs. They need 10-20 MG of Vitamin C a day if they are healthy. If they are unhealthy, pregnant, or under 3 months, they should get 30-50 MG. For additional vitamin C, you can purchase vitamin C tablets. It is very important that you do not use vitamin C drops, as these can result in dehydration in guinea pigs. Do not give them multivitamins. These can be bad for them and even poisonous.

;Other things to avoid
* Mixes or treats with nuts, seeds, dried fruit and dyed pieces.
* Dairy and meat products (cavies are herbivores) 
* Seeds in husks can be a choking hazard.
* Cruciferous vegetables (cabbage, collards, bok choy, broccoli) may cause gas in your pet and are best offered sparingly and infrequently.
* Mineral wheels. Never use Tang (which contains dyes, refined sugars, and very little vitamin C) in drinking water.
* Commercial treats marketed for cavies (like yogurt drops) which can even be detrimental to their health. Consuming these empty calories (many contain fat, sugars and even excess calcium) can result in decreased consumption of the basic foods they really need. Guinea pigs are very strictly herbivores; therefore, they are lactose intolerant. Yogurt and honey are not good for guinea pigs, and should be avoided.

==Problems==
Before you bringing home your new guinea pig, you should locate your nearest veterinarian, and go in to the practice to pick up any leaflets or advice sheets on basic first aid for guineas. Staff should be knowledgeable, and will be able to help you with any other queries you might have about your guinea pigs. Make sure to visit a knowledgeable exotic pet veterinarian, as many regular cat and dog veterinarians have limited knowledge of cavies and some may refuse to treat them altogether. 

'''Pain'''
As guinea pigs are naturally prey animals, they instinctively hide pain to prevent appearing as a weak animal within the group. As a result it may be difficult to tell if they are hurting. If you notice changes in behavior, or unusual avoidance of handling, call your veterinarian for advice.

'''Parasites'''
Guinea pigs can occasionally harbor skin (ecto-) parasites, which may not always be visible to the naked eye. Fortunately these parasites are not zoonotic, meaning your guinea pig cannot give them to you. Treatment with a topical product called Revolution(R) (active ingredient, selamectin) is a very effective method of controlling ectoparasites. Ivermectin is also effective, and is given either as an injection or orally. These medications must be prescribed by your veterinarian. It is not uncommon for pet store bought guinea pigs will harbor lice or mites. For this reason, it is a good idea to have a newly acquired guinea pig examined by a veterinarian before introducing the new cavy to other cavies in your home.

[[Image:Guinea pig 8379.JPG|thumb|right|The correct appearance of a cavy's teeth]]
'''Teeth'''
As guinea pigs are rodents, their teeth grow constantly. The constant availability of roughage (grass hay) is of critical importance in maintaining your guinea pig's dental health. It is also helpful, and fun for your guinea pig, if you include a chew stick (available in most pet shops) or piece of fruit wood for them to gnaw on. Dental examinations are an important part of your guinea pig's health plan. You can easily monitor the incisors (front teeth), but it is difficult to see the premolars and molars (cheek teeth) without an oral speculum. To see the incisors, hold your guinea gently but firmly in one hand, with one finger behind the head to support, lean your pet back. If this doesn't expose the teeth, gently push on the lips to show them. The teeth should appear straight; the top and bottom teeth should overlap only slightly (top over bottom- if they are the other way round, you should consult with your veterinarian). Normal incisors are off-white to yellow in color. Normal mandibular (lower) incisors often appear quite long to the untrained eye. If the incisors curve away from each other or are excessively long, consult your veterinarian. ''Never'' attempt to trim or clip your guinea pig's incisors by yourself. This may result in a fractured incisor, which is painful, and may cause further dental problems in the future.

'''Guinea pigs and other pets'''
Obviously, cats, dogs and ferrets are predators and may kill a small furry creature. However, there are cases of guinea pigs getting along with them, and often as not cats may not know what to think of a guinea pig or even be scared of it. Dogs may be trained to accept guinea pigs as well. Chiefly, never leave a guinea pig alone with any predatory animal, however well-trained. Cohousing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils, rats and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively towards the guinea pig. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, and so the two species cannot be fed the same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as the respiratory infections Bordetella and Pasteurella), which guinea pigs are susceptible to. Even a dwarf rabbit is much stronger and more aggressive than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.

'''Breeding'''
Pregnant sows have a 25% chance of having a fatal pregnancy complication. It is advisable to not breed guinea pigs, unless you know 100% of what you're doing, you're able to find homes for them, and you know what breeds can cause problems if they cross.

'''THF''' stands for Tetrahydrofuran, and is a common [[Ethers (Organic chemistry)|ether]]-type solvent. 

==Structure==
It is a 5 membered ring containing 4 carbons and one oxygen. It is very inert and thus makes a good solvent for many reactions.

== No longer active ==

I am most active on en: [[Wikipedia:user:Omegatron]]

I started out contributing to the [[Electronics]] wikibook and the [[Robotics]] book, occasionally.  (I have a bachelor's in electrical engineering, and I have built a few robots in my day.)  I watched it turn into a complete mess, as a single person turned a book about Electronics into a grand unified book about Life, the Universe, and Everything.  (Adding things like ''Brief History of the Universe'', ''The Solar System'', ''[[Electronics/Atmosphere|Evolution of the Earth's Atmosphere]]'', ''Earthquakes and natural disasters'', and ''Global Warming'' to the [[Electronics/Analog Circuits|Analog Circuits]] section, which should have been about resistors, capacitors, and op-amps.)  There are just too few people on Wikibooks to fight off such disruptions, so it just goes on uncontrolled.  

It seems policies are [[Wikibooks_talk:Administrators#Ratification?|decided the same way]].  Compare [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] with [[w:Wikipedia:Administrators|Wikipedia:Administrators]].

There's no clear distinction between where Wikipedia's goals end and Wikibooks' begin.  I'm just going to focus on Wikipedia from now on.

== Old links and such ==

=== &quot;Next section&quot; functionality ===

I think Wikibooks could really use &quot;next&quot;/&quot;previous&quot; functionality for sections.  Wikipedia has soundly rejected such functionality several times, but Wikibooks ''is'' inherently a progression through topics.  Here is a sandbox for myself to try some things:

The aim of this textbook is to explain the design and function of electronic circuits and components.  The text covers electronic circuit components, DC analysis, and AC analysis.

It should be useful to beginner hobbyists as well as beginner engineering students, teaching both theory and practical applications.

It should be thought of as a companion project to the Wikipedia articles about electronics.  While Wikipedia covers many details about the technology used in electronics components and related fields, the Electronics Wikibook covers a lot of the &quot;how-to&quot; aspects that aren't covered in an encyclopedia.  The book will focus on how to use the components to build useful circuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The regions as I've defined them here are totally off the top of my ignorant head.  Change at will.  There's no reason there can't be broad guides and specific ones.  If nothing else, a list of species present in Virginia would be useful for someone trying to identify Virginian wildflowers, and if the field guide entry for each species is on a different page, I don't see a problem with having that extra level of redundancy.  There are surely specialized regions that should maybe be distinct in some way -- the Chesapeake Bay and the Everglades come to mind. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 22:48, 19 Mar 2004 (UTC)

A few comments; judging by a look through what's been done so far, it doesn't look very well thought out:&lt;br&gt;
# Use of common names can be very confusing; 'Twinflower' to many or most refers to ''Linnaea borealis'', not (as given at [[Field Guide:Wildflowers - Western US and Canada]]) ''Dyschoriste oblongifolia''. I've amended the template above to Scientific name.&lt;/br&gt;
# What is a 'wildflower'? Does it include: Woody plants (e.g. trees)? Plants other than Angiosperms (e.g. ferns, conifers)? Non-native naturalised plants? The title and coverage needs a lot more thinking.&lt;br&gt;
# Scientific (metric) measurements should be the standard.&lt;/br&gt;
# The dark purple box color makes the type hard to read. A paler color would be better; I'd recommend following wikipedia's choice of light green (#90ee90) for plants.&lt;/br&gt;

;[[Electronics/AC_Voltage_and_Current|AC]] : Alternating current.  Consists of a periodic oscillation between two different voltages.  Usually said to look like a sine wave, but is not always.  

;AM : Amplitude modulation.  In radio communications, a signal controls the amplitude of a carrier wave that is at a much higher, constant frequency.  The carrier wave is filtered out and a loudspeaker plays based on the amplitude of the signal.

;Ampere (A) : The SI unit for current ''I''.  (Commonly spoken as &quot;amps&quot;, &quot;milliamps&quot;, etc.)  The ampere is officially defined as that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; newton per meter of length.  There is another definition which is based on the deposition rate of silver (''in electrolysis?''), which is much easier to measure.  The other electronics units  are ''derived units'' based on the ampere definition.

;Amplify : To increase the strength of the signal.  Often an &quot;amplifier&quot; is used to pass a signal with both an increase or a decrease in gain.

;Anode : An electron collector.  ''Means up the path from a negative to a positive voltage.''  An anode has a more positive voltage relative to a cathode.

;Attenuate : Decrease the strength of a signal.

;Band-Pass Filter : An analog filter that absorbs low and high frequencies (''f'') but allows a band of frequencies in the middle to pass through.

;[[Electronics/Transistors|BJT]] : Bi-polar junction transistor.  A transistor in which the resistance of the channel is controlled by a current at the gate.  Can be thought of as a current-controlled resistor.  '''FET''' is the other major type of transistor.

;[[Electronics/Inductors|Choke]] : Another name for an inductor, specifically referring to those used in power regulation.

;[[Electronics/Integrated_Circuit|CMOS]] : Complementary metal oxide semiconductor.  Complementary means that it has N-channel and P-channel transistors.  Metal oxide is the type of gate.  CMOS is a type of Integrated Circuit (IC) that is voltage based, since it is made of FETs.  Digital circuits tend to use very little current, because the paths for current flow are effectively open or closed circuits except during the transition between states.

;[[Electronics/Inductors|Coil]] : A helix of wire (the same shape as a spring or Slinky).  Its height, width, thickness, and material can all vary.  Used as an inductor.  The loops of wire can overlap.

;Condenser : Another name for capacitor.

;Conductance : The inverse of resistance.  Measured in siemens (obsolete name mhos), which are the inverse of ohms.  1 S = 1/&amp;Omega; = 1 A/V = 1 A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W

;Coulomb (C) : The SI unit for electric charge ''Q''.  Defined in terms of the '''ampere'''.  1 coulomb is the amount of electric charge carried by a current of 1 ampere flowing for 1 second.  It is also about 6.24&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; times the charge on an electron.  1 C = 1 A&amp;middot;s

;Current : The drift of electrons in an electric field.  This is perceived as a flow.  It is measured in '''amperes'''.

;Cycles per second (cps) :  An obsolete name for hertz, the standard SI unit. As the name implies, a measurement of frequency in full cycles of a wave per second.   The unit cps (or kilocycles, megacycles, etc.) is more often seen in older documents.

;dB : Decibel.  Used to measure logarithmic ratios like signal to noise ratio (SNR), total harmonic distortion (THD), volume relative to a nominal level.  Similar to percent (%) in that it has no units.   dB SPL is used to measure sound levels relative to 20 micro-pascals (&amp;micro;Pa).  dBu is used to measure voltage relative to 0.775 V.

;[[Electronics/DC_Voltage_and_Current|DC]] : Direct current.  A constant voltage and a constant current flow in one direction.

;[[Electronics/Diodes|Diode]] : A one way valve for current.  Semiconductor diodes typically have a voltage drop of 0.6 V (silicon) or 0.2V (germanium) when conducting in the forward direction.

;EMF (''E'') : Electro-Motive Force.  A force for moving electrons.  See '''Voltage'''.

;Ethernet: is a family of frame-based computer networking technologies for local area networks (LAN). It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the standard networking model as well as a common addressing format and a variety of Medium Access Control procedures at the lower part of the Data Link Layer.

;Forward Biased : The voltage polarity through a part which causes it to conduct current.

;Frequency (''f'') : The number of revolutions (cycles) per unit time.  Usually expressed in either radians per second or cycles per second (Hz).

;Gain : A multiplier of voltage or current.

;Ground : Ground is defined as the point in the circuit which is at zero voltage.  Voltage is relative, and is the same throughout a conductor, so any point in the circuit can be defined as ground, and all other voltages are referenced to it.  Usually it is defined as the most negative point in the circuit, for convenience.  Sometimes it is defined in the middle of two bi-polar rails, for &quot;balanced&quot; circuits. In many cases this circuit point is connected to the Earth (Ground) by some buried conductor. 

;[[Electronics/Inductors|Henry]] (H) : The SI unit for inductance.  1 H = 1 Wb/A

;Tesla (T) : Unit of magnetic flux density.  1 T = 1 Wb/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

;Through-hole : This means the circuit is built on a PCB with holes drilled in it for the component leads to go through.  The leads are soldered on the other side of the board.

;Time (t) : The symbol for time in seconds (s).

;[[Electronics/Transformers|Transformer]] : Used to raise or lower the AC voltage between two circuits.  This is based on the ratio of turns between the two coupled inductors.  Transformers operate by way of induction between two inductors.

==to be merged==

superfluous stuff from &quot;overview of electronics&quot;, which should be merged in with these definitions:

'''Charge:''' Particles can have three possible types of charge: positive, negative, or neutral (no charge).  Electrons are negatively charged, protons are positively charged, and neutrons are (surprise!) neutral.  Opposite charges tend to attract, while particles with the same charge (both positive or negative) tend to repel.

'''Electricity:''' the flow of electrons.

'''Electronics:''' is the study of gadgets that use electricity, typically creating or handling signals, not just switching power.

'''???''' are devices which take in input, perform some function, and return some output, through the use of electricity.

'''Circuit''': The path electrons take as they are pushed by some power source, flow through various electrical components in a gadget, and return to the power source.

'''Electric Field:''' field created by the presence of charge.  The field represents the force that would be felt by a positive charge.

'''Voltage:''' Accelerates charge.

'''Voltage''' is a gravity-like potential due to the separation of a negative and a positive charge. Voltage accelerates negatively charged electrons from the negative to the positive charge, and accelerates positive charged protons and ions the other way. Pushing accelerates the charges in what is known as '''current'''.

'''Resistance:'''  When moving electrons (current) collide with atoms, energy is given off as heat.  Resistance is the measure of a material's tendency to cause this type of energy loss. Resistance acts to limit the flow of current due to a given voltage. As the resistance becomes infinite the current stops flowing and becomes an '''open''' circuit. When there is no resistance the circuit '''shorts''' and the current becomes infinite.  (Current 'prefers' the path with the lowest possible resistance.)
* Air has higher resistance than wire.

'''Resistor:''' A device whose primary use is to provide resistance.

'''Short Circuit:''' there is no resistance between two points. Current flows without a change in voltage. 

'''Open Circuit:''' there is infinite resistance between two points. Current is unable to flow, but there is still a voltage between the two points.

'''Voltage Source''' creates a voltage, which creates a current. 

'''Current Source''', which creates a current and a voltage for the current.

'''Voltage Drop''' When the current goes through resistance it loses some of the push of the voltage.

When the current comes to an intersection it has multiple paths it can take and flows according to its resistance.

'''Permittivity: (&amp;epsilon;)''' A measure of how much energy a material absorbs in response to an electric field. Materials (&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;) absorb more energy than the vacuum (&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). The permittivity of a material is known as its '''dielectric constant'''.

'''Cell:''' Two materials with a voltage difference between them.

'''Capacitor:''' Two metal plates with a gap between them. Voltage causes charge to drain from one plate and accumulate on the other plate. This charge separation creates a voltage in the capacitor that opposes the other voltage and stops the flow of current. When a dielectric is placed between the plates it weakens the electric field between the plates and allows more charge to accumulate.

'''Capacitance:'''  Any two pieces of conducting material separated by some distance have capacitance.  Simply, a measure of the tendency of some configuration of metal to act as a capacitor.

'''Inductor:''' A coil of wire. Current starts to flow through the wire and creates a magnetic field. This magnetic field creates an opposing magnetic field which stops the current through the wire. Over time the inductor stops opposing current and turns into a wire.

'''Transformer''' Two connected inductors, which operate through mutual inductance. Current flows through the first inductor and creates a magnetic field that is fed to the second inductor. In response the second inductor creates an opposing magnetic field and current. Having a permanent magnet between the two inductors intensifies their magnetic fields.

'''[[w:vacuum tube|Vacuum tube]]:''' An arrangement of two or more electrodes in a vacuum. Typically placed in a glass bulb to keep air from leaking in. 

'''[[w:Triode|Triode]]:''' The first electrical amplification device. A triode is a type of vacuum tube with three connections:
* The '''cathode''' emits electrons.
* The '''anode''' accepts electrons.
* The '''grid'', placed in the middle, which controls the flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode.

'''Diode:''' A 2 wire device that allows current to flow easily in only one direction.

'''[[w:transistor|Transistor]]:''' A 3 wire device, with one wire (the &quot;base&quot; or &quot;gate&quot;) that controls the flow of electrons between the other 2 wires. Replaced vacuum tubes. 

'''[[w:light|Light waves:]]''' (Electromagnetic waves)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Unit Circle is a circle with its center at the origin (0,0) and a radius of one unit.

[[File:Unit circle 3.svg|thumb|300px|Unit Circle]]

Angles are always measured from the positive x-axis (also called the &quot;right horizon&quot;).  Angles measured counterclockwise have ''positive'' values; angles measured clockwise have ''negative'' values.

{{clear}}

==Defining Sine and Cosine in terms of the unit circle==

In the unit circle shown here, a unit-length radius has been drawn from the origin to a point (x,y) on the circle.

[[Image:Defining_sine_and_cosine.svg|300px|thumb|center|Defining sine and cosine]]

A line perpendicular to the x-axis, drawn through the point (x,y), intersects the x-axis at the point with the [[Algebra/Function Graphing|abscissa]] ''x''.  Similarly, a line perpendicular to the y-axis intersects the y-axis at the point with the [[Algebra/Function Graphing|ordinate]] ''y''.  The angle between the x-axis and the radius is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

So, we can say that the sine of an angle is the ordinate of the point on the unit circle at that angle, and, the cosine of an angle is the abscissa of the point on the unit circle at that angle.

We define the basic trigonometric functions of any angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\mathrm{Sine:} &amp; \sin(\alpha) &amp; = &amp; y \\
\mathrm{Cosine:} &amp; \cos(\alpha) &amp; = &amp; x \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be algebraically defined.

&lt;math&gt;\tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} \qquad \cos\theta \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tan\alpha = \frac{y}{x} \qquad x \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

{{TrigBoxClose}}

These three trigonometric functions can be used whether the angle is measured in degrees or radians as long as it specified which, when calculating trigonometric functions from angles or vice versa.

===Alternative definitions===
* A previous chapter used ''[[Trigonometry/Soh-Cah-Toa|Soh-Cah-Toa]]'' to define the trigonometric functions.  The advantage of the unit circle is that &amp;theta; can be extended outside the first quadrant [0,&amp;pi;/2], which allows us to define these functions on the interval [-&amp;infin;,+-&amp;infin;].
* If trigonometry is applied to vectors, it is more convenient if the radius of the circle is not equal to unity.  For example, if vector '''''A''''' has magnitude ''A''=|'''''A'''''|:
{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x   = r\cos\alpha &amp; \rightarrow  &amp; A_x  = A\cos\alpha \\
y    = r\sin\alpha &amp; \rightarrow  &amp; A_y  = A\sin\alpha \\
r^2  =  x^2+y^2     &amp; \rightarrow  &amp; A^2  =  A_x^2+A_y^2 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Some Values for Sine and Cosine==
A unit circle with certain exact values marked on it is below:

[[File:Unit_circle_angles.svg|thumb|440px|left|Labeled Unit Circle]] 

It is worth memorizing some of the values of sine and cosine on the unit circle (cosine is equal to x while sine is equal to y).  You should at least become familiar with the values for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 0^\circ, 30^\circ 45^\circ, 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt; and know where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \pi/2, \pi, 3\pi/2, 2\pi&lt;/math&gt; are on the unit circle .

Unit circles form the basis of most analog clocks and animations on computers since the cos and sin correspond to the x and y positions of the end of the line segments representing the hands of the clock.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Geometrically defining tangent==

In the previous section, we algebraically defined tangent as &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\tan\theta=\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}&lt;/math&gt;, and this is the definition that we will use most in the future. It can, however, be helpful to understand the tangent function from a geometric perspective.

[[Image:Definition-of-tan.svg|250px|thumb|right|Geometrically defining tangent]]

A line is drawn at a tangent to the unit circle: (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x = 1&lt;/math&gt;). Another line is drawn from the point on the radius of the circle where the given angle falls, through the origin(O), to a point (Q) on the drawn tangent. The ordinate (QP) of this point is called the tangent of the angle.

The slope of the line '''OQ =''' &lt;math&gt;\frac {KC}{OC}&lt;/math&gt; and as we mentioned before

'''KC = sin(θ)''' , 
'''OC = cos(θ)'''

Hence , the Slope of the line '''OQ =''' &lt;math&gt;\frac {\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

and also the slope of '''OQ =''' &lt;math&gt;\frac {QP}{OP}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac {QP}{1}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac {\tan(\theta)}{1}&lt;/math&gt; = '''tan(θ)'''

Hence , we can deduce that '''tan(θ)''' '''=''' &lt;math&gt;\frac {KC}{OC}&lt;/math&gt; '''=''' &lt;math&gt;\frac {\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt; '''= QP = the ordinate of the point Q = the slope of OQ'''

==Domain and range of circular functions==

Any size angle, positive or negative, can be the input to sine or cosine &amp;mdash; the result will be as if the largest multiple of 2&amp;pi; (or 360&amp;deg;) were subtracted from or added to the angle. The output of the two functions is limited by the absolute value of the radius of the unit circle, &lt;math&gt;|1|&lt;/math&gt;.

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
 &amp; \mathrm{domain}&amp;\mathrm{range} \\
\mathrm{sine} &amp; \mathbb{R} &amp; [-1,1] \\
\mathrm{cosine} &amp; \mathbb{R} &amp; [-1,1] \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''R'' represents the set of all real numbers.
{{TrigBoxClose}}

No such restrictions apply to the tangent, however, as can be seen in the diagram in the preceding section. The only restriction on the domain of tangent is that odd integer multiples of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; are undefined, as a line parallel to the tangent will never intersect it.

{{TrigBoxOpen}}
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
 &amp; \mathrm{domain}&amp;\mathrm{range} \\
\mathrm{tangent} &amp; \mathbb{R} \setminus \left \{ \cdots,-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{3\pi}{2},\frac{5\pi}{2},\cdots \right \} &amp; \mathbb{R} \\
\end{matrix}

==Applying the trigonometric functions to a right-angled triangle==

If you redefine the variables as follows to correspond to the sides of a right triangle:&lt;br /&gt;

• y = o (opposite)&lt;br/&gt;
• a = h (hypotenuse)&lt;br/&gt;

= Construction of Right Triangles =
[[image:Animated illustration of thales theorem.gif|right|thumb|225px|Provided ''AC'' is a diameter, angle ''B'' is always a constant right angle]]
Right triangles are easily constructed. Recall that a ''diameter'' is a straight line which starts at one point on the circle and goes through the center to the other side. Using this property of a circle: 

# Construct a diameter of a circle. Call the points where the diameter touches the circle ''a'' and ''c''. 
# Choose a distinct point ''b'' on the circle (any point that is neither ''a'' nor ''c''). 
# Construct line segments connecting points ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''. 

Provided the above three directions are followed, the resulting triangle Δ''abc'' will be a right triangle.  This result is known as [[w:Thales' theorem|Thales' theorem]].

This right triangle can be further divided into two isosceles triangles by adding a line segment from ''b'' to the center of the circle. 

To simplify the following discussion, we specify that the circle has diameter 1 and is oriented such that the diameter drawn above runs left to right.  We shall denote the angle of the triangle at the right ''θ'' and that at the left ''φ''.  The sides of the right triangle will be labeled, starting on the right, ''a, b, c,'' so that ''a'' is the rightmost side, ''c'' the leftmost, and ''b'' the diameter.  We know from earlier that side ''b'' is opposite the right angle and is called the '''hypotenuse.'''  Side ''a'' is opposite angle ''φ'', while side ''c'' is opposite angle ''θ''. We reiterate that the diameter, now called ''b'', shall be assumed to have length 1 except where otherwise noted.

By constructing a right angle to the diameter at one of the points where it crosses the circle and then using the method outlined earlier for producing binary fractions of the right angle, we can construct one of the angles, say ''θ'', as an angle of known measure between 0 and ''π'' / 2.  The  measure of the other angle ''φ'' is then ''π'' - ''π''/2 - ''θ'' = ''π''/2 - ''θ'', the '''complement''' of angle ''θ''. Likewise, we can bisect the diameter of the circle to produce lengths which are binary fractions of the length of the diameter. Using a compass, a binary fractional length of the diameter can be used to construct side ''a'' (or ''c'') having a known size (with regard to the diameter ''b'') from which side ''c'' can be constructed.

= Using Right Triangles to find Unknown Sides =

== Finding unknown sides from two other sides ==

From the [[w:Pythagorean Theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]], we know that:

: &lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;  

Recall that c (the diameter/hypotenuse in the above example) has been defined as having a length of one, therefore:

: &lt;math&gt;b^2 = 1 - a^2. \,&lt;/math&gt;  

permits us to calculate the length of b squared.  It may happen that b squared is a fraction such as  1/4 for which a rational square root can be found, in this case as 1/2, alternatively, we could use Newton's Method to find an approximate value for b.

== Finding unknown sides from one side and one (non-right) angle ==

As any triangle could be compared to our basic triangle (formed from a circle with a diameter of one), a table enumerating the relationships between angles and side lengths would be very useful to understanding the properties of any triangle. However, such a table would be unwieldy in practice and it is often not necessary to know the exact value.

Of course, given an angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, we could construct a right angled triangle using ruler and compass that had &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; as one of its angles, we could then measure the length of the side that corresponds to a to evaluate the &lt;math&gt;\cos&lt;/math&gt; function.  Such measurements would necessarily be inexact; it would be a problem in physics to see how accurately such measurements can be made; using trigonometry we can make precise predictions with which the results of these physical measurements can be compared.

The most common way of communicating the idea that relationships exist without providing exact details takes the form of a 'function'. A function is like a machine that takes some simple input and produces some simple output. Usually a function defines some kind of rule ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#Overview| Function]]) and provides us a handy notation useful in trigonometry. That way, we know that we're using a certain relationship without needing to know the exact numerical values. Basic trigonometric functions are simply stand-ins for the relationship between angles and sides of a triangle.

One such function, which allows us to know the relationship between any value of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding value of &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''cosine'' or &lt;math&gt;\cos\,&lt;/math&gt;. This universal relationship is represented as: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{c} = \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt; which would save us the work of constructing angles and lengths and making difficult deductions from them.

This means that if you know the cosine of an angle, you also know the relationship between the lengths of the sides. The actual size of the triangle can be bigger or smaller, but the mathematical relationship represented by the cosine does not change so long as the size of the angle remains constant.

== Cosine example ==
Some explicit values for the cos function are known. For &lt;math&gt;\theta\, = 0&lt;/math&gt;, sides &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; coincide: &lt;math&gt;a = c = \frac{a}{c} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\cos\left(0\right) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, sides &lt;math&gt;b\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c\,&lt;/math&gt; coincide and are of length 1, and side &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is of zero length, consequently &lt;math&gt;a\, = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c\, = 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{c} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{\pi}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.


The simplest right angle triangle we can draw is the isosceles right angled triangle, it has a pair of angles of size &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; radians, and if its hypotenuse is considered to be of length one, then the sides &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are of length &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; as can be verified by the theorem of Pythagoras.  If the side &lt;math&gt;a\,&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the same length as the radius of the circle containing the right angled triangle, then the right hand isosceles triangle obtained by splitting the right angled triangle from the circumference of the circle to its center is an equilateral triangle, so &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{6}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\,^2&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;1 - \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.

= Properties of the cosine and sine functions=

== Period ==

A full revolution is an angle of 2π radians, so increasing an angle by this amount gets you exactly back to your starting point. Therefore, a perfect circle is maintained, along with the relationships formed by triangles within, by adding 2π to any angle &amp;theta;. This is called the ''period,'' --the size of the angle or the time period over which the relationships begin to repeat (correlating the two is complex, and allows us to talk about wave theory).

Using functions, we can represent this fact in terms of the cosine function by stating that : &lt;math&gt;\cos\theta = \cos\left(\theta + 2\pi n \right),\,&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing the period of the sine and cosine functions (and by derivation, that of other functions) is useful because it means that we can substitute one angle for another when we know that the period is the same. This helps in calculations, such as when there is the need to add or subtract angles.

== Half Angle and Double Angle Formulas ==

We can derive a formula for cos(θ/2) in terms of cos(θ) which allows us to find the value of the cos() function for many more angles.  To derive the formula, draw an isosceles triangle, draw a circle through its corners, connect the center of the circle with radii to each corner of the isoceles triangle, extend the radius through the apex of the isoceles triangle into a diameter of the circle and connect the point where the diameter crosses the other side of the circle with lines to the other corners of the isoceles triangle. 

Therefore:

&lt;math&gt;\cos (\theta /2) = \sqrt{\frac {1 + \cos \theta}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives a method of calculating the cos() of half an angle in terms of the cos() of the original angle.  For this reason * is called the &quot;Cosine Half Angle Formula&quot;. 

The half angle formula can be applied to split the newly discovered angle which in turn can be split again ad infinitum.  Of course, each new split involves finding the square root of a term with a square root, so this cannot be recommended as an effective procedure for computing values of the cos() function.

Equation * can be inverted to find cos(θ) in terms of cos(θ)/2:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}&amp;\cos (\theta /2)  =  \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos (\theta)}{2}}\\
  \Rightarrow  &amp;  \cos^2(\theta/2)  =  \frac{1 + \cos(\theta)}{2} \\
  \Rightarrow  &amp;  \cos^2(\theta/2) - \frac{1}{2}  =  \frac{\cos (\theta)}{2}  \\
  \Rightarrow  &amp; 2\cos^2(\theta/2) - 1   =  \cos(\theta) \\
 \end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

substituting &lt;math&gt;\delta\ = \frac{\theta}{2}&lt;/math&gt; gives:

&lt;math&gt;2\cos^2(\delta) - 1     = \cos(2\delta) \,&lt;/math&gt;

that is a formula for the cos() of double an angle in terms of the cos() of the original angle, and is called the &quot;cosine double angle sum formula&quot;.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Polish cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Soup|Soup]]

'''Zupa ogórkowa''' is a traditional Polish soup made out of sour, salted [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]].

==Ingredients==
*4 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] wings
*1 small [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] (or 1 small [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]])
*2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]s 
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Celery Root|celery root]] (optional) 
*1 [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip root]]
*3 medium [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]es
*3 big sour-salted (pickled) [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]s
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaves]]
*3 [[Cookbook:Pimento|pimento]]s
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] 
*1 – 2 tablespoon of [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] or [[Cookbook:Half and Half|half and half]] ([[Cookbook:Yogurt|yoghurt]] is also acceptable, however it isn't traditional then) (optional)

==Procedure==
#Put the chicken wings, salt, pepper, bay leaves and pimentos into a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] or [[Cookbook:Stock Pot|stock pot]] with 1.5 [[Cookbook:L|L]] (1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]]) cold water. After bringing it to a boil, let it simmer for 25 minutes on low heat. 
#Add the peeled carrots, celery root, parsnip root, and leek, and boil it for 10 more minutes. During that time peel the potatoes and dice them into quarter inch (cubes [[Cookbook:Inch|0.25“ x 0.25”]]). 
#Take out the leek, and add the potatoes to the pot. Boil them for 10-12 minutes and make sure the potatoes are cooked through. 
#Now is the time to prepare the pickled cucumber mixture. Grate the sour-salted (pickled) cucumbers and put them into a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|saute pan]] with the melted butter. Saute for 2 minutes, and add the flour and constantly stir it over low heat. 
#Add 1/2 - 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]s of water to the saute pan and continue stirring. 
#When the potatoes are cooked, add the prepared sour cucumber preparation to the stock pot and mix them well. Boil for 3-5 minutes and season the soup to taste. If you like, mix some soup with cream or sour cream in a small cup and add it to the pan, or a smaller amount to each individual serving.

''Bon appétit!'' ''Smacznego!''

==Notes, tips, and variations==
It is very important to add the potatoes first, and then the sour cucumbers. If you add them in reverse order, the potatoes will not be cooked through.

== Naming ==

''Wiejska'' is in Polish a singular, feminine adjective. When trying to specify the name of this meal you should use also ''kiełbasa'' word to avoid confusion. We may say that ''wiejska'' describes something but we don't know what until we point on ''kiełbasa''!

So, the proper, full name of this meal is '''kiełbasa wiejska''' &amp;#8212; this also should be reflected in the names of articles considering this matter and in a way that meal is referred to.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Poland|Cuisine of Poland]] | [[Cookbook:Sausage|Sausage]] | [[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meat Recipes]] 

'''Wiejska''' is the most popular form of Kielbasa, or Polish sausage, in the United States.

==Ingredients==
*1 1/2 lbs, lean boneless [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1/2 lb. boneless [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]] (optional)
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*1 tsp. [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]]
*2-3 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Mustard seed|mustard seed]]
*1/4 cup crushed ice
*[[Cookbook:Sausage casing|sausage casing]]

==Procedure==
Cut the meat into small chunks, then grind the meat with the seasonings and ice, mix this well.  Stuff the meat mixture into the casing.  Smoke in an outside smoker following the manufacturer's directions, or you can place the sausage in a casserole and cover it with water and bake at 350° F until water is absorbed, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  This makes about 2 lbs.

When making sausage by hand, tie a knot about 3 inches (76 mm) from one end of a cleaned sausage casing and fix the open end over the spout of a wide-based funnel, easing most of the casing up onto the spout.  Then spoon the mixture into the funnel and push it through into the casing with your fingers.  Knot the end and roll the sausage gently on a firm surface to distribute the filling evenly.

==Warning==

While typically this sausage is prepared in a cured form, the above recipe is for fresh sausage.  As such it must be fully cooked before eating in order to prevent food poisoning. Alternatively this sausage can be prepared as a cured product.

Notes: The purpose of the ice is to keep the fat in the pork solid, which is very important in the final texture of the sausage.  If you do not add the veal then add 1 lb. additional pork

'''Rosó&amp;#322;''' is a traditional Polish meat broth. The most popular variety is Rosó&amp;#322; z kury, or clear chicken (hen) soup. It is commonly served with fine noodles, often home made, like Jewish lokshen. It is important to differentiate the type of meat used for the preparation of this particular dish. Young chicken meat will result in a different flavour than that obtained from an older cooking hen. Additionally, the type of meat will result in a different fat content. Finally, other meats, or a mix of beef and/or veal may be used.

== Rosó&amp;#322; z kury ==
Chicken rosó&amp;#322;, serves 4

=== Ingredients ===
* 1 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 small [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]]s
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Celery Root|celery root]]
* 2-3 sprigs green [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]]
* 1-2 parsley roots
* 1 bunch of [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] and [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1/8 sweet [[Cookbook:cabbage|cabbage]]
* Other spices, added to taste: garlic clove, bay leaf, allspice

=== Procedure ===
#Quarter the chicken and place in a [[Cookbook:Stock pot|stock pot]] with ~1.5 cold water. Do not add salt at this time, as may harden some meats. Bring to a boil on high heat, then simmer for 30-45 min. At this time, remove (skim) surface flotsam (a mix of protein and some fat).
#In the traditional Polish way chicken is not quartered or cut whatsoever. 
#To avoid having to remove surface flotsam use the blanching technique: bring large amount of water (unsalted) to a boil. Remember to leave enough space for the chicken. When in vigorous boil put the chicken in. Let it boil for about a minute. Take the chicken out and put under cold, running water until cold. Now you can add chicken to your rosół, and not worry about the flotsam. It will also make rosół clearer - which is one of the indicators of a good rosół dish.
#Add vegetables: peeled garlic clove, carrots peeled and sliced lengthwise, celery root, parsley root similarly prepared, and other vegetables previously washed.
#Sauté onion halves on minimal oil to caramelize the flesh. Omitting this step will result in a clearer, less-yellow product. 
#Simmer on low heat for approx 2 hours or more. Rosó&amp;#322; should not boil, as this will result in a cloudy consistency.
#Season to taste with salt, pepper, bay leaf, allspice, juniperus seeds, dried wild mushrooms, etc.
#Continue simmering. You may skim fat off the surface, if so desired (traditionally it should be as fat as possible)
#Adding vegetable stock or a stock cube is a personal choice. Some argue that it is unnecessary, as the vegetable and meat give enough flavour to the broth.
#Remove cabbage, parsley, celery root and any &quot;undesired&quot; vegetables. Carrots are usually left in and served with the broth


Serve hot with noodles and fresh parsley. Individuals may season with maggi, soy sauce, freshly ground black pepper and/or chilli flakes.

=== Variations ===
Instead of chicken you may use 1/2 kg (1 lb) of [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]], or beef.

== One Component Systems ==

All materials can exist in three phases:  ''[[w:solid|solid]]'', ''[[w:liquid|liquid]]'', and ''[[w:gas|gas]]''.  All one component systems share certain characteristics, so that a study of a typical one component system will be quite useful.

[[Image:Onecompon_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|One Component System]]

For this analysis, we consider heat transferred to the substance at constant pressure.  The above chart shows temperature vs. specific volume (1/density) curves for at three different constant pressures.  The three line-curves labeled p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; above are isobars, showing conditions at constant pressure.  When the liquid and vapor coexist, it is called a saturated state.  There is no change in temperature or pressure when liquid and vapor are in equilibrium, so that the temperature is called ''saturation temperature'' and the pressure is called ''saturation pressure''.  Saturated states are represented by the horizontal lines in the chart.  In the temperature range where both liquid and vapor of a pure substance can coexist in equilibrium, for every value of saturated temperature, there is only one corresponding value of saturation pressure.  If the temperature of the liquid is lower than the saturation temperature, it is called ''subcooled liquid''.  If the temperature of the vapor or gas is greater than the saturation temperature it is called ''superheated vapor''.

The amount of liquid and vapor in a saturated mixture is specified by its ''quality x'', which is the fraction of vapor in the mixture.  Thus, the horizontal line representing the vaporization of the fluid has a quality of ''x=0'' at the left endpoint where it is 100% liquid and a quality of ''x=1'' at the right endpoint where it is 100% vapor.  The blue curve in the preceding diagram shows saturation temperatures for saturated liquid i. e. where x=0.  The green curve in the diagram shows saturation temperatures for saturated vapor i. e. where x=1.  These curves are not isobars.  

&lt;math&gt;
  x = \frac{m_g}{m_f + m_g}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  v_x =
  \left(
    1 - x
  \right)v_f + xv_g
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  v_{fg} = v_g - v_f
&lt;/math&gt;

If you also consider the solid state, then we get the phase diagram for the material.  The point where the solid, liquid, and the vapor state exist in equilibrium is called the &lt;br/&gt;''triple point''.  Note that as the saturation temperatures increase, the liquid and vapor specific volumes approach each other until the blue and green curves come together and meet at point C on the p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; isobar.  At that point C, called the ''critical point'', the liquid and vapor states merge together and all their thermodynamic properties become the same.  The critical point has a certain temperature T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, and pressure p&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, which depend on the substance in question.  At temperatures above the critical point, the substance is considered a super-heated gas.  

This diagram is based on the diagram for water.  Other pure (one-component) substances have corresponding temperature vs. specific volume diagrams which are fairly similarly shaped, but the temperatures, pressures, and specific volumes will vary. 

The thermodynamic properties of materials are given in charts.
One commonly used chart is the ''[[w:Mollier Chart|Mollier Chart]]'', which is the plot of [[w:enthalpy|enthalpy]] versus [[w:entropy|entropy]].
The pressure enthalpy chart is frequently used in refrigeration applications.
Charts such as these are useful because many processes are isenthalpic, so obtaining values would be as simple as drawing a straight line on the chart and reading off the data.

''Steam tables'' give the values of specific volume, enthalpy, entropy, and internal energy for different temperatures for water.
They are of great use to an engineer, with applications in steam turbines, steam engines, and air conditioning, among others.


''Gas tables'' give the same equations for common gases like air.
Although most gases roughly obey the ideal gas equation, gas tables note the actual values which are more accurate in many cases.
They are not as important as steam tables, but in many cases it is much easier to lookup from a table rather than compute answers.

=== Gibbs Phase Rule ===

''Gibbs  phase rule'' states that for a heterogeneous system in equilibrium with ''C'' components in ''P'' phases, the degree of freedom ''F = C - P + 2''.
Thus, for a one component system with two phases, there is only one degree of freedom.
F=1-2+2
F =1
That is, if you are given either the pressure or temperature of wet steam, you can obtain all the properties, while for superheated steam, which has just one phase, you will need both the pressure and the temperature.

==Psychrometry==

''Psychrometry'' is the study of air and water vapor mixtures for air conditioning.
For this application, air is taken to be a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with the other gases being small enough so that they can be approximated by more of nitrogen and oxygen without much error.  In this psychrometry section, vapor refers to water vapor.  For air at normal (atmospheric) pressure, the saturation pressure of vapor is very low.  Also, air is far away from its critical point in those conditions.  Thus, the air vapor mixture behaves as an ideal gas mixture.  If the partial pressure of the vapor is smaller than the saturation pressure for water for that temperature, the mixture is called unsaturated.  The amount of moisture in the air vapor mixture is quantified by its ''humidity''.

The absolute humidity ''&amp;omega;'' is the ratio of masses of the vapor and air, ''i.e.'', ''&amp;omega; = m&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/m&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Now, applying ideal gas equation, ''pV = mRT'' for water vapor and for air, we have, since the volume and temperature are the same, ''&amp;omega; = 0.622 p&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The ratio of specific gas constants (R in preceding equation) of water vapor to air equals 0.622 .

The ''relative humidity'' ''&amp;phi;'' is the ratio of the vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure at that temperature, ''i.e.'', ''&amp;phi; = p&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/p&lt;sub&gt;v,sat&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The ''saturation ratio'' is the ratio of the absolute humidity to the absolute humidity at saturation, or, ''&amp;psi; = &amp;omega;/&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;sat&lt;/sub&gt;''.
It is easy to see that the saturation ratio is very close to the value of relative humidity.

[[Image:abshum_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Absolute Humidity]]

The above plot shows the value of absolute humidity versus the temperature.
The initial state of the mixture is 1, and it is cooled isobarically, and at constant absolute humidity.
When it reaches 2, it is saturated, and its absolute humidity is ''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Further cooling causes condensation and the system moves to point 3, where its absolute humidity is ''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''.
The temperature at 2 is called the ''dew point''.

It is customary to state all quantities in psychrometry per unit mass of dry air.
Thus, the amount of air condensed in the above chart when moving from 2 to 3 is ''&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''.

=== Adiabatic Saturation ===

[[Image:adiabatic_saturation_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Adiabatic Saturation]]

Consider an unsaturated mixture entering a chamber.
Suppose water was sprayed into the stream, so that the humidity increases and it leaves as a saturated mixture.
This is accompanied by a loss of temperature due to heat being removed from the air which is used for vaporization.
If the water supplied is at the temperature of exit of the stream, then there is no heat transfer from the water to the mixture.
The final temperature of the mixture is called ''adiabatic saturation temperature''.

=== Wet Bulb Temperature ===

The relative [[w:humidity|humidity]] of air vapor mixtures is measured by using dry and wet bulb [[w:thermometers|thermometers]].
The dry bulb thermometer is an ordinary thermometer, while the wet bulb thermometer has its bulb covered by a moist [[w:wick|wick]].
When the mixture flows past the two thermometers, the dry bulb thermometer shows the temperature of the stream, while water evaporates from the wick and its temperature falls.
This temperature is very close to the [[w:adiabatic|adiabatic]] [[w:saturation|saturation]] temperature if we neglect the heat transfer due to [[w:convection|convection]].

=== Psychrometric Chart ===

[[Image:psychrometric_chart_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Psychrometric Chart]]

This chart gives the value of absolute [[w:humidity|humidity]] versus temperature, along with the [[w:enthalpy|enthalpy]].
From this chart you can determine the relative humidity given the dry and wet bulb temperatures.
We have, from the first law, that for a flow system with no heat transfer, the enthalpy is a constant.
Now, for the [[w:adiabatic|adiabatic]] [[w:saturation|saturation]] process, there is no heat transfer taking place, so that the adiabatic saturation lines are the same as the wet bulb temperature and the constant enthalpy lines.

'''Questions'''

'''1.''' The temperature at [[w:Phoenix|Phoenix]] is 35&amp;deg;C with a relative humidity of 40%.  Can a room be cooled using a conventional air cooler?

: We need to find the wet bulb temperature for the point ''T'' = 35&amp;deg;C and ''&amp;phi;'' = 40%.  We have, from the psychrometric chart, the wet bulb temperature is between 20 and 25&amp;deg;C.  Thus, you can cool the room down to a comfortable temperature using an evaporative cooler.

'''2.''' The temperature of [[w:Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] is 37&amp;deg;C with relative humidity of 83%.  To what temperature can a room be cooled using a conventional air cooler?

: The wet bulb temperature is about 34.2&amp;deg;C for this situation.  Thus, you cannot use an ordinary cooler to reduce room temperature in this situation.  You will need to use an air conditioner.

=== [[w:Air Conditioning|Air Conditioning]] ===

The human body can work efficiently only in a narrow range of conditions.
Further, it rejects about 60 W of heat continuously into the surroundings, and more during heavy exercise.
The temperature of the body is maintained by the evaporation of sweat from the body.
Thus, for comfort, both the temperature and the relative humidity should be low.

Conventional air conditioning consists of setting the humidity at an acceptable level, while reducing the temperature.
Reducing the humidity to zero is not the ideal objective.
For instance, low humidity leads to issues like high chances of static electricity building up, leading to damage of sensitive electronic equipment.
A humidity level of 50% is more acceptable in this case.

The most common method of reducing humidity is to cool the air using a conventional air conditioner working on a reversed Carnot cycle.
The vapor that condenses is removed.
Now, the air that is produced is very cold, and needs to be heated back up to room temperature before it is released back to the air conditioned area.

== Common Thermodynamic Cycles ==

Several thermodynamic cycles used in machines can be approximated with idealized cycles.
It was shown previously that a Carnot engine was the most efficient engine operating between two thermal reservoirs.
However, due to practical difficulties, Carnot cycle cannot be implemented in all situations.
The following sections deal with idealized (non Carnot) systems found in practice.

=== Rankine Cycle ===

In the Rankine cycle, also called the ''standard vapor power cycle'', the working fluid follows a closed cycle.
We will consider water as a working substance.
In the Rankine cycle, water is pumped from a low pressure to a high pressure using a liquid pump.
This water is then heated in the boiler at constant pressure where its temperature increases and it is converted to superheated vapor.
This vapor is then expanded in an expander to generate work.  This expander can be a turbine or a reciprocating (i.e. piston) machine such as those used in older steam locomotive or ship.
The output of the expander is then cooled in a condenser to the liquid state and fed to the pump.
The Rankine cycle differs from the Carnot cycle in that the input to the pump is a liquid (it is cooled more in the condenser).
This allows the use of a small, low power pump due to the lower specific volume of liquid compared to steam.
Also, the heat transfer in the boiler takes place mainly as a result of a phase change, compared to the isothermal heating of the ideal gas in the Carnot cycle, so that the efficiency is quite good (even though it is still lower than the Carnot efficiency).
The amount of heat transferred as the liquid is heated to its boiling point is very small compared to the heat transfer during phase change.
The steam is superheated so that no liquid state exists inside the turbine.
Condensation in the turbine can be devastating as it can cause corrosion and erosion of the blades.

There are several modifications to the Rankine cycle leading to even better practical designs.
In the ''reheat cycle'' there are two expanders working in series, and the steam from the high pressure stage is heated again in the boiler before it enters the low pressure expander.
This avoids the problem of moisture in the turbine and also increases the efficiency.  The ''regenerative cycle'' is another modification to increase the efficiency of the Rankine cycle.
In many Rankine cycle implementations, the water enters the boiler in the subcooled state, and also, the large difference in temperature between the one at which heat is supplied to the boiler and the fluid temperature will give rise to irreversibilities which will cause the efficiency to drop.
In the regenerative cycle, the output of the condenser is heated by some steam tapped from the expander.
This causes the overall efficiency to increase, due to the reasons noted above.

=== Otto Cycle ===

[[Image:otto_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Otto Cycle]]

The ''Otto Cycle'' is the idealization for the process found in the reciprocating internal combustion engines which are used by most automobiles.
While in an actual engine the gas is released as exhaust, this is found to be a good way to analyze the process.
There are, of course, other losses too in the actual engine.
For instance, partial combustion and aspiration problems for a high speed engine.
The working material in the idealized cycle is an ideal gas, as opposed to the air fuel mixture in an engine.

# Heat is transferred at constant volume during 1-2.
# The gas expands reversibly and adiabatically during 2-3, where work is done.
# Heat is rejected at constant volume at low temperature during 3-4.
# The gas is compressed reversibly and adiabatically in 4-1.

==== Analysis ==== 

Heat is transferred at constant volume in 1-2, so that ''Q&lt;sub&gt;1-2&lt;/sub&gt; = m c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;(T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''.
Similarly, the heat rejected in 3-4 is ''Q&lt;sub&gt;3-4&lt;/sub&gt; = m c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)''.
The thermal efficiency of the Otto cycle is thus

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = (Q&lt;sub&gt;1-2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; Q&lt;sub&gt;3-4&lt;/sub&gt;)/Q&lt;sub&gt;1-2&lt;/sub&gt;''

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; Q&lt;sub&gt;3-4&lt;/sub&gt;/Q&lt;sub&gt;1-2&lt;/sub&gt;''

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)/(T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Since 2-3 and 4-1 are reversible adiabatic processes involving an ideal gas, we have,

''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;gamma; &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt;''

and 

''T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;gamma; &amp;minus; 1&lt;/sup&gt;''

But,

''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

and 

''V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''

So, we have

''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''

Thus, 

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(1 &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)/(1 &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Or

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

If we introduce the term ''r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the compression ratio, then we have, 

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1 &amp;minus; &amp;gamma;&lt;/sup&gt;''

As can be seen, increasing the compression ratio will improve thermal efficiency.
However, increasing the compression ratio causes the peak temperature to go up, which may cause spontaneous, uncontrolled ignition of the fuel, which leads to a shock wave traveling through the cylinder, and is called ''knocking''.

=== Diesel Cycle ===

[[Image:diesel_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Diesel Cycle]]

The Diesel cycle is the idealized cycle for compression ignition engines (ones that don't use a spark plug).
The difference between the Diesel cycle and the Otto cycle is that heat is supplied at constant pressure.

# Heat is supplied reversibly at constant pressure in 1-2.
# Reversible adiabatic expansion during which work is done in 2-3.
# Heat is rejected reversibly at constant volume in 3-4.
# Gas is compressed reversibly and adiabatically in 4-1.

==== Analysis ====

Heat is transferred to the system at constant pressure during 1-2 so that 

''Q&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; = m c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Heat is rejected by the system at constant volume during 3-4:

''Q&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = m c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)''

Thus, the efficiency of the Diesel cycle is

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = (Q&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; Q&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;)/Q&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;''

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; Q&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;/Q&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;''

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; (c&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;))/(c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;))''

''&amp;eta;&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 &amp;minus; (1/&amp;gamma;) (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)/(T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)''

&lt;math&gt;
\eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma}\frac{T_4}{T_1}
\left(
  \frac{\frac{T_3}{T_4} - 1}{\frac{T_2}{T_1} - 1}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

We define the cutoff ratio as ''r&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and since  the pressures at 1 and 2 are equal, we have, applying the ideal gas equation, ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''.
Now, for the adiabatic processes 2-3 and 4-1 we have,

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T_2}{T_3} =
\left(
  \frac{V_3}{V_2}
\right)^{\gamma - 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T_1}{T_4} =
\left(
  \frac{V_4}{V_1}
\right)^{\gamma - 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'', we have

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T_2}{T_1}\frac{T_4}{T_3} =
\left(
  \frac{V_1}{V_2}
\right)^{\gamma - 1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{T_4}{T_3} =
\left(
  \frac{V_1}{V_2}
\right)^{\gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma}\frac{1}{r_c^{\gamma - 1}}
\left(
  \frac{r_t^\gamma - 1}{r_t - 1}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dual Cycle ===

[[Image:dual_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Dual Cycle]]

The dual cycle is sometimes used to approximate actual cycles as the time taken for heat transfer in the engine is not zero for the Otto cycle (so not constant volume).
In the Diesel cycle, due to the nature of the combustion process, the heat input does not occur at  constant pressure.

=== Gas Turbine Cycle (or Joule-Brayton Cycle) ===

Gas turbines are rotary internal combustion engines.
As the first stage air is drawn in from outside and compressed using a compressor.
Then the fuel  is introduced and the mixture is ignited in the combustion chamber.
The hot gases are expanded using a turbine which produces work.
The output of the turbine is vented outside as exhaust.

[[Image:brayton_Engineering_Thermodynamics.png|Gas Turbine Cycle]]

The ideal gas turbine cycle is shown above.
The four stages are

# Heat input at constant pressure during 1-2.
# Reversible adiabatic expansion during 2-3, where work is done.
# Heat rejection at constant pressure during 3-4.
# Reversible adiabatic compression during 4-1 where work is consumed.

Large amount of work is consumed in process 4-1 for a gas turbine cycle as the working material (gas) is very compressible.
The compressor needs to handle a large volume and achieve large compression ratios.

==== Analysis ====

The heat input in a gas turbine cycle is given by ''Q&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; = m c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'' and the heat rejected ''Q&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt; = m c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)''.
Thus the thermal efficiency is given by

&lt;math&gt;
  \eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{Q_{out}}{Q_{in}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  \eta_{th} = 1 -
  \left(
    \frac{T_3 - T_4}{T_2 - T_1}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
  \eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{T_4}{T_1}
  \left(
    \frac{\frac{T_3}{T_4} - 1}{\frac{T_2}{T_1} - 1}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Since the adiabatic processes take place between the same pressures, the temperature ratios are the same

&lt;math&gt;
  \eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{T_4}{T_1} = 1 - \frac{1}{
    \left(
    \frac{p_1}{p_4}
    \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Or

&lt;math&gt;
  \eta_{th} = 1 - \frac{1}{r_p^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''r&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the pressure ratio and is a fundamental quantity for the gas turbine cycle.

=== Refrigeration Cycles ===

The ideal refrigeration cycle is reverse of Carnot cycle, working as a heat pump instead of as a heat engine.
However, there are practical difficulties in making such a system work.

The ''gas refrigeration cycle'' is used in aircraft to cool cabin air.
The ambient air is compressed and then cooled using work from a turbine.
The turbine itself uses work from the compressed air, further cooling it.
The output of the turbine as well as the air which is used to cool the output of the compressor is mixed and sent to the cabin.

The Rankine vapor-compression cycle is a common alternative to the ideal Carnot cycle.
A working material such as Freon or R-134a, called the ''refrigerant'', is chosen based 
on its boiling point and heat of vaporization.  
The components of a vapor-compression refrigeration system are the compressor, condenser, the expansion (or throttling) valve, and the evaporator.
The working material (in gaseous form) is compressed by the compressor, and its output is cooled to a liquid in the condenser.
The output of the condenser is throttled to a lower pressure in the throttling valve, and sent to the evaporator which absorbs heat.
The gas from the evaporator is sent to the compressor, completing the cycle.

Standard refrigeration units use the throttling valve instead of a turbine to expand the gas as the work output that would be produced is not significant to justify the cost of a turbine.
There are irreversibilities associated with such an expansion, but it is cost effective when construction costs are considered.

Vietnamese cuisine (cuisine translates to ẩm thực in Vietnamese: ẩm: drink and thực: food) is known for its common use of fish sauce, soy sauce and hoisin sauce. Vietnamese recipes use many vegetables, herbs and spices, including lemon grass, lime, and kaffir lime leaves. Throughout all regions the emphasis is always on serving fresh vegetables and/or fresh herbs as side dishes along with dipping sauce. The Vietnamese also have a number of Buddhist vegetarian dishes. The most common meats used in Vietnamese cuisine are pork, beef, prawns, various kinds of tropical fish, and chicken. Duck and goat/lamb are used much less widely.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Echinodermata have radial symmetry, and so under this key would be classes as Cnidaria or Ctenophora.  I don't know how to fix this, however, without introducing more technical characters.

:I made it no longer incorrect, but it is still technical -- not such a big deal, I think, for one of the high level taxa like ''Animalia''. Can always be simplified later... [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 18:37, 20 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::This is only a superficial symmetry. If one considers e.g. the madreporite, then echinoderms are clearly bilateral symmetric. [[User:Lycaon|Lycaon]] 08:51, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lars Hennings. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lars Hennings~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation
&lt;/div&gt; 23:21, 17 March 2015 (UTC)

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information.

== Inkscape ==

There is a SVG electrical components library available, which should provide a possibility to draw the images in [[w:Inkscape|Inkscape]] or similar [[w:vector graphics editor|vector graphics editor]]:

[[Image:Electrical_symbols_library.svg|600px]]

The images remain editable, look nice even when scaled or printed and take small amount of space. 

You can edit this template and add more components, of course. See the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Electrical_symbols_library.svg image description page] for more info. 

See the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Created_with_electrical_symbols_library Category:Created_with_electrical_symbols_library] for examples.

== Klunky ==

[[Image:Electronics Template.PNG]]

I recommend using [http://www.qsl.net/wd9eyb/klunky/ Klunky schematic editor] to do diagrams, and have contacted the author to see about making my own version, with more parts and easier to get into 2-color PNG with transparency, etc.  See my Wikipedia page ([[Wikipedia:User:Omegatron#Electronics_diagrams]]) for some of the stuff I have done with it, and feel free to give me style suggestions or recommend other drawing programs/sites. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

For instance, the above would look like this, Klunkified, and took me this long to make.  (6 minutes?  That seems longer than it actually took.)  It is pretty nice for web graphics:

[[Image:klunkyexample.png]]

&quot;Not bad.  The question is how big we want our pictures to be?  

What would really be nice is to have some sort of circuit builder.  That would be a great way to teach electronics, but it would probably be a lot of work.

Circuit builder of choice: mspaint.exe&quot;

:I think we should use Klunky.  I have mentioned this a million times.  It is super easy, a uniform, good look for the web, much much faster than mspaint, everyone can access it, free, etc. etc.  see [[Electronics:Template]] for more. 

:My circuit builder of choice: klunky

:We should have some discussion, though.  It would be nice if we could all use the same thing and have nice looking graphics. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:32, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:: Is this something IE specific?  I followed the instructions with Mozilla and nothing happened. [[User:Norman Weiner|Norman Weiner]]

:::Hmm... I am using FireFox, which I guess is only somewhat related to Mozilla.  It works fine for me in both IE and Firefox.  If anyone knows how to change it so it is supported in all browsers, let me know, and I will add that change to the modified version. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

'''Instructions for making a Klunky drawing in Windows with the help of MSPaint:'''

# Open a window to http://www.qsl.net/wd9eyb/klunky/framed.html (or open the downloaded klunky.html on your own computer)
# Draw your circuit
#* Click on the desired component or wire in the top frame
#* Click in the bottom frame where you want the component to go, repeat for each component
#* To erase a block, just click on one of the blank squares in the top frame and click in the bottom frame where you want a blank.
#* Additional parts are located in the bottom row, by clicking the links to things such as &quot;L's &lt;&quot;, &quot;D's ^&quot;, &quot;Amps&quot;
#* You can slide your circuit in one direction to make more room for components by pushing left, right, up, or down
# Use the scroll bars to move the circuit so the entire circuit is visible
# Press the &quot;Print Screen&quot;, &quot;Print Scrn&quot;, or &quot;Prt Scn&quot; button on your keyboard.
# Run MSPaint
# Press Edit -&gt; Paste
# Use the resizing handles to crop the image to just the circuit
# Add labels, etc. with Arial 10 pt.
# Save as PNG
# Upload to Wikibooks

More detailed instructions are available at http://www.qsl.net/wd9eyb/klunky/guide.html

Note that there are many ways to streamline this process (steps 3 through 9), such as screen capture programs, etc.  I use Paint Shop myself, but it is certainly not the best solution.  I just use it out of habit.

----

Here are some others I made:

[[Image:klunky v and i source.png]]
[[Image:klunkyextras.png]]

I don't actually recommend that ugly 4 way connection.  That is just something I sent to the author of the program since he doesn't include a 4 way because it might get confused with the non contacting wires.  i think it is not very confusing, and you shuold just use a regular 4 way connection.  in fact, i will make one:

==Modified Klunky==

I modified the Klunky available on the web.  I added a bunch of new symbols (all of the above symbols, like ideal sources, cells, etc.), and tweaked a few so they were better, in my opinion.  Plus you can run it from your own machine, which is much faster.  You can download it from http://mysite.verizon.net/negatron/klunky.zip Just unzip it into a folder and then open klunky.html (however that site seems to be down.  keep checking and i will see if it is something i can fix.) Or you can give me your email address and I will send it. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

==TeX-based diagrams?==

Is there a way to create diagrams with a TeX-like language?  They are adding musical notation, hieroglyphs, etc. to the mediawiki.  I don't understand all the details but here is something similar: [http://www.ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/Circuit_macros/]. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 20:59, 26 May 2004 (UTC)

==Energy Analysis==

'''Figure 11.2:''' Potential, kinetic, and total energy of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator plotted as a function of spring displacement.

For a spring, Hooke's law says the total force is proportional to the displacement, and in the opposite direction.
:&lt;math&gt;F=-kx&lt;/math&gt;

Since this is independent of velocity, it is a conservative force. We can integrate to find the potential energy of the mass-spring system,

&lt;math&gt;V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2&lt;/math&gt;

Since a potential energy exists, the total energy 
:&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{1}{2}kx^2+\frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2&lt;/math&gt; 
is conserved, i. e., is constant in time. 

We can now use energy conservation to determine the velocity in terms of the position
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=\pm \sqrt{\frac{2E}{m}-\frac{k}{m}x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

We could integrate this to determine the position as a function of time, but we can deduce quite a bit from this equation as it is.

It is fairly evident how the mass moves. From Hooke's law, the mass is always ''accelerating'' toward the ''equilibrium position'', so we know which sign of the square root to take.

The velocity is zero when
:&lt;math&gt;x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{2E}{k}}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''x'' were larger than this the velocity would have to be imaginary, clearly impossible, so the mass must be confined between these values. We can call them the turning points.

If the mass is moving to the left, it slows down as it approaches the left turning point. It stops when it reaches this point and begins to move to the right. It accelerates until it passes the equilibrium position and then begins to decelerate, stopping at the right turning point, accelerating toward the left, etc. The mass thus oscillates between the left and right turning points. 

How does the period of the oscillation depend on the total energy of the system? 
We can get a general idea without needing to solve the differential equation.

There are only two parameters the period, ''T'', could depend on; the mass, ''m'', and the spring constant, ''k''.

We know ''T'' is measured in seconds, and ''m'' in kilograms. For the units in Hooke's law to match, ''k'' must be measured in N&amp;middot;m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, or equivalently, in kg&amp;middot;s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.

We immediately see that the only way to combine ''m'' and ''k'' to get something measured in seconds is to divide, cancelling out the kg's.

Therefore ''T''&amp;prop;&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{m/k}&lt;/math&gt;

We have established the general way the period depends on the parameters of the problem, without needing to use calculus.

This technique is called ''dimensional analysis'', and has wide application. E.g., if we couldn't calculate the proportionality constant exactly, using calculus, we'd be able to deduce by doing one experiment. Without dimensional analysis, if calculus failed us we'd have to do scores of experiments, each for different combinations of ''m'' and ''k''.

Fortunately, the proportionality constants are typically small numbers, like &lt;math&gt;3\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\pi}/2&lt;/math&gt;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi, welcome to Wikibooks. Re [[Abstract algebra/Groups]], I've changed some things back around (such as the isomorphisms section), because I think it is important that we introduce the concepts in order. Also try and keep the language relatively gentle. I'm trying to keep the language in these mathematics text precise, but not exceedingly dry. Don't forget to put the ''answers'' in to the even numbered  questions, if you add some! :)`

Thanks, and keep contributing. Let me know what you think of the changes. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:57, 21 Mar 2004 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Dan Gardner. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Dan Gardner~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:24, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal]] ==

I want to call the attention of all wikibookians, especially active admins to the discussion about the new voting policy. Wikibooks currently does not have a concrete voting policy in effect, so the adaptation of this policy will potentially create immediate differences in the way business is conducted here. Due to large amounts of discussion, changes, and dissention, there are several versions of this policy being considered:

*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 1|Version 1]] Written by [[User:Whiteknight]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 2|Version 2]] Written by [[User:Jguk]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 3|Version 3]] [[User:RobinH]]'s revision of Jguk's version
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 4|Version 4]] Written by [[User:Kellen]]
*[[Wikibooks:General voting rules/Proposal/Version 5|Version 5]] Whiteknight's Revision of Kellen's Version.

Also, there are additional issues being discussed, such as the inclusion of a &quot;minimum contributions&quot; clause, that will limit users with less then 20 votes from editing. Also, there is a proposed clause that would allow this 20 vote minimum to be raised in response to abuse.

I am sending this same message to all currently active admins. I hope you are able to come in and give your opinions on this matter. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:49, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Perl. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Perl~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

{{ingredient}}

'''Pasta''', or alimentary paste, is a class of foods made from an unleavened dough formed into a variety of shapes (most commonly, thin strips called &quot;noodles&quot;). It is a [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrate]]-rich basis for many meals.

== Varieties ==
Pasta comes in fresh and dried form. One is not necessarily better than the other. Dried pasta contains [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] and water; fresh pasta also contains [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. Egg noodles (fresh or dried) are always made with [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]].

Fresh pasta has a lighter flavor and a more tender bite, so it's better suited for more delicate sauces. Fresh pasta will keep for up to five days when refrigerated; dried pasta and egg noodles will keep almost indefinitely at room temperature.

Pasta is available in various forms, all shaped from a basic thin sheet of pasta-dough. Some types are served with a sauce, while others are used in soups.

===Asian pasta===
*[[Cookbook:Ramen Noodles|ramen]]: long, thin noodles, often served as a soup
*[[Cookbook:Soba|soba]]: short, thin buckwheat noodles
*[[w:Udon|udon]]: thick, round wheat noodles
*[[Cookbook:Vermicelli|vermicelli]]: long, thin rice noodles

===Italian pasta===
Pasta comes in two main types: fresh ''pasta fresca'' and dry ''pasta''. 

Fresh pasta includes egg pasta ([[cookbook:Pasta fresca all'uovo|''pasta fresca all'uovo]]''), and pasta made with water only. Filled pasta includes tortellini, ravioli, agnolotti, which are made of egg pasta filled with meat, [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] or [[Cookbook:Ricotta|ricotta cheese]]. 

Decades ago in Italy, fresh pasta was made at home, or you can buy it at special shops or at supermarkets. But the best is home-made.

Dry pasta is an industrial product, and  different types of pasta are of different thicknesses and sizes, and are made to be used in different dishes. The thinner and smaller a pasta is, the quicker it will cook. 

Italians have a word for how to cook pasta best: ''al dente'', which means &quot;to the tooth&quot;. This means the pasta must not be undercooked - which leaves a taste of uncooked flour - yet it must not be overcooked. The pasta must be able to retain its texture and be softened, yet firm to the bite.

Italian dried pasta is made with water and durum wheat.
This is a very hard wheat with a high protein content and it helps to make the pasta firm.
Fresh pasta, ''pasta fatta in casa'', is made with normal wheat and eggs.
However, there are also types of dried pasta which have egg in them to resemble the taste of fresh pasta, as well as commercial fresh pasta made with a combination of wheat, durum wheat, eggs and water, which helps the pasta to keep longer.
Both dried and fresh pasta are appreciated in Italy and used for a wide variety of dishes.

In the process of mass production of pasta, the end product is transported through an oven which dries the dough. With lower quality pasta this process is done relatively quickly, resulting in a darker coloring. High quality pasta is dried much slower and as a result is much lighter in color - and more expensive.

There are over 650 distinct varieties of Italian pasta, as every shape and size has its own name. Some of these are rarely seen outside Italy, while others are common worldwide. Note that the same type of pasta may have different names in different areas of Italy. Here are some of the common shapes:

*[[w:bucatini|''bucatini'']]: thick empty spaghetti
*[[w:capellini|''capellini'']]: known as angel hair pasta in English; a very fine, fast-cooking pasta
*[http://www.recipetips.com/glossary-term/t--35245/ditalini-pasta.asp ''ditalini'']: a small, tubed-shaped pasta
*[[w:farfalle|''farfalle'']]: 'bow ties', usually made with egg and/or spinach
*[[w:fettuccine|''fettuccine'']]: wide flat noodles in varying lengths and widths
*[[cookbook:fusilli|''fusilli'']]: narrow corkscrews
*[[w:gnocchi|''gnocchi'']]: potato or ricotta pasta
*[[cookbook:lasagne|''lasagne'']]: a wide flat pasta, used for the classic baked dish
*[[w:linguine|''linguine'']]: long flattened ovals, similar to spaghetti
*[[w:maccheroni|''maccheroni'']]: the ubiquitious small curled tubes
*[[cookbook:Orzo|''orzo'']]: pasta in the form of large grains of rice.
*[[w:pappardelle|''pappardelle'']]: a long inch-wide flat pasta with crinkled edges, usually served with a very rich sauce
*[[w:penne|''penne'']]: long narrow tubes cut diagonally at the ends
*[[cookbook:ravioli|''ravioli'']]: square stuffed pasta, often filled with meat or a cheese-based filling
*[[w:rigatoni|''rigatoni'']]: inch-long ridged tubes, often used in baked dishes
*[[Cookbook:spaghetti|''spaghetti'']]: the traditional long narrow tubes
*[[w:Tagliatelle|''tagliatelle'']]: ribbons of pasta, work well with hearty meat-based sauces.
*[[w:tortellini|''tortellini'']]: a crescent-shaped stuffed pasta
*[[cookbook:vermicelli|''vermicelli'']]: thin, worm-shaped noodles

==Cooking pasta==
Both fresh and dried pasta are usually cooked by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] in a large amount of water, which may be salted according to taste. Fresh pasta will cook in less than five minutes; dried pasta takes longer: 9 to 12 minutes, depending on the variety. If you are cooking an unfamiliar brand or variety, keep checking. Most people prefer pasta when it is ''al dente'' - that is when it still offers some resistance to the bite.

Consult the [[Cookbook:Boiled pasta|boiled pasta]] page for a more thorough explanation of how to cook pasta.

==Flavoring==
Plain pasta is usually bland. You may wish to flavor it with salt, olive oil, butter or a sauce. Tomato-based sauces are classically associated with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italian]] pasta dishes.

In some pastas the dough is flavoured or colored with an extra ingredient such as squid ink (for a black color), beet juice (for a vibrant red), tomato puree (for an orange tint) or spinach (for a green color). Pasta can also be flavoured with [[Cookbook:Chile|chili peppers]] for a spicy kick, or with [[Cookbook:Truffle|truffles]], for the unique flavour that only truffles can bring to a dish.
==Pasta recipes==
*[[Cookbook:Pasta_Recipes|pasta recipes]]

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Pasta names ending in -ini refer to a small variety of some type of pasta, and those ending in -oni or -one refer to a large variety. For instance, farfallini are small farfalle and farfallone are large ones.
* When making a pasta sauce (whether based on tomatoes, cream, bechamel or just 'dry' vegetables), it's a good idea to add a couple of tablespoons of the sauce's cooking fat (usually butter or olive oil) to the pasta when tossing it. 
* When incorporating a flavoring or coloring ingredient into pasta dough, it's important to take the water content into consideration. Beets, for instance, contain a lot of moisture, so less water should be added to the dough to compensate.

&quot;'''Collard Greens'''&quot; refers both to the plant and the cooked recipe.

==Background==
[[File:Collard greens.jpg|thumb|Collard greens freshly washed, still attached to the stalk.]]
The collard plant is a large, loose-leafed dark green member of the [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] family which grows easily and readily. It is unique because it flourishes in cool weather, often tolerating temperatures as low as 5°F (-10°C) if it is gradually acclimated, while a sudden cool snap will kill it. The plant may reach three feet tall by four feet wide. Though it is infrequently done, they may be cooked with any other loose-leafed greens ([[Cookbook:Kale|kale]], [[Cookbook:turnip|turnip greens]], [[Cookbook:spinach|spinach]] and [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard greens]]). Collards and other green leafy vegetables comprise several traditional &quot;[[Cookbook:soul food|soul food]]&quot; dishes of the southern US.

[[File:Tearing collard greens.jpg|thumb|left|Collard greens are easily hand shredded for cooking ease.]]
Collards are available year-round, but the best growing, and traditional, seasons are autumn or winter. Many people prefer their taste after the first frost, and believe them richer and more nutritious. Collards do become sweeter after the first frost, when photosynthesis is slowed. 

When buying collards, make sure to choose dark green leaves with no wilting or yellowness. They may ideally be stored in the refrigerator about a week, but once they are cooked can be frozen indefinitely or added to other dishes as desired. 

[[File:Smoked neckbone.jpg|thumb|Smoked pork neckbone.]]
Collard greens belong to the family ''Brassica oleracea'', which contains several varieties of cultivars including broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, Chinese broccoli, kale, and kohlrabi.

Traditional Southern recipes for collards often include some type of pork, sometimes a portion of the neck bone, as a flavoring agent, which is boiled along with the greens. 

==Nutrition==
Nutritionally, collards are an excellent source of calcium and  vitamins A &amp; C. They are virtually fat-free, low in calories and sodium, and are an excellent source of carbohydrates and dietary fiber. A one-cup serving of boiled collards contains 17 calories, 0.1g fat, 10mg sodium, 0.9g protein, 3.9g carbohydrate, 1.3g dietary fiber, 174.7 RE of vitamin A (17% US RDA), and 7.7mg vitamin C (13% US RDA).

'''Kale''' is a very bitter open-headed member of the [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] family. It can be cooked in combination with [[Cookbook:Collard Green|Collard greens]] or with other milder ingredients to soften its harsh flavour. It can also be substituted for [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] in most dishes.

Kale must be kept cold to avoid bitterness and wilting. Choose smaller leaves because they will be less strongly flavoured, and use them quickly as the bitterness will intensify rapidly after picking. If the leaves are very small and tender, the stems can also be used, but they become woody and tough as the plant grows, so they may need to be removed before cooking.

Frisee is a curly-leafed [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]] vegetable (sometimes referred to as 'baby curly endive'). It is a close relative to [[Cookbook:Chicory|Chicory]] or [[Cookbook:Endive|Endive]] (which, to add confusion are actually the same thing only with different names on different continents). The outside leaves of the frisee are very coarse and bitter, so they are generally discarded. Try to choose a head with many small baby leaves instead, as they are much milder. 

Frisee greens can also be cooked and added to [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] or other dishes.

''Two atoms are walking down the street. The first atom says to the second atom &quot;I think I lost an electron!&quot; The second says &quot;Are you sure?&quot; To which the first states &quot;I'm positive!&quot;''

==Electrons==

''This is a rough draft''

Electronics is the study and use of devices that control the flow of electrons (or other charged particles).  These devices can be used to process information or perform tasks using electromagnetic power.

Atoms, the smallest particles of matter ''(which cannot be divided and still blah blah)'', are made of protons, electrons, and neutrons.

Electrons have a negative charge, and protons have a positive charge.  Neutrons have no charge.  The notation that a charge is positive or negative is arbitrary.

Particles that have the same charge (such as two electrons) have a tendency to push each other away; to ''repel''. Particles with opposite charge (such as a proton and an electron) tend to move closer together, or ''attract''.  This effect extends from every particle to infinity, although it decreases with distance.  It is called the particle's ''electric field''.

Protons and neutrons combine to form the atom's nucleus, with electrons circling them at a relatively great distance (held near the protons by the fact that they are oppositely charged).  

All atoms have electrons surrounding them, which tend to exist in several layers.  (The modern model of the atom, which involves quantum mechanics, is more complicated, but both models are equally valid for electronics, so we will use the vastly simpler classical model for our introduction to electronics.)  The outermost electrons are free to move from atom to atom.  The inner shells of electrons are held tightly to just one atom.  The electrons that are free to move are called ''valence electrons''.

Electronic devices are based on the following principles:
# Atoms in certain types of materials (called ''conductors'') have many electrons which are free to move from atom to atom.
# Atoms in other types of materials (called ''insulators'') do not have many free electrons, and so the electrons tend to stay attached to the same atom.
# Electrons are repelled from other electrons.

The most commonly used conductors are metals.  Metals have electrons that are very free to move from atom to atom, and do so constantly.  This is sometimes thought of as many atomic nuclei surrounded by a &quot;sea of electrons&quot;.

==Voltage==
''This is a rough draft.''

This section talks about the nature of voltage and current.  Voltage and current sources and series and parallel voltage and current belong in the DC section.  I'm not sure where voltage drops should go.

Voltage is a potential in an electric field between two charges.  A voltage drop  is a change in potential.  Voltages add or subtract in series.  (Relate this to voltage symbol) 

''(Moved to talk page)''

Two electrically charged particles separated by a distance will have a potential energy associated with them, 

Potential energy between two charges, where k is a constant, q and Q are the value of the two charges and r is the distance.  Note that potential falls off as 1/r.  

&lt;math&gt;PE = {k q_{1} q_{2} \over r} &lt;/math&gt;

The potential divided by the amount of charge is the voltage:

&lt;math&gt;V = {PE \over Q}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Volt = {Joule \over Coulomb}&lt;/math&gt;

===Ideal voltage sources===

An ideal voltage source is a fundamental electronics component that creates a constant voltage between two points regardless of whatever else is connected to it.  Since it is ideal, some circuit configurations are not allowed.

''Real'' voltage sources, such as batteries, power supplies, piezoelectric disks, generators, etc. have an internal source impedance (in series with the source), which is very important to understand.

==Current==

It is sometimes taught that current in electric circuits is composed of electrons, which flow from the negative terminal of the power source to the positive at the speed of light.  This is not (completely) true.

# Electricity is carried by charged particles.
#: This can mean ''any'' small particles that carry charge and are free to move.  In metals, electrons are free to move and the metal nuclei are not.  In salt water, however, electrons, negative ions, and positive ions are free to move, and do, when a voltage is applied (batteries and electrolytic capacitors are examples of electrical components that carry charge as ions).  In your own nerve cells, electricity is carried by moving ions, such as potassium and sodium.  In semiconductors, electricity is carried by electrons, but is often much more easily understood as movement of &quot;holes&quot;; the absence of an electron.  ''In some static electricity experiments, electricity can be carried by charged dust or small pieces of paper.''
# Electrons ''drift'' through conductors.
#* When you flip the light switch, the light comes on almost instantly.  This does not mean that the electrons themselves move that quickly.  In fact, they usually move much much slower.  A typical speed for electron drift in a DC electronic circuit is slower than molasses.  The electrons themselves ''are'' moving very quickly, but not in one direction.  They are constantly moving randomly from atom to atom, and only have a very gradual drift, or shift in average position over time.  The speed electrons drift actually depends on voltage, resistance of the conductor, shape of the conductor, material the conductor is made of, temperature, and other factors.
#* What is actually traveling quickly is ''electromagnetic waves''; the pushing of electrons by their neighbors.  This is similar to the way a wave in water works.  When you drop a stone in a pond, a wave spreads out from where the stone hit the surface.  But does the water itself move?  Not really.  The water molecules at the surface are just moving back and forth, and their cumulative effect is the wave that you see, which travels in one direction.  This is similar to the travel of an AC wave down a transmission line.  (''we could make a better analogy to waves of car traffic or waves of people in line for a ride at the fair'')  An interesting analogy would be moving a hand through air.  The hand is the wave and the air is the random electron movement. 
# Electromagnetic waves only travel at the speed of light in a vacuum.
#* What is usually meant when someone says &quot;the speed of light&quot; is actually &quot;the speed of light in a vacuum&quot;, as light itself slows down while traveling through materials.  A typical speed for a signal traveling down common coaxial cable is 2/3 the speed of light (in a vacuum).  (This is about 200,000,000 m/s.)  The wave traveling down the cable is actually the same thing as light, just at a different frequency.  The waves traveling through your nerves as you read this are traveling at about 120 m/s.

(Section relating voltage to current.)  As you increase voltage you apply an electric field to electrons and they travel from the negative to the positive potential.  This is why increasing voltage directly increases current.  Reversing the voltage reverses the current.  Without resistance this is effectively a short meaning the electrons flow unhindered.

(section where you have voltage but no current.) Sometimes you have voltage but no current.  Describe its effects on circuits.

So, negative particles drift from negative to positive voltage, and positive particles drift in the opposite direction from positive to negative voltage.  The particles drift at different speeds in different materials.  speed of &quot;holes&quot; based on bandgap.  Given the presence of holes we tend to ignore the particles and focus on the current flow.  Current is measured by the amount of charge flow per unit time and represents the speed of the electromagnetics waves.  In talking about current we will mainly talk about electrons flowing, as they are the predominant charge carriers in metal and many circuit components.

Voltage = potential between two charges.  
Defined as the derivative of the flux linkage:

&lt;math&gt;V(t)={d(Ni(t)) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Current = flow of electrons
Defined as the rate of change of the charge:

&lt;math&gt;I(t)={dQ(t) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;

===Ideal current sources===

An ideal voltage source is a fundamental electronics component that creates a constant current through a section of circuit, regardless of whatever else is connected to it.  Since it is ideal, some circuit configurations are not allowed.

''Real'' current sources, such as batteries, power supplies, piezoelectric disks, generators, etc. have an internal source impedance (in parallel with the source), which is very important to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've ceased keeping up on things.  I'm going to contact The MathWorks again to see if they are putting up a wiki and what it would take to get an annotated manual started.  - rs2 11/19/2004

Almost a year to the day since I was last here!  Woh, what happened to my life?  [[User:Rs2|Rs2]] 06:33, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

===Matlab===
My major goal had been to start a Wiki [[MATLAB Programming]] Reference Text here.  I didn't put any copyrighted material onto this website.  That being said, I am curious how one goes about writing a reference about a piece of software that is proprietary.  I had been in contact with Mathworks to determine if there is any way to incorporate the existing manual into a Wiki, probably a Wiki owned and operated by Mathworks.  However, I got really busy and quit caring.  For some home computing I wanted to get a copy of MATLAB and realized it costs almost $2k, so now I'm using Octave.  My goal is not only to see good, wikified documentation on Octave, but also to see Octave bring about the downfall of MATLAB -- the MathWorks can live on, but $2k is TOO much for MATLAB.

===Wikis===
I'm also tried to put together a [[Wiki Science:How to start a Wiki|Wiki HowTo]] documenting what I learned about how to start a Wiki, but the same time constraints apply.  I just looked at that page and it's really taken off.  Now when I get time, I can go back and read all the answers to the questions I didn't even know to ask 18 months ago when I was trying to get my own wiki started.

===Pages I yanked because they were in bad shape===
I'm starting to doubt the following page will ever get put back where I had it.  I think the book will evolve beyond it or die anyway.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protons and neutrons combine to form the atom's nucleus (a force called the strong force holds the protons together), with electrons circling them at a relatively great distance (held near the protons by the fact that they are oppositely charged). (is this even an accurate way to think of it? quantum mechanics, probabilities, etc.) 

&gt;&gt; In all reality, getting in to quantum mechanics wouldn't benefit the reader. It's more or less a lesson on the basics of an atom. Getting into quantum mechanics may show how smart you are, but in the end probably won't help someone that is trying to understand.

:That's very true.  Hmm...  I just don't want to give out information that is incorrect, which will confuse them if they ever want to learn more about it, you know?  Like when they teach very basic electricity in high school physics, and you have to &quot;unlearn&quot; things that were simplified (like current direction) in order to learn in-depth electronics later.  We can say things like &quot;the electrons are orbiting the nucleus in shells&quot; but then clarify that in reality this is just a model, which works well for electronics but is not what physicists currently use.  I don't even know about the quantum mechanics myself, I only know that electrons spinning around in shells is not really an accurate idea anymore; it has to do with clouds of probability and electron waves and weird things like that. - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]]

:The debate on 'electron clouds' vs. 'shells' and such probably should be left for a molecular physics textbook. I agree that the idea of shells is simple and easy to learn, although may be slightly flawed in today's sense. For what we're dealing with though, I think we should concentrate on the atom, electrons, and how they pertain to electricity in general. Leave the other stuff for someone that wants to get more in-depth. I know the feeling when you are really skilled at something and cringe at basic lessons and certain incorrect things, but they are a neccesary evil.

:I agree with Omegatron, you should not give misleading information.  I would just give the very basics and leave it at that.  You can see my attempt to explain the basic physics [[Electron_Device_Modeling:Semiconductor_Physics]].  Both the 'electron clouds' and 'shells' are just models.  I have used the shells explanation.  Basically no two electrons can share the same orbit (which is a wave).  There are a number of orbits with different energies (shells).  The first energy level contains two orbits, second energy level contains 8 orbits, ect.  Electrons can jump between orbits in a quantum leap.  So the electrons are not spinning in shells, the shells represent the energy level of the electron in the electron cloud.  [[User:Peterblockley|Peterblockley]] 22:58, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:The problem is that this is really hard to understand for someone with no background in the quantum physics. I'm sure it's really easy for you to understand, however the problem is you forget how you interpreted things when you did not know any at all. Your type of articles seem to be targeted at people that already have background in modern physics and a university degree / college diploma.

::who is this book targeted at?  It says a 1st or 2nd year level.  Is this High school?  Or university?  Im not advocating using [[Electron_Device_Modeling:Semiconductor_Physics]] for this book (that is why its in a separate book).  On a more general note, is it possible to combine both a full explanation as well as a simplified explanation?  Seems to me this may be possible with the internet as a medium.  What do you think? [[User:Peterblockley|Peterblockley]] 03:39, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:::It's not true to say that &quot;no two electrons can share the same orbit&quot;. If you are going to get into QM you should not talk about orbits at all! QM says that no two electrons can have the same set of quantum numbers. If you think of an &quot;orbit&quot; as being ''The average distance from the nucleus'', (Which is the only sensible way to do it IMO) then there are '''2''' electrons in the very first orbit. It's all getting way too complicated. Why not just say ''with electrons to be found at a relatively great distance (held near the protons by the fact that they are oppositely charged)''. By removing the ''circling'' word you get rid of an untruth but don't make it too difficult. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 06:56, 28 Mar 2004 (UTC)


::&quot;The aim of this textbook is to educate someone with little or no previous experience in electronics to a 1 or 2 year level.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Basically we're trying to teach someone that hasn't touched electronics before from ground up. 1-2 year level meaning up to college/university. So basically, start from ground 0 and head up.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a biologist, specialized in molecular plant virology. I just learned about the wiki concept very recently (march 2004), and am fascinated with it. I have started to write about plant virology for the [[Botany/Microbes]] chapter of the botany textbook. Originally from the Netherlands, I have been living in Basel, Switzerland since 1996. I did my PhD and a postdoc here, but am currently at home looking after our daughter and expecting a second child. Contributing here may help me to keep my neurons exercised ;-)</text>
