== Grammar: The Accusative ==

As you learned in the last lesson, the verb 'esse' (to be) usually takes the nominative case, because then the word after it is a complement.  Most other verbs take the 'accusative' case. 

In a sentence, the accusative is the &quot;what&quot; - in English grammar, this is known as the direct object.

&lt;b&gt;For example:&lt;/b&gt;
The girl sells the box.

What did the girl sell? The box. Thus, box is the direct object, and when we translate it into Latin:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;4&quot; | '''Example'''
|-
| ''English:'' || The girl|| sells|| the box.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puella|| vendit|| cistam.
|-
| ''Explanation:'' || NOMINATIVE || VERB
| ACCUSATIVE
|}

Cistam, then, is in the accusative, because it is the direct object.

Again, when an adjective describes a noun in the accusative case, the adjective must agree in number, case, and gender.

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;5&quot; | '''Example'''
|-
| ''English:'' || The girl|| sells|| the big || box.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puella|| vendit|| magnam || cistam.
|-
| ''Explanation:'' || NOMINATIVE || VERB || ADJECTIVE ACCUSATIVE|| NOUN ACCUSATIVE
|}

Because Latin uses cases to mark the subject and the object of a sentence, word order does not matter. Consider:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| puer puellam videt || The boy sees the girl
|-
| puerum puella videt || The girl sees the boy
|-
| puellam puer videt || The boy sees the girl
|-
| puella puerum videt || The girl sees the boy
|}

== Examples of Adjectives Agreeing with the Nominative and Accusative Case ==

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''good'' boy loves the ''wild'' dog.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || puer || '''bonus''' || amat || canem (acc) || '''ferocem''' (acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] boy || '''good''' || [he] loves || [the] dog || '''wild'''. 
|}

''Bonus'', a first and second declension adjective, is masculine, nominative, and singular to agree with ''puer'', the word it is describing.

''Ferocem'', a third declension adjective, is masculine, accusative, and singular to agree with ''canem''. ''Canem'' is accusative because it is the object of ''amat''.

Here is an example of plural adjectives:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''good'' boys love the ''wild'' dogs.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Pueri (plur) || '''boni''' (plur)|| amant (plur) || canes (plur, acc) || '''feroces''' (plur, acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] boys || '''good''' || [they] love || [the] dogs || '''wild'''. 
|}

The words  ''bonus'' and ''ferocem'' become ''boni'' and ''feroces'' to agree with the plurals ''pueri'' and ''canes''.

However, if a girl ([[wiktionary:en:puella#Latin|puella]]) happened to love that boy:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''good'' girl loves the ''good'' boy.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puella || '''bona'''|| amat || puerum (acc) || '''bonum''' (acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] girl|| '''good''' || [she] loves || [the] boy|| '''good'''. 
|}

''Bonus'' must become ''bona'' in order to modify ''puella'', which is feminine.

Finally, if the girl isn't good, but rather wild:

{| cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | '''Explanation'''- The ''wild'' girl loves the ''good'' boy.
|-
| ''Latin:'' || Puella || '''ferox'''|| amat || puerum (acc) || '''bonum''' (acc).
|-
| ''English:'' || [The] girl|| '''wild''' || [she] loves || [the] boy|| '''good'''. 
|}

Even though ''puella'' is first declension, ''ferox'' remains third declension. In the same way, a good lion would be ''bonus leo''.

== Exercise 3 ==

Determine whether the adjective agrees with the substantive in all three categories: case, gender, number.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Questions:
! Does it Agree?
|-
| 1. magn-us agr-ōs || True/False
|-
| 2. magn-a puella || True/False
|-
| 3. poet-a* bon-us || True/False
|-
| 4. magn-um serv-um || True/False
|-
| 5. poet-ae* magn-ae || True/False
|-
| 6. bell-a magn-a || True/False
|}

:''* Nota bene: ''Poeta'' (meaning poet) is a masculine noun, even though it ends in '''-a'''.''

{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
See table above. Determine whether the adjective (magnus, bonus..) agrees with the substantives (ager, puella, poeta) in both case (nominative, accusative...), gender (masculine, female and neuter) and number (singular and plural).
|
# '''False.''' ''Magnus'' doesn't agree with ''agrōs''; in number and case.
#:''Magnus'': Masculine, singular, nominative.
#:''Agrōs'': Masculine, plural, accusative.
# '''True.''' ''Magna'' agrees with ''puella''.
#:''Magna'': Feminine, singular, nominative.
#:''Puella'': Feminine, singular, nominative.
# '''True.''' ''Bonus'' agrees with ''poeta''.
#:''Bonus'': Masculine, singular, nominative.
#:''Poeta'': Masculine, singular, nominative.
# '''True.''' ''Magnum'' agrees with ''servum''.
#:''Magnum'': Neuter, singular, nominative.
#:''Servum'': Neuter, singular, nominative.
# '''False.''' ''Magnae'' doesn't agree with ''poetae''; in gender.
#:''Magnae'': Feminine, plural, nominative.
#:''Poetae'': Masculine, plural, nominative.
# '''True.''' ''Bella'' agrees with ''magna''.
#:''Bella'': Neuter, plural, nominative.
#:''Magna'': Neuter, plural, nominative.

|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Nota Bene: 'fuisse' and all the forms of it, the past tense of 'esse', behaves exactly like the present tense.
|}


The newly introduced verbs, ama-t, curri-t, and porta-t take the accusative as the 'object'.  Unless specified, any verb you look up in the dictionary will take the accusative, not the nominative. This means that they are '''transitive verbs''', verbs that happen to someone or something, e.g.:

 I heal '''you'''. (''acc.'')
 You make '''my day'''. (''acc.'')
 She hit '''your arm'''. (''acc.'')

In the examples above, the '''bold''' words are the subject of the sentence clause. Because something happens &quot;to&quot; them, they can't be in nominative.

A '''noun''', or '''noun substantive''', is a part of speech (a word or phrase)  which functions as the head of a noun phrase. The word &quot;noun&quot; derives from the Latin ''nomen'' meaning &quot;name&quot;, and a traditional definition of nouns is that they are only those expressions that refer to a person, place, thing, event, substance, quality, or idea. They serve as the subject or object of a verb and as the governed term of a preposition, and can co-occur with articles and attributive adjectives.

There are different groups of nouns:

*'''Common nouns'''&amp;mdash;&quot;''chair''&quot;,
*'''Proper nouns'''&amp;mdash;&quot;''Fred''&quot;,
*'''Abstract nouns'''&amp;mdash;&quot;''love''&quot;,
*'''Collective nouns'''&amp;mdash;&quot;''gaggle''&quot;,
*'''Compound nouns'''&amp;mdash;&quot;''butterfly''&quot;,
*'''Verbal nouns'''&amp;mdash;&quot;''triumphing''&quot;.

Each of these different groups of nouns have different properties, each making them different in how we use them.

Thus, nouns are names of objects, places, people and things. They are used with adjectives to describe something, and with verbs to show an action.


==Concrete nouns==

Concrete nouns are proper nouns and common nouns.

===Proper nouns===

'''Proper nouns''' are the names of people, places, groups or dates: as, ''Adam'', ''Boston'', ''the Hudson'', ''the Romans'', ''the Azores'', ''the Alps''. They almost always have a capital letter as their first letter. Example:

*&quot;''Timmy'' is not someone to be toyed with.&quot;No one likes to hear other people boast their talents

===Common nouns===

'''Common nouns''' are the names of a sort, kind, or class, of beings or things: as, ''beast'', ''bird'', ''fish'', ''insect'', ''creatures'', ''persons'', ''children''. They often refer to objects or things which we can see, touch and feel, like the word ''chair''. Example:

*&quot;I sat at the ''table''.&quot;

====Individual nouns====
Their refer to only one thing of the same kind, for eg: man, player, cow, chicken, minister.

====Collective nouns====

'''Collective nouns''' are the names of a groups of objects or many individuals together: as, ''council'', ''meeting'', ''committee'', ''flock''. Example:

*&quot;They are a ''group''.&quot;

==Abstract nouns== 

'''Abstract nouns''' are the names of some particular qualities considered apart from its substance: as, ''goodness'', ''hardness'', ''pride'', ''frailty''. They are often names of the things that we cannot touch or see, but are there all the same. Example:

*&quot;I think I've fallen in ''love''!&quot;

===Attribute===

===Verbal nouns===

'''Verbal nouns''' or '''participial nouns''' are the names of some actions, or states of being; and are formed from a verb, like a participle, but employed as a noun: as,

*&quot;The ''triumphing'' of the wicked is short.&quot;&amp;mdash;Job, XX, 5.

===Sui generis===

A thing '''sui generis''', (i.e., of its own peculiar kind,) is something which is distinguished, not as an individual of a species, but as a sort by itself, without plurality in either the noun or the sort of thing: as, ''galvanism'', ''music'', ''geometry''.

==Words and word groups used as nouns==

==Countable and uncountable nouns==

==Inflections of Nouns==

Nouns have modifications of genders, numbers, and cases.

===Genders===

Genders, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish objects in regard to sex.

There are three genders; the masculine, the feminine, and the neuter:

#The '''masculine''' gender is that which denotes persons or animals of the male kind: as, ''man, father, king''.
#The '''feminine''' gender is that which denotes persons or animals of the female kind: as, ''woman, mother, queen''.
#The '''neuter''' gender is that which denotes things that are neither male nor female: as, ''pen, ink, paper''.

Hence, names of males are masculine; names of females, feminine; and names of things inanimate, literally, neuter.

* Masculine nouns make regular feminines, when their termination is changed to ''ess'': as,

:''Hunter, huntress; prince, princess; lion, lioness''.

* In some instances the syllable ''ess'' is simply added: as,

:''Accuser, accuseress; advocate, advocatess; archer, archeress; author, authoress; avenger, avengeress; barber, barberess; baron, baroness; canon, canoness; cit, cittess; coheir, coheiress; count, countess; deacon, deaconess; demon, demoness; diviner, divineress; doctor, doctoress; giant, giantess; god, goddess; guardian, guardianess; Hebrew, Hebrewess; heir, heiress; herd, herdess; hermit, hermitess; host, hostess; Jesuit, Jesuitess; Jew, Jewess; mayor, mayoress; Moabite, Moabitess; monarch, monarchess; pape, papess; or, pope, popess; patron, patroness; peer, peeress; poet, poetess; priest, priestess; prior, prioress; prophet, prophetess; regent, regentess; saint, saintess; shepherd, shepherdess; soldier, soldieress; tailor, tailoress; viscount, viscountess; warrior, warrioress''.

* In other instances, the termination is changed, and there is no increase of syllables: as,

:''Abbot, abbess; actor, actress; adulator, adulatress; adulterer, adulteress; adventurer, adventuress; advoutrer, advoutress; ambassador, ambassadress; anchorite, anchoress; or, anachoret, anachoress; arbiter, arbitress; auditor, auditress; benefactor, benefactress; caterer, cateress; chanter, chantress; cloisterer, cloisteress; commander, commandress; conductor, conductress; creator, creatress; demander, demandress; detractor, detractress; eagle, eagless; editor, editress; elector, electress; emperor, emperess, or empress; emulator, emulatress; enchanter, enchantress; exactor, exactress; fautor, fautress; fornicator, fornicatress; fosterer, fosteress, or fostress; founder, foundress; governor, governess; huckster, huckstress; or, hucksterer, hucksteress; idolater, idolatress; inhabiter, inhabitress; instructor, instructress; inventor, inventress; launderer, launderess, or laundress; minister, ministress; monitor, monitress; murderer, murderess; negro, negress; offender, offendress; ogre, ogress; porter, portress; progenitor, progenitress; protector, protectress; proprietor, proprietress; pythonist, pythoness; seamster, seamstress; solicitor, solicitress; songster, songstress; sorcerer, sorceress; suitor, suitress; tiger, tigress; traitor, traitress; victor, victress; votary, votaress''.

* In a few instances the feminine is formed as in Latin, by changing ''or'' to ''rix''; but some of these have also the regular form, which ought to be preferred: as,

:''Adjutor, adjutrix; administrator, administratrix; arbitrator, arbitratrix; coadjutor, coadjutrix; competitor, competitress, or competitrix; creditor, creditrix; director, directress, or directrix; executor, executress, or executrix; inheritor, inheritress, or inheritrix; mediator, mediatress, or mediatrix; orator, oratress, or oratrix; rector, rectress, or rectrix; spectator, spectatress, or spectatrix; testator, testatrix; tutor, tutoress, or tutress, or tutrix; deserter, desertress, or desertrice, or desertrix''.

* The following are irregular words, in which the distinction of sex is chiefly made by the termination:

:''Amoroso, amorosa: archduke, archduchess; chamberlain, chambermaid; duke, duchess; gaffer, gammer; goodman, goody, or goodwife; hero, heroine; landgrave, landgravine; margrave, margravine; marquis, marchioness; palsgrave, palsgravine; sakeret, sakerhawk; sewer, sewster; sultan, sultana; tzar, tzarina; tyrant, tyranness; widower, widow''.

===Numbers===

Numbers, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish unity and plurality.

There are two numbers; the '''singular''' and the '''plural'''.

The singular number is that which denotes but one: as,

*&quot;The boy learns.&quot;

The plural number is that which denotes more than one: as,

*&quot;The boys learn.&quot;

* Plurals in meaning and form:

:''Analects, annals, archives, ashes, assets, billiards, bowels, breeches, calends, cates, chops, clothes, compasses, crants, eaves, embers, estovers, forceps, giblets, goggles, greaves, hards or hurds, hemorrhoids, ides, matins, nippers, nones, obsequies, orgies, piles, pincers or pinchers, pliers, reins, scissors, shears, skittles, snuffers, spectacles, teens, tongs, trowsers, tweezers, umbles, vespers, victuals''.

* Plurals by formation, derived chiefly from adjectives:

:''Acoustics, aeronautics, analytics, bitters, catoptrics, commons, conics, credentials, delicates, dioptrics, economics, ethics, extraordinaries, filings, fives, freshes, glanders, gnomonics, goods, hermeneutics, hustings, hydrodynamics, hydrostatics, hydraulics, hysterics, inwards, leavings, magnetics, mathematics, measles, mechanics, mnemonics, merils, metaphysics, middlings, movables, mumps, nuptials, optics, phonics, phonetics, physics, pneumatics, poetics, politics, riches, rickets, settlings, shatters, skimmings, spherics, staggers, statics, statistics, stays, strangles, sundries, sweepings, tactics, thanks, tidings, trappings, vives, vitals, wages, withers, yellows''.

* Plurals by composition:

:''Backstairs, cocklestairs, firearms, headquarters, hotcockles, spatterdashes, self-affairs. To these may be added the Latin words, aborigines, antipodes, antes, antoeci, amphiscii, anthropophagi, antiscii, ascii, literati, fauces, regalia, and credenda, with the Italian vermicelli, and the French belles-lettres and entremets''.

====Regular plurals====

The plural form is usually represented orthographically by adding ''s'' to the singular form. The phonetic form of the plural morpheme is {{IPA|[z]}} by default. When the preceding sound is a voiceless consonant, it is pronounced {{IPA|[s]}}. Examples: ''boy'' makes ''boys''; ''girl'', ''girls''; ''chair'', ''chairs''; ''cat'', ''cats''. 

Where a noun ends in a sibilant sound, the plural is formed by adding ''es'' (pronounced {{IPA|[?z]}}), which is spelled ''es'' if the word does not already end with ''e'': ''glass'' makes ''glasses''; ''dish, dishes; witch, witches; phase, phases; judge, judges''.

Most nouns ending in ''o'' preceded by a consonant also form their plurals by adding ''es'' (pronounced {{IPA|[z]}}): ''hero'' makes ''heroes''; ''potato, potatoes; volcano, volcanoes''.

Nouns ending in a ''y'' preceded by a consonant drop the ''y'' and add ''ies'' (pronounced {{IPA|[iz]}}): ''cherry'' makes ''cherries''; ''lady, ladies''.

Proper nouns (particularly those for people or places) ending in a ''y'' preceded by a consonant form their plurals regularly: ''Harry'' makes ''Harrys''; ''Germany, Germanys''.

This does not apply to words that are merely capitalised common nouns: as, ''P&amp;O Ferries''.

A few common nouns ending in a ''y'' preceded by a consonant form their plurals regularly: ''henry'' makes ''henrys''; ''zloty, zlotys''.

Words ending in ''ey'' form their plurals regularly, in order to avoid the unpleasant-appearing vowel sequence ''eie'': ''monkey, monkeys''.

====Almost-regular plurals====

Many nouns of Italian or Spanish origin are exceptions to the '''oes rule''': ''canto'' makes ''cantos''; ''piano, pianos; portico, porticos; quarto, quartos; solo, solos''.

Many nouns ending in a voiceless fricative mutate that sound to a voiced fricative before adding the plural ending. In the case of {{IPA|[f]}} changing to {{IPA|[v]}} the mutation is indicated in the orthography as well: ''calf'' makes ''calves''; ''bath, baths; mouth, mouths; house, houses''.

Some retain the voiceless consonant: ''proof'' makes ''proofs''; ''moth, moths; place, places; dwarf, dwarfs or dwarves; hoof, hoofs or hooves; staff, staffs or staves; turf, turfs or turves; roof, roofs or rooves''.

====Irregular plurals====

There are many other less regular ways of forming plurals. While they may seem quirky, they usually stem from older forms of English or from foreign borrowings.

====Irregular Germanic plurals====

The plural of a few Germanic nouns can also be formed from the singular by adding ''n'' or ''en'', stemming from the obsolete weak declension: ''ox'' makes ''oxen''; ''child, children''.

The plural is sometimes formed by simply changing the vowel sound of the singular, in a process called umlaut (these are sometimes called ''mutated plurals''): ''foot'' makes ''feet''; ''goose, geese; louse, lice; man, men; mouse, mice; tooth, teeth; woman, women''.

Some nouns have singular and plural alike, although they are sometimes seen as regular plurals: as, ''aircraft, sheep, deer, fish, cod, trout, head, cannon''.

Generally, plurals refer to several species or kinds of animal, while the unmarked plural is used to describe multiple individual animals; one would say ''the classification of fishes'', but ''five fish in an aquarium''.

====Irregular plurals of foreign origin====

Such nouns often retain their original plurals. In some cases both forms are still vying: for a librarian, the plural of ''appendix'' is ''appendices''; for physicians, the plural of ''appendix'' is ''appendixes''. A radio engineer works with ''antennas'' and an entomologist deals with ''antennae''. The &quot;correct&quot; form is the one that sounds better in context. Correctly formed Latin plurals are the most acceptable, in academic and scientific contexts. In common usage, plurals with ''s'' are sometimes preferred.

* Final ''a'' becomes ''ae'' (also ''æ'') or just adds ''s'':

:''Formula'' makes ''formulae'', ''lamina'', ''laminae''; ''macula'', ''maculae''; minutia, ''minutiae''; ''nebula'', ''nebulae''; ''siliqua'', ''siliqiuae''; ''dogma'', ''dogmas'' or ''dogmata''; ''exanthema'', ''exanthemas'' or ''exanthemata''; ''miasm'' or ''miasma'', ''miasms'' or ''miasmata''; ''stigma'', ''stigmas'' or ''stigmata''.

:''Saliva'' and ''scoria'' have no occasion for the plural.

* Final ''ex'' or ''ix'' becomes ''ices'' (pronounced {{IPA|[??si?z]}} or {{IPA|[??siz]}}) or just adds ''es''. Of nouns in ''x'', there are few, if any, which ought not to form the plural regularly, when used as English words; though the Latins changed ''x'' to ''ces'', and ''ex'' to ''ices'', making the ''i'' sometimes long and sometimes short: as,

:''Apex, apices, for apexes; appendix, appendices, for appendixes; calix, calices, for calixes; calx, calces, for calxes; calyx, calyces, for calyxes; caudex, caudices, for caudexes; cicatrix, cicatrices, for cicatrixes; helix, helices, for helixes; index, indices, for indexes; matrix, matrices, for matrixes; quincunx, quincunces, for quincunxes; radix, radices, for radixes; varix, varices, for varixes; vertex, vertices, for vertexes; vortex, vortices, for vortexes''.

:Some Greek words in ''x'' change that letter to ''ges'': as, ''larynx, larynges, for larinxes; phalanx, phalanges, for phalanxes''. ''Billet-doux'', from the French, is ''billets-doux'' in the plural.

* Final ''is'' becomes ''es'' (pronounced {{IPA|[?i?z]}}. Of nouns in ''is'', some are regular: as, ''trellis, trellises: so, annolis, butteris, caddis, dervis, iris, marquis, metropolis, portcullis, proboscis''.

:Some seem to have no need of the plural: as, ''ambergris, aqua-fortis, arthritis, brewis, crasis, elephantiasis, genesis, orris, siriasis, tennis''.

:But most nouns of this ending follow the Greek or Latin form, which simply changes ''is'' to ''es'': as, ''amanuensis, amanuenses; analysis, analyses; antithesis, antitheses; axis, axes; basis, bases; crisis, crises; diaeresis, diaereses; diesis, dieses; ellipsis, ellipses; emphasis, emphases; fascis, fasces; hypothesis, hypotheses; metamorphosis, metamorphoses; oasis, oases; parenthesis, parentheses; phasis, phases; praxis, praxes; synopsis, synopses; synthesis, syntheses; syrtis, syrtes; thesis, theses''.

:In some, however, the original plural is not so formed; but is made by changing ''is'' to ''ides'': as, ''aphis, aphides; apsis, apsides; ascaris, ascarides; bolis, bolides; cantharis, cantharides; chrysalis, chrysalides; ephemeris, ephemerides; epidermis, epidermides''.

:So ''iris'' and ''proboscis'', which we make regular; and perhaps some of the foregoing may be made so too.

* Final ''ies'' remains unchanged: as, ''series, species''.

* Final ''on'' becomes ''a''. Of nouns in ''on'', derived from Greek, the greater part always form the plural regularly: as, ''etymons, gnomons, ichneumons, myrmidons, phlegmons, trigons, tetragons, pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, octagons, enneagons, decagons, hendecagons, dodecagons, polygons''.

:So ''trihedrons, tetrahedrons, pentahedrons'', etc., though some say, these last may end in ''dra''.

:For a few words of this class, however, there are double plurals in use; as, ''automata'' or ''atomatons'', ''criteria'' or ''criterions'', ''parhelia'' or ''parhelions''; and the plural of ''phenomenon' appears to be always ''phenomena''.

:The plural of ''legumen'' is ''legumens'' or ''legumina''; of ''stamen'', ''stamens'' or ''stamina'': of ''cherub'', ''cherubs'' or ''cherubim''; of ''seraph'', ''seraphs'' or ''seraphim''; of ''beau'', ''beaus'' or ''beaux''; of ''bandit'', ''bandits'' or ''banditti''.

* Final ''um'' becomes ''a'' or just adds ''s'': as, ''addendum'' makes ''addenda'', ''medium'' makes ''media'' or ''mediums''. Of nouns in ''um'', some have no need of the plural: as,

:''Bdellium, decorum, elysium, equilibrium, guaiacum, laudanum, odium, opium, petroleum, serum, viaticum. Some form it regularly; as, asylums, compendiums, craniums, emporiums, encomiums, forums, frustums, lustrums, mausoleums, museums, pendulums, nostrums, rostrums, residuums, vacuums. Others take either the English or the Latin plural; as, desideratums or desiderata, mediums or media, menstruums or menstrua, memorandums or memoranda, spectrums or spectra, speculums or specula, stratums or strata, succedaneums or succedanea, trapeziums or trapezia, vinculums or vincula. A few seem to have the Latin plural only: as, arcanum, arcana; datum, data; effluvium, effluvia; erratum, errata; scholium, scholia''.

* Final ''us'' becomes ''i'' (second declension), ''era'', ''ora'' (third declension), or just adds ''es'' (especially in fourth declension, where it would otherwise be the same as the singular): as, ''alumnus'' makes ''alumni'', ''viscus viscera, corpus corpora, prospectus prospectuses''.

:But such as have properly become English words, may form the plural regularly in ''es''; as, ''chorus, choruses'': so, ''apparatus, bolus, callus, circus, fetus, focus, fucus, fungus, hiatus, ignoramus, impetus, incubus, isthmus, nautilus, nucleus, prospectus, rebus, sinus, surplus''.

:''Radius'' makes ''radii'' or ''radiuses''. ''Genius'' has ''genii'', for imaginary spirits, and ''geniuses'', for men of wit. ''Genus'', a sort, becomes ''genera'' in Latin, and ''genuses'' in English. ''Denarius'' makes ''denarii'' or ''denariuses''.

:Of nouns in ''us'', a few have no plural: as, ''asparagus'', ''calamus'', ''mucus''.

:Some have only the Latin plural, which usually changes ''us'' to ''i'': as, ''alumnus, alumni; androgynus, androgyni; calculus, calculi; dracunculus, dracunculi; echinus, echini; magus, magi''.

:Final ''us'' in nouns of Greek origin &quot;properly&quot; add ''es''. These words are also heard with the Latin ''i'' instead, which is sometimes considered &quot;over-correct&quot;, but this is so common as to be acceptable in most circumstances, even technical ones: ''cactus'' makes ''cactuses'' or ''cacti''; ''hippopotamus, hippopotamuses or hippopotami, octopus, octopuses, octopi, or octopodes; platypus, platypuses, rhinoceros, rhinoceroses or rhinoceri, uterus, uteruses or uteri''.

* Final ''as'' in one case of a noun of Greek origin changes to ''antes'': ''Atlas'' makes ''Atlantes''; ''atles, atlases''.

* Final ''ma'' in nouns of Greek origin add ''ta'': ''stigma'' makes ''stigmata''; ''stoma, stomata; zeugma, zeugmata''.

:Though some take ''s'' more commonly: ''schema'' makes ''schemata'' or ''schemas''; ''dogma'', ''dogmata'' or ''dogmas''; ''lemma'', ''lemmata'' or ''lemmas''.

* Some nouns of French origin add ''x'': ''beau'' makes ''beaux''; ''chateau, chateaux; bureau, bureaus or bureaux''.

* Nouns from Slavic languages: ''kniazhestvo'' makes ''kniazhestvos'' or ''kniazhestva''; ''kobzar'', ''kobzars'' or ''kobzari'', ''oblast'', ''oblasts'' or ''oblasti''.

* Nouns of Hebrew language origin add ''im'', ''ot'' (generally m/f), or just ''s'': ''cherub'' makes ''cherubim'' or ''cherubs''; ''seraph, seraphim or seraphs; matzoh, matzot or matzos''.

:The Hebrew plurals ''cherubim'' and ''seraphim'', being sometimes mistaken for singulars, other plurals have been formed from them.

* Some nouns of Japanese origin have no plural and do not change: as, ''samurai, otaku''.

:However, other nouns such as ''kimonos'', ''futons'' and ''tsunamis'' are more often seen with a regular English plural.

*In New Zealand English, nouns of Maori origin can either take an ''s'' or have no separate plural form: as, ''waka'' makes ''waka''; ''marae, marae; kohwai, kohwai or kohwais; tui, tuis or tui, kiwi, kiwi or kiwis''.

*Nouns from languages that have donated few words to English, and that are spoken by relatively few English-speakers, generally form plurals as if they were native English words: ''canoe'' makes ''canoes''; ''kayak, kayaks; igloo, igloos; kangoroo, kangoroos; sauna, saunas; cwm, cwms; pizza, pizzas; kindergarten, kindergartens''.

:In Canada and Alaska, some words borrowed from Inuktitut retain traditional plurals: ''Inuk'' makes ''Inuit''; ''inukshuk, inukshuit''.

*Some words of foreign origin are much better known in the plural. In common usage, the proper plural is considered the singular form. Back-formation has usually resulted in a regularized plural: ''candelabra'' makes ''candelabras''; ''data, data; agenda, agendas or agendae; graffiti, graffiti; insignia, insignias; algae, algae or algaes; opera, operas; viscera, viscera; panini, paninis; phalanx, phalanges; magazine, magazines''.

===Cases===

Cases, in grammar, are modifications that distinguish the relations of nouns or pronouns to other words.

There are three cases; the nominative, the possessive, and the objective.

====The nominative case====

The nominative case is that form or state of a noun or pronoun, which usually denotes the subject of a finite verb: as,

*&quot;The boy runs;&quot;
*&quot;I run.&quot;

The subject of a finite verb is that which answers to who or what before it: as,

*&quot;The boy runs.&quot;
*Who runs? &quot;The boy.&quot;

Boy is therefore here a noun in the nominative case, or '''nominative'''.

For example:
* I eat an orange 
* I buy a chocolate
* I love my family
* I love yellow

====The possessive case==== 

The possessive case is that form or state of a noun or pronoun, which usually denotes the relation of property: as,

*&quot;My hat;&quot;
*&quot;The boy's hat.&quot;

Boy is here a noun in the possessive case, or '''possessive'''.

The possessive case of nouns is formed, in the singular number, by adding to the nominative ''s'' preceded by an apostrophe; and, in the plural, when the nominative ends in ''s'', by adding an apostrophe only: as, singular, boy's; plural, boys'; sounded alike, but written differently.

====The objective case====

The objective case is that form or state of a noun or pronoun which usually tells the object of a verb, participle, or preposition: as, 

*&quot;I know the boy, having seen him at school; and he knows me.&quot;

The object of a verb, participle, or preposition, is that which answers to whom or what after it: as,

*&quot;I know the boy.&quot;
*I know whom? &quot;The boy.&quot;

Boy is therefore here a noun in the objective case, or '''objective'''.

The nominative and the objective of nouns, are always alike in form, being distinguishable from each other only by their place in a sentence, or by their simple dependence according to the sense.

For example:
* I am playing with my football.
* I take her bag.
* Anoud's room is dirty.

====The declension of nouns====

The declension of a noun is a regular arrangement of its numbers and cases. Thus:
&lt;pre&gt;
Sing. Nom.  friend,    Plur. Nom.  friends,
      Poss. friend's,        Poss. friends',
      Obj.  friend;          Obj.  friends.

Sing. Nom.  man,       Plur. Nom.  men,
      Poss. man's,           Poss. men's,
      Obj.  man;             Obj.  men.

Sing. Nom.  fox,       Plur. Nom.  foxes,
      Poss. fox's,           Poss. foxes', 
      Obj.  fox;             Obj.  foxes.

Sing. Nom.  fly,       Plur. Nom.  flies,
      Poss. fly's,           Poss. flies', 
      Obj.  fly;             Obj.  flies.
&lt;/pre&gt;

==The noun as a modifier==

==A short syntax==

The subject must be in the nominative case, as &quot;You say it.&quot;

The subject is placed before the attribute, as &quot;Peace dawned on his mind,&quot; except the following cases: a question, as &quot;How many loaves have you?&quot; imperative mood, as &quot;Go you,&quot; strong feeling, as &quot;May she be happy!&quot; a supposition, as &quot;Were it true,&quot; ''neither'' or ''nor'', as &quot;Neither shall you touch it,&quot; emphasis, as &quot;Here am I,&quot; no regimen, as &quot;Echo the mountains round,&quot; dialogue, as &quot;My name is Hassan,&quot; and the adverb ''there'', as &quot;There lived a man.&quot;

A noun in apposition is put in the same case as the noun it explains, as &quot;But he, our gracious master, knows us.&quot;

A possessive is governed by the name of the thing possessed, as &quot;Man's life.&quot;

A possessive comes immediately before the governing noun, as &quot;Nature's peace,&quot; except the following cases: an intervening adjective, as &quot;Flora's earliest smells,&quot; affirmation or denial, as &quot;The book is not John's,&quot; a possessive without sign, as &quot;Brother Absalom's house,&quot; or &quot;David and Jonathan's friendship.&quot;

The predicate is governed by attribute in objective case, as &quot;I found her.&quot;

A noun or a pronoun put after a non-transitive verb or participle, agrees in case with a preceding noun or pronoun referring to the same thing, as &quot;The child was named John.&quot;

The case of absolute noun or pronoun depends on no other word, as &quot;Your fathers, where are they?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Elemental analysis''' is the process for determining the partial or complete chemical formula for a substance.  Most commonly, it involves the complete combustion in air or oxygen of the substance and then quantifying the amount of elemental oxides produced.  In the case of organic compounds, the carbon is converted to carbon dioxide and the hydrogen to water.  From these, the percent carbon and percent hydrogen in the substance can be found and compared with a proposed chemical formula for the substance at hand.

Element test: Put a small amount of the solid into a small piece of Na metal then roll it around the solid, followed by introduction into a fusion tube. The tube is heated with a gentle flame at a slow rate (in order not to evaporate N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present in solid) then strong heating till the bottom of the tube become red hot. The tube is then put in a beaker containing a minimal amount of water then heated, cooled, filtered and the filtrate divided into three parts.

1. &lt;u&gt;Test for nitrogen&lt;/u&gt;:
The filtrate and ferrous sulphate are boiled and cooled and dilute sulphuric acid is added. If green or blue color occurs the solid contain nitrogen.

&lt;b&gt;The chemistry behind what happened&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Na+C+N --&gt; NaCN&lt;br&gt;
FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;+NaCN gives Fe[CN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fe[CN]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+4NaCN give the complex Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;br&gt;
ferrous oxidizes to ferric by the acid so
3Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]+4Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt; Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

2. &lt;u&gt;Test for sulphur&lt;/u&gt;:
The filtrate is exposed to dilute acetic acid and lead acetate, yielding a brown or black precipitate. 

&lt;b&gt;The chemistry behind what happened&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Na+S --&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;br&gt;
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S +Pb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yields lead sulphide, a black precipitate.

or:
The filtrate and sodium nitro prusside yield a violet color 

Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO] --&gt; Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NOS] = violet color

3. &lt;u&gt;Test for chlorine&lt;/u&gt;:

a) In the absence of N or S:
The filtrate is exposed to dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate. Formation of a white precipitate suggests the presence of chlorine.

b) In the presence of N and/or S :

The filtrate is exposed to dilute sulphoric acid then boiled to 1/3 initial volume and cooled. Formation of a white precipitate after the addition of dilute nitric acid and silver nitrate suggests the presence of chlorine.

&lt;b&gt;Equations&lt;/b&gt;:

NaCN+AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; --&gt; AgCN white ppt&lt;br&gt;
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S black ppt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;In the presence of N or S these two precipitates may interfere with the white colour of the result of the chlorine test.  Therefore dilute sulphoric acid is added because in the presence of N or S&lt;/b&gt;:
Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S+ dilute H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;/sub&gt;4 gives H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S gas
NaCN+ dilulte H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; gives HCN gas 

There is no interference with the white colour expected from the chlorine test in solid.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Chromatography''' involves the physical separation of a mixture of compounds.  Chromatography can be used as a purification method but also sees wide use for the identification of compounds based on their chromatographic behavior.

=Theory=

There are many variations of chromatography, but all involve the dissolution of an analyte into a fluid known as the '''mobile phase''' and the passage of this fluid solution across a '''stationary phase''', often a solid or liquid-coated solid.

As the mobile phase comes into contact with the stationary phase, some of the analyte molecules dissolve or adsorb onto the mobile phase.  The more the molecules of that substance are retained, the slower their progress through the chromatographic apparatus.  Different substances will then move through at different rates, ideally resulting in distinctly identifiable '''retention times''' for each substance.

Commonly used chromatographic techniques are identified through the nature of the stationary and mobile phases used, the method for passing the mobile phase through the apparatus, and how separated components are identified.

=Paper chromatography=

In '''paper chromatography''' the stationary phase is a specialized paper made to absorb water to a high level. The mobile phase is usually water or a concentrated salt solution. Paper chromatography has many uses in forensic chemistry due to it's simplicity and availability. However, paper chromatography is limited by the characteristics that only water soluble components can be separated and inaccuracy in RF values. This makes paper chromatography mostly useful to distinguish the differences between two residues rather than their similarities.

[[Image:Paper_Chromatography_SH.png|thumb|Paper chromatography separation in the visible spectrum.]]

=Thin layer chromatography=

In '''thin layer chromatography''' (TLC) a plastic or glass plate is coated with the stationary phase, often alumina, silica, or alkylated silica.  The analyte is dissolved in a quick-drying solvent and spotted near the bottom of the plate.  The edge of the plate beneath the spot or spots is then dipped and left in a solution of the mobile phase, either an organic solvent or aqueous solution (depending on the nature of the analyte and stationary phase).  Capillary action is then allowed to draw the '''solvent front''' through the spotted analyte, carrying with it and in the process separating out the analyte's components.

=Gas chromatography=

In '''gas chromatography''' (GC) the analyte and mobile phase must both be gases or be readily introduced into the gas phase by heating. The mobile phase gas must be inert and not reacting with the sample to be analysed. Examples of inert gases are helium and nitrogen gas.

The gases are passed through a long, narrow (and most often, coiled) tube either packed with a porous stationary phase or whose inner walls are coated with a stationary phase, and the analyte components are detected as they emerge from the far end of the tube. The tube is commonly known as GC column.

Often a time-varying temperature gradient, from lower temperature to higher temperature, is applied to the tube.  This first allows the analyte components to partition into the stationary phase and then, as the temperature rises, to differentially force them back into the mobile phase.

Common detectors for gas chromatography are flame ionization detector (FID), electron capture detector (ECD) and mass spectrometry (MS). Different types of sample analysis would require the use of a different type of detectors.

=Column chromatography=

'''Column chromatography''', like gas chromatography, uses a tube packed with a stationary phase, but the mobile phase is a liquid instead of a gas (It is sometimes known as '''liquid chromatography''' or LC). Instead of temperature gradients, a gradient in the composition of the liquid phase can be used to separate components.

Column chromatography can be performed on larger molecules which may not be readily introduced into the gas phase.  On the other hand, because of the increased viscosity of liquids compared with gases, liquid chromatography can be a more ponderous process.  '''HPLC''' (variously ''high-pressure liquid chromatography'' or ''high-performance liquid chromatography'') speeds the process and improves its selectivity and sensitivity to a significant degree by forcing the mobile phase through the chromatographic column with high-pressure pumps.

=Detection methods=

The root of the word '''chromatography''', ''chroma'' (Greek &lt;i&gt;khrōma, color&lt;/i&gt;) and grafein is &quot;to write&quot;,  indicates that the separated components in some forms of the technique can be identified by their color alone.  But chromatography has now long been performed on colorless compounds that can be identified in other ways.

Analyte components on thin-layer chromatography plates are often identified under ultraviolet light, or by chemical staining in, for example, an iodine chamber or potassium permanganate.  Gas chromatographic analytes are detected by changes in the ionization levels of a flame at the output end of the column or by changes in the electrical conductivity of the gas mixture at the end of the column.  Liquid chromatography fractions are often analyzed through spectrophotometric techniques, notably UV-visible spectroscopy. When separation with GC or LC is performed in tandem with mass spectrometry (the &quot;hyphenated&quot; techniques of GC-MS and LC-MS), masses of individual fractions are rapidly determined. These methods are frequently employed in analytical and forensic science.

&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

== Botany as a Science ==

'''Botany''' is the branch of '''biology''' concerned with the scientific study of plants. Traditionally, botanists studied all organisms that were not generally regarded as animal. However, advances in our knowledge about the myriad forms of life, especially microbes (viruses and bacteria), have led to spinning off from Botany the specialized field called '''Microbiology'''. Still, the microbes are usually covered in introductory Botany courses, although their status as neither animal nor plant is firmly established.


Plants are living entities, and material presented within ''Biology'' will have relevance here, most particularly at the cellular and subcellular levels of organization (Chapter 2). Both plants and animals deal with the same problems of maintaining life on planet Earth &amp;mdash; their approaches seem quite different, but the end result is the same: continued existence in an organized state, as part of a universe whose tendency is towards greater disorganization.  Back on Earth, however, it is a fact that microbes, plants, and animals comprise a very interdependent system. We divide them apart, because our minds work best that way. We categorize and learn common features or properties of the categories. This approach is neither right nor wrong, but is clearly efficient for our minds.  Nonetheless, it is desirable to regularly step back and realize that the boundaries between categories are often just constructs, and exceptions to our categories usually abound.

It was alluded to in the opening definition that Botany is a '''science'''. Just what makes Botany, or anything else a science?  It is important to acquire a grasp of the fundamentals of science itself to fully appreciate both how botanical knowledge was gained as well as how it can be used. It is usually quickly disinteresting to acquire facts simply for the sake of knowing. Humans do not just appreciate mountains ''because they are there'', they climb them because they are there!

== Living Systems ==
Biology is defined as the study of life, and Botany is that discipline within Biology concerned with the study of living organisms called '''plants''' and with certain other living things that are not plants (but are not animals either).  

=== Defining 'Plant' ===
Like many words in common usage that apply to biological entities or concepts, the term '''''plant''''' is more difficult to define than might be at first obvious.  Although botanists describe a '''Kingdom Plantae''', the boundaries defining members of Plantae are more inclusive than our common concept of a &quot;plant&quot;.  We are tempted to regard ''plant'' as meaning a multicellular, eukaryotic organism that generally does not have sensory organs or voluntary motion and has, when complete, a root, stem, and leaves.  However, botanically only vascular plants have a root, stem, and leaves, and even some vascular plants, such as certain carnivorous plants and duckweed, fall afoul of that definition.  But to be fair, the vascular plants are the plants we tend to encounter every day and that most people would readily regard as &quot;plants&quot;.

A more significant point of departure between Plantae and plants occurs among the seaweeds. Technically, only a relatively minor group of seaweeds (the chlorophytes or green algae) are members of the Kingdom Plantae.  The majority of seaweeds, like the kelps (very large brown algae from the Order Laminariales), despite a superficial appearance of such, lack true stems, leaves, roots, and any kind of vascular systems as found in higher plants. Thus, the kelps are not Plantae; but are they plants? Certainly if we regard the green algae as plants, it is difficult to exclude the more prominent red and brown algae of our coastal waters.  

Another, much broader definition for ''plant'' is that it refers to any organism that is '''''photoautotrophic'''''&amp;mdash;produces its own food from raw inorganic materials and sunlight. This is not an unreasonable definition, and is one that focuses on the role plants typically play in an ecosystem. However, there are photoautotrophs among the '''Prokaryotes''', specifically photoautotrophic bacteria and cyanophytes. The latter are sometimes called (for good reasons) blue-green algae. Then there arises the problem that many people would consider that a mushroom is a plant; a mushroom is the fruiting body of a fungus (Kingdom Fungi) and not ''photoautotrophic'' at all, but ''saprophytic''. However, there are more than a few species of flowering plants, fungi, and bacteria that are not autotrophic, but ''parasitic''.

We cannot hope to offer a firm answer. The list of characteristics that separate the Plantae from the other biological kingdoms provides at least a technical definition, but realize it is only a technical definition. The problem this lack of precision or agreement in the definition of &quot;plant&quot; presents is one of understanding statements, often encountered in ''Wikipedia'' (and other) articles, of the sort: ''...xylem is one of the two transport tissues of plants''. In general it cannot be assumed this means all plants, algae through flowering plants. It very probably does not include fungi or bacteria. Indeed, it is usually safest to assume the discussion is about vascular plants (essentially the ferns, conifers, flowering plants, and a few others; see discussion below on &quot;General Terminology&quot;) unless stated differently (e.g., ''...in vascular and non-vascular plants this is ''such and such).

=== Plants as Organisms ===

The distinction between life and non-life is not as easily made as you might think. There exist intracellular &quot;parasites&quot; that are progressively less alive in terms of being metabolically active:

== Plants and their Uses ==

There can be no disputing the fundamental significance of plants to the ecology of our planet.  Photosynthetic plants utilize energy arriving from the sun to create complex organic molecules from inorganic substances, and by this process contribute oxygen to the atmosphere.  Advanced animal life is very much dependent upon this source of oxygen, as well as the organic molecules that form the basis of nearly every food web on the planet. However, humans utilize plants in many ways, especially as sources of pleasure, food, and material for shelter, clothing, and more. Consider here the role plants play in our everyday lives and in our economy.

== Introduction to Plant Classification ==
At the beginning of this chapter it was suggested that each of us categorizes information we encounter on a daily basis. Our minds seem to want to find relationships between facts and observations, to erect mental bins in which to place new items with previous &quot;facts&quot;.  This natural human process is the basis for prejudice, in as much as &quot;facts&quot; categorized together can become strongly associated. But these are personal constructs. In order for scientists of many races, speaking many languages, and coming from all manner of backgrounds and experiences to work productively together to solve common  problems, the objects with which they work must be classified within a universally accepted framework.    

The classification of living things is called '''systematics''', or '''taxonomy''', and ideally should reflect the evolutionary history (phylogeny) of the different organisms.  

Taxonomy arranges organisms in groups called '''taxa''', while systematics seeks clues to their relationships. The dominant system of ''Scientific Classification'' is called '''Linnaean taxonomy''', and includes classification ranks as well as an organism naming convention called '''binomial nomenclature'''.

Traditionally, all living things were divided into five kingdoms:

:[[Wikipedia:en:Monera|Monera]] &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:En:Protist|Protista]] &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:en:Fungi|Fungi]] &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:En:Plantae|Plantae]] &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:en:Animal|Animalia]]

However, this five-kingdom system has been replaced by Carl Woese's three-domain system,  which focuses on phylogenic roots and comparison of DNA structures.  The older approach  utilized visual observation as the basis of classification. The three domains reflect whether cells have nuclei ('''eukaryotic''') or not ('''prokaryotic'''), as well as differences in cell membranes and cell walls.

:[[Wikipedia:en:Archaea|Archaea]] &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:en:Eubacteria|Eubacteria]] &amp;mdash; [[Wikipedia:en:Eukaryota|Eukaryota]]

Recall (and review as necessary) how these groupings relate to the sequence of events in the evolutionary history of life as summarized in [[Wikipedia:en:Timeline of evolution|Timeline of Evolution]]. You will return to the subject of Scientific Classification to consider in much more detail the groups of organisms studied in Botany, beginning with Chapter 7. First, however, we shall turn our attention to the structure and function of cells and eventually to gain an understanding of plant structure (''plant anatomy'') and function (''plant physiology'').

=== General Terminology === 
In Section II of this text we will delve much deeper into &quot;plant&quot; systematics.  But you should be aware of some general terms related to classificatory schemes that are used regularly in discussing plants.  You have probably encountered these terms many times, although may not be aware of their exact definitions. For example, much of the material in Section I of this textbook is biased towards '''flowering plants'''.  That is, much of the descriptive material here as well as at Wikipedia refers specifically to these. Flowering plants are angiosperms; plants that have flowers and produce seeds, and comprise the majority of the plants we would normally encounter in say a nursery if not on the street, field, or empty lot. '''Seed-bearing plants''' include both the angiosperms and the gymnosperms, the latter now treated as a modern group called '''conifers'''.  The conifers are also common plants, especially in higher latitudes, but bear cones instead of flowers. Both conifers and flowering plants develop vascular tissues internally that conduct fluids (especially water) throughout the plant. Included in the '''vascular plants''' are ferns.  Ferns have vascular tissue, but reproduce by spores.  They do not produce seeds and do not bear flowers.

== Introduction ==
[[image:lupe.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A loupe (left) and a hand-lens (right) - tools used by botanists in the field]]
A '''cell''' is a very basic structure of all living systems, consisting of '''protoplasm''' within a containing '''cell membrane'''.  Only entities such as viruses&amp;mdash;literally on the boundary between non-living chemicals and living systems&amp;mdash;lack cells or basic cell structure. All plants, including very simple plants called ''algae'', and all animals are made up of cells, and these are organized in various ways to create structure and function in an organism. Biologists recognize two basic types of cells: '''prokaryotic''' and '''eukaryotic'''. ''Prokaryotic cells'' are structurally more simple. They are found only in single-celled and some simple, multicellular organisms (all bacteria and some algae, which all belong to Bacteria and Archaea domains). ''Eukaryotic cells'' are found in most algae, all higher plants, fungi, and animals (Eukarya domain). Thus, differences between these two cell types are critical to how an organism is classified, and an important consideration in the evolutionary sequence of life on the planet Earth.

== Plant Cell Structure ==
[[File:Simple diagram of plant cell (en).svg|thumb|right|200px|The structure of a plant cell]]

Nearly all cells are too small to be seen with the unaided eye. As always there are some exceptions, but generally magnification is required to detect a cellular structure. In plants, a good hand-lens or loupe (see photo at right) will sometimes suffice, but in working with cells or observing how cells are organized to form tissues and structures, a high power '''[[Wikipedia:en:Microscope|microscope]]''' is used.

* Read about [[Wikipedia:en:Cell (biology)|Cells]] ~ &lt;small&gt;You may wish to follow some or all links to &quot;Main articles&quot; as these provide detail that may interest you; or you might return to explore further should questions arise later in the course.&lt;/small&gt;  
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Plant_cell|Plant cells]] &lt;small&gt;and, at minimum, articles at the following links (but ignore, for now, the topic of &lt;u&gt;Plant Cell Types&lt;/u&gt;):&lt;/small&gt;

:Also note that the textbook, ''[[Cell Biology]]'', is available at ''WikiBooks'' and can be used as a more detailed reference. You should read the [[Cell Biology/Introduction|Introductory Chapter]] (all subsections) at this time.  

&lt;tt&gt;Questions&lt;/tt&gt;:
#''Can you think of reasons why ''macroscopic'' organisms are multicellular?'' &lt;small&gt;(Macroscopic means large, in the sense of &quot;not microscopic&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;

== Basic Cell Function ==

You should, by now, have a general appreciation for the complexity of cellular structure. Improvements in microscopy, especially development of the [[Wikipedia:en:Electron_microscope|Electron microscope]], have revealed that cells are not merely membranous sacks containing fluid of gel-like consistency. The degree of organization of the '''cytoplasm''' into  '''organelles''' and their '''membranes''' should have you convinced that much (perhaps most) of what is really going on around you on this planet is occurring at a scale that is simply inaccessible to your eyes. And while you cannot be expected to directly observe chemical reactions at a molecular scale, contemplate that you cannot, even with powerful optics, directly observe most of the structure where these reactions are somehow controlled to produce outcomes favorable to life&amp;mdash;indeed, are life. Hopefully, as you acquire knowledge and become a biologist&amp;mdash;a botanist&amp;mdash;you will learn to recognize the relevant phenomena by their macroscopic expressions (that which you can readily observe with the unaided eye).    

To appreciate basic cell function, it is necessary to first list the processes or outcomes that cells must accomplish to further existence. More specialized functions will be discussed under plant cell structure, as our interest must eventually focus on plants. For now, recall that in your reading you have already encountered these several basic abilities of cells: 

*'''Metabolism''' involves taking in of raw material to use in building cell components and  breaking down of other molecules to provide energy for various growth processes; byproducts may be released. 
*'''Protein biosynthesis''' by transcription of DNA to RNA and then translation to protein, used in growth or released for use elsewhere by the organism.          
*'''Reproduction''' by cell division. 

Now explore each in turn. Think initially of a single-celled organism with no special abilities, only a &quot;will&quot; to stay alive and perpetuate itself. Remember, the environment will not be kind. The cell must grow and reproduce to counter the tendency of outside forces to breakdown molecular structure and destroy life. Then consider the situation where a cell is part of a multicellular organism, and may be performing more limited and specialized functions. 

*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Cell_metabolism|Cell metabolism]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links and read at least these articles&lt;/small&gt;):
** [[Wikipedia:en:Metabolic pathway|Metabolic pathway]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be followed&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Cellular respiration|Cell respiration]] (&lt;small&gt;Follows all links&lt;/small&gt;)

*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Protein_biosynthesis|Protein biosynthesis]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links as necessary to understand process and terminology; Also included is:&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Gene_expression|Gene expression]]
*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Cell_division|Cell reproduction]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included:&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Mitosis|Mitosis]]
** [[Wikipedia:en:Cell_cycle|Cell cycle]]

&lt;tt&gt;Questions&lt;/tt&gt;:
#''Have you been able to discern a relationship between genes and basic cell function? If so, is this also a basic cell function, and where do we list it?''   

== Plant Cell Specializations ==

We will learn about the cells of algae and other organisms (e.g., bacteria and fungi) traditionally covered within Botany in later chapters on those organisms (Chapters 5 - 7).  Here, we concentrate on the cells of plants. 

The simplest type of plant cell is called a '''parenchyma cell''' and most of the basic metabolic and reproductive processes of the plant occur in these cells.  A term for ''parenchyma'' cells with chloroplasts, is '''chlorenchyma cells'''.  Other plant cell types that we shall be considering are:

*'''Collenchyma''' ~ living cells with thickened walls for increased support
*'''Sclerenchyma''' ~ lignified dead cells forming fibers for increased support
*'''Epidermal''' ~ surface covering
*'''Cork'''
*'''Xylem tracheid''' ~ single long (up to 1 mm) thin cells for transporting water and support
*'''Xylem vessel''' ~ cells form individual elements in an even longer (up to 1 meter in extreme cases) tube for transporting water 
*'''Meristematic cells''' ~ growth

== Introduction ==
As was noted in the previous [[Botany/Plant_tissues|chapter]], most plant cells are specialized to a greater or lesser degree, and arranged together in '''tissues'''.  A tissue can be ''simple'' or ''complex'' depending upon whether it is composed of one or more than one type of cell.  Tissues are further arranged or combined into '''organs''' that carry out life functions of the organism.  Plant organs include the '''leaf''', '''stem''', '''root''', and '''reproductive structures'''.  The first three are sometimes called the ''vegetative organs'' and are the subject of exploration in this chapter. Reproductive organs will be covered in [[Botany/Plant_reproduction|Chapter 5]].

The relationships of the organs within a plant body to each other remains an unsettled subject within plant morphology. The fundamental question is whether these are truly different structures, or just modifications of one basic structure (Eames, 1936; Esau, 1965). The plant body is an integrated, functional unit, so the division of a plant into organs is largely conceptual, providing a convenient way of approaching plant form and function. A boundary between stem and leaf is particularly difficult to make, so botanists sometimes use the word '''shoot''' to refer to the stem and its appendages (Esau, 1965).

== The Leaf ==
The plant leaf is an organ whose shape promotes efficient gathering of light for photosynthesis. The form of the leaf must also be balanced against the fact that most of the loss of water a plant might suffer is going to occur at its leaves (transpiration). Leaves are extremely variable in terms of their size, shape, and adornments (such as small hairs on the face of the leaf).

Although the leaves of most plants carry out the same basic functions, there is nonetheless an amazing variety of leaf sizes, shapes, margin types, forms of attachment, ornamentation (hairs), and color. Examine the [[Botany/Leaves (forms)|Leaves (forms)]] page to learn the extensive terminology used to describe this variation. Consider that there are functional reasons for the modifications from a &quot;basic&quot; type.

== The Stem ==
The stem arises during development of the embryo as part of the ''hypocotyl-root axis'', at the upper end of which are one or more cotyledons and the shoot primordium.  

* Read: [[Wikipedia:en:Plant_stem|Stem]]

== The Root ==
The root is the (typically) underground part of the plant axis specialized for both anchoring the plant and absorbing water and minerals. 
* Read: [[Wikipedia:en:Root|Root]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow any links for terms you do not understand and to gain a complete picture of root structural variation&lt;/small&gt;)

::Be sure to read about and understand the meaning of each (at a minimum) of the following terms: '''adventitious roots''', '''endodermis''', '''epidermis''', '''gravitropism''', '''root cap''', '''root hair''', '''stele''', '''taproot'''.

Most of the material you have read discusses the root organ as found in the angiosperms (flowering plants). However, among the vascular plants, only Psilotales lack such an organ, having instead rhizomes that bear hair-like absorbing structures called '''rhizoids''' (Eames, 1936 in Esau, 1965).


'''Questions''':

 4-1. At this point the conceptual differences between cell types, tissues, organs,
      and organisms may be somewhat confusing. Using the leaf as an example, describe
      this structure in a way that considers the cell types, tissues, and organs for
      that part of the leaf where photosynthesis is concentrated.

You've probably done quite a lot of work in basic electrical circuits in lower school, but we will revise them here so don't worry if you've forgotten them.

Before we start you need to know a whole host of circuit symbols. 

'''Q1)'''See how many of the following you can name:

{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| [[image:Circuit symbols 1.png]]
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
| [[Image:Circuit symbols 2.png]]
|}

You should already know about half of them. For the others see [[GCSE Science/Circuits answers|here]]. You need to learn all these symbols by heart, but don't worry about that just yet. It's much easier to learn the symbols if you know what the components actually do, and we will be looking at that later on.

==What is a circuit?==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Simple bulb and switch circuit.png]]
|}

A circuit is a loop in which electricity can flow.  Consider a simple circuit with a  cell, a switch and a bulb. The current flows from the cell, via the closed switch to the bulb. The bulb lights because the electricity carries energy. '''But''' even after the bulb there current still needs to go around the rest of the loop back to the cell. If there is a break ''anywhere'' in the loop, the bulb will not light. This is a concept that is not all that difficult, yet most people do not understand it. 

Ask a selection of adults you know and many will say:&lt;br&gt;
''&quot;Electricity flows from the cell to the bulb, where it gets used up&quot;''

'''Q2)''' What is wrong with the above statement?

'''Q3)''' Look at the selection of circuits below. What is wrong with each of them?


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Three wrong circuits.png]]
|}

What we have been looking at so far has been largely revision. You should already be familiar with what a circuit is and how it works. Let's now go on to some more advanced work.

While Wikibooks offers somewhat clearer opportunities for &quot;authorship&quot; than Wikipedia, there remains the fact that anything put here is really just a contribution, and everyone who furthers the effort is a contributor. In this respect there are no &quot;authors&quot;. If you are interested in developing a particular subject within the field of botany as part of this textbook, please start the module and link it here. We will work out the chapter arrangement after you get started. Of course, you can also just expand on an existing chapter.

*[[w:user:Marshman|Eric Guinther]] is a biologist and environmental consultant living in Kane'ohe, Hawai'i. He envisioned this particular textbook &quot;project&quot; and developed the approach of creating a textbook around articles found in [http://www.Wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]. By then working specifically on those articles referred to, the quality and quantity of the ''Study Guide to the Science of Botany'' was gradually enhanced.  These efforts were done with the steady help of numerous talented contributors at Wikipedia who, collectively, would have no interest in working on a textbook project per se.  Ultimately, the user of the guide benefits from the textbook's approach: 1) by having more control over the depth into any subtopic pursued and 2) being limited in that pursuit only by that considerable information available at Wikipedia and other linked websites. 

*Others (add your name and thoughts here if you are a serious contributor)

      <text xml:space="preserve">IMO there are no &quot;food enemies&quot; as such. Those listed are essential to health. Even LDL, the &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol, is essential to certain metabolic functions. It causes problems when the level is too high or the ratio of LDL to HDL is too high even when the overall cholesterol level is &quot;acceptable&quot;. Perhaps it should be emphasized that any nutrient taken in excess is bad. Even vitamins are toxic or have unpleasant side effects when taken in large amounts. [[User:CyberMaus|CyberMaus]] 20:55, 8 Sep 2003 (UTC)
:I agree. A book on healthy eating should concentrate on good and bad diet, not good and bad foods [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]

== Charred meat? ==

Can the carcinogenic (free radicals?) effect of eating charred/browned meat be countered by ingesting antioxidants (such as tea) ?

Charred/browned meat is yummy and it would be a shame to avoid it unnecessarilly [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 21:48, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

:It seems so... but ingesting the antioxidants and skipping the charred meat would be even better. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:14, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

::I agree, I would hate to have to give up seared or browned meats. I don't think the carcinogens produced during normal cooking are significant enough to warrant total removal from one's diet. [[User:64.238.163.200|64.238.163.200]] 21:33, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

== e coli == 
I am skeptical of the statements made here about organic foods, e-coli and irradiation. I have read reports that ecoli on '''un'''certified organic farms are higher than on commercial farms, but that on certified farms this level is only somewhat higher than commercial farms (characterized by the staff conducting the study as &quot;not significant&quot;). Even so, this does not directly lead to the conclusion that it is &quot;important&quot; for these organic foods to be irradiated. Irradiation has also been accused of negative side effects (though it does have the approval of the FDA). Futhermore, the danger from ecoli is '''much''' higher from meat products, but the current wording singles out organic produce. I do think a general-purpose e-coli warning is probably appropriate... but this is not it. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

:I got rid of it, even though I mostly agree with it. It didn't fit well. The 600 degree claim was misleading, because there is no single temperature at which bacteria suddenly all die. As far as food dangers go, bacteria are severely underestimated by most people, but ''e coli'' isn't anywhere near being the main danger. (my father is a food microbiologist with his doctorate, so you can be sure I've had far more education about the matter than would be normal) The danger from meat products would be much higher if people treated meat and vegetables the same. Few people eat raw meat though, so vegetables are quite dangerous in actual use. The main danger with meat is that some idiots will handle cooked meat with the same dishes that were used to handle it when raw. Many people are also careless about faucet handles. People don't even think about vegetable contamination. They eat raw vegetables, sometimes without even a rinse. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:41, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

:Food irradiation is an excellent process. It is always used on spices. On other foods it is not used, because bomb-driven hysteria resulted in a mandatory label that looks rather scary. Spices are exempt from the labeling requirement. The dangerous chemical changes caused by food irradiation are the same as those caused by cooking; one can not eliminate all risk. We cook food. Sometimes cooking is far worse than irradiation. Failure to irradiate and/or cook food can hurt you too, via mold toxins for example, so you have to pick your poison. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 21:41, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

== The article states lettuce as being nutritionally worthless ==

Researching this I discovered that according to www.nutritiondata.com iceberg lettuce actually receives a score of 4.9/5 nutritional rating, therefore, being one of the more nutritional foods available.

== MSG Instead of Salt? ==

Whilst adding salt to food is definitely not very healthy, using MSG as a substitute doesn't seem like a very good idea, considering its bad reputation for destroying neurons in the brain.

:Of course salt is healthy just as long as you don't eat too much, it, like every edible substance has some stuff that the body needs, and table saly has what I think is called iodine. Stating otherwise is blatant and enthusiastic asshattery, douchebaggery, and POVism. This is the kind of thing a former MSG enthusiast would say.

== Healthful? ==

Is there some specific reason not to use &quot;healthy&quot;?
: Ditto. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:24, 6 December 2008 (UTC)
: Technically healthful is correct usage, but in everyday English, healthy means the same thing.

== Deep Fried Mars Bars ==

This cookbook links to the recipe for Deep Fried Mars Bars 4 times. I have been dieting for some time and I remember when I first started reading about junk food and then getting a very horrble feeling in my entire being untill I ate what I had read about. Therefore this is a horrible cookbook that needs to be altered. --[[User:203.118.177.19|203.118.177.19]] 07:07, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

== Most of this information is worthless ==

Whoever said that MSG destroys neurons is a crazy freak. People complain about Chinese food 'cause it has MSG, but there's more MSG in an Italian meal than a fast-food Chinese, and people don't complain about Italian food syndrome. Plus, whoever wrote this says we should boil meat? What kind of lunatic boils a steak? This article is worthless.

== carrots ==

if you eat too many carrots your skin will turn orange. just look at a former WWII RAF pilot and you'll see. lol i was kidding no i wasn't.

== Olive oil junk science ==

Olive oil is not harmful when heated, for crying out loud. That's one of the more ridiculous myths out there. Some sources:
http://scienceornot.net/2012/09/15/is-it-safe-to-cook-with-olive-oil/ and http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/myth-buster-olive-oil-is-one-of-the-safest-oils-for-frying-and-cooking/</text>

== Vegetative Reproduction ==

Vegetative reproduction is a type of '''asexual reproduction'''&amp;mdash;other terms that apply are ''vegetative propagation,'' ''clonal growth'', or ''vegetative multiplication''. Vegetative '''growth''' is enlargement of the individual plant; vegetative reproduction is any process that results in new plant &quot;individuals&quot; without production of seeds (see ''The Seed'' below) or spores.  It is both a natural process in many, many species as well as one utilized or encouraged by horticulturists and farmers to obtain quantities of economically valuable plants. In this respect, it is a form of cloning that has been carried out by humankind for thousands of years and by &quot;plants&quot; for hundreds of millions of years.

*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Vegetative_reproduction|Vegetative Reproduction]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow all links&lt;/small&gt;)

== Sexual Reproduction ==
=== The Flower ===

The '''flower''' is the reproductive organ of plants classified as ''angiosperms''&amp;mdash;that is, the flowering plants comprising the '''Division Magnoliophyta'''. All plants have the means and corresponding structures for reproducing sexually, and these other cases will be explored in later chapters. However, because '''flowering plants''' are the most conspicuous plants in almost all terrestrial environments, we justifiably devote this chapter to the flowering plants alone.  You will learn how other plant groups (and non-plant groups, such as fungi) reproduce sexually in Section II of the ''The Guide''.  

The basic function of a flower is to produce '''seeds''' through '''sexual reproduction'''. Seeds are the next generation, and serve as the primary method in most plants by which individuals of the species are dispersed across the landscape.  Actual dispersal is, in most species, a function of the '''fruit''': structural parts that typically surround the seed.  But the seed contains the germ of life of the next generation.

'''Questions''':

 5-1. Do you think the flower structure is in any way responsible for the considerable
      success of flowering plants in populating the earth? 

=== The Seed and Germination===

the primary purpose of the seed is one of preserving the continuity of life&amp;mdash;starting a new generation in a new physical location. For large plants (shrubs and trees), this can be especially important because successful germination and growth close to the parent may be difficult or impossible; the established plant monopolizes light and water resources in its immediate vicinity. Seeds can also serve the function of overwintering or surviving harsh conditions. The entire generation&amp;mdash;every individual&amp;mdash;may die in the Fall or the dry season. In many annual species, only the seed exists during unfavorable dry or cold conditions.

==What is electricity anyway?==
So far in this module we have been using words like electricity, current, voltage, and resistance without actually explaining in depth what these words mean. On this page you will learn what these words mean, and how they relate to one another.

===What is electricity on a microscopic level===
Let's think about a wire, made of copper.
You should already know that it is made of particles called copper atoms, which have a positive nucleus surrounded by negative electrons.
We need not concern ourself with the nucleus, because it does not move.
They are stuck in a rigid crystal structure.
Instead we need to look at the electrons. Copper, like all metals, has some loose electrons.
These electrons are not held rigidly by the atoms but are free to roam about anywhere as long as they stay somewhere in the metal.
We call them ''conduction electrons'' because they are the ones that conduct electricity.
To see how electric current flows imagine a small petri dish, with an even smaller one glued inside.
The channel between the two dishes  is then filled with peas.
The channel represents the wires in a circuit, the peas the electrons.

'''Charge''' is the quantity of free charged particles (in this case electrons). The SI unit of charge is the coulomb.

You ''could'' count the electrons, but there are an awful lot of electrons! Each electron carries a ''tiny'' charge, of &amp;minus;1.602×10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; coulomb. We can turn this figure on its head and say that if we grouped together 6.2415&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons we would have &amp;minus;1 coulomb of charge.

==Electric field:-==

An electric field is a region where an object experiences a force due to its charge.

The strength of the electric field (electric field strength  E ) is described by considering how much force is experienced by a unit charge (a charge of 1 coulomb) when it's placed in the field. 

The electric field at any point is therefore expressed in newtons per coulomb.

Some fields (such as the field between two parallel charged plates) have the same field strength throughout the field - uniform fields. Others (particularly radial fields due to isolated point charges) do not have constant field strength.


In a battery there is a negative and positive terminal. The conventional current flows from positive to negative (the large line to the small line). Because opposites attract, these charges in the battery will be attracting each other, but they can not move directly to each other through the battery because of the chemical processes. If there is a complete external circuit, this attraction from the battery will give the free electrons in the metal (i.e. the wire) a force which will make them move. If you think about it these electrons are being forced to the other side of the battery because of this attraction. We call this driving force the Electro-motive Force (e.m.f). Emfs are measured in volts, and are sometimes referred to simply as voltage. The larger the emf (the voltage) the more quickly electrons flow round the circuit. What is the rate of flow of the electrons?....the current. so, a larger voltage means a larger current.

== Current ==

Now imagine that you were to put your finger on one pea and push it in a clockwise direction. All the peas would move because they are all touching one another. This is just what happens when an electric current flows.


'''Current''' is the flow of charged particles (the particles are usually electrons).
The SI '''unit''' of current is the ampere (symbol A).

To understand how current is defined think of standing at a given point in the wire. Electrons are flowing past you.



One Ampere is a flow of one coulomb going past every second.

::1 A = 1 C·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;  (1 A = 1 C/s)

====Definition of the ampere====


BUT this flow of charge idea is NOT the definition of the ampere. The ampere is defined in terms of the force produced between two wires each carrying identical currents:-


''The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; newton per meter of length.''

==Voltage==
Having looked at charge and current, we now need to look at what voltage means.

As you know, electrons repel each other. If you hold one electron near another electron, you have to push against it to hold it in place. If you try to bring it even closer, you have to do work (force times distance) to get it to that new position.

The voltage between one point and another is simply how much work per coulomb is required to move any small test charge from point A to point B.

In most electronic components, it doesn't matter much which path the test charge takes in-between point A and point B.

Voltage is related to the ''energy'' of the charges. Let's go back to the peas in the petri dish. They can be pushed slowly or they can be pushed quickly. The faster they go, the more energy they have.  It's a similar situation for the electrons, except the push isn't provided by a finger! It's provided by the battery.

The battery gives the charges energy. This energy is given up to the various components in the circuit, e.g. bulbs, resistors etc. The energy per unit charge is called the voltage (or the potential difference).

====Definition of the volt====

One volt means one joule of energy per coulomb of charge.

More accurately it has 2 definitions:

Electromotive Force is the amount of energy converted from non-electrical to electrical form when driving 1 coulomb of charge around a completed and closed circuit.

Potential Difference is the amount of energy converted from electrical to non-electrical form when driving 1 coulomb of charge around a completed and closed circuit.

The potential difference between 2 points in a conductor is defined as 1 volt, if 1 Joule of energy is converted from electrical form to non-electrical form, when 1 coulomb of charge per second (1 amp) flows through it. Note: This will only occur between 2 points in a conductor, that has a resistance, defined as 1 ohm. See resistance below.

:1 V = 1 J·C&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;  (1 V = 1 J/C)

==Resistance and Ohm's law==

Resistance is easy to understand. It's just how difficult it is for the charges to flow through an electrical component or from one point to another in an electrical circuit. Imagine a group of walkers travelling down a road. They approach a fork in the road. To the left is a flat straight road leading to a nearby town. To the right is a huge mountain, over which a steep and winding road traverses. This road also leads to the nearby town.

Naturally all the walkers chose the left route. Let's now suppose that there are millions of walkers. They are jam packed on the road, and they are all in a hurry to get to the town as quickly as possible. Now when they come to the fork in the road which way should they go? Most will still go to the left, but a few might chose to go to the right, the road is more difficult but there is no traffic jam, so they might get there quicker.

It's a similar thing with moving charges. Like charges repel, so they would rather not pack in very closely together. Some routes, like wires have very low resistance, while other routes like bulbs have much higher resistance. More charges will go down a low resistance route than a high resistance one. The unit of resistance is the ohm, represented by the Greek letter Omega (&amp;Omega;).

===Ohm's Law===
This law relates resistance, current, and voltage. It's very easy to remember because it's obvious when you think about it. 

Let's think of a wire carrying current from a battery, to a bulb then back to the battery. The voltage of the battery provides the energy of the flowing electrons. Let's assume we want to increase the rate of flow of charge. Remember that current is the rate of flow of charge so we want to increase the current.

*'''Increase the voltage''' If we increase the voltage, we increase the energy of the charges. Each charge will then flow faster, so the current will increase. (A fast moving river carries more water per hour than a slow one of the same size). So current must be proportional to voltage.

*'''Increase the number of charges flowing''' The more charges that flow, the bigger the current will be. (A wide river carries more water per hour than an equally fast flowing but narrower one.) The way to increase the number of charges is to ''decrease'' the resistance. So the current must be proportional to 1&amp;divide;Resistance. We say that it is inversely proportional to the resistance.

*'''So''', the current is proportional to the voltage, and is inversely proportional to the resistance.

So &lt;math&gt;Current = Voltage \times \frac{1}{Resistance}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;Current = \frac{Voltage}{Resistance}&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging gives :
:::&lt;math&gt;Voltage = Current \times Resistance&lt;/math&gt;

In symbols:
:::&lt;math&gt;V=IR&lt;/math&gt;

This is Ohm's law. Learn it by heart.

'''Q2)''' A wire has a resistance of two &amp;Omega; and a voltage of 3 V is applied. What is the current?

'''Q3)'''A wire has a 5 V potential difference applied. the current is 10 A, what is the resistance?

'''Q4)''' A current of 2 A is flowing through a wire with a voltage of 20 V. What is the resistance of the wire?

(Remember to give the units for all your answers).

|
* The unit of current is the ampere (A), and means one coulomb per second.
* The unit of potential difference is the volt (V), and means one joule per coulomb.
* The unit of resistance is the ohm (&amp;Omega;), and is equal to voltage over current.
* Ohm's law, &lt;math&gt;V=IR&lt;/math&gt;, determines the relationship between these three units.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Kpjas, thanks for the work on Othello. Was it hard ? Can we expect more Shakespeare plays to follow ? Did you have to write the script yourself ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
----
If a blessing is all you need and mine is good enough, then go for it ! It took me quite some time to do just one scene of Othello by hand. A little bit of noise due to unexpected variations are no big problem for me; each modern version of Shakespeare's plays has variations due to editorial insight anyways. Any slight errors can be worked out over time, right ? Thanks for your help on this, I am very excited about the opportunities we will have to bring people together for learning. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:So what did you decide ? Are you going to go for it ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Cool, with Macbeth I see you have not yet given up. Who do we have to talk to tho to enable the annotation feature ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==Importing texts==
Is it possible to use scripts to import other texts, such as the physics book that we started to import over to the site by hand ? It would certainly save a lot of tedious work. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==Protecting Shakespeare texts==
Hello Kpjas,

I am feeling very tired with deleting the vandalism on Romeo and Juliet. I cannot revert to your version, because I do not know how

This has been done on 2 acts (Act 3, Scenes 1 and 3) by at least 6 separate IPs, during the past 2 days (8-9 June 2004).

Since you are the one who designed these pages (and will almost certainly have to retype Scene 3 of Act 3), would you consider protecting them?

Thank you very much,

Great work! I'll continue writing the next lesson tomorrow :) --[[User:Dcabrilo|Dcabrilo]] 06:35, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

== Re:Health science bookshelf ==

[[User:Mike.lifeguard]] has done a little bit of work over on the health sciences bookshelf. Specifically, the [[First Aid]] book was his masterpiece. I guess I don't really understand what kinds of problems you are talking about with copyright. What kinds of unforeseeable legal problems are you anticipating? We're pretty flexible, as long as you aren't straight copying content that doesn't belong to you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:05, 25 September 2008 (UTC)

:Okay, I see what you are saying. That page you mentioned does look a little suspect, however going back [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Pharmacology/Antibiotics&amp;oldid=950848 a few revisions] shows us a page that seems less likely to be problematic. If there is something you suspect is a copy+paste violation, do a best effort google search to double check. If things do go bad, we can try, in order of most disruptivity: (1) reverting to a clean revision on the page, (2) deleting the entire page but not the surrounding book, and finally (3) deleting the book. Things would have to be pretty bad, and obviously so, if we were going to resort to option #3.
:If a page doesn't appear to be a copyvio, or if it appears so but you can't confirm it, or if nobody raises an allegation about it, don't worry about it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 22:46, 26 September 2008 (UTC)

== Introduction to the Botany Study Guide == 

This ''Study Guide to the Science of Botany'' is a textbook at '''''Wikibooks''''' shelved at the [[Wikibooks:biology bookshelf]] and intended to establish a course of study in the subject of Botany, utilizing articles provided in '''''[http://www.Wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]''''', with links to other relevant web sites and other Wikibooks as appropriate. In some cases, portions of the text from  ''Wikipedia'' articles have been used to materially develop introductory text within the Guide.    

For the new user, it need be pointed out that ''Wikipedia'' differs from a standard encyclopedia in two important respects: 1) it is a '''hypertext''' document, and 2) it is open and editable, and therefore '''constantly changing'''. For the student following this or any guide through ''Wikipedia'' to cover a specific subject, it is recommended that each article (page) be read first in its entirety, before any hyperlinks are followed to other topics or explanations.  It is too easy, otherwise, to simply become lost in a maze of links, and miss the main thrust of an article presented as an assignment from the Guide.  Because ''Wikipedia'' is constantly changing (and, it is believed, improving) the quality of each article encountered will be variable.  Some articles are well written and go to adequate depth, whereas others, lacking a proponent, are shallow and incomplete. Short or sloppy looking articles may contain questionable facts. These short-comings should diminish with time, but can be a problem for the student.  

One clear advantage to using this Guide linked to a hypertext like ''Wikipedia'' is the &quot;circular redundancy with serendipity&quot; factor that arises when an article is read and its hyperlinks followed; this factor can be a powerful learning tool. The persistent reader is  subjected to a fairly high degree of repetitive reading, often presenting slightly differing perspectives on the same general topic, with the result that learning comes from redundancy and seeing difficult concepts presented in more than one way. At the same time, some hyperlinks lead down less relevant paths, bringing new and unanticipated knowledge. If, as a student, you are truly interested in mastering the subject of botany, you must be prepared to read beyond the basic assignments; in some cases, beyond Wikipedia to explore other, &quot;outside&quot; web sites.  

It seems likely that the typical user of the ''Study Guide to the Science of Botany'' is not necessarily an active student taking a course in botany at the high school (AP) or college level, but a person with a strong interest in plants&amp;mdash;an amateur naturalist or a gardener.  Therefore the guide must incorporate both the basic biological and physiological aspects of plants as well as extensive taxonomy-based coverage of the diversity of plants and related organisms. The amount of material now available on the web covering the latter subject is becoming nothing short of phenomenal. In effect, one now has access to much of the world's plant diversity, with photographs and descriptions, in many cases from web sites maintained by specialists. One goal of the guide is to provide a systematics-based approach to capturing this kind of information, hopefully giving the student a strong background in plant systematics.  The importance of this approach is not that everyone should become a taxonomist&amp;mdash;or become more familiar with plant taxonomy, a specialized field of botanical science with a relatively narrow following&amp;mdash;but that appreciation for (and understanding of) species diversity is most critical at this time in our earth's history marked by accelerated species extinctions and destruction of native ecosystems by both human population expansion and man-induced spread of non-native species.                 

The ''Study Guide to the Science of Botany'' includes two other &quot;parallel&quot; documents intended to enhance the usefulness of the Guide.  These could also be used separately or independently as source documents for a beginning course in Botany.  They are the ''Discussion'' pages and the ''Laboratory Exercise'' pages. Both are explained in detail in the next Section titled ''[[Botany/How_to_use|How to use this Guide]]''.

&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;BIG&gt;How to Use the ''Botany Study Guide''&lt;BIG&gt;&lt;/BIG&gt;

The purpose of the ''Study Guide to the Science of Botany'' is to weave - out of the information on Life Science and especially Botany contained in ''Wikipedia'' - a course of study for the student or layman.  It is anticipated that this course will be either supplemental to instruction being received at a school or college, or will be self-directed. In either case, the Guide is not a novel and should not be approached as one. A smooth flow of dialogue is simply not possible and should not be anticipated.  The Guide may be closer to the sometimes disjointed notes generated by a student from a lecture or careful reading of a detailed textbook.

Within each subsection of a Chapter, introductory text is followed by one or more &quot;reading assignments&quot; of the form:

*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Botany|Botany]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;) 

Following (that is ''clicking'' on) the link (to ''Wikipedia'' &quot;Botany&quot; in this case) will open an article intended to provide the details of the Chapter subsection. Recommended articles should be read from top to bottom, and then re-read following some or all of the links embedded in the article to other articles for expanded elucidation or to clarify terms; that is, in most cases, completion of an &quot;assignment&quot; (recommended article) includes at least some or all articles linked to the first.  Obviously, it cannot be the case that all links are followed to articles, whose links are then followed to articles, and so on until no new material is encountered. It is likely there would be no quick end to such a pursuit. The amount of time spent wandering beyond the original article is partly a personal matter of how much the reader is getting out of the foray than anything else. Realize it is certainly possible to wander well off the subject at hand.  As in the example above, notes are provided with assignments giving some direction for pursuing links. An instruction NOT to follow links simply means the additional material will be encountered later in the course of instruction, and going beyond the assigned article may provide too much detail for a beginning student.  The following example: 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Science|Science]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included:&lt;/small&gt;)
** [[Wikipedia:en:Scientific method|Scientific Method]]
** [[Wikipedia:en:Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]]

specifies that two other links ARE part of the assignment.  Other links encountered may be followed to expand your knowledge or, as always, to aid in  understanding of technical terms encountered. Hyperlinks included with the text in the Guide are there simply for convenience, usually to topics somewhat peripheral to the main one.  In all cases, finding your way back to the Guide may become tricky, but we have to leave this up to you to establish, beyond pointing out that your browser's ''Back'' button is intended for this purpose.   

==Discussion Questions==

At the end of each subsection are posted one to several questions.  In general, you will get more out of these questions if you write out your answer on a piece of paper.  You may wish to accomplish this on the re-read, allowing each question to guide your quest for an answer. A discussion page for each chapter provides answers to the questions posed. However, the questions are intended to be thought-provoking, and may not have a single straight-forward answer. Answers on the discussion pages are also necessarily much longer than would be expected of any one student; it is expected that each student answer will fit somewhere within the broad discussion presented.  

== Laboratory Exercises ==

A natural sciences course laboratory unit is supposed to provide hands-on experience in exploring topics raised in the text and lecture units. The best that a website can give towards this goal is a manual that is liberally provided with pictures and diagrams. The student must provide the &quot;hands on&quot; from the neighboring natural world. Fortunately, in botany, this is much easier to accomplish than in almost any other field of science. Both the outdoors, the local market, and (if available) a botanical garden can be sources of materials for study. Indeed, we may teach the structure of a ''pome'' using an apple in the hope that the student will end up with a pear.

In using any of the Laboratory Exercises, it is always best to read through the entire module before actually doing anything.  Resist the temptation to view the material as an instruction manual to be followed in a specific order.  For one thing it is difficult to write a module that covers, at each step, all that the student should know before proceeding on to the next step. The value of any exercise will be significantly enhanced if you have a pretty good idea where it is going in advance.

== General Navigation ==

The ''Study Guide'' is divided into Sections and Chapters which define the subject material of each module.  At the bottom of each text page (main text of a module), is a short version of the Table of Contents, allowing the reader to jump between chapters within a Section.  Here is an example of the &quot;Wiki Contents Table&quot; for Section I:

{{Template:BotanyTOC}} 
 
Note that at the beginning of each module, links are provided to both the previous chapter and the succeeding chapter, as well as to the main Table of Contents. Links to units associated with a module, as for example to a Laboratory Exercise, appear near the end of the module

== Final Note ==
 
As [[Botany/A final note about the Guide|a final note]], read the next Section and consider how you might make a contribution to the Guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Further Discussion ==
The questions posed in '''Chapter 3. Plant Structure''' are discussed further on this page. Remember, some questions are intended to be thought-provoking and more than one answer may be &quot;correct&quot;.   

&lt;tt&gt;Question&lt;/tt&gt;:
*''At this point the conceptual differences between cell types, tissues, organs, and organisms may be somewhat confusing. Using the leaf as an example, describe this structure in a way that considers the cell types, tissues, and organs for that part of the leaf where photosynthesis is concentrated.''

Photosynthesis is concentrated in the '''mesophyll''' of the leaf. The ''mesophyll'' is a type of ''tissue'' composed of two layers or arrangements of '''chlorenchyma cells''': an upper '''pallisade layer''' of tightly packed parenchyma (called pallisade chlorenchyma), and a lower '''spongy layer''' of loosely packed parenchyma (or spongy chlorenchyma). One could regard these layers as different tissue types (''simple tissues'') and the mesophyll as a ''complex tissue''. The mesophyll is packed between two protective layers of '''epidermal cells''' (tissue: epidermis of epidermal cells and cuticle), which along with the vascular tissue and perhaps other structural tissues form an ''organ'' called the leaf whose primary function is food production for the ''organsim'': the plant.

Leaves usually have a stem-like structural part called a '''petiole''' by which they attach to another plant organ termed the '''stem'''.

'''Gibbs free energy''' is represented by the following equation:

:'''&amp;Delta;G = &amp;Delta;H -T&amp;Delta;S'''

:&amp;Delta;G is the change in Gibbs free energy.
:&amp;Delta;H is the change in potential energy, sometimes known as the enthalpy of a system.
:T is the temperature in Kelvin.
:&amp;Delta;S is a statistical correlation, known as the entropy of a system.

&lt;!-- The main idea is that the lowest energy is favored. FALSE  Whenever there is a reaction for which there also is a reverse reaction, nature favours the one reaction, whose products are lesser in energy. --&gt;

The basic principle is that ''total'' entropy increases. This increase can be because of an increase in the entropy of the chemicals, ''&amp;Delta;S'', or because the reaction has produced heat, increasing the entropy of the environment.

The Gibbs free energy lets us calculate the total increase in entropy, including the effects on the environment, without needing to know anything about the environment.

At ''low'' temperatures, ''&amp;Delta;G'' is approximately ''&amp;Delta;H'', and nature favours the reaction with lowest energy products, which release the most heat. This may ''reduce'' the entropy of the ''system'', but the ''increase'' in the entropy of the ''environment'' more than compensates.

At ''high'' temperatures, ''&amp;Delta;G'' is approximately ''-T&amp;Delta;S'', and nature favours the reaction with high energy products, which may actually absorb heat. This may ''reduce'' the entropy of the ''environment'', but the ''increase'' in the entropy of the ''system'' more than compensates.

Either way, the Gibbs free energy ''always'' decreases.

Notes: 4/5th declensions are modified 3rd declensions, thus behave similarily. 3rd declension is either M/F/N, 4th declension is either M/F/N and 5th declension is either M/F. So for 3rd, 4th, and 5th declension is of most importance to memorise the gender because the adjective will still need to agree (ie have the same) with the noun in both case, gender, and number.

The Vocative only changes for the 2nd declension masculine singular (however not for the nouns that leave the -us suffix when in nominative).

There are a few exceptions in the 1st declension which are not feminine. Such nouns are poet-a (1st declension masculine, so to agree you need to use -us on the adjective) and naut-a.

There are a few second declension nouns with irregularities. It is of most importance that you memorise them.

When memorising a noun's meaning, make sure that you also memorise any irregularities the noun has, the gender, and the declension. Without doing this you may have trouble translating. For example, 2nd declension masculines have -us in the nominative singular; however, 4th declension masculines have -us in the nominative singular, nominative plural and accusative plural. This may get you confused if you do not memorise the declension of each noun.


==Single Declension Theory==
If you look at the above list of declensions, you may feel that you are going to be overcome if you have to memorize all of it.  Memorization is indeed the key, but it will be easier than you think.  Each word in Latin has three parts: the root, the stem vowel, and the ending.  There are five vowels in Latin, so there are five stem vowels: A,O,I,U,E. Any word not really having a stem vowel naturally was given to I. If you study the declension patterns enough you will see that there are many similarities in the declensions.  All accusative singulars end in &quot;m&quot; except neuters that sometimes still do.  All accusative plurals end in 's' except neuters that always end in ''a''.  All genitive plurals end in &quot;um&quot;, be it ''ium, rum, uum'' or whatever else.
If you read enough Latin you will actually find that authors would switch a declension of a word at will if it made the sentence clearer.  Thus many words that are of the 4th declension were sometimes written as if 2nd, and 5th declension as if 3rd and vice versa.  Some ending patterns that we use for one declension may also be used in another, again to make the sentence clearer.  Thus &quot;filiabus&quot; would be used in any sentence where we want to make it clear that we are talking about the Daughters and specifically not the Sons.  We also see examples of this in ''animabus''.  Some think that the ''IS'' used in the first and second declensions was actually an abbreviation of ''bus''.
Some students find the ablative difficult since it sometimes looks like the nominative singular, dative plural or neither.  All you really need to do to get the hang of this is to know that in the plural, the ablative always looks like the dative.  If there is no prepostion in front of it then it is probably a dative, unless it is being used in an ablative construction that would likely be apparent.  If there is a preposition and it looks like a dative, just remember that no preposition takes a dative, only ever ablative and sometimes accusative.  Dative plural plus preposition equals ablative.  The ablative singular is really just the root plus the stem vowel with no ending to speak of, since the preposition tells you the grammar of the word.  Some students also get confused by words that are the same in the nominative singular and plural.  Don't worry about that; the verb will tell you which it is since the verb always agrees with the nominative.
It is thought that originally there was only one declension, but during the task of applying it to every word in natural speech it was found that some words naturally changed the way the basic sounds of the original declension worked.  Here is one idea of the original basic declension.


{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! Case
! Root
! Stem Vowel
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| nominative || puell || a || None || es
|-
| genitive || puell || a || is || rum
|-
| dative || puell || a || i || bus
|-
| accusative || puell || a || m || s
|-
| ablative || puell || a || none || bus
|}

When speaking in everyday conversation, Latin speakers would shorten the word in their pronunciation so long as it still made sense.  If you go to New Orleans you will likely hear someone say 'prowly'.  This is not a new dish at a resturaunt or a new new code name for the police, it is actually the local pronunciation of the word ''probably''.  It is ok to shorten this word because when it is shortened everyone can still understand it.  The Latins did the same thing.  It is known that ''I'' can change to ''E'' and vice versa, so we can see that pattern in the dative singular of all declensions.  The ''IS'' of the genitive was kept in the 3rd declension, shortened in the 1st, 2nd, and 5th and slightly altered in the 4th.  The 'add ''M''' rule of the accusative singular is seen in the altering of the stem vowel in the 2nd and 3rd declensions.  The ''ES'' of the nominative plural became ''E'' in 1st, ''I'' in 2nd, and ''US'' in 4th.  The ''RUM'' of the genitive plural was shortened in the 3rd and 4th declensions.  The accusative plural as a rule never changes, but keep in mind that neuter words followed a different pattern of using ''A'' for the accusative plural, and all neuters took the accusative singular or plural for the nominative of the same number.  The ''BUS'' of the dative/ ablative plural was shortened to ''IS'' in the 1st and 2nd declensions but kept in the others.  The 4th declension has a tendency to copy the ''IBUS'' of the 3rd in some authors but retain the ''UBUS'' in others.  When studying Latin declensions you really should strive to memorize the patterns, but also look to see how they are similar to other patterns in the language as it will help you to remember.  Also note that the ''IS'' of the genitive singular is what eventually gave us the word ''HIS'' and the  'add 's'&quot; rule of English.  Latin also gave us the 'add 's'&quot; to make a plural by way of the accusative plural.  If you study other inflexive languages related to Latin, such as Greek, you will notice even similarities across languages.

==The Genitive==
The genitive case is a descriptive case. The genitive case describes the following features of the described noun:
*Possession e.g. The dog of Marcus ''or'' Marcus's dog (canis Marcī)
*Origin e.g. Marcus of Rome (Marcus Romae)
*Relation e.g. A thing of beauty (rēs pulchrae)
*Quantity e.g. A gallon of water
*Quality e.g. Day of wrath (diēs irae)

Quite simply, a word in the genitive case is translated with the preposition &quot;of&quot;. Note that Latin does not have a separate form for the possessive genitive (''Marcus's dog'' vs ''The dog of Marcus''), as English does. A word in the genitive case showing possession can be translated either way.

|- style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;
| nominative noun || genitive (plural)

| genitive || verb || nominative adj.
|}

===Exercise 1===
Indicate the word in the genitive:
#Flavia's dog is good.
#The man has his mother's good taste.

==Agreeing with the Adjectives==
When adjectives are used to describe nouns in the genitive case, they must have the same case, number, and gender as the noun to which it refers.

===Example===
;A road of beautiful Rome → Via Romae pulchrae.
:If we look at the bare necessities, namely nouns, in this phrase, then we get &quot;road of Rome,&quot; which is translated as &quot;via Romae.&quot; Now, let's look at the adjective: beautiful (''pulchra''). Its antecedent (the noun it modifies) is Rome. Since Rome is in the genitive case, ''pulchra'' also needs to be in the genitive case. Both are already feminine, so we don't need to change that. 
:To make ''pulchra'' in the genitive singular case, we replace the final &quot;-a&quot; with a &quot;-ae,&quot; and we get ''pulchrae''.

It's that simple.

==The Dative==
The dative case, also known as the indirect object case indicates:
*For whom, e.g., I made this car '''for him'''.
*To whom, e.g., I gave this car '''to him'''.

Latin does not distinguish between &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;, though this is sometimes the case in English:
*I made this car '''for him'''. ↔ I made '''him''' this car.
*I gave this car '''to him'''. ↔ I gave '''him''' this car.

===Example 1===
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#ccc;&quot;
| He || made || the desk || for || his friend
|- style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;
| nominative noun || verb || accusative || dative prep. || dative
|}

'For' is the preposition indicating a dative. 'For' can be used in some other constructs. To determine whether it is dative, analyse the meaning of the sentence (see Example 3). Practice will enable you to quickly spot the case of a noun in the sentence without much effort.

===Example 2===
''He gave the book '''to John'''''; ''He gave '''to John''' the book''; or ''He gave '''John''' the book''.

This demonstrates how English can use prepositions to change word order and even 'presume' a certain preposition exists that has been left out, giving a dative construct.

==Roman Numerals==
The Romans did not use the Hindu-Arabic numerals we use today. They used their own symbols and own numeric system. We still use Roman Numerals today.

===Page formatting===
Your question: &quot;Do you have any advice on fixing layout? After editing
the changes the page looks hideous.&quot;

Dan, I'm looking around for some good links on how to format things in Wiki markup language (I just made that term up). Mostly regular HTML works but there are a number of shortcuts .. like to make an external link use a single pair of these things: [ ] with the link inbetween. For an internal link do double: [[ ]] and just put the last part of the link on there, the page name. Is that what you are talking about ? Or other formatting issues .. you can upload images easy too. Do you want a different font, or what ? I'm not the most knowlegable but there are people around that I can find to help you. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Haloalkanes''' are alkanes that contain one or more members of the halogen family. The halogens found in organic molecules are chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine. Some texts refer to this class of compounds as '''halogenoalkanes''' or '''alkyl halides'''. This text will frequently use both '''haloalkane''' and '''alkyl halide''', so it's important to remember that they are the same thing.

''Note:'' The X in R-X represents a generic halogen atom.

=Preparation=

Methods for preparation are found elsewhere in this text:

*Preparation from [[Organic_Chemistry/Alcohols#Conversion_of_alcohols_to_haloalkanes|Alcohols]] (nucleophilic substitution)

*Preparation from [[Alkanes]] (radical substitution)

*Preparation from [[Organic_Chemistry/Alkenes#Electrophilic_addition|Alkenes]] (electrophilic addition)
*Preparation by halogen exchange.*It is generally used for preparing iodoalkanes.
*Preparation from silver salts of acids*

=Properties=

==Naming Haloalkanes==

Haloalkanes are named by adding a prefix to the name of the alkane from which they are derived. The prefix denotes the particular halogen used.

'''F''' = ''Fluoro-''&lt;br&gt;
'''Cl''' = ''Chloro-''&lt;br&gt;
'''Br''' = ''Bromo-''&lt;br&gt;
'''I''' = ''Iodo-''&lt;br&gt;

If other substituents need to be named, all prefixes are still put in alphabetical order. When necessary, numbers identify substituent locations.

===Example names of haloalkanes===

==Physical properties==

'''R-X bond polarity:''' C—F &gt; C—Cl &gt; C—Br &gt; C—I

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''atom''' &lt;nowiki&gt;| &lt;/nowiki&gt;
|''' electronegativity''' &lt;nowiki&gt;| &lt;/nowiki&gt;
|''' difference from C''' (= 2.5) &lt;nowiki&gt;| &lt;/nowiki&gt;
|-
|F
|4.0
|1.5
|-
|Cl
|3.0
|0.5
|-
|Br
|2.8
|0.3
|-
|I
|2.5
|0.0
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The difference in electronegativity of the carbon-halogen bonds range from 1.5 in C-F to almost 0 in C-I. This means that the C-F bond is extremely polar, though not ionic, and the C-I bond is almost nonpolar.

'''Physical appearance:''' Haloalkanes are colourless when pure. However bromo and iodo alkanes develop colour when exposed to light. Many volatile halogen compounds have sweet smell.

'''Boiling point:''' Haloalkanes are generally liquids at room temperature. Haloalkanes generally have a boiling point that is higher than the alkane they are derived from. This is due to the increased molecular weight due to the large halogen atoms and the increased intermolecular forces due to the polar bonds, and the increasing polarizabilty of the halogen.

For the same alkyl group, the boiling point of haloalkanes decreases in the order RI &gt; RBr &gt; RCl &gt; RF.This is due to the increase in [[w:van der Waals forces|van der Waals forces]] when the size and mass of the halogen atom increases.

For isomeric haloalkanes, the boiling point decrease with increase in branching. But boiling points of dihalobenzenes are nearly same; however the para-isomers have higher melting points as it fits into the crystal lattice better when compared to ortho- and meta-isomers.

'''Density:''' Haloalkanes are generally more dense than the alkane they are derived from and usually more dense than water. Density increases with the number of carbon and halogen atom. It also increases with the increase in mass of halogen atom.

'''Solubility:''' The haloalkanes are only very slightly soluble in water, but dissolves in organic solvents. This is because for dissolving haloalkanes in water the strong hydrogen bonds present in the latter has to be broken. When dissolved in organic (non polar) solvents, the intermolecular attractions are almost same as that being broken.

'''Bond Length:''' C—F &lt; C—Cl &lt; C—Br &lt; C—I

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''bond'''
|'''length''' (pm)
|-
|C-F
|138
|-
|C-Cl
|177
|-
|C-Br
|193
|-
|C-I
|214
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Larger atoms means larger bond lengths, as the orbitals on the halogen is larger the heavier the halogen is. In F, the orbitals used to make the bonds is 2s and 2p, in Cl, it's 3s and 3p, in Br, 4s and 4p, and in I, 5s and 5p. The larger the principal quantum number, the bigger the orbital. This is somewhat offset by the larger effective nuclear charge, but not enough to reverse the order.

==Chemical properties==

'''Bond strength:''' C—F &gt; C—Cl &gt; C—Br &gt; C—I

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|'''bond'''
|'''strength''' (kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
|-
|C-F
|484
|-
|C-Cl
|338
|-
|C-Br
|276
|-
|C-I
|238
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The orbitals C uses to make bonds are 2s and 2p. The overlap integral is larger the closer the principal quantum number of the orbitals is, so the overlap is larger in the bonds to lighter halogens, making the bond formation energetically favorable.

'''Bond reactivity:''' C—F &lt; C—Cl &lt; C—Br &lt; C—I

Stronger bonds are more difficult to break, making them less reactive. In addition, the reactivity can also be determined by the stability of the corresponding anion formed in solution. One of the many trends on the periodic table states that the largest atoms are located on the bottom right corner, implying that iodine is the largest and fluorine being the smallest. When fluorine leaves as fluoride (if it does) in the reaction, it is not so stable compared to iodide. Because there are no resonance forms and inductive stabilizing effects on these individual atoms, the atoms must utilize their own inherent abilities to stabilize themselves. Iodide has the greatest surface area out of these four elements, which gives it the ability to better distribute its negative charge that it has obtained. Fluorine, having the least surface area, is much more difficult to stabilize. This is the reason why iodine is the best leaving group out of the four halogens discussed.

=Reactions=

'''Determination of Haloalkanes:''' A famous test used to determine if a compound is a haloalkane is the Beilstein test, in which the compound tested is burned in a loop of copper wire.  The compound will burn green if it is a haloalkane. The numbers of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atoms present in each molecule can be determined using the sodium fusion reaction, in which the compound is subjected to the action of liquid sodium, an exceptionally strong reducing agent, which causes the formation of sodium halide salts. Qualitative analysis can be used to discover which halogens were present in the original compound; quantitative analysis is used to find the quantities.

==Substitution reactions of haloalkanes==

R-X bonds are very commonly used throughout organic chemistry because their polar bonds make them reasonably reactive. In a '''substitution reaction''', the halogen (X) is replaced by another substituent (Y). The alkyl group (R) is not changed.

Substitutions involving haloalkanes involve a type of substition called '''Nucleophilic substitution''', in which the substituent Y is a '''nucleophile'''. A nucleophile is an electron pair donor. The nucleophile replaces the halogen, an ''electrophile'', which becomes a '''leaving group'''. The leaving group is an electron pair acceptor. Nuclephilic substition reactions are abbreviated as S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; reactions.

''Any halogen could be used instead of Br''

===Reaction mechanisms===

Nucleophilic substitution can occur in two different ways. S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 involves a '''backside attack'''. S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 involves a '''carbocation intermediate'''.

'''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism'''
[[File:backsideattack.gif|frame|center|Illustration of the Sn2 mechanism. First, the electrons in the nucleophile attack the central carbon atom from the side opposite the leaving group (in this case, a halogen). The electrons forming the bond between the central carbon atom and the halogen move to the halogen, causing the halogen to leave the molecule.]]

'''S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 mechanism'''
[[File:sn1mechanism.gif|frame|center|Illustration of the Sn1 mechanism. First, in the presence of a polar solvent, the C-X bond breaks, forming the carbocation. This carbocation intermediate is highly reactive. In this case, it reacts with water. Note that the water may attack from either side.]]

===Comparison of S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 and S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 mechanism===

'''Stereochemistry:''' &lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 - Configuration is inverted (i.e. R to S and vice-versa). &lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 - Product is a mixture of inversion and retention of orientation because the carbocation can be attacked from either side. In theory the products formed are usually racemic due to the 50% change of attack from the planar conformation. Interestingly, the amount of the inverted product is often up to 20% greater than the amount of product with the original orientation. Saul Winstein has proposed that this discrepancy occurs through the leaving group forming an ion pair with the substrate, which temporarily shields the carbocation from attack on the side with the leaving group. &lt;br&gt;

'''Rate of reaction:'''&lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 - Rate depends on concentrations of both the haloalkane and the nucleophile. S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions are fast.&lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 - Rate depends only on the concentration of the haloalkane. The carbocation forms much slower than it reacts with other molecules. This makes S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 reactions slow.&lt;br&gt;

'''Role of solvent:'''&lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 - Polar aprotic solvents favored. Examples: Acetone, THF (an ether), dimethyl sulfoxide, n,n-dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA).&lt;br&gt;
Nonpolar solvents will also work, such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
Protic solvents are the worst type for S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions because they &quot;cage,&quot; or solvate, the nucleophile, making it much less reactive.&lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 - Polar protic solvents favored. Examples: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Formic acid, methanol.&lt;br&gt;
Aprotic solvents will work also, but protic solvents are better because they will stabilize the leaving group, which is usually negatively charged, by solvating it. Nonpolar solvents are the worst solvent for S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 reactions because they do nothing to stabilize the carbocation intermediate.&lt;br&gt;

'''Role of nucleophile:'''&lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 - Good nucleophiles favored&lt;br&gt;
S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 - Any nucleophile will work (since it has no effect on reaction rate)&lt;br&gt;

'''Carbocation stability:'''&lt;br&gt;
3&lt;sup&gt;&amp;deg;&lt;/sup&gt; carbon - most stable = S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 favored&lt;br&gt;
2&lt;sup&gt;&amp;deg;&lt;/sup&gt; carbon - less stable = either could be favored&lt;br&gt;
1&lt;sup&gt;&amp;deg;&lt;/sup&gt; carbon - seldom forms = S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 favored&lt;br&gt;
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - never forms = S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 favored&lt;br&gt;
The reason why the tertiary carbocation is most favored is due to the inductive effect. In the carbocation intermediate, there is a resulting formal charge of +1 on the carbon that possessed the haloalkane. The positive charge will attract the electrons available. Because this is tertiary, meaning that adjacent carbon atoms and substituents are available, it will provide the most electron-density to stabilize this charge.

===Example===

Predict whether the following reactions will undergo S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 or S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 and tell why.

'''Answers:'''&lt;br&gt;
1) S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2. Good nucleophile, polar solvent.&lt;br&gt;
2) S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1. Tertiary carbon, polar solvent. Very slow reaction rate.&lt;br&gt;
3) S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2. Primary carbon, good nucleophile, nonpolar solvent.&lt;br&gt;

==Grignard reagents==

Grignard reagents are created by reacting magnesium metal with a haloalkane. The magnesium atom gets between the alkyl group and the halogen atom with the general reaction:

R-Br + Mg &amp;rarr; R-Mg-Br

Gringard reagents are very reactive and thus provide a means of organic synthesis from haloalkanes. For example, adding water gives the alcohol R-OH.
Basic:
R-X + Mg → R-Mg-X
For example
(X=Cl and R=CH3):
CH3-Cl + Mg → CH3MgCl
(methylmagnesiumchloride)

==Elimination reactions==

With alcoholic potassium hydroxide, haloalkanes lose H-X and form the corresponding alkene. Very strong bases such as KNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; convert vic-dihalides (haloalkanes with two halogen atoms on adjacent carbons) into alkynes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Arrival of Columbus ==

Christopher Columbus and three ships - the ''Ni&amp;ntilde;a'', the ''Pinta'', and the ''Santa Maria'' - set sail on August 3, 1492. On October 12, a lookout cried out that he had sighted land. The crew set foot on an island that day, naming it San Salvador. It is unknown which exact island was discovered by Columbus. (Note that the island presently called San Salvador is so-called in honor of Columbus' discovery; it is not necessarily the one on which Columbus set foot.)

The Native Americans inhabiting the islands were described as &quot;Indians&quot; by Columbus, who had believed that he had discovered the East Indies (modern Indonesia). In reality, he had found an island in the Caribbean. He continued to explore the area, returning to Spain. Columbus' misconception that he found Asia was corrected years later by the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci, after whom ''America'' may be named.

== The Protestant Reformation ==

In Europe, the power of the Pope and the influence of Catholicism was undoubted. The Catholic religion affected every aspect of politics on the continent. However, in the sixteenth century, the conditions were ripe for reform. Gutenberg's printing press made the spread of ideas much easier. The influence of nationalism grew, and rulers began to resent the power possessed by the Pope. 

The Protestant movement may have commenced earlier, but the publication of ''Ninety-Five Theses'' by Martin Luther in 1517 spurred on the revolution within the Church. Luther attacked the Church's theology, which, he believed, misrepresented The Bible and placed too much authority in the hands of the clergy, and wished to reform the Church. After being excommunicated, Luther published many books on Reform. Luther's works were most
influential in Germany and Scandinavia.

Persons other than Luther championed the cause of Reform. In Switzerland, Huldreich Zwingli advanced Protestant ideas, which mostly affected his home country. Similarly, Frenchman John Calvin helped the spread of Protestantism in France and the Netherlands.

English Protestantism resulted from the direct influence of the British monarch.  Henry VIII (1509-1547) sought to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she had failed to produce a viable male heir to the throne.  When his divorce led to excommunication by the Pope, Henry simply declared the entire country free of Catholic domination and a bastion of Protestantism.  Henry reasoned that England could survive under its own religious regulation (Anglican) and he named himself head of the church.

== Elizabethan England ==

'''Elizabethan Succession'''&lt;br&gt;

After Henry VIII died, he was succeeded by his son Edward VI (1547-1553) who reigned briefly before dying.  Edward's death led to the ascension of Henry's daughter by Catherine, Mary I (1553-1558).  A staunch Catholic, Mary sought to return England back to the Catholic church.  Her religious zeal and persecution of Protestants earned her the nickname, &quot;Bloody Mary.&quot;  After a short reign, she was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth.  Elizabeth I (1558-1603) was the daughter of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn.  Her ascendency to the throne resulted when neither of her half siblings, Edward and Mary, produced an heir to the throne.  

'''Religious Reform'''&lt;br&gt;

Under her siblings' reign, the nation constantly battled religious fervor as it sought to identify itself as either Protestant or Catholic.  Henry VIII had severed ties with the Roman Catholic Church upon his excommunication after divorcing Catherine of Aragon.  He established the Church of England (the precursor to the Anglican Church) as the official state religion and named himself, not the Pope, as its head.  Under Mary, the country returned to Catholic rule.  The Elizabethan Age brought stability to English government. Elizabeth sought a compromise (the Elizabethan Settlement) which returned England to a nation governed by Protestant theology with a Catholic ritual.  Elizabeth called Parliament in 1559 to consider the Reformation Bill that re-established an independent Church of England and redefined the sacrament of communion.  Parliament also approved the Act of Supremacy, establishing ecclesiastical authority with the monarch.

'''Economic Reform'''&lt;br&gt;

Elizabeth's far more important response was to stabilize the English economy following the 1551 collapse of the wool market.  To respond to this economic crisis, Elizabeth used her power as monarch to shift the supply-demand curve.  She expelled all non-English wool merchants from the empire.  Her government placed quotas on the amount of wool that could be produced while also encouraging manors to return to agricultural production.  She also started trading directly with the Spanish colonies in direct violation of their tariff regulations.  This maritime violation would later result in an attack on England by the Spanish Armada in 1588.

Queen Elizabeth was a very popular monarch.  Her people followed her in war and peace.  She remained unmarried until her death, probably through a reluctance to share any power and preferring a series of suitors.  This gave her the name,  ''the Virgin Queen,'' and in honor of her, a colony was named ''Virginia'' a few years after her death.

In the aftermath of the Armada's overwhelming defeat and building on the development of a strong fleet started by Henry VIII, England began to gain recognition as a great naval power. Nationalism in England increased tremendously. Thoughts of becoming a colonial power were inspired. These thoughts were aided by the fact that the defeated Spanish lost both money and morale, and would be easy to oppose in the New World.

== Early Colonial Ventures ==

'''Richard Hakluyt'''

In 1584, Richard Hakluyt proposed a strong argument for expansion of English settlement into the new world.  With his ''Discourse Concerning Western Planting,'' Hakluyt argued that creating new world colonies would greatly benefit England.  The colonies could easily produce raw materials that were unavailable in England.  By establishing colonies, England would assure itself of a steady supply of materials that it currently purchased from other world powers.  Second, inhabited colonies would provide a stable market for English manufactured goods.  Finally, as the economic incentives were not enough, the colonies could provide a home for disavowed Englishmen.

'''Roanoke'''

The English had already begun the exploration of the New World prior to the Armada's defeat. In 1584, Queen Elizabeth granted Sir Walter Raleigh a charter authorizing him to explore the island of Roanoke, which is part of what is now North Carolina. 

Between 1584 and 1586, Raleigh financed expeditions to explore the island of Roanoke and determine if the conditions were proper for settlement. In 1586, about a hundred men were left on the island. They struggled to survive, being reduced to eating dogs. They were, however, rescued- except for fifteen men whose fate remained a mystery.

After another expedition in 1587, another group of men, women, and children- a total of more than one-hundred people- remained on the island. Governor John White of the Roanoke colony discovered from a local Native American tribe that the fifteen men who were not rescued were killed by a rival tribe. While attempting to gain revenge, White's men killed members of a friendly tribe and not the members of the tribe that allegedly killed the fifteen men.

Having thus strained relations with the Natives, the settlers could not survive easily. John White decided to return to England in 1587 and return with more supplies. When he returned, England faced war against Spain. Thus delayed, White could not return to Roanoke until 1590. When he did return, White discovered that Roanoke was abandoned. All that gave clue to the fate of the colony was the word ''Croatan,'' the name of a nearby Native American tribe, carved out on to a tree. No attempt was made to discover the actual cause of the disappearance until several years later.

There are only theories as to the cause of the loss of Roanoke. There are two major possibilities. Firstly, the settlers may have been killed by the Natives. Second, the settlers may have assimilated themselves into the Native tribes. But there is no evidence that settles the matter beyond doubt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Patterns of Colonization ==

The islands of Great Britain changed greatly in the Renaissance, resulting in the Church of England, the British Civil War, and total transformation of economic, political, and legal systems. Yet through this time, despite pressure from other nations and America's own Natives, a diverse set of English colonies were planted and thrived.  

These new colonies were funded in three different ways. In one plan, '''corporate colonies''' were established by joint stock companies. A joint stock company was a project in which people would invest shares of stock into building a new colony. Depending on the success of the colony, each investor would receive profit based on the shares he had bought. This investment was less risky than starting a colony from scratch, and each investor influenced how the colony was run. These investors often elected their own public officials. (An example of a joint stock company on another continent was the British East India Company.) Virginia was settled in this way.

'''Proprietary colonies''' were owned by a person or family who made laws and appointed officials as he or they pleased. Development was often a direct result of this ownership. Charles II granted William Penn the territory now known as Pennsylvania. Penn's new colony gave refuge to Quakers, a group of millennialist Protestants who opposed the Church of England. (Quakers did not have ministers and did not hold to civil or religious inequality, making them a dangerous element in hierarchical societies.) Penn was an outspoken Quaker and had written many pamphlets defending the Quaker faith. He also invited settlers from other countries and other Protestant minorities, and even some Catholics. 

Finally, '''royal colonies''' were under the direct control of the King, who appointed a Royal Governor. The resulting settlement was not always identical to England. For example, England had broken with Catholicism during the reign of Henry the Eighth, and the Old Faith was seen not only as religious heresy but the prelude to domination by other countries. Yet Maryland's grant of toleration of Catholics was granted as a boon from the British Crown. In 1634, Lord Baltimore appointed George Calvert of England to settle a narrow strip of land north of Virginia and south of Pennsylvania as a Catholic colony via a royal charter. Fifteen years later, in 1649, he signed the Act of Toleration, which proclaimed religious freedom for its colonists. Despite the original charter, Protestants later became the majority faith. After Lord Baltimore's death several years later, Margaret Brent, the wife of an esteemed landowner in Maryland, executed his will as governor of the colony. She defied gender roles in the colonies by being the first woman of non-royal heritage to govern an English colony.

== Massachusetts Bay Colony ==
The ''Massachusetts Bay Colony'', another corporate colony, was founded as a place far from England where its religious dissenters could live. The Puritans, a group of radical Protestants who wanted what they called a return to the faith of the Bible, suffered torture and execution because they disagreed with the official Church of England. In 1620, forty-one Puritans (who called themselves Pilgrims) sailed for the new world. Their own contemporary accounts show that the Pilgrims originally intended to settle the Hudson River region near present day Long Island, New York. Once Cape Cod was sighted, they turned south to head for the Hudson River, but encountered treacherous seas and nearly shipwrecked. They then decided to return to Cape Cod rather than risk another attempt to head south. After weeks of scouting for a suitable settlement area, the Mayflower's passengers finally landed at Plymouth in present-day Massachusetts on December 26, 1620. They called it Massachusetts after the name of the Indian tribe then living there. 

[[File:The Mayflower Compact 1620 cph.3g07155.jpg|thumb|Passengers of the Mayflower signing the &quot;Mayflower Compact&quot;]]

William Bradford, who was selected as a governor after the death of John Carver, wrote a journal that helps us to better understand the hardships colonists endured, encounters with the Native Americans, and ultimately, the success of the colony. The Pilgrims agreed to govern themselves in the manner set forth in the Mayflower Compact, which signed on the Pilgrims' ship, The Mayflower. After two years they abandoned the communal form of partnership begun under the Compact and in 1623 assigned individual plots of land to each family to work.  

Ten years later, the joint-stock Massachusetts Bay Company acquired a charter from King Charles of England. The colony of Plymouth was eventually absorbed by Massachusetts Bay, but it remained separate until 1691. 

A large group of Pilgrims later migrated to the new colony of Massachusetts Bay. In keeping with its mother Church of England, the colony did not provide religious freedom. It only allowed (male) Puritans the right to vote, established Puritanism as the official religion of the colony in The Act of Toleration, and punished people who did not go to their Church.

== New York ==
Other countries used the joint-stock company to fund exploration. In 1609, the Dutch East India company discovered a territory on the eastern coast of North America, from latitude 38 to 45 degrees north. This was an expedition in the yacht Halve Maen (&quot;Half Moon&quot;) commanded by Henry Hudson. Adriaen Block and Hendrick Christiaensz explored the territory from 1611 until 1614. In March of 1614 the States General, the governing body of the Netherlands, proclaimed exclusive patent for trade in the New World. The States General issued patents for development of New Netherland as a private commercial venture. Ft. Nassau was swiftly built in the area of present day Albany to defend river traffic and to trade with Native Americans. New Netherland became a province of the Dutch Republic in 1624. The northern border was then reduced to 42 degrees north, as the English had encroached north of Cape Cod. 

According to the Law of Nations, a claim on a territory required not only discovery and charting but settlement. In May 1624 the Dutch completed their claim by landing thirty Dutch families on Noten Eylant, modern Governors Island. 

In the next few decades incompetent directors-general ran New Netherland. The settlers were attacked by Native Americans, and British and Dutch conflicts seemed destined to destroy the colony. All that changed when Peter Stuyvesant was appointed Director-General in 1647. As he arrived he said, &quot;I shall govern you as a father his children&quot;. He expanded the colony's borders. He oversaw conquest of the one settlement of northernmost Europe, New Sweden, in 1655. He resolved the border dispute with New England in 1650. He improved defenses against Native American raids, and the population of the colony went from 500 in 1640 to 9,000 by 1664. But in August of 1664, four English warships arrived in New York Harbor demanding the surrender of the colony. At first, Stuyvesant vowed to fight, but there was little ammunition and gunpowder. He received weak support from the overwhelmed colonists, and was forced to surrender. New Netherland was subsequently renamed ''New York'', in honor of the British Duke of York.

In an attempt to gain supremacy over trade, the English waged war against the Dutch in 1664. The English took control over the Dutch harbor of New Amsterdam on the Atlantic coast of America. James, the brother of King Charles II, received the charter for New Amsterdam and the surrounding Dutch territory. 

In 1673 the Dutch, lead by Michiel de Ruyter, briefly reoccupied New Netherland again, this time naming it New Orange. After peace was made, ending the Third Anglo-Dutch War, they agreed to return it to the English.

== Patterns of Colonization in the Other Early Colonies ==

The territory of Carolina, named after the British King Charles I, was granted as a proprietary colony to eight different nobles. The proprietors divided Carolina into two separate colonies -- ''North Carolina'' and ''South Carolina''.

Four colonies were formed by division from already extant larger territories. When New Holland was taken to become New York, King James granted a portion of the territory, present-day ''New Jersey'', to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Cartaret, while retaining present-day New York for himself as a proprietary colony. Sir George had come from the Isle of Jersey, and the new colony was named accordingly. Another portion of the territory became the crown colony Connecticut. This colony was also named for its native tribe of Indians. A corner of Pennsylvania which was not peopled by Quakers separated in 1704 to become the colony of ''Delaware''. This was given the name of Thomas West, Third Baron De La Warr, a nobleman under Queen Elizabeth and a noted adventurer.

''Rhode Island'' was a unique experiment in religious and political freedom. Massachusetts banished Roger Williams after he began asserting that Jesus Christ meant for the Church to be separate from the governing authority. This dissenter from the Church of England, and then from the Puritans, became the first American Baptist. After many adventures in other colonies, he bought land from the Narragansett Indians for a new settlement. Providence was meant to be a colony free from religious entanglements and a refuge for people of conscience. He was later followed by Anne Hutchinson. She had outraged Boston divines because she was a woman who preached, and because she believed that one's works were not always tied to grace, unlike the Puritans. She also bought land from the Indians. On this was the settlement subsequently named Portsmouth, and afterward a dissident sister town, Newport. The colony was partially based upon Aquidneck Island, later called Rhode Island for unknown reasons, and the entire establishment eventually took its name from that place. 

Georgia was another proprietary colony, named after King George I, with a charter granted to James Oglethorpe and others in 1732. It was intended as a &quot;buffer&quot; colony to protect the others from attacks from the Florida Spanish and the Louisiana French. Because of this, Georgia was the only colony to receive funds from the Crown from its founding. The laws in Great Britain put people in prison for debt. Many of these people were shipped from overcrowded jails to freedom in the wilds of Georgia colony. America was already seen as a land of prosperity, and Oglethorpe hoped that the ex-prisoners would soon become honest and rich. However, few of the prisoners of London jails knew how to survive in the new wilderness.

==Portrait of the British Colonies==

The Colonies are often considered as three groups: '''New England''' (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut), '''the Southern Colonies''' (Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia), and '''the Middle Colonies''' (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware).  Sometimes the Carolinas and Georgia are counted as separate from the Chesapeake Colonies.

Each group had geographic and economic characteristics. New England's rocky soil only encouraged small farms, and its agricultural opportunities were limited. Thus it focused on fishing, forestry, shipping, and small industry to make money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Morison |first = Samuel Eliot |coauthors = |title = The Oxford History of the American People |publisher = Mentor |year = 1972 |location = New York City |pages =199–200 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 0451-62600-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Richer land in the Southern colonies was taken over by individual farmers who grasped acreage. This created large plantation farms that grew tobacco, and later cotton. Farms in the Carolinas also farmed sugar, rice, and indigo. In the 17th century, these were farmed by indentured servants, people who would work for a period of years in return for passage to America and land. Many of these servants died before their indentures ended. A group of indentured servants rose up in Bacon's Rebellion in 1676. After Bacon's Rebellion, plantations began using African slaves instead. Even after release from indenture, many of these white people remained in the economic lower classes, though not subject to the slave codes, which became more harsh as time passed, denying almost all liberty to slaves in the southern colonies. By the American Revolution, one in five colonists was an African slave. And the products produced by slavery in the South were consumed and traded by towns in the Middle Colonies and New England. Few people questioned the slave economy.  

The Middle Colonies had medium-sized farms. These colonies also had people from many different cultures with many different beliefs. Individuals in these states used indentured servants, and later slaves, but there was not the concentration of masses of slave labor found in the Southern colonies.  

Another distinction lies in religious practices. New England was mostly Congregationalist, with some admixture of Presbyterian congregations and the religious non-conformists who called themselves Baptists. These were all descendants of dissenters before and during the British Civil War. The South was mostly Anglican, cherishing religious and secular traditions and holidays. The Middle Colonies held small groups of people from Holland, German lands, and even Bohemia, and they brought a welter of Catholic and Protestant faiths. 

Among the whites sent to the colonies by English authorities were many Scots-Irish people from Ulster. These had been Calvinist Protestants in the middle of a Irish Catholic majority, at odds both with them and with England. This minority settled in the frontier region of the Appalachian Mountains and eventually beyond in the Ohio and Mississippi country. In America their desire for land and freedom pushed the colonial boundary westward at little cost to the government, and provided an armed buffer between the eastern settlements and Native American tribes which had been driven away from the seaboard. Colonial frontiersmen endured a very harsh life, building their towns and farms by hand in a dense wilderness amid economic deprivation and native attack.

Each colony developed its own areas of edification and amusement, depending upon the local faith and the local capacities. The culture of the South recorded early interest in musical theater, with Charleston, South Carolina and Williamsburg, Virginia as hubs of musical activity. A performance of Richard III, the first professional production of Shakespeare in America, took place in New York City in 1750. And preachers, lecturers, and singers entertained the colonists.

Their commonalities were stronger than their differences. All three regions shared a population mostly derived from the British Isles. All had terrible roads, and all had connections to the Atlantic Ocean as a means of transportation. And all were tied to the Atlantic economy. Atlantic merchants used ships to trade slaves, tobacco, rum, sugar, gold, silver, spices, fish, lumber, and manufactured goods between America, the West Indies, Europe and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World|last=Kurlansky|first=Mark|publisher=New York: Walker|isbn=0-8027-1326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charleston were the largest cities and main ports at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab02.txt| title= Earliest Population Figures for American Cities | author= U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Technology ==

The first wave of colonists used hand labor to cultivate their farms, and established such land-based crafts such as pottery and tanning. As later ships brought cattle and horses, draft animals became part of the economy. Indentured servants, and then slaves kidnapped from Africa, were imported. This was when larger plantations began to be founded. In the latter part of the eighteenth century small-scale machine-based manufacturing began to appear. Individuals started to dig for coal and iron ore. New England used the latter to begin making building tools and horseshoes. A new textile industry arose, dependent in part upon Southern cotton. Powered by wood or coal and fed by the need for strong metal, household forges pioneered new techniques of iron-making. The blacksmith and the tinsmith became part of large settlements. Colonies started making mechanized clocks, guns, and lead type for printing.

== Mercantilism, Salutary Neglect and British Interference ==
The American colonies, entirely new societies separated by an ocean from Great Britain, believed they had the right to govern themselves. This belief was encouraged by Great Britain's Glorious Revolution and 1689 Bill of Rights, which gave Parliament the ultimate authority in government. A policy of relatively lax controls or '''Salutary Neglect''' ended in increased British regulation resulting from the policy of mercantilism, and seen through the Lords of Trade and the later Navigation Acts.

=== Mercantilism ===
Parliament placed controls on colonial trade in obedience to the economic policy of '''mercantilism'''. This was the idea that a nation's economic power depended on the value of its exports. A country could use its colonies to create finished goods, rather than raw materials. These could be traded to other countries, thus increasing the strength of the colonizing nation. This policy had been put forth by a Frenchman named Jean-Baptiste Colbert. It seemed tailor-made for Great Britain. Spain had American gold as its economic base, and France had American furs. England had neither of these. But it had American cotton, molasses, and tobacco, as well as its state-of-the-art ships.  Prior to the mid-1700s, the colonies had enjoyed a long period of &quot;salutary neglect&quot;, where the British largely let the colonies govern themselves. This now ended.

=== The Lords of Trade ===
In an attempt to enforce mercantilist policies, King Charles II created '''the Lords of Trade''' as a new committee on the Privy Council. The Lords of Trade attempted to affect the government of the colonies in a manner beneficial to the English, rather than to the colonists. 

The Lords of Trade attempted to convert all American colonies to royal ones so that the Crown could gain more power. Under King James II, the successor to Charles II, New York, New Jersey, and the Puritan colonies were combined into the Dominion of New England in 1687. 

However, the Dominion only lasted a brief time. King James II, a Catholic, was seen as a threat by British Protestants. James was overthrown (he was technically held abdicated by Parliament) in the bloodless Glorious Revolution of 1688. In 1689, James' daughter Mary II and her husband William III took the throne as joint rulers. However, the British Parliament actually held the power. The Dominion of New England was dissolved, the various separate colonies were reestablished, and the Lords of Trade were abandoned (replaced by a Board of Trade, a purely advisory body).

===Navigation Acts===
Beginning in 1660, the Parliament of England passed '''the Navigation Acts''' to increase its benefit from its colonies. The Acts required that any colonial imports or exports travel only on ships registered in England, meaning that only England could have the shipping power and the fees derived from them. They forbid the colonies to export tobacco and sugar to any nation other than England. (Tobacco was then used as medicine, and sugar was used to make alcohol, also a medicine.) And the colonies could not import anything manufactured outside England unless the goods were first taken to England, where taxes were paid, and then to the colonies.  

In the 1730s, The Sugar Act established a tax of six pence per gallon of sugar or molasses imported into the colonies. By 1750, Parliament had begun to ban, restrict, or tax several more products.  It tried to curtail all manufacture in the the colonies. This provoked much anger among the colonists, despite the fact that their tax burdens were quite low, when compared to most subjects of European monarchies of the same period.

Colonists hated the Navigation Acts because they believed they would be more prosperous and rich if they could trade on their own behalf. They also believed that some vital resources would not be found in Britain.

== Indians in the 1700s ==

Indians of the Great Plains:

Today, the area where the Indians of all the Great Plains lived is located from the Rocky mountains to the Mississippi River. During the 1700s, there were about 30 tribes that lived on the Great Plains. These tribes tended to rely on buffalo as their food source as well as other daily needs, such as clothing. Not only did Indians, specifically women, make their clothing out of buffalo, but also out of deer. Women would soak the deer or buffalo and scrape off the hair of the dead animal.&lt;ref name=&quot;englar&quot;&gt;Englar, Mary. The Great Plains Indians: Daily Life in the 1700s. Mankato, MN: Capstone, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Indian tribes traded with one another. The amount of horses an individual owned was a sign of wealth; Indians would trade their horses for food, tools, weapons(such as guns), and hides. Since the tribes spoke many different languages from one another, they had to use sign language to be able to trade with each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;englar&quot; /&gt;

== Philadelphia Election Riot ==
A riot broke out on election day in Philadelphia in 1742 as a result of the Anglican population disagreeing with the Quaker majority.  The riot stemmed over a power struggle between the Anglican and Quaker population.  The Quakers had a history of political dominance over Philadelphia.  The German population backed the Quaker vote because of the Quaker Pacifism which would protect from higher taxes and ultimately the draft.  On election day, the Anglicans and sailors fought with the Quakers and Germans.  The Quakers were able to seek shelter in the courthouse and complete the election.  The Anglican party lost the election and 54 sailors were jailed following the riot.

== Education ==
As the three sections of the colonies through the 1700s were made up of people with different interests, they provided differing sorts of education for their children. Although there were commonalities -- a rich family in any of the three regions might send a son to Europe for his education -- people in different colonies tended to educate in differing ways. 

New England's motives for education were both civil and religious. The good citizen had to know his or her Bible. The Massachusetts General School Law of 1647 stated that if more than 50 families lived in a community, a schoolteacher must be hired. This law gave a justification: &quot;It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times by keeping them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of tongues, that so that at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded and corrupted with love and false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers; and to the end that learning may not be buried in the grave of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors.&quot; This was the Pilgrim ethos, set up in opposition to what they saw as the ignorance imposed by tyrants. Both boys and girls were often taught to read the Bible by their parents, perhaps with the aid of a horn book, an alphabet and syllabary page covered by a protective layer of horn. 

In addition to being able to read the Bible, a Christian ought to be able to govern in his society. (''His'' society: for government was the province of godly, property-holding men, rather than women.) To obtain this youths had to gain a classical education -- that is, one based thoroughly on Latin. The 1647 law was the beginning of the American grammar school, which initially taught Latin, but later included practical subjects such as navigation, engineering, bookkeeping, and foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;A People and a Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the schools opened in the colonial era were private. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.excite.com/education/education/history-of-american-education&lt;/ref&gt; However, they had been preceded by the first public-supported school, the Boston Latin School, in 1635. It had a rigorous education, and as a result, few students. Harvard was the first university in America, founded in 1636 and originally intended to teach Protestant clergy. Because of the small number of people graduating from the classical curriculum, attendance was low. Some people jumped directly from the classical curriculum to the University, sometimes entering Harvard as young as 14 or 15 years old. Cotton Mather graduated Harvard at 15, an exception only because of his extreme precocity. In private schools, boys and girls learned penmanship, basic Math, and reading and writing English. These fed the various trades, where older children were apprenticed. Girls who did not become servants were often trained for domestic life, learning needlework, cooking, and the several days-long task of cleaning clothes.  

Like New England, the Middle Colonies had private schools which educated children in reading and writing. However, the basics were rarer. The further west one lived, the less likely one was to be able to go to school, or to read and write at all. Ethnic and religious sub-groups would have their own private schools, which taught their own children their own folk-ways. In none of the colonies was higher education certain. Secondary schools were very rare outside of such major towns as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.&lt;ref&gt;A People and a Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chesapeake experience was different again. Children could only could only read and write if their parents could.&lt;ref&gt;A People and a Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; And the South had few schools, of any kind, until the Revolutionary era. Children in wealthy families would study with private tutors. Though wealthy girls might learn 'the womanly arts,' they would not have the same curriculum as their brothers. Martha Washington's granddaughter Eliza Custis was laughed at by her stepfather when &quot;[I] thought it hard they would not teach me Greek and Latin because I was a girl -- they laughed and said women ought not to know those things, and mending, writing, Arithmetic, and Music was all I could be permitted to acquire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edmund S. Morgan. Virginians At Home: Family Life in the Eighteenth Century. Charlottesville, VA: Dominion Books, 1962(1952). P. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Middle class children might learn to read from their parents, and many poor children, as well as all black children, went unschooled. The literacy rates were lower in the South than the North until about the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;A People and a Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693 the College of William &amp; Mary was founded, Virginia's first University. As the 18th century wore on, it specialized not in theology for clergymen but in law.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, the Collegiate College was founded. In 1718 it received funds from a Welsh governor of the British East India Company, Elihu Yale, and was renamed Yale College. These were later joined by several other universities, including Princeton in 1747. In the 18th century, astronomy, physics, modern history and politics took a bigger place in the college curriculum. Some colleges experimented with admitting Native American students in the 18th century, though not African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;A People and a Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1640, ''The whole Booke of Psalms Faithfully Translated into English Metre'', commonly known as the Bay Psalm Book, was printed in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was the first book written in the new world. The Bay Psalm Book was the first metrical English translation of the Biblical psalms.&lt;ref&gt;Farris, Jean Americans Musical Landscape, Volume 5&lt;/ref&gt; This famous and influential songbook was succeeded by a whole New England publishing industry. Sometime after 1687 the first ''New England Primer'' was published as an aid to childhood reading and spelling.  

An alternative to the classical curriculum emerged in Benjamin Franklin's American Academy, founded in Philadelphia in 1751. This body represented something closer to the modern American high school, offering vocational education. This sort of school later outnumbered the classical secondary school. However, Franklin's Academy was private as well, making such learning open only to those who could afford it.

During this period colonists attempted to convert Native Americans to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2536600517.html&lt;/ref&gt;

''(The following text is from Wikipedia)''

The '''French and Indian War''' (1754&amp;ndash;1763) was
 the North American chapter of the Seven Years' War. The name refers to the two main enemies of the British, the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them. This conflict, the fourth such colonial war between the kingdoms of France and Great Britain, resulted in the British conquest of all of New France east of the Mississippi River, as well as Spanish Florida. France ceded control of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi to its Spanish ally, to compensate it for its loss of Florida. By the end of this war France kept only the tiny islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon north of the Caribbean. These colonies today still allow France access to the Grand Banks. 

In Great Britain and France, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War war usually has no special name, and so the entire worldwide conflict is known as the ''Seven Years' War'' (or the ''Guerre de sept ans''). The &quot;Seven Years&quot; refers to events in Europe, from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763. These dates do not correspond with the actual fighting in North America, where the fighting between the two colonial powers was largely concluded in six years, from the Jumonville Glen skirmish in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Fred. ''Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of Empire in British North America, 1754-1766.'' New York: Knopf, 2000. p. 747&lt;/ref&gt; 

Elsewhere the conflict is known by several names. In British North America, wars were often named after the sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. Because there had already been a King George's War in the 1740s, British colonists named the second war in King George's reign after their opponents, and thus it became known as the ''French and Indian War''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War.'' p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt; This traditional name remains standard in the United States, although it obscures the fact that American Indians fought on both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Francis. ''Empire of Fortune: Crowns, Colonies, and Tribes in the Seven Years War in America.'' New York: Norton, 1988. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; American historians generally use the traditional name or the European title (the Seven Years' War), and have also invented other, less frequently used names for the war, including the ''Fourth Intercolonial War'' and the ''Great War for the Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, ''Crucible of War.'' P. 747&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian francophones and English speakers both refer to it as the Seven Years' War (''Guerre de Sept Ans'') or the War of the Conquest (''Guerre de la Conquête''), as the war in which New France was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire. This war was also known as the ''Forgotten War''.

==Reasons for war==
The French and Indian War began less than a decade after France and Great Britain had fought on opposing sides in the European War of the Austrian Succession (1740&amp;ndash;1748). One cause for the conflict was '''territorial expansion'''. Newfoundland's Grand Banks were fertile fishing grounds and coveted by both sides. Both sides also wanted to expand their territories for trapping furs to trade, and for other pursuits that aided their economic interests. Both the British and the French used trading posts and forts to claim the Ohio Country, the vast territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. English claims resulted from royal grants with no definite western boundaries. La Salle had claimed the Mississippi River for France: its drainage area includes the Ohio River Valley. Both Great Britain and France took advantage of Native American factions to secure these claims, to protect their territories, and to keep the other from growing too strong.  

A second cause was '''political &amp; religious ideology'''. The English Protestant colonists  feared papal influence in North America. New France was administered by French governors and Roman Catholic hierarchy. French missionaries included Armand de La Richardie. English history was told as a story of freedom from Catholic (i.e., foreign) influence. French control over North America represented a threat to Great Britain. In their turn, the French feared English  anti-Catholicism, in a time when Catholics were still being persecuted under English law.

== Declaration and Action Anticipating the War ==
===Céloron's expedition===
In June 1747 the Governor-General of New France, the Marquis de la Jonquière, ordered Pierre-Joseph Céloron to lead an expedition to the Ohio Country to remove British influence from the area. Céloron was also to confirm allegiance of the Native Americans in the Ohio territory to the French crown.

Céloron's expedition consisted of 213 soldiers of the Troupes de la marine (French Marines) transported by twenty-three canoes. The expedition left Lachine on June 15, 1749, and two days later reached Fort Frontenac. It then continued along the shoreline of present-day Lake Erie. At Chautauqua Portage (Barcelona, New York), it moved inland to the Allegheny River.

The troop headed south to the Ohio River at present-day Pittsburgh, where Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country. Whenever British merchants or fur-traders were encountered by the French, they were informed of the illegality of being on French territory and told to leave the Ohio Country. When the expedition arrived at Logstown, the Native Americans there informed Céloron that they owned the Ohio Country, and they would trade with the British, despite anything the French said.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, W. M. ''Empires at War: The French and Indian War and the Struggle for North America, 1754-1763.'' New York: Walker, 2005. P. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Céloron continued the expedition. At its farthest point south, it reached the junction between the Ohio River and the Miami River, just south of the village of Pickawillany. Here lived the old Chief of the Miami tribe, whom Céloron called &quot;Old Britain.&quot; When Céloron arrived at Pickawillany, he informed the elderly Chief of &quot;dire consequences&quot; of continuing to trade with the British. &quot;Old Britain&quot; ignored the warning. After this meeting, Céloron and his expedition began the trip home, reaching Montreal only on November 10, 1749. In his report, Céloron wrote: &quot;All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French, and are entirely devoted to the English. I don't know in what way they could be brought back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, W. M. ''Empires at War.'' P. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Langlade's expedition===
On March 17, 1752, Governor-General de la Jonquière died. His temporary replacement was Charles le Moyne de Longueuil. It was not until July 1, 1752 that Ange Duquense de Menneville arrived in New France to take over the post. 

In the spring of 1752, Longueuil dispatched an expedition to the Ohio River area. The expedition was led by Charles Michel de Langlade, an officer in the Troupes de la marine. Langlade was given 300 men, some French-Canadians, and others members of the Ottawa tribe. His objective was to punish the Miami of Pickawillany for continuing to trade with the British. At dawn on June 21, 1752, the war party attacked the British trading center at Pickawillany, killing fourteen people of the Miami nation, including &quot;Old Britain.&quot; The expedition then returned home.

===Marin's expedition===
In the spring of 1754, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000 man force of Troupes de la Marine and Aboriginals. His orders were to protect the Ohio from the British. Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years before. However, where Céloron had buried lead plates, Marin was constructing and garrisoning forts. The first fort that was constructed by Paul Marin was at Presque Isle (Erie, Pennsylvania) on Lake Erie's south shore.  He then had a road built to the headwaters of Rivière aux Boeuf (now known as Waterford, Pennsylvania). Marin then constructed a second fort at Le Boeuf, designed to guard the headwaters of the Rivière aux Boeuf.

===Tanaghrisson's proclamation===
On September 3, 1753, Tanaghrisson (d. 1754), Chief of the Mingo, arrived at Fort Le Boeuf. One tradition states that Tanaghrisson hated the French because they had killed and eaten his father.  Tanaghrisson told Marin, &quot;I shall strike . . .&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Empires at War.'' P. 31&lt;/ref&gt; threatening the French. The show of force by the French had alarmed the Iroquois in the area. They sent Mohawk runners to William Johnson's manor in Upper New York. Johnson, known to the Iroquois as &quot;Warraghiggey&quot;, meaning &quot;He who does big business&quot;, had become a respected member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area. In 1746, Johnson was made a colonel of the Iroquois, and later a colonel of the Western New York Militia.

At Albany, New York, there was a meeting between Governor Clinton of New York and Chief Hendrick, as well as other officials from a handful of American colonies. Chief Hendrick insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion. When an unsatisfactory response was offered by Clinton, Chief Hendrick proclaimed that the &quot;Covenant Chain&quot;, a long-standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown, was broken.

===Dinwiddie's reaction===
[[Image:Washington 1772.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The earliest authenticated portrait of George Washington shows him wearing his colonel's uniform of the Virginia Regiment from the French and Indian War. However, this portrait was painted years after the war in 1772.]]
Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia found himself in a predicament. Many merchants had invested heavily in fur trading in Ohio. If the French made good on their claim to the Ohio Country and drove out the British, then the Virginian merchants would lose a lot of money. 
Dinwiddie could not possibly allow the loss of the Ohio Country to France. In October 1753 he wrote a letter to the commander of the French forces in the Ohio Country, Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, demanding an immediate French withdrawal. To deliver it he delegated Major ''George Washington'' of the Virginia militia. Major Washington left for Fort Le Boeuf on the 31st of October, along with his interpreter Jacob Van Braam and several other men. 

A few days later, Washington and his party arrived at Wills Creek (Cumberland, Maryland). Here Washington enlisted the help of Christopher Gist, a surveyor who was familiar with the area. They arrived at Logstown on November 24, 1753. At Logstown, Washington met with Tanaghrisson, who was angry over the French military encroachment upon his land. Washington convinced Tanaghrisson to accompany his small group to Fort Le Boeuf.

On December 12, 1753, Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf. Commander Saint-Pierre invited Washington to dine with him that evening. Over dinner, Washington presented Saint-Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie. Saint-Pierre was civil in his response, saying, &quot;As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Empires at War''. P. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The French explained to Washington that France's claim to the region was superior to that of the British, as René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de a Salle (1643&amp;ndash;1687) had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Joseph J. ''His Excellency George Washington.'' New York: Vintage Books, A Division of Random House, Inc., 2004. P. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16, 1753. By January 16, 1754, they had arrived in Williamsburg, Virginia.  In his report, Washington stated, &quot;The French had swept south.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Empires at War'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  They had constructed and garrisoned forts at Presque Isle, Le Boeuf and Venango.

==War==
The French and Indian War was the last of four major colonial wars between the British, the French, and their Native American allies. Unlike the previous three wars, the French and Indian War began on North American soil and then spread to Europe, where Britain and France continued fighting. Britain officially declared war on France on May 15, 1756, marking the beginnings of the Seven Years' War in Europe. Native Americans fought for both sides, but primarily alongside the French (with one exception being the Iroquois Confederacy, which sided with the American colonies and Britain). The first major event of the war was in 1754. Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, then twenty-one years of age, was sent to negotiate boundaries with the French, who did not give up their forts. Washington led a group of Virginian (colonial) troops to confront the French at Fort Duquesne (present day Pittsburgh). Washington discovered the French troops at '''the Battle of Jumonville Glen''' (about six miles or ten kilometers North-West of soon-to-be-established Fort Necessity). In the ensuing skirmish, a French Officer, Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, was killed. Washington pulled back a few miles and established Fort Necessity. The French forced Washington and his men to retreat. Meanwhile, the Albany Congress was taking place as means to discuss further action. 

Edward Braddock led a campaign against the French at Fort Duquesne in 1755. Washington was again among the British and colonial troops. Braddock employed European tactics -- bold, linear marches and firing formations -- and employed heavy cannon. This led to disaster at the '''Monongahela'''. The French and natives were heavily outmanned and outgunned. But they used superior tactics, taking cover behind trees and bushes to gun down and rout the British. Braddock was killed. Despite four close calls, Washington escaped unharmed and led the survivors in retreat. This stunning British defeat heralded a string of major French victories over the next few years, at '''Fort Oswego''', '''Fort William Henry''', '''Fort Duquesne''', and '''Carillon''', where veteran Montcalm famously defeated five times his number. The sole British successes in the early years of the war came in 1755, at '''the Battle of Lake George''', which secured the Hudson Valley; and in the taking of '''Fort Beauséjour''' (which protected the Nova Scotia frontier) by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton. A consequence of this last battle was the subsequent forced deportation of the Acadian population of Nova Scotia and the Beaubassin region of Acadia. 

In 1756 William Pitt became Secretary of State of Great Britain. His leadership, and France's continued neglect of the North-American theater, eventually turned the tide in favor of the British. The French were driven from many frontier posts such as Fort Niagara, and the key Fortress Louisbourg fell to the British in 1758. In 1759, '''the Battle of the Plains of Abraham''' gave Quebec City to the British, who had to withstand a siege there after the '''Battle of Sainte-Foy''' a year later. In September of 1760, Pierre François de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, the King's Governor of New France, negotiated a surrender with British General Jeffrey Amherst. General Amherst granted Vaudreuil's request that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition, continued ownership of their property, and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes. The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers, and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war.

'''Summary of the war in America'''
In 1752 the French and their Native allies raided a trading outpost sited at modern day Cleveland rid the area of Pennsylvanians. In 1754 General George Washington attacked French soldiers and then became trapped in his poorly built, Fort Necessity in Great Meadows Pennsylvania and more than one-third of Washingtons's men shortly became casualties. Twenty-two year old Washington and his men surrendered and were allowed to leave back to Virginia. In July 1755, a few miles south of Fort Duquensne in Pennsylvania, the combined forces of French and Natives attacked British colonial troops that were preparing a to assault the fort. The aftermath that ensued would result in a British defeat and General Edward Braddock would be killed. Once London heard of this Britain declared war upon France and formally began the seven years war. After this the British feared that France would attempt to retake Nova Scotia and that the 12,000 French Nova Scotians would break their neutrality, so the British military forced around seven thousand French Nova Scotians from their homeland. This was history's first large-scale modern deportation, the French would be sent from Louisiana to the Caribbean and families would become torn apart. In July of 1758 The British had recaptured the fort at Loiusberg winning control of the St. Lawerence River. This would cut the major French supply route and open up more supply lines for the British. In the fall of 1758 the Shawnee and Delaware Natives accepted peace offerings from the British and the French abandoned Fort Duquesne. A decisive attack would happen in the fall of 1759 when General James Wolfe's forces defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham and thus taking Quebec. A year after this event the British would capture Montreal and the North American stage of the war would be over.

===Outcome===
[[File:Vue de la descente a Terre Neuve par le chevalier de Ternay en 1762.jpg|330px|thumb|right|The descent of the French on St. John's, Newfoundland, 1762.]]
Though most of the North American fighting ended on September 8, 1760, when the Marquis de Vaudreuil surrendered Montreal &amp;mdash; and effectively all of Canada &amp;mdash; to Britain (one notable late battle allowed the capture of Spanish Havana by British and colonial forces in 1762), the war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. The treaty sealed France's loss of all its North American possessions east of the Mississippi except for Saint Pierre and Miquelon islands off Newfoundland. All of Canada was ceded to Britain. France regained the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which had been occupied by the British. The economic value of these islands to France was greater than that of Canada at the time, because of their rich sugar crops; and the islands were easier to defend. However, the British were happy to take New France: defense was not an issue, and they had many sources of sugar. Spain gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, in compensation for its loss of Florida to the British.

French Canada contained approximately 65,000 French-speaking Roman Catholic residents. Early in the war, in 1755, the British had expelled French settlers from Acadia. (Some of these eventually fled to Louisiana, creating the Cajun population.) Now at peace, and eager to secure control of its hard-won colony, Great Britain made concessions to its newly conquered subjects with the Quebec Act of 1774. The history of the Seven Years' War, particularly the siege of Québec and the death of British Brigadier General James Wolfe, generated a vast number of ballads, broadsides, images, maps and other printed materials, which testify to how this event continued to capture the imagination of the British public long after Wolfe's death in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/ Virtual Vault], an online exhibition of Canadian historical art at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The European theatre of the war was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on February 15, 1763. The war changed economic, political, and social relations between Britain and its colonies. It plunged Britain into debt, which the Crown chose to pay off with tax money from its colonies. These taxes contributed to the beginning the American Revolutionary War.

== Proclamation of 1763 ==
''(The following text is taken from the Wikipedia article)''

[[Image:map of territorial growth 1775.jpg|thumb|A portion of eastern North America; the 1763 &quot;Proclamation line&quot; is the border between the red and the pink areas.]]

The '''Royal Proclamation of 1763''' was issued October 7, 1763 by George III following Great Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America after the end of the Seven Years' War. The purpose of the proclamation was to make sure Britain could control its new territory for its  The Proclamation in essence forbade Americans from settling or buying land west of the Appalachians. Colonists were angry because many already had land in that area. Additionally, the Proclamation gave the Crown a monopoly in land bought from Native Americans.

===Native land===
In the fall of 1763, a royal decree was issued that prohibited the North American colonists from establishing or maintaining settlements west of an imaginary line running down the crest of the Appalachian Mountains. The proclamation acknowledged that Native Americans owned the lands on which they were then residing and white settlers in the area were to be removed. 

However, provision was made to allow specially licensed individuals and entities to operate fur trading ventures in the proscribed area. There were two motivations for this policy: 

'''To avoid warfare with the Indians.''' Neither side evidenced any affection for the tribes, but Indian conflicts were very expensive, and the British hadn't yet deployed enough soldiers in the West to keep the peace. Some Indians welcomed this policy, believing that separation from the colonies would allow them to resume their traditions. Others realized that the proclamation would, at best, only provide breathing room before the next onslaught of settlers. 

'''To concentrate colonial settlements on the seaboard where they could be active parts of the British mercantile system.''' British trade officials took it as a first priority to populate the recently secured areas of Canada and Florida (referring to the Treaty of Paris), where colonists could reasonably be expected to trade with the mother country. Settlers living west of the Appalachians would be highly self-sufficient and have little opportunity to trade with English merchants. 

The reaction of colonial land speculators and frontiersmen was immediate and negative. They believed their fight in the recent war had been &quot;rewarded&quot; by the creation of a vast restricted native reserve in the lands they coveted. Most concluded that the proclamation was only a temporary measure: a number ignored it entirely and moved into the prohibited area. Almost from its inception, the proclamation was modified to suit the needs of influential people with interests in the American West, both high British officials and colonial leaders. 

Beginning in 1764, portions of the Proclamation Line were adjusted westward to accommodate speculative interests. Later, in 1768, the first Treaty of Fort Stanwix formally recognized the surrender of transmontane lands claimed by the Iroquois.

The Proclamation of 1763 was a well-intentioned measure. Pontiac’s Rebellion had inflicted a terrible toll on the frontier settlements in North America and the British government acted prudently by attempting to avoid such conflict in the foreseeable future. 

The colonists, however, were not appreciative and regarded the new policy as an infringement of their basic rights. The fact that western expansion was halted at roughly the same time that other restrictive measures were being implemented, made the colonists increasingly suspicious

Almost immediately, many British colonists and land speculators objected to the proclamation boundary, since there were already many settlements beyond the line (some of which had been temporarily evacuated during Pontiac's War), as well as many existing land claims yet to be settled. Indeed, the proclamation itself called for lands to be granted to British soldiers who had served in the Seven Years' War. Prominent American colonists joined with land speculators in Britain to lobby the government to move the line further west. As a result, the boundary line was adjusted in a series of treaties with Native Americans. The Treaty of Fort Stanwix and the Treaty of Hard Labor (both 1768) and the Treaty of Lochaber (1770) opened much of what is now West Virginia and Kentucky to British settlement.

===Organization of new colonies===
Besides regulating colonial expansion, the proclamation dealt with the management of newly ceded French colonies. It established government for four areas: Quebec, West Florida, East Florida, and Grenada. All of these were granted the ability to elect general assemblies under a royally appointed governor or a high council, which could then create laws and ordinances specific to the area in agreement with British and colonial laws. In the meantime, the new colonies enjoyed the same rights as native-born Englishmen, something that British colonists had been fighting over for years. An even bigger affront to the British colonies was the establishment of both civil and criminal courts complete with the right to appeal--but those charged with violating the Stamp or Sugar Act were to be tried in admiralty court, where the defendant was considered guilty until he or she could prove his or her innocence.

===Legacy===
The influence of the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on the coming of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) has been variously interpreted. Many historians argue that the proclamation ceased to be a major source of tension after 1768, since the aforementioned treaties opened up extensive lands for settlement. Others have argued that colonial resentment of the proclamation contributed to the growing divide between the colonies and the Mother Country.

In the United States, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 ended with the American Revolutionary War, because Great Britain ceded the land in question to the United States in the Treaty of Paris (1783). Afterwards, the U.S. government also faced difficulties in preventing frontier violence, and eventually adopted policies similar to those of the Royal Proclamation. The first in a series of Indian Intercourse Acts was passed in 1790, prohibiting unregulated trade and travel in Native American lands. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court case Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823) established that only the U.S. government, and not private individuals, could purchase land from Native Americans.

The Royal Proclamation continued to govern the cession of aboriginal land in British North America, especially Upper Canada and Rupert's Land. The proclamation forms the basis of land claims of aboriginal peoples in Canada – First Nations, Inuit, and Metis. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 is thus mentioned in Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

== The Stamp Act and other Laws ==

In 1764, George Grenville became the British Chancellor of the Exchequer (minister of finance). He allowed customs officers to obtain general writs of assistance, which allowed officers to search random houses for smuggled goods. Grenville thought that if profits from smuggled goods could be directed towards Britain, the money could help pay off debts. Colonists were horrified that they could be searched without warrant at any given moment. Also in 1764, with persuasion from Grenville, Parliament began to impose several taxes on the colonists. '''The Sugar Act''' of 1764 reduced the taxes imposed by the Molasses Act, but at the same time strengthened the collection of the taxes. It also provided that British judges, and not juries, would try cases involving that Act.

The next year, Parliament passed the '''Quartering Act''', which required the colonies to provide room and board for British soldiers stationed in North America; the soldiers would serve various purposes, chiefly to enforce the previously passed acts of Parliament.

Following the Quartering Act, Parliament passed one of the most infamous pieces of legislation: the '''Stamp Act'''. Previously, Parliament imposed only external taxes on imports. But the Stamp Act provided the first internal tax on the colonists, requiring that a tax stamp be applied to books, newspapers, pamphlets, legal documents, playing cards, and dice. The legislature of Massachusetts requested a conference on the Stamp Act; the Stamp Act Congress met in October that year, petitioning the King and Parliament to repeal the act before it went into effect at the end of the month, crying &quot;taxation without representation.&quot;

The act faced vehement opposition throughout the colonies. Merchants threatened to boycott British products. Thousands of New Yorkers rioted near the location where the stamps were stored. In Boston, the Sons of Liberty, a violent group led by radical statesman Samuel Adams, destroyed the home of Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson. Parliament did indeed repeal the Stamp Act, but additionally passed the Declaratory Act, which stated that Great Britain retained the power to tax the colonists, even without substantive representation.

Believing that the colonists only objected to internal taxes, Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend proposed bills that would later become the '''Townshend Acts'''. The Acts, passed in 1767, taxed imports of tea, glass, paint, lead, and even paper. The colonial merchants again threatened to boycott the taxed products, reducing the profits of British merchants, who in turn petitioned Parliament to repeal the Townshend Acts. Parliament eventually agreed to repeal much of the Townshend legislation. But Parliament refused to remove the tax on tea, implying that the British retained the authority to tax the colonies despite a lack of representation.

In 1773, Parliament passed the '''Tea Act''', which exempted the British East India Company from the Townshend taxes. Thus, the East India Company gained a great advantage over other companies when selling tea in the colonies. The colonists who resented the advantages given to British companies dumped British tea overboard in the Boston Tea Party in December of 1773. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image: Boston Tea Party.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The Boston Tea Party''&lt;/center&gt;

In retaliation for the Boston Tea Party, Parliament passed the '''Coercive Acts''', which were in the colonies known as the Intolerable Acts.Parliament reduced the power of the Massachusetts legislature and closed the port of Boston. Also, the Quartering Act was extended to require private individuals to lodge soldiers. Furthermore, Parliament allowed royal officials accused of crimes to be tried by a British, rather than a colonial, jury.

== First Continental Congress ==

In order to debate a response to the Intolerable Acts, all American colonies except for Georgia sent delegates to '''the First Continental Congress''' at Philadelphia. The Congress met in September 1774 and issued a Declaration of Rights and Grievances. When the Congress adjourned, it stipulated another Congress would meet if King George III did not meet the demands of the Declaration. When the Second Congress did meet, the military hostilities of the Revolutionary War had already begun, and the issue of Independence, rather than a redress of grievances, dominated the debates.

==Education==

Literacy grew for both men and women during the 18th century. In New England and the Middle States, more middle-class girls were sent to school. However, as Science and the requirements for citizenship became more a part of education, girls were excluded from learning these topics. 

Higher education continued to develop, with the 1746 opening of The College of New Jersey (later known as Princeton), and King's College (now Columbia) in 1754. All of these universities were meant exclusively for White men, though some of the colleges experimented by admitting Native Americans. In the public schools, vocational education expanded.&lt;ref&gt;A people and a nation eight edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia.org\ education_in_the_Age_of_Enlightenment.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Education the colonial experience by Cremin A. Lawrence&lt;/ref&gt;

Though what was lost by failing to educate the underclasses was incalculable, we can gauge the lost possibilities through such individuals as Benjamin Banneker and Phillis Wheatley. Mr. Banneker, a self-educated free African-American, observed the stars, wrote his own almanac, and was one of the surveyors of what would later become the District of Columbia. Miss Wheatley, an African-born slave educated and freed by her mistress, wrote a remarkable volume of poems published in the year 1773. Most of these had been published in ''The Newport Mercury'', edited by Benjamin Franklin's brother James.

==Questions For Review==
1. What were the reasons for the French and Indian War?

2. What was the strategy of General Braddock against the French at Fort Duquesne? What was the strategy of the defending French and Indian forces?

3. Examine the succession of acts imposed upon the American Colonists in the wake of the war, beginning with the Sugar Act. What was the intended purpose of each act? What was its actual effect?

      <text xml:space="preserve">The British forces might at first glance seem to have every advantage. At the outset of the War they had stocks of cannon and ammunition. The Colonists had single-shot rifles from local forges, guns which took time to load and could easily misfire or explode. When Washington took command of the army in 1775, he learned that there was only enough gunpowder to provide nine rounds of ammunition per man.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, David. ''1776.'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 2005. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The British had a large professional army drilled to a pitch like that of Ancient Rome, well-supplied with food, uniforms, and arms. But the American lack of training meant that they did not mass in the European style. Instead they relied on snipers, individuals hidden behind the trees who shot their bullet and then loaded again while their neighbors fired. They had learned this during the French and Indian War. Snipers helped strengthen the American odds. 

==The Beginning of the War (1775 - 1778)==

===Lexington and Concord===
[[Image:Battle_of_Lexington.jpeg|thumb|300px|right|The skirmish at Lexington.]]
The British government commanded General Thomas Gage to enforce the Intolerable Acts and shut down the Massachusetts legislature. Gage decided to confiscate a stockpile of colonial arms located in Concord. On April 19, 1775, Gage's troops marched to Concord. On the way, at the town of Lexington, Americans who had been warned in advance by Paul Revere and others of the British movements made an attempt to stop the troops. No one knows which side fired the first shot, but it sparked battle on Lexington Green between the British and the Minutemen. Faced against an overwhelmingly superior number of British regular troops in an open field, the Minutemen were quickly routed. Nevertheless, alarms sounded through the countryside. The colonial militias poured in and were able to launch guerrilla attacks on the British while they marched on to Concord. The colonials amassed of troops at Concord. They engaged the British in force there, and they were able to repulse them. They then claimed the contents of the armory. The British retreated to Boston under a constant and withering fire from all sides. Only a reinforcing column with artillery support on the outskirts of Boston prevented the British withdrawal from becoming a total rout. The following day the British woke up to find Boston surrounded by 20,000 armed colonists, occupying the neck of land extending to the peninsula the city stood on.

=== The Battle of Bunker Hill ===
[[Image:Bunker_hill.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Battle of Bunker Hill.]]
The action changed from a ''battle'' to a ''siege'', where one army bottles up another in a town or a city. (Though in traditional terms, the British were not besieged, since the Royal Navy controlled the harbor and supplies came in by ship.) General Artemas Ward, the head of the Massachusetts militia, had the initial oversight of the siege. He set up headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts and positioned his forces at Charlestown Neck, Roxbury, and Dorchester Heights. The 6,000 to 8,000 rebels faced some 4,000 British regulars under General Thomas Gage. Boston and little else was controlled by British troops. General Gage countered the siege on June 17 by attacking the colonists on Breed's Hill and Bunker Hill. Although the British suffered tremendous casualties compared to the colonial losses, the British were eventually able to dislodge the American forces from their entrenched positions. The colonists were forced to retreat when many colonial soldiers ran out of ammunition. Soon after, the area surrounding Boston fell to the British. However, because of the losses they suffered, they were unable to break the siege of the city. Despite the early defeat for the colonists, the battle proved that they had the potential to counter British forces, which were at that time considered the best in the world.  

=== The Last Chance For Peace ===

The Second Continental Congress adopted '''the Olive Branch Petition''', a petition for peace,  on July 5, 1775. The Congress affirmed its allegiance to the Crown. It was received in London at the same time as it heard of the Battle For Bunker Hill. The King refused to read the petition or to meet with its ambassadors. Parliament reacted by passing the Prohibitory Act, which banned trade with the colonies.

===Battle For Boston===

Despite the British access to the ships, the town and the army were on short rations. Salt pork was the order of the day, and prices escalated rapidly. While the American forces had some information about what was happening in the city, General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.

On May 25, 1775, 4,500 reinforcements and three new generals arrived in Boston Harbor. The fresh leaders were Major General William Howe and Brigadiers John Burgoyne and Henry Clinton. Gage began planing to break out of the city.

On July 3, 1775, George Washington arrived to take charge of the new Continental Army. Forces and supplies came in from as far away as Maryland. Trenches were built at Dorchester Neck,  extending toward Boston. Washington reoccupied Bunker Hill and Breeds Hill without opposition. However, these activities had little effect on the British occupation.

[[Image:Henry_Knox.PNG|thumb|right|150px|Henry Knox helped bring the Continental Army the artillery used to defeat the British.]]In the winter of 1775&amp;ndash; 1776, Henry Knox and his engineers under order from George Washington used sledges to retrieve sixty tons of heavy artillery that had been captured at Fort Ticonderoga. Knox, who had come up with the idea to use sledges, believed that he would have the artillery there in eighteen days. It took six weeks to bring them across the frozen Connecticut River, and they arrived back at Cambridge on January 24, 1776. Weeks later, in an amazing feat of deception and mobility, Washington moved artillery and several thousand men overnight to take Dorchester Heights overlooking Boston. General John Thomas fortified the area. The British fleet had become a liability, anchored in a shallow harbor with limited maneuverability, and under the American guns on Dorchester Heights. 

When General Howe saw the cannons, he knew he could not hold the city. He asked that George Washington let them evacuate the city in peace. In return, they would not burn the city to the ground. Washington agreed: he had no choice. He had artillery guns, but did not have the gunpowder. The whole plan had been a masterful bluff. The siege ended when the British set sail for Halifax, Nova Scotia on March 17, 1776. The militia went home, and in April Washington took most of the Continental Army forces to fortify New York City.

===Ethan Allen and Fort Ticonderoga===

[[Image:Fort_Ticonderoga_1775.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ethan Allen capturing Fort Tinconderoga.]]
The British had considered Fort Ticonderoga a relatively unimportant outpost in a conflict which had up to then been mostly based in Massachusetts. However, a veteran of the French and Indian War, Ethan Allen, had his eye on the fort. Allen had built up a Vermont territorial militia, the Green Mountain Boys, until it was an effective fighting force. Vermont was claimed by the New York colony, but Allen wanted more independence. In April of 1775, Allen was surprised by a visit by Commander Benedict Arnold of the Connecticut Militia. Arnold announced that '''he''' had been commissioned to seize the cannons of Fort Ticonderoga. A heated discussion between the two concluded with the agreement that the two militias would combine to attack the fort. This was for the best, for both forces together were small, well short of brigade strength. On May tenth, the combined American forces captured the fort. They seized the arms, including the cannons, which were then hauled by oxen all the way to Boston.

== Strengthening The Cause ==

Through the media available in that day, the Revolution promoted the idea of honorable men in revolt against tyranny. Newspapers in North and South published incendiary stories and inspiring engravings. The theater contributed dramatic outcries, including those of Mary Otis Warren. Songs were played and sung to rally flagging spirits.

===Thomas Paine's 1776===

In January of 1776, the Englishman Thomas Paine published the pamphlet ''Common Sense''. This anti-monarchical publication encouraged American independence, using examples from the Bible and republican virtues to argue that kings were never good for any free state. In late 1776 he began printing his series of pamphlets, ''The American Crisis'', calling soldiers to mass to the cause of the Revolution. The first of these pamphlets begins with the stirring words, &quot;These are the times that try men's souls.&quot;

===The Declaration of Independence===

[[Image:Flag at Independence Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Raising the first flag at Independence Hall. Copy of a painting by Clyde O. Deland.]]

As military hostilities built up, the Second Continental Congress appointed George Washington as General of the Continental Army. Washington gave up his salary for the position all through the war. (As he was among the richest men in the colonies, he could afford this choice.) In June of 1776, the Second Continental Congress felt it needed a spur for separation from Great Britain. It appointed a Committee of Five to draft '''a declaration of independence''': John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman and Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson became the principal author of this document. 

Although the British king was no longer principally responsible for his dominion's policy, the Declaration of Independence called him a tyrant. It justified the rights of the rebellion with words the European Enlightenment would have hailed: &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal[.]&quot; The Continental Congress signed the document on July 4, 1776. However, the signatures at this point showed that they wished independence: they could not alone achieve it.

===Army Bands===

One of the attributes of a well-drilled company of soldiers was its military band. The British and Hessian troops drilled to the beat of drums, which carried the rhythm of the march above the noise of musket fire, and provided a way to communicate on the battlefield. &quot;By 1778 soldiers marched at seventy-five 24″ steps per minute in common time and nearly double that (120 steps per minute) when marching in quick time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anon. &quot;Middle-brook Order, June 4, 1777: What It Really Says about the Quality of Revolutionary War Field Music.&quot; Paper read at School of the Musician, Brigade of the American Revolution, April 4, 1989. Revised February 12, 2011. Copyright 1989, 2011 HistoryOfTheAncientsDotOrg. http://historyoftheancients.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/1195/&lt;/ref&gt; The music of the fife (a shrill flute) and drum helped build soldier morale. 

If the Rebellion could not have good supplies, it would at least have high morale. With the ''Middle-brook Order'', George Washington directed that every officer must provide military music for his troops. This was despite the limited number of instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, &quot;Middle-brook Order.&lt;/ref&gt; The bands were used to announce the beginning and end of the day, direct troops in battle, and uplift spirits.

===Popular Music in the Revolution===

One of the two major songs of the Revolution was the hymn ''Chester'', first published in 1770 in &quot;The New England Psalm Singer&quot; and revised in 1778. Its author and composer, William Billings, created a combination of the biblical (''Let tyrants shake their iron rod'') and the topical (''Howe and Burgoyne and Clinton too,/ With Prescot and Cornwallis join'd'').

Another was the song ''Yankee Doodle'', adapted from a tune of the Seven Years War. This was originally used by the British to laugh at the provincial manners of the Colonists, but was turned into a theme of the American upstarts.

==Canada==

In September of 1775, the Colonists, led by General Richard Montgomery, invaded Canada. At first the invasion proved successful, with Montgomery capturing Fort St. Jean and the city of Montreal. On December 30 he made the decision to launch an attack onto the British held city of Quebec. It proved disastrous, and Montgomery was killed in battle. This was the last major action in Canada, although Benidict Arnold and a number of other generals did attack the coasts or Canada, or launch raids across the border.

== The Turning Point of the War ==
Despite the numerous defeats they faced in the early years of the war, the colonists were able to turn the tide around with several major victories.

=== New York and New Jersey ===
In July, 1776, General William Howe and thirty-thousand British troops arrived at Staten Island in New York. The large army attacked and defeated General George Washington's American forces in the Battle of Long Island. After nearly having his entire army captured, Washington led a skilled withdrawal out of New York. Eventually the Continental Army was forced to set up camp in Pennsylvania.

Howe could have ended the war by pursuing Washington's forces. But Howe was very cautious and took almost no risks. He feared losing too many men so far from home. Britain hired German mercenaries (Hessians) to guard the British fort at Trenton. Howe took advantage of these replacements and decided to wait until spring to attack the Continental Army again.

Washington also took advantage of the situation, though from a different perspective. He figured that the Hessians would be weakest on Christmas night, after heavy feasting and drinking. On the night of December 25, 1776, Washington led his troops 9 miles, and across the Delaware River to ambush the Hessians. Crossing the river was difficult. A hail and sleet storm had broken out early in the crossing, winds were strong and the river was full of ice floes. The crossing took 3 hours longer than expected, but Washington decided to continue the attack anyway. As Washington predicted, the mercenaries were completely caught off guard and had little time to respond. Within just a over an hour, on the morning of December 26, the Continental Army had won the Battle of Trenton. The Americans had just 4 wounded and 0 killed against 25 Hessians Killed, 90 wounded and 920 captured. The victory increased the troops' morale and eventually led to re-enlistments. Some historians even speculate Trenton saved the revolution. 

On January 2, the British came to re-take Trenton, and did so with heavy casualties. Washington once again led a clever withdrawal, and advanced on Princeton. At the Battle of Princeton, the Continental Army attacked the rear-guard of the British Army, and forced them to retreat from New Jersey.

=== The Battle of Saratoga ===
[[Image:Surrender_of_General_Burgoyne.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Burgoyne surrendering to the Continental Army.]]
In the summer of 1777, British General John Burgoyne and General Howe agreed to attack the colonial Army from two sides and defeat it. Howe marched north, winning the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown and eventually capturing Philadelphia. But Burgoyne was not so fortunate. Delayed by natural traps set up by the Continental Army, his troops slowly marched from Canada to Albany. By September of the year, his forces reached Saratoga, where an enormous American Army attacked the troops. In October, General Burgoyne surrendered all his forces to the Americans. General Howe resigned his post, thwarted despite his victories in Pennsylvania.

The Battle of Saratoga proved to be the major turning point in the war. It persuaded France that America had to overthrow Great Britain, and French aid now was introduced to the colonists. The battle was also the last time the British would advance North. By the summer of 1778, following the Battle of Monmouth in New Jersey, all fighting would take place in the South.

=== Defeat of the Iroquois ===
The Iroquois Confederacy in its zenith had been the equal of the European Powers. But since the French and Indian war it had been in decline. The Tribes of the Confederacy disagreed on who to support in the Revolution. The Onedia and Tuscaroras supported the Americans, while the Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga, and the Seneca supported the British. The Confederacy managed to stay together until 1777, when following the Battle of Saratoga, the 4 Tribes supporting the British began to attack American settlements across New York and Pennslyvenia. 

A back and forth battle followed. The Iroquois would attack American Forts and Towns, then the Americans would burn Iroquois villages. In 1779 George Washington sent General Sullivan to destroy the Iroquois Nation. After defeating the Iroquois at the Battle of Newtown, Sullivan's army then carried out a scorched earth campaign, methodically destroying at least forty Iroquois villages. The devastation created great hardships for the thousands of Iroquois refugees outside Fort Niagara that winter, and many starved or froze to death. The survivors fled to British regions in Canada and the Niagara Falls and Buffalo areas. Thus ended the 700-year history of the Iroquois Confederacy.

== Conclusion of the War (1778 - 1781) ==

After the loss at Saratoga, the French, traditional rivals of the British, offered their aid in the Revolution. The United States allied itself with France in 1778. Spain and the Dutch Republic also joined the American side, both lending money to the United States and going to war with Britain.
===On the Seas===
War broke out on the seas as well. Americans granted commissions to &quot;privateers&quot; to attack and destroy all British ships, whether they were military or not. One of the most famous privateers, John Paul Jones, scored several victories at sea for the Americans, even attacking the shores of Britain itself.
[[Image:Yorktown80.JPG|thumb|250px|Benjamin Lincoln accepting the British surrender at Yorktown, with Washington in the background.]]

===The War Heads South===

An attempted treachery was defeated when its architect, British Major John Andre, was captured in September of 1780. Benedict Arnold, one of the heroes of Fort Ticonderoga, had been placed in charge of Fort Clinton, New York (now called West Point). In response to a bribe, Arnold neglected maintenance of the fortification, and was then preparing to turn the fort over to the British. After he had learned of Andre's arrest he fled to join the British army.

Britain turned its attention from the North to the South, where more loyalists lived. They were at first very successful, defeating the Americans at Waxhaws, Charleston, and Camden. Lord Cornwallis, commander of the British forces in the south, was faced with the challenge of chasing down the Americans. Nathanael Greene had split his army into two, leaving one under the control of Daniel Morgan. Morgan drew Banastre Tarleton, who was commanding one half of the British Army, to Cowpens where they were they decisively defeated the British. The other half of the British Army, still under control of Cornwallis, defeated the Americans at the Battle of Guilford Court House. However, it was a bloody victory for Cornwallis and he was forced to withdraw to Yorktown Virginia to regroup.

After hearing that the British were in Yorktown, and there was a French Fleet arriving, Washington took the Continental Army, along with French Troops, to Yorktown and surrounded the British. By mid September the town was under siege. Cornwallis was assured by British Commander-in-Chief, Henry Clinton, who was in New York, that he would be relieved shortly. However, the British relief force was defeated by the French fleet. The British continued to hold off for a few more days, but the allied army moved in closer and closer to Yorktown, and their cannons destroyed many of the British defenses. On October 19, 1781, Cornwallis surrendered his entire army, over 7,000 men. 

Scattered fighting continued, but back in Britain, the British were crushed by this defeat. Parliament voted to cease all offensive operations in &quot;the colonies.&quot; Washington took his army to Newburgh, New York, where he stopped a mutiny in the Army.

At the conclusion of the war in 1783 large numbers of loyalists and their families relocated to the home country of England and in large part to Canada as well as to other British Colonies. They submitted claims for lost property and lands in America. Many of the claims were not accepted by the English government for lack of evidence of the losses or significantly reduced. The property and lands were acquired by the American communities and then resold to the highest bidders. 

Due to the climatic effects of a 1782 eruption of an Icelandic volcano, the loyalists also experienced one of the coldest Canadian winters on record which contributed to poor crops in 1783-1784. Starvation, disease and hardship were rampant and many resolved to return to the United States despite the threats of retribution rather than subsist on their meager produce.

== Treaty of Paris (1783) ==

The British lost hope of crushing the rebellion after Yorktown. They decided to negotiate peace with The United States, France, and Spain. '''The Treaty of Paris''' was signed on September 3rd, 1783. In it, the United States was recognized as an independent nation, with boundaries stretching from the Canadian border in the North, to the Mississippi River to the West, and the northern border of Florida in the South. Britain was forced to return Florida to Spain, but could still hold Canada. Congress was told to advise the states to restore property lost or stolen from the Loyalists. (However, many Loyalists had fled during the Revolution, and many of them did not return to claim their property.)

{{chapnav|Road to Revolution|Constitution Early Years}}

== Religion &amp; the Revolution ==

=== Catholics in the Revolution ===

The complex situation of Catholicism in Great Britain had results in its Colonies. At the time of the American revolution, Catholics formed approximately 1.6% of the total American population of the original 13 colonies. If Catholics were seen as potential enemies of the British state, Irish Catholics, subject to British rule, were doubly-damned. In Ireland they had been subject to British domination. In America Catholics were still forbidden from settling in some of the colonies. Although the head of their faith dwelt in Rome, they were under the official representation of the Catholic Bishop of the London diocese, one James Talbot. When War began, Bishop Talbot declared his faithfulness to the British Crown. (If he had done otherwise, Catholics in England would have been in trouble. Anti-Catholic sentiment still ran high.) He forbade any Colonial priest to serve Communion. This made practice of the faith impossible. This created sympathy for the Colonial rebels. The Continental Army's alliance with the French increased sympathy for the faith. When the French fleet arrived in Newport, Rhode Island, the colony repealed the Act of 1664 and allowed citizenship to Catholics. (This anticipated the provision of the Constitutional Bill of Rights which would strike anti-Catholic laws from the books.) After the war, the Pope created an American Bishop, John Carroll -- a descendant of the same Carrolls who had helped found Maryland -- and an American Diocese communicating directly with Rome.

=== From Anglicanism to Episcopalianism ===

On the one hand the colonial Church of England was seen as an organ of the British government and a collaborator with it. Its clergy swore allegiance to the King. Several colony governments paid monies to their local Anglican Church. Although other faiths were allowed in those states, the Anglican was considered the Official (Established) Church, putting pressure on other denominations. Yet several Revolutionaries, including Thomas Jefferson, rented their pews in a Church of England building. (Jefferson's own faith was Low Church, and he disagreed with the miracles in Christianity.) Significant meetings of the rebellion were held in Church of England buildings. 

Yet after the war, the Church needed to find a new role. Some of the Loyalist clergy went north to Canada. Others were allowed to remain after swearing an oath to the new government. The formerly Established Church was no more: even before the creation of the Constitution, with its separation of Church and State, Americans did not want to pay any extra fees. The Book of Common Prayer, the form of worship in that Church, was pragmatically revised for the new Episcopal Church so that people prayed for &quot;Civil Rulers,&quot; instead of the King. But many Church buildings were closed, and there was now room for other denominations to flourish in Virginia and other states.

The '''Articles of Confederation''', formally the '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', was an agreement among the 13 founding states that established the United States of America as a confederation of sovereign states and served as its first constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774–1781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = xi, 184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its drafting by the Continental Congress began in mid-1776, and an approved version was sent to the states for ratification in late 1777. The formal ratification by all 13 states was completed in early 1781. Even when not yet ratified, the Articles provided domestic and international legitimacy for the Continental Congress to direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with Europe and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations. Nevertheless, the weakness of the government created by the Articles became a matter of concern for key nationalists. [Whom?]

==Questions for Review==

1. Who were these authors/composers, and what were they known for? (Mary Otis Warren, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, William Billings.)

2. How do the battles of Lexington and Concord show the early strengths and weaknesses of the American fighters?

3. Examine a copy of the Declaration of Independence in relation to this and the previous chapters. How does its rhetoric (choice of words) address the concerns of the American rebellion? How does it deviate from actual events to make a point?

===Soviet Union===
At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union controlled the largest army the world had ever known. Yet the &quot;Mother Country&quot; lay ravaged: nearly one third of its wealth had been destroyed. 32,000 factories were in ruins, 65,000 kilometers of railway track were now useless, and an untold number of citizens had been killed. 17,100 townships had been destroyed; 70,000 villages and hamlets had been burned to the ground; 100,000 collective farms had been completely demolished in the military occupation. Citizens who had  survived were now starving and resorting to barbaric ways of survival.

After years of struggle with the Wehrmacht, the Soviets were widely regarded as having borne the brunt of destroying Nazism, creating immense respect for the Red Army. &quot;Uncle Joe&quot; Stalin had become a popular figure in Europe and in the United States. Many Europeans thought that having won the war, Stalin could now win the peace.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Jeremy, Taylor Downing, Markus Schurr, Heike Schlatterer, and Norbert Juraschitz. DerKalte Krieg: Ein Illustrierte Geschichte, 1945-1991. Mu%u0308nchen, etc.: Diana Verlag, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
After the war, America's economy was ready to expand into markets on every continent.  During the war, much of the world had built up a debt to the United States, and many ex-allies turned towards America for financial relief.  Britain negotiated a loan of $3.75 billion. Even the Soviet Union discussed with Washington about the possibility of a $6 billion loan for desperately needed reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Jeremy, Taylor Downing, Markus Schurr, Heike Schlatterer, and Norbert Juraschitz. DerKalte Krieg: Ein Illustrierte Geschichte, 1945-1991. Mu%u0308nchen, etc.: Diana Verlag, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Bretton Woods Conference on the postwar global economy in 1944, the dollar was established as the worlds principal trading currency, while the pound was relegated to second place. Because the dollar was the only currency freely convertible throughout the world,many nations hoped for loans and assistance from the United States. And since the United States was the only power possessing the atom bomb, America seemed to have the advantage in both military and economy when it came to determining the future shape of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Jeremy, Taylor Downing, Markus Schurr, Heike Schlatterer, and Norbert Juraschitz.

During the Cold War the United States opened up many different job opportunities to help out other countries who agreed not to favor communism. This began to become very beneficial to the United States because many countries came to the United States aid to help fight against communism.

== Truman Doctrine ==

World War II changed the balance of power in the international community by reducing the influence of France and the United Kingdom, while increasing the influence of the United States and the Soviet Union, which became the world's superpowers. The initial sentiments of the US government towards the avowedly socialist Soviet Union were friendly. In the aftermath of the war, however, relations between the two powers quickly deteriorated. At the end of World War II, a number of entities were established by Allied nations to help maintain international order; the most notable of these was the [[w:United Nations|United Nations]]. Within the framework of the UN, the United States and Britain advocated for the creation of a regulatory entity for the world's monetary system which would help avoid another worldwide depression similar to that seen during the Great Depression before the war.  Talks among Allied delegates were held in 1944 which resulted in the creation of the [[w:International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund]] and what would eventually become the [[w:World Bank|World Bank]], organizations established to make currency exchange easier and to regulate international debt. The Soviet government was highly suspicious of these entities -- it viewed them as a tool for the western world to force capitalism on socialist member-states -- and it refused to support them.

The USSR's refusal to support the IMF and the World Bank set off a diplomatic chain reaction that would eventually grow into what became known as the Cold War.

The Soviet Union believed that its control of Eastern Europe was vital to its security, and said that it was right for it to do so, for &quot;we suffered at Stalingrad&quot;. As agreed at the Yalta Conference, the World War II Allies divided Germany into four zones, giving one zone each to the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's zone, known as East Germany, was later transformed into a Communist state, after an agreement on a unified Germany could not be reached. The other three zones, West Germany, were joined - at first economically through a currency reform - during the implementation of the Marshall Plan in 1948. The city of Berlin, which was surrounded by East Germany, was divided in two parts between East and West Germany. Critics correctly pointed out that the Soviet Union was little involved in the Greek Civil War, that the communists in Greece were more pro-Tito than pro-Stalin, and that the resistance movement had non-communists as well as communist members. Nor was The Soviet Union threatening turkey at the time. Others suggested that such aid should be channeled through the United Nations.

In 1947, Greece became the focus of the Cold War. The Greek monarchy had been supported by Great Britain since 1945. Greek Communists threatened to overthrow this regime, which was corrupt and not representative of the people. In order to &quot;shock&quot; the American public into accepting American involvement in order to help other peoples resist the &quot;communist threat&quot; and secure the strategically and economically important Middle East for US influence, President Harry Truman issued the ''Truman Doctrine''. The Doctrine suggested that the US would aid nations threatened by revolutionary forces. Congress agreed and appropriated $400 million in aid for Greece and Turkey. By 1949, the Communists in Greece were defeated. In 1952, Greece and Turkey entered the NATO.

== The Marshall Plan ==

The Marshall Plan was the first attempt to achieve the goals that America set in western Europe. The European nations were still unstable, both in politics and in economics, and so they did not have the money to purchase the good that they required from the U.S. The people and government of America were all extremely worried that if Europe's funds continued to be so unstable, this would trigger another great depression. With the memories of all the hardships and economic ruin of the Great Depression in the 1930s fresh in the American people's minds, the government decided they needed to do something. In order to make sure that there was not another worldwide depression, in 1948 the American government decided to launch a massive European recovery program called the Marshall Plan which sent 12.4 billion dollars to western Europe. A condition of this program was that Europe would spend this foreign-aid money on American products. This program ended in 1951. The Marshall Plan was a mixture of failure and success. In Europe, it assisted to further divide eastern and western Europe and it caused inflation which did nothing to solve the balance-of-payment problem. However, this program did succeed in spurring western European industrialization and investment. &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconstruction of the New World ==

The leadership in the United States by contrast, came out of war extremely confident about the immediate security of the country’s borders. Separated from the other world powers by two vast oceans, the American home base had been virtually immune from attack during the fighting—only the occasional shell from a submarine or a hostile balloon reached the shores of the continental United States American casualties were fewer than those of any other major combatants—hugely so in comparison with the Soviet Union. With its fixed capital intact, its resources more plentiful than ever, and in lone possession of the atomic bomb, the United States was the strongest power in the world at war’s ends. 

Yet this was no time for complacency, Washington officials reminded one another. Some other power — almost certainly the USSR — could take advantage of the political and economic instability in war-torn Europe and Asia, and eventually seize control of these areas, with dire implications for America’s physical and economic security. To prevent this eventuality, officials in Washington sought forward bases overseas, in order to keep a airborne enemy at bay. To further enhance U.S. security, American planners, in direct contrast to their Soviet counterparts, sought the quick reconstruction of nations—including the former enemies Germany and Japan—and a world economy based on free trade. Such a system, they reasoned, was essential to preserve America’s economic well being.

The Soviets, on the other hand refused to join the new World Bank and International Monetary Fund, created at the July 1944 Bretton Woods Conference by forty-four nations to stabilize trade and finances. They held that the United States dominated both institutions and used them to promote private investment and open international commerce, which Moscow saw as capitalist tools of exploitation.  With the United States as its largest donor, the World Bank opened its doors in 1945 and began to make loans to help members finance reconstruction projects; the IMF, also heavily backed by the united states, helped members meet their balance-of-payment problems through currency loans.

== Reconstruction of Japan ==

After Japan's surrender in 1945, the United States military was directed to reconstruct the nation. American General Douglas MacArthur headed the Reconstruction effort. However, he was aided at every stage by anthropologists and specialists on Japanese history and culture. This effort was not simply an attempt to make the defeated Japanese knuckle under, but a sensitive reconstruction of the whole society for both political modernization and cultural continuity with the pre-Dictatorship history.

MacArthur was dealing with a society in physical and cultural shock. The Japanese Dictatorship had used the Emperor's position as the head of Shinto religion, and his people thought of him as a god. They heard his voice for the first time over the radio announcing their nation's capitulation. Bombing of Japanese infrastructure, and months of shortages, had ruined electrical, water, and sanitary systems. Before Fat Man and Little Boy, an American campaign of bombing Tokyo had killed, wounded, and dismayed civilians. The A-bombs had left areas of Hiroshima and Nagasaki radioactive. Those who had not been killed outright were dying of radiation poisoning and cancer. 

In 1947, a new Constitution for Japan was created. The Constitution entirely changed the role of the Emperor from an active leader to a passive symbol of the nation. The Diet, or legislature, was modeled on the British Parliament. The Constitution granted an enormous number of rights to Japanese citizens. Finally, the Constitution formally denounced all military conflict and prohibited Japan from keeping any armed forces.

The Reconstruction of Japan made other sweeping changes. For example, the Reconstruction introduced labor unions and reduced the influence of monopolistic businesses. 

During the Cold War, America was determined to make an ally out of the Empire of Japan. The Reconstruction made an about-face, reversing its policy of reducing the power of large businesses. More regulations regarding the economy were made. In 1951, the US agreed to grant Japan full independence and autonomy. The treaty, however, did permit the US to maintain parts of its military in Japan. The treaty became effective in 1952.

== The Rise of Communism in China ==
After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, China was in a state of confusion and unrest. The nation saw the worst nightmares as the people were without stable unified authority, fragmenting into a rudderless giant. Many land lords (ward lords, since the standing was imposed and established by force of arms) took advantage of the situation aiming to expand their influence and so fought against each other regardless of common statehood ideas or national purpose and gradually the situation became chaotic. This was the period of warlordism in China, it lasted from 1916 to 1927, a dark period in China’s history.

Meanwhile the principles of communism began to spread in the country and those ideals attracted a majority of the people. The people who belonged to the lower strata were for these principles especially for the law of equality.

The rise of Communism in China is mainly due to a man named Mao Zedong. He was poorly educated as a child but highly intelligent. Zedong left home and had become a member of the Nationalist Army as the Revolution began around 1911. He was soon introduced to and became powerfully influenced by the philosophies of Marxism.

After decades of civil war and invasion by Japan, the communists under Mao prevailed. The opposition nationalists fell and barely managed to retreat offshore to Taiwan. Communism came to power in 1949 under the power of Mao. Communism began as a movement that paved the way for the liberation of the proletariat.  Proletariat is that class of society which lives entirely from the sale of its labor and does not draw profit from any kind of capital; whose weal and woe, whose life and death, whose sole existence depends on the demand for labor – hence, on the changing state of business, on the vagaries of unbridled competition. The proletariat, or the class of proletarians, is, in a word, the working class of the 19th century.

Anarchy was to some extend controlled by Mao but he faced failure many times. Mao’s initiatives did cause a kind of equality to emerge in China, but it was not one in which all the inhabitants of China benefited. Contrarily, many of them suffered extreme poverty and greatness was lost in the realms of academia, science, and technology which hindered China’s ability to become a modern nation capable of interacting on the global scale.

== The Red Scare and McCarthyism ==

When China fell to Communism, suspicion of the ideology's influence in the American government became a pandemic. Many experts on China and the regions around it were fired as in some way causing the change. This became a problem during the Korean War. What became known as '''the Red Scare''' proved costly in American life. 

Congress passed the McCarran Internal Security Act in 1950, overriding President Truman's veto. The Act created a public body known as the ''Subversive Activities Control Board''; the Board was charged with monitoring and investigating Communist Activities. 

In Congress, meanwhile, Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy accused certain government officials of being Communists and disloyal. While a Communist conspiracy involving State Department employees was eventually uncovered, many of the accusations were baseless. The word ''McCarthyism'' refers to a vindictive persecution of the innocent.

The House of Representatives had established a Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947. The Committee performed actions such as investigating actors, directors, and writers. As was the case with Red Summer, it was not mere membership in the Communist party which caused suspicion. Individuals were sometimes grilled for belonging to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People or the American Civil Liberties Union. It was not enough to confess innocence: you had in turn to accuse others of Communism. A few in the dragnet had actually been Communists, either because they had actually believed in its aims or as part of the polarization of American society in the era of the Spanish Civil War. 

However, the opponents of the Committee were not all Communist. Some accused it of violating the Constitutional rights against self-incrimination and for freedom of belief. The entertainment industry, fearful of an investigation, fired many people who had become shadowed by the hearings, or by a pamphlet called &quot;Red Channels.&quot; Men and women lost their livelihood, in some cases fleeing to Europe and elsewhere, in others even committing suicide over their lost lives. Ten individuals refused to name names, including screenwriters Dalton Trumbo and Ring Lardner, Jr., and were all duly blacklisted as ''the Hollywood Ten''.

Some local communities banned literature that they feared would encourage Communism. Public servants and teachers were forced to take a so-called &quot;loyalty oath&quot;: those who refused, for whatever reason, were not hired. Others lost their jobs due to unfounded accusations of disloyalty. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who had come to power in the wake of the first Communist scare, had Americans followed on suspicion of Communism. Scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped develop the atomic bomb, was fired from his high-security job because of his former associations with the Communist party. Yet the career of Joseph McCarthy was also derailed during the Red Scare: in 1954, the Senate formally censured him for abusing his powers and using unfair tactics in targeting innocent government officials.

Even at the height of the McCarthyist furor in the early 1950s, the anti-Communist crusade was relatively mild. Many prosecutions faltered on appeal and only a few foreign-born radicals were actually deported. Only Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were put to death. Of the roughly 150 people who went to prison, most were released within a year or two. Yet the after effects lasted for decades. When the United States later fought a war in Vietnam, it was often in the dark because a number of regional experts had been lost to the Red Scare.

== The Korean War ==

After World War II, the US attempted to curb Soviet influence on the Korean Peninsula by occupying southern part of that area. The area occupied by the US became South Korea, while the other part became North Korea. North Korea soon passed into the control of the Communist Party.

In May, 1949, fighting between North and South Korean troops broke out near the border between the two nations. In an attempt to add South Korea to the Communist World, North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950. The People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union lent their support to North Korea, while the United States did the same to South Korea.
On June 25, 1950 a large military force moved across the 38th parallel in the Republic of Korea. Since 1910, Korea had been divided into two by the powers of Japans victory in 1945. The Korean war was seen as an internal struggle, with the north heavily armed and backed by China and the Soviet Union invading the lightly armed south. The two parts moved along the temporary border while the anti-government fighting began to flare into the south.

On June 27, 1950 the United Nations security Council first adopted a ceasefire resolution. When the United Nations Security Council voted to aid South Korea in stopping North Korean aggression, the United States agreed to send troops to the Korean Peninsula. General Douglas MacArthur was given the command of UN troops in Korea. The United States agreed to send troops over on June 30 along with increasing aid to the French fight against Communists rebels in Indochina. MacArthur was placed in command on July 8. At the beginning the U.S. troops were lacking training and were out of shape. In the first few weeks of fighting the U.S. troops were pushed back to a defensive perimeter at Pusan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Don't Know Much About History&quot; by Kenneth C. Davis&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the autumn of 1950, North Korean troops were forced out of South Korea. In October, General MacArthur ordered troops to cross into North Korea. In the third week of that month, the US took the capital of North Korea, Pyongyang. 

However, just six days after the United Nations forces took Pyongyang, the People's Republic of China sent a quarter million men on a series of counterattacks. In December, Chinese &quot;volunteers&quot; took over Pyongyang and by January 1951 they had taken the South Korean capital, Seoul.

The US intended to do whatever it took to win the Korean War. It even planned on using the atomic bomb. However, President Truman did not trust General MacArthur to follow orders when using the atomic bomb. Therefore, he asked for MacArthur's resignation; MacArthur complied.

In 1953, Dwight D. Eisenhower became President of the US. Having promised during the election campaign to end the Korean War, he fulfilled this promise by continuing negotiations with the North and South Koreans, Chinese, and the Soviet Union and using &quot;brinkmanship&quot; to reach an agreement acceptable to all countries involved except for South Korea, which tried to induce the US to help unite Korea.

==Weapons of the Cold War==
The nuclear arms race was central to the Cold War. Many feared where the Cold War was going with the belief that the more nuclear weapons you had, the more powerful you were. Both America and The Soviet Union massively built up their stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

The world greatly changed when USA exploded the H-bomb in 1952. This one bomb was smaller in size than the Hiroshima atomic bomb but 2500 times more powerful. The Soviets produced an H-bomb in 1953 and the world became a much more dangerous place.

However, it is possible that the sheer power of these weapons and the fear that they evoked, may have stopped a nuclear war.

USA produced a bomber - the B52 - that could fly 6,000 miles and deliver a nuclear pay-load. Such a development required massive financial backing from the government - something which America could afford to do and which The Soviet Union could not. The Soviet Union concentrated on producing bigger bombs - a far more cost effective procedure.

In October 1957, the world was introduced to the fear of a missile attack when the Soviet Satellite Sputnik was launched. This was to lead to ICBM’s :  Inter-continental ballistic missiles. As a result, America built the [[w:Distant Early Warning Line|DEW line]] around the Arctic - Distant Early Warning system.

At the end of the 1950’s, American Intelligence estimated that in a Soviet missile attack, 20 million Americans would die and 22 million would be injured.

During the 1960’s, the Soviet's put their money into producing larger missiles, Eventually creating Tsar Bomba, the biggest Nuclear Weapon ever created. America built fewer but technologically superior missiles - the Atlas could go 5,000 miles at a speed of 16,000 mph. By 1961, there were enough bombs to destroy the world.

Despite this, great emphasis was put on new weapon systems - mobile missile launchers were built, missiles were housed underground in silos and in 1960 the first Polaris submarine was launched carrying 16 nuclear missiles. Each missile carried four warheads which could targeted on different cities; hence one submarine effectively carried 64 nuclear warheads.

During the 1960’s the theory of MAD developed - Mutually Assured Destruction. This meant that if The Soviet Union attacked the west, the west would make sure that they would suitably retaliate  i.e. there would be no winners.

By 1981, USA had 8,000 ICBMs and USSR 7,000 ICBMs

By 1981, USA had 4,000 planes capable of delivering a nuclear bomb. the USSR had 5000.

USA defense spending for 1981 = 178 billion dollars. By 1986, it was 367 billion dollars.

By 1986, it is estimated that throughout the world there were 40,000 nuclear warheads - the equivalent of one million Hiroshima bombs.

British Intelligence estimated that just one medium sized H-bomb on London would essentially destroy anything living up to 30 miles away.

Confronted by such awesome statistics, world leaders had to move to a position where they trusted each other more. Throughout the 1960's and 1970's &quot;detente&quot; had been used to ease bad relations between the superpowers. This was to culminate in the Reykjavik meeting between presidents Reagan and Gorbachev that started real progress in the cut in nuclear weaponry in future meetings (if little was actually gained at the meeting in Reykjavik).

== President Harry S. Truman ==

Harry S. Truman had been vice president for only 82 days when President Roosevelt died, on April 12, 1945. He told reporters, &quot;I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.&quot; He had had very little communication with Roosevelt about world affairs or domestic politics and was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb. Truman was much more difficult for the Secret Service to protect than the wheel chair–bound Roosevelt had been. Truman was an avid walker, regularly taking walks around Washington. Truman was President from April 12, 1945 to January 20, 1953. Deciding not to run again, he retired to his home town of Independence, Missouri.

==Eisenhower==
In addition to his desire to halt the advance of “creeping socialism” in U.S. domestic policy, Eisenhower also wanted to “roll back” the advances of Communism abroad. After taking office in 1953, he devised a new foreign policy tactic to contain the Soviet Union and even win back territory that had already been lost. Devised primarily by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, this so-called New Look at foreign policy proposed the use of nuclear weapons and new technology rather than ground troops and conventional bombs, all in an effort to threaten “massive retaliation” against the USSR for Communist advances abroad.

In addition to intimidating the Soviet Union, this emphasis on new and cheaper weapons would also drastically reduce military spending, which had escalated rapidly during the Truman years. As a result, Eisenhower managed to stabilize defense spending, keeping it at roughly half the congressional budget during most of his eight years in office.

The doctrine of massive retaliation proved to be dangerously flawed, however, because it effectively left Eisenhower without any options other than nuclear war to combat Soviet aggression. This dilemma surfaced in 1956, for instance, when the Soviet Union brutally crushed a popular democratic uprising in Hungary. Despite Hungary’s request for American recognition and military assistance, Eisenhower’s hands were tied because he knew that the USSR would stop at nothing to maintain control of Eastern Europe. He could not risk turning the Cold War into a nuclear war over the interests of a small nation such as Hungary.

As an alternative, Eisenhower employed the CIA to tackle the specter of Communism in developing countries outside the Soviet Union’s immediate sphere of influence. Newly appointed CIA director Allen Dulles (the secretary of state’s brother) took enormous liberties in conducting a variety of covert operations. Thousands of CIA operatives were assigned to Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East and attempted to launch coups, assassinate heads of state, arm anti-Communist revolutionaries, spread propaganda, and support despotic pro-American regimes. Eisenhower began to favor using the CIA instead of the military because covert operations didn’t attract as much attention and cost much less money.

A CIA-sponsored coup in Iran in 1953, however, did attract attention and heavy criticism from liberals both at home and in the international community. Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers authorized the coup in Iran when the Iranian government seized control of the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Afraid that the popular, nationalist, Soviet-friendly prime minister of Iran, Mohammed Mossadegh, would then cut off oil exports to the United States, CIA operatives convinced military leaders to overthrow Mossadegh and restore Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi as head of state in 1953. Pahlavi returned control of Anglo-Iranian Oil to the British and then signed agreements to supply the United States with almost half of all the oil drilled in Iran.

The following year, a similar coup in Guatemala over agricultural land rights also drew international criticism and severely damaged U.S.–Latin American relations.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ideas and Questions of the Time ==

The overriding question throughout the decade preceding the Civil War was, “Should slavery be allowed in the new territories of the United States?” Before 1848, the question had been hypothetical; however, with the new lands acquired during the Mexican War, it was time for America to make a firm decision regarding the expansion of slavery. 

The central ideas dominating the debate were:

=== The Wilmot Proviso ===

On August 8, 1846, Representative David Wilmot, a Pennsylvania Democrat, presented a proposal expressing that “slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of any territory obtained from Mexico.” The Wilmot Proviso was never accepted as law, but it at long last put the issue forth on the political table.

=== The Calhoun Resolutions ===

John C. Calhoun, the South Carolina statesman, responded with the Calhoun Resolutions, which said that Congress had no right to stop any citizen with slaves in their possession from taking those slaves into one of the territories. If they did so, the Fifth Amendment, which states that no person can be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” would be violated. While this was not made formal legislation either, this belief became the standard in most of the south. 

=== Popular Sovereignty ===

A third option, which appealed to many moderates, most prominently Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, was the idea of popular sovereignty. This was the idea of letting the settlers of a territory themselves decide whether slavery was to be allowed in it, by voting on state constitutions and other such measures. The primary merit of this initiative was that it took the debate out of Congress, which quickly grew tired of the issue, and put it into the hands of people it truly affected. There was also an unspoken understanding that most of the territories would end up being free, as most settlers that were already in those areas did not bring their slaves with them.

== Compromise of 1850 ==

America looked to the Senate for an answer to the question of slavery within the territories. Henry Clay, nicknamed the &quot;Great Compromiser,&quot; constructed a compromise: California was admitted as a free state, but all other territories in the Mexican Cession were allowed to choose between becoming a free territory or a slave territory. Also, as part of the Compromise, the slave trade was banned in the District of Columbia, and a Fugitive Slave Act was passed to allow the capture of fugitive slaves.

The Fugitive Slave Act was a very controversial measure. Previously, many in the North felt that slavery merely occurred in the South and that they had nothing to do with it. But under the Fugitive Slave Act, Northerners were required to help return runaway slaves. Thus, the Northerners felt that they were being dragged into aiding the institution of slavery. Several Northern states passed laws prohibiting their officials from aiding the enforcement of the Act.

While the admission of California as a free state gave the free states the majority in Congress, the pro-slavery measures in the Fugitive Slave Act made the Compromise seem more favorable to the South.

== Uncle Tom’s Cabin ==

Harriet Beecher Stowe’s &lt;i&gt;Uncle Tom’s Cabin&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1852, is often called “the book that started the Civil War.” The melodramatic story of the evil overseer Simon Legree and his slaves Eliza and Uncle Tom painted an accurate picture of the horrors of slavery, and gave rise to much abolitionist feeling in the North. However, the effects were not easily visible from the start: because the country was growing tired of the sectional bickering over slavery, it took a while for the story to becoming embedded in the American imagination.

==Nat Turner==
Nat, commonly called Nat Turner, (October 2, 1800 – November 11, 1831) was an American slave whose slave rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia, was the most remarkable instance of black resistance to enslavement in the antebellum southern United States. His methodical slaughter of white civilians during the uprising makes his legacy controversial, but he is still considered by many to be a heroic figure of black resistance to oppression. At birth he was not given a surname, but was recorded solely by his given name, Nat. In accordance with a common practice, he was often called by the surname of his owner, Samuel Turner.

== Election of 1852 ==

In one of the less spectacular elections in American history, Senator Franklin Pierce of the Democratic party defeated General Winfield Scott of the Whig party. The Whigs tried to rely on Scott’s heroics as a general during the Mexican war to get him elected, a strategy that proved unsuccessful. Pierce, of New Hampshire, ended up being largely an ineffective president, trying and failing to please both the North and the South.

== The Kansas-Nebraska Act and its Effects ==

Throughout this time, plans were underway for a transcontinental railroad. A question arose as to what Eastern city should be the main terminus. Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois hoped to advance his own state’s interests by making Chicago the railroad hub. To do this, he suggested a piece of legislation known as the “Kansas-Nebraska Act,” requiring recognition of two new territories, Kansas and Nebraska, west of Missouri and Iowa, respectively. These territories would both help his railroad and solve the overdue issue of the territories in the remainder of the Louisiana Purchase. 

But to get the Kansas-Nebraska Act passed, he would have to get the support of Southerners, who wanted a railroad along a more southern route. For this reason, Douglas included in the Act the provision of popular sovereignty in the territories. 

This blatantly violated the Missouri Compromise of 1821, which stated that slavery would be prohibited above the 36º30’ line. Douglas therefore opened himself up to the verbal barrage of protests from the North, who denounced the cancellation of the Missouri Compromise as unfair. Yet the Act passed, to the indignation of many Northerners, with the support of President Pierce.

=== The North ===

Many in the North figured that if the Missouri Compromise was not an unbreakable law, neither was the Fugitive Slave Act, leading to many demonstrations against it. Boston witnessed the most remarkable of these, leading to many New Englanders turning against Pierce for his support of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

=== Political Parties ===

The Whig party essentially buckled under the pressure of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, with the North condemning it and the South supporting it. Whigs from the North joined some Democrats and Free Soilers that united under the general principle of the Wilmot Proviso, eventually calling themselves the Republican Party and offering its first presidential candidate, John C. Fremont in 1856.

==Rachel v. Walker==
Rachel v. Walker was a lawsuit involving a slave who, in 1834, sued for her freedom from John Walker in the Supreme Court of Missouri, and won. This result was cited in 1856 in the famous Dred Scott v. Sandford case before the Supreme Court of the United States.[1]
== Dred Scott ==

The question of the constitutionality of Congressional Compromises was decided by the Supreme Court in 1856. In &quot;Scott v. Sanford&quot;, the Court ruled against a slave, Dred Scott, who had sued to become free. The Court ruled 7-2 that Scott remained a slave, and there were nine written opinions. The Chief Justice of the United States, Roger Taney, decided that blacks were so inferior that they could not be citizens of the United States, and that, consequently, they could not sue for his freedom (a state issue)in diversity in federal court, and therefore the court lacked jurisdiction. Nevetheless (the biggest &quot;nevertheless&quot; in American history) in a supererogatory effort to settle the question of slavery once and for all, the Marylander Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise (which had banned the expansion of slavery into the territories north of Missouri) among other laws, was unconstitutional because it restricted the Constitutional right to own property. Many felt that Taney had committed a legal error in his decision. First, Taney had ruled that Scott had no right to sue. The case should have ended there. Taney had ruled on the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise, which had, under Taney's own ruling that Scott had no right to sue, no bearing upon the case. Thus, the outrage against the Dred Scott decision was increased even more.

== John Brown’s Raid ==

John Brown, an extreme abolitionist last seen engineering the Pottawatomie Massacre in Kansas, came to the federal arsenal at Harper’s Ferry, Virginia for his last fight. He planned to take over the arsenal, give weapons to the slaves that would support him, and make a center of black power in the Appalachian Mountains that would support slave uprisings in the south. 

The raid did not go quite as planned. Brown did take over the arsenal and took a couple of hostages, but ended up being assaulted by  Virginia militia and U.S. Marines under the command of Col. Robert E. Lee of the US 2nd Cavalry. He was tried, convicted, and hanged for treason to the State of Virginia. 

However, his Raid left a profound impact. John Brown became a martyr for the abolitionist cause during the Civil War. In the South, his actions gave cause to rumors of Northern conspiracy supporting slave insurrections, engendering further suspicion of outsiders in the South. A later Northern marching song sang “John Brown’s body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul is marching on.”

== Lincoln ==
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 340px; float:left; margin:0 1 0em 2em; text-align: center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Lincoln_Campaign_Poster.jpg]]&lt;br&gt; '' Lincoln campaign poster''&lt;/div&gt;
In 1860, four major candidates ran for President. The Whigs, adopting the name &quot;Constitutional Union&quot;, nominated Tennessean Senator John Bell. The Northern Democrats nominated Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois and the Southern Democrats nominated the Vice President John Breckenridge of Kentucky. The more united Republican party nominated Abraham Lincoln, who spoke out against expansion of slavery. Though he assumed that, under the constitution, Congress could not outlaw slavery in the South, he assured all that he would work to admit only free states to the US. Due to divisions between the parties, Lincoln won the election by carrying every  Northern State. Douglas won Missouri, Bell the Upper South, and Breckenridge the Deep South. The South was outraged. The North had a far larger population than the South, and thus had more electoral votes. The South had been out voted.

Now we have learned Ohm's Law we can start applying it to some circuits.

The test circuits below can be used to investigate how the voltage across a component varies with the current flowing through the component. Either circuit can be used. The one on the left is easiest to set up, the one on the right is easiest to use once it is set up, but does require you to use the rheostat as a potential divider.

Note that the voltmeter is in parallel with the component and the ammeter is in series with it.This is necessary so that the ammeter and voltmeter do not interfere with the circuit in anyway. An ideal meter does not change either the current or the voltage. 

The wire should be ''resistance wire'', such as nichrome. Ordinary copper wire would short circuit the power pack and blow the pack's fuse.


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Voltage current characterstic test circuit.png]]
| [[Image:Voltage current test circuit with P.D..png]]
|-
| A test circuit || A better test circuit
|}

Set up either circuit and then by turning the voltage setting on the power pack and the slider on the rheostat, adjust the current to read 0.1 A. Take a reading of the voltage. Repeat for 0.2 A, 0.3 A up to 1.0 A. Repeat the readings but this time go from 1.0 A to 0.9 A and so on down to 0.1 A.

Set your results out in a table like this.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;  bgcolor=&quot;ffffdd&quot;
|-
! Current&lt;br&gt;(A)
! Voltage going up&lt;br&gt;(V)
! Voltage going down&lt;br&gt;(V)
! Average voltage&lt;br&gt;(V)
|-
| 0.1 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.2 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.3 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.4 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.5 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.6 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.7 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.8 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 0.9 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|-
| 1.0 || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt; || &lt;br&gt;
|}

Now plot the average voltage against the current on graph paper. You should find the points all fall approximately on a straight line. The slope of the line =Voltage/Current. This is the resistance.

Below is a typical voltage/current graph for a wire. Note that all the points fall approximately on a straight line. 


[[Image:VC_wire.png]] 

The slope of the line is 1.1 V/A.

Therefore the resistance  of this wire is 1.1 &amp;Omega;

All ''Ohmic'' components have a constant resistance like this. However, ''non-Ohmic'' components (that is, components that do not obey Ohm's law) do not have such a resistance. A bulb, for example, has a resistance that increases as the current flowing through it goes up, because the filament is heating up. A current-voltage graph for a bulb would be a curve.

'''Q1)''' Plot a current/voltage graph for the following set of data for a 12V filament bulb.


{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
| '''Summary'''
|-
|
* Resistance is the gradient of a current-voltage graph.
* Ohmic conductors, such as a wire, will have a constant resistance (straight line on the graph).
* Non-Ohmic conducts, such as a bulb, will have a changing resistance due to temperature (curved line on the graph).

'''Complex numbers''' are the extension of the real numbers, i.e., the number line, into a number plane. They allow us to turn the rules of plane geometry into arithmetic. Complex numbers have fundamental importance in describing the laws of the universe at the subatomic level, including the propagation of light and quantum mechanics. They also have practical uses in many fields, including signal processing and electrical engineering.

== Introduction ==
Currently, we are able to solve many different kinds of equations for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, such as &lt;math&gt;x + 7 = 12&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;3x = 4&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;x +10 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In each of these cases the solution for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a real number: respectively 5, 4/3, and -10.

However, there is no real number ''x'' that satisfies the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2 = -1\,&lt;/math&gt;, since the square of any real number is nonnegative.

Conceptually it would be nice to have some kind of number to be the solution of &lt;math&gt;x^2 = -1\,&lt;/math&gt;. This &quot;number&quot; would not be a real number, however, and we refer to such a number as an ''imaginary'' number.

We then extend the real number system to accommodate this special number. It turns out that there will be two imaginary solutions of the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. One of them will be called &lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt; and, following the normal rules for arithmetic, the other solution is &lt;math&gt;-i\,&lt;/math&gt;. We may be inclined to say that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}=i\,&lt;/math&gt;.  That would, however, be incorrect solely because in words this says that &quot;'''the''' square root of -1 is &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, but there is no basis for preferring &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt; (or vice versa) as the square root of -1.  Rather, the two square roots have equal standing. 

We say that all numbers of the form a +b&lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are any real numbers, is the set of ''complex'' numbers, and we denote this set '''C'''. 
The real numbers '''R''' may be considered to be the subset of complex numbers '''C''' = {a +b&lt;math&gt;i\,&lt;/math&gt;} for which b = 0. Complex numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided (except by 0). We will explore some of the properties of these numbers later.

There are in fact two commonly used definitions of complex numbers, but they are immediately seen to be logically equivalent.

For a negative root like &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-4}\,&lt;/math&gt;, we split the number into two parts such that one part is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\,&lt;/math&gt; like &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-4}\, = \sqrt{4*-1}\, = \sqrt{4}\,* \sqrt{-1}\, &lt;/math&gt; which leads to &lt;math&gt;2i&lt;/math&gt;

== Definition 1==
A '''complex number''' is an expression of the form ''x + iy'', in which ''x'' and ''y'' are real numbers and ''i'' is a new number, called the '''imaginary unit''', for which expressions the normal rules of calculation apply together with the extra rule: ''i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1''.

== Definition 2==
A '''complex number''' is a pair of real numbers ''(x,y)'', satisfying the properties:

:&lt;math&gt;(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+c,b+d)\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(a,b) \cdot (c,d)=(ac-bd,ad+bc)&lt;/math&gt;

In both cases a complex number consists of two real numbers ''x'' and ''y''. The real number ''x'' is called the '''real part''' and the real number ''y'' the '''imaginary part''' of the complex number.

From the properties we deduce that complex numbers of the form (x,0) behave just like the real numbers, so we identify (1,0) with 1 and hence (x,0) with x. Furthermore we see that:

:&lt;math&gt;(0,1) \cdot (0,1)=(-1,0)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.

It is common use to write ''i'' instead of (0,1), so:
:&lt;math&gt;\, i=(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\, i^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;.

Any complex number ''(x,y)'' may now be written as ''x + iy''.



=== Some examples ===
A ''complex number'' is a number that is in the form z = ''a'' + ''b''i, where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. We say that ''a'' is the ''real'' part of z and write Re(z), and that ''b'' is the ''imaginary'' part of z, and write Im(z)

A number of the form ''b''i is sometimes called a ''pure imaginary'' number, as it has no real part. The pure imaginary numbers are also complex numbers, because ''b''i = 0 + ''b''i. In the same way, all real numbers are also complex numbers, because ''a'' = ''a'' + 0i. So the set of complex numbers includes real numbers, pure imaginary numbers, and the sums of reals and pure imaginaries.

Here are some examples
* 1 + 4i: a complex number, real part 1, imaginary part 4
* 2 - 2i: a complex number, real part 2, imaginary part -2.
* -4i: a complex number, real part 0, imaginary part -4
* 2: a complex number (also a real number), real part 2, imaginary part 0.

Notice that the number 2 is a complex number '''and''' a real number. This fact is clearer if we write 2 = 2 + 0i.

Any complex number may be written in three main forms, which we will explore later. The form ''x'' + ''y''i is known as the ''Cartesian'' form.

=== Complex numbers and matrices ===
Complex numbers can be identified with a certain set of ''matrices''. If we think of the 2x2 identity matrix as the number 1, and we think of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; which we introduced above as the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -1 \\
1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;,

then the complex number &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt; then has the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; -b \\
b &amp; a \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==
Complex numbers obey most of the properties of real numbers. Take two complex numbers, &lt;math&gt;z_1=a+bi\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2=c+di\,&lt;/math&gt;. 

=== Addition ===
How can we add these two complex numbers? 

We don't even have to think about &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; as being &quot;special&quot; in any way, just treat it as any other symbol and proceed by the standard rules of algebra, grouping along the way.

We obtain: 
:&lt;math&gt;z_1+z_2=(a+bi)+(c+di)=(a+c)+(b+d)i\,&lt;/math&gt;

If one uses the matrix analogy above, regular matrix addition works to add complex numbers in the same way. Verify for yourself that this is true.

=== Subtraction ===
Subtraction proceeds just as before. 
:&lt;math&gt;z_1-z_2=(a+bi)-(c+di)=(a-c)+(b-d)i\,&lt;/math&gt;


=== Multiplication ===
By the normal rules, taking into account that &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1\,&lt;/math&gt;, we find:
:&lt;math&gt;z_1z_2=(a+bi)(c+di)=ac+adi+bci+bdi^2=(ac-bd)+(bc+ad)i\,&lt;/math&gt;


If one uses the matrix analogy above, regular matrix multiplication works to multiply complex numbers in the same way. Verify for yourself that this is true.

=== Conjugates ===
The ''conjugate'' of a complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;, is the same number with the sign of the imaginary part changed: the conjugate of ''a'' + ''b''i = ''a'' - ''b''i (and vice versa).

Let us examine what happens when we have a complex number ''z'' = ''a'' + ''b''i, what is the product of ''z'' and its conjugate?

:(''a''+''b''i)(''a''-''b''i) = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ab''i - ''ab''i - ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''' + ''' ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Notice the imaginary parts cancel out, so the product is a ''real number''. This will aid us greatly in the division of a complex number, as we will see.

Notice also that this is the ''sum'' of two squares, analogous to the difference of two squares.

Matrix transposition behaves as conjugation if one uses the matrix analogy.

=== Division ===
How do we compute the quotient
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+bi}{c+di}&lt;/math&gt;
of two complex numbers? It is not difficult. Let the quotient be:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+bi}{c+di}=r+si&lt;/math&gt;,
then cross multiplication gives:
:&lt;math&gt;\,a+bi=(r+si)(c+di)=rc-sd+i(rd+sc)&lt;/math&gt;,
hence
:&lt;math&gt;\,a=rc-sd&lt;/math&gt;,
and
:&lt;math&gt;\,b=rd+sc&lt;/math&gt;.

So we have to solve two linear equations. Solution:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}&lt;/math&gt;,
and
:&lt;math&gt;s=\frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this is complete nonsense unless &lt;math&gt;c^2+d^2 \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact, it is easy to see that the pair of linear equations have a solution exactly when this is true, i.e., when c and d are not both zero. Or in other words, when &lt;math&gt;c+di \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; as a complex number. Thus we can divide by a complex number ''only'' when it is non-zero.

Luckily there is a little trick to speed up this computation. We multiply the denominator with a well chosen number as to make it real. We ''realize the denominator'' by multiplying with the conjugate of the denominator; a complex number times its conjugate is a real number:

:&lt;math&gt;\,(c+di)(c-di)=c^2-(di)^2=c^2+d^2&lt;/math&gt;.

hence:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \frac{a+bi}{c+di}\cdot \frac{c-di}{c-di} = \frac{ac-adi+bci+bd}{c^2+d^2} = \frac{(ac+bd)+(bc-ad)i}{c^2+d^2}=\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2} + \frac{bc-ad}{c^2+d^2}i&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that in the multiplication and division of complex numbers, we usually work out the whole problem instead of just memorizing the equation of the answer.  The reader will note that we use here the familiar trick from algebra of multiplying by the number 1 in a particularly convenient form: &lt;math&gt;\frac{c-di}{c-di}&lt;/math&gt;.  (We leave it to the reader to verify that any non-zero complex number divided by itself is in fact equal to 1.)

== The Argand Plane ==
We can represent complex numbers ''geometrically'' as well. 
Every complex number can be represented in the form z=x+iy (so x=Re(z) and y=Im(z)).
Then we can represent z in the xy-plane by the point (x,y).
Notice that this is a one-to-one relationship: for each complex number, we have one corresponding point in
the plane, and for each point in the plane there corresponds one complex number.
When we use the xy-plane in this way to represent complex numbers, we call the plane
the &quot;Argand plane&quot;.
We will refer to the &quot;y&quot; axis as the imaginary axis, and the &quot;x&quot; axis as the real axis.

Notice that a purely imaginary number is represented in the Argand plane by a point on the
imaginary axis.  A purely real number is represented by a point on the real axis.

Here is an example of the Argand plane.
:[[Image:Argand2.png]]

There are two complex numbers drawn in the plane; viz., 1 + i, -2 - i. Their sum is plotted on the graph, -1. The red and blue lines demonstrate how geometrically, a parallelogram can be constructed, and their apex forms their sum.

=== Modulus and argument ===
:[[Image:Modulus and argument.png]]
On this diagram we can see the number 3 + 4i. The red line is the distance away from the origin (the number 0 + 0i). The gray line represents the distances away from the respective axes. We can see that the red line makes an angle &amp;theta; from the real axis.

It is clear that almost all complex numbers have this distance away from the origin and that almost all complex numbers make an angle away from the real axis. We give these two qualities special names; the distance away from the origin is known as the ''modulus'' of the complex number, and the angle &amp;theta; is known as the ''argument'' of the complex number.

We write the modulus of a complex number z by |z|, and the argument of the complex number as arg z.

We can calculate the modulus and argument by basic trigonometry. 

==== Calculating the modulus ====
In the above example, we have the number 3 + 4i. We can form a triangle in the Argand plane with base 3 and height 4. By Pythagoras we can find the length of the hypotenuse by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = \sqrt{9+16} = \sqrt{25} = 5&lt;/math&gt;.

And thus, the length of the hypotenuse is thus the modulus of the complex number, and it is 5 for 3+4i.

===== Generalization =====
If ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y''i, |''z''| is clearly &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2+y^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;|z|=\sqrt{\mathrm{Re}(z)^2+\mathrm{Im}(z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Calculating the argument ====
We have the same triangle as we had in calculating the modulus. Remember from trigonometry that tan &amp;theta; is the ratio of the height over the base. So, for 3 + 4i, we have tan &amp;theta; = 4/3, and thus &amp;theta; = arctan 4/3 = 0.9...

With complex numbers, we always take two things:
* the argument must be in radians
* the argument lies in the interval [-&amp;pi;,&amp;pi;], and we always adjust the angle so it does.

Note that arg 0 is undefined.

==== Generalization ====
If ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y''i, arg ''z'' is clearly arctan (y/x), or, equivalently, arg ''z'' = arctan (Im(''z'')/Re(''z'')).

=== The polar form ===
We are now able to calculate the modulus and argument of a complex number, where these two numbers are able to uniquely describe every number in the Argand plane. 

Using these two characteristics of complex numbers, we are now able to formulate a new way of writing these numbers. 

Note that in the above diagram, we obtain a triangle that describes the complex number 3 + 4i. Clearly, we can do this for all complex numbers in the Argand plane (except for 0). 

To simplify our work, let us look at numbers in the circle of unit length equidistant from 0. From trigonometry, we can parameterize all the points on a circle in the Cartesian plane by (cos &amp;theta;, sin &amp;theta;). In complex number notation we can say that all numbers on this unit circle are in the form cos &amp;theta;+i sin &amp;theta;. 

This works well on the unit circle, but how does this generalize to describing ''all'' numbers on the plane? We simply make the circle larger or smaller to encompass the number; this is done by multiplying by the modulus.

So then, we obtain the polar form ''r''(cos &amp;theta; + i sin &amp;theta;) = ''z'', where ''r'' is the modulus.

== Euler's formula ==
A very significant result in the area of complex numbers is Euler's formula. It basically asserts that
: ''r''e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; = r (cos &amp;theta; + i sin &amp;theta;)

This statement can be verified through a rearrangement of the [[Wikipedia:Taylor series|Taylor Series]] of the cosine and sine functions.

Note that conjugate complex numbers have an opposing argument. 2e&lt;sup&gt;2i&lt;/sup&gt; and 2e&lt;sup&gt;-2i&lt;/sup&gt; are conjugate pairs.

=== Proofs ===
====Using Taylor series====
Here is a proof of Euler's formula using [[Wikipedia:Taylor series|Taylor Series]] expansions
as well as basic facts about the powers of ''i'':

: &lt;math&gt;
  i^0 = 1, \ i^1 = i, \ i^2 = -1, \ i^3 = -i, \ i^4 = 1, \ i^5 = i, \ i^6 = -1, \ i^7 = -i, \ i^8 = 1, \dots
&lt;/math&gt;

The functions ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, cos(''x'') and sin(''x'') (assuming ''x'' is real) can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt; e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sin x = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

and for complex ''z'' we ''define'' each of these function by the above series, replacing ''x'' with ''iz''. This is possible because the radius of convergence of each series is infinite. We then find that

: &lt;math&gt;e^{iz} = 1 + iz + \frac{(iz)^2}{2!} + \frac{(iz)^3}{3!} + \frac{(iz)^4}{4!} + \frac{(iz)^5}{5!} + \frac{(iz)^6}{6!} + \frac{(iz)^7}{7!} + \frac{(iz)^8}{8!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;= 1 + iz - \frac{z^2}{2!} - \frac{iz^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \frac{iz^5}{5!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} - \frac{iz^7}{7!} + \frac{z^8}{8!} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;= \left( 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} + \frac{z^8}{8!} + \cdots \right) + i\left( z - \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \frac{z^7}{7!} + \cdots \right) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;= \cos (z) + i\sin (z) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent. Taking ''z'' = ''x'' to be a real number, gives the original identity as Euler discovered it.&lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

====Using calculus====
Define the complex number ''z'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;z=\cos x + i\sin x \,&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating ''z'' with respect to ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=-\sin x + i\cos x&lt;/math&gt;
Using the fact that ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dz}{dx}=i^2\sin x + i\cos x=i(\cos x + i\sin x)=zi&lt;/math&gt;
Separating variables and integrating both sides:
:&lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{z}\,dz=\int i\,dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln z=xi + C\,&lt;/math&gt;
where C is the constant of integration. To finish the proof we have to argue that it is zero. This is easily done by substituting x = 0.
:&lt;math&gt;\ln z = C\,&lt;/math&gt;
But z is just equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;\ z = \cos x + i\sin x = \cos 0 + i \sin 0 = 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt;\ln 1 = C\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ C = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

So now we just exponentiate
:&lt;math&gt;\ \ln z = xi\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ e^{\ln z} = e^{xi}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ z = e^{xi}\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ e^{xi} = \cos x + i\sin x\,\square&lt;/math&gt;

=== Corollaries ===
A number of significant results follow as corollaries to Euler's result.


=== de Moivre's theorem ===
De Moivre's theorem is useful in calculating powers of complex numbers. It states that
:  (''r'' (cos &amp;theta; + i sin &amp;theta;))&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ( cos ''n''&amp;theta; + i sin ''n''&amp;theta;)

This follows clearly (from the laws of exponents) if we rewrite the theorem in the form
: (''r''e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;=''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;e&lt;sup&gt;i''n''&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Equivalent trigonometric forms ===
From the cosine/sine form of the complex number, we can rewrite the cosine and sine function in terms of exponentials.
: cos &amp;theta; = 1/2 (e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;-i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt;)
: sin &amp;theta; = 1/(2i) (e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; - e&lt;sup&gt;-i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt;)

=== Relation of e, &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, i, 1, and 0 ===
By substituting &amp;pi; into the formula, we obtain the following result:

&lt;math&gt;e^{\pi i}+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

The actual mathematical relevance of this equation is actually very little.  It is known more for its relation of the many branches of mathematics:  e comes from calculus, &amp;pi; from geometry, i comes from algebra, 1 is the multiplicative identity, and 0 is the additive identity.  It is also known for its simple mathematical aesthetic.

== Forming trigonometric identities ==
The aforementioned equivalent trigonometric forms, combined with the Binomial theorem, allow us to create some trigonometric identities that would be difficult to form in any other way. These identities can be used to simplify integral problems.

=== Cosine/sine powers ===
How can we simplify, say, (cos ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;?

Let us look at a simple example for motivation.
First, rewrite as
:(cos ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = (1/2 (e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;+e&lt;sup&gt;-ix&lt;/sup&gt;))&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; =
1/2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;+e&lt;sup&gt;-ix&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

By the Binomial theorem, 
:(''a''+''b'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=''a''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 5''a''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' + 10''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; +  5''ab''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

Replacing a with e&lt;sup&gt;i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/2 and b with e&lt;sup&gt;-i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/2, we obtain 
:10e&lt;sup&gt;-i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/32+10e&lt;sup&gt;i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/32+5e&lt;sup&gt;3i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/32+5e&lt;sup&gt;-3i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/32+e&lt;sup&gt;5i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/32+e&lt;sup&gt;-5i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;/32=
:(5/16)(e&lt;sup&gt;-i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;+e&lt;sup&gt;i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;)+(5/32)(e&lt;sup&gt;3i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;+e&lt;sup&gt;-3i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;)+(1/32)(e&lt;sup&gt;5i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;+e&lt;sup&gt;-5i''x''&lt;/sup&gt;)=
:(5/16)(2 cos ''x'')+(5/32)(2 cos 3''x'')+(1/32)(2 cos 5''x'')=
:'''(5/8) cos ''x''+(5/16) cos 3''x''+(1/16) cos 5''x''=(cos ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'''

==== Procedure====
We can summarize from the above example the general procedure:
To simplify an expression in the form:
* cos(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;
* sin(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;

the procedure is:
* write cos(''x'') or sin(''x'') in the exponential form, all to the power of ''k''
* expand using the Binomial theorem
* collect conjugate pairs
* write back from the exponential form into the trigonometric form

=== Cosine/sine multiples ===
We can also form identities in the form:
* cos(''kx'')
* sin(''kx'').

Let's look at another example to see how it's done.

==== Example ====
Let's expand sin(3''x''). 

Recall de Moivre's theorem stating
: (cos(''x'')+i sin(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = cos(3''x'')+i sin (3''x'')

We will use this fact to expand out the left side. For ease of manipulation, it may be easier to let ''c'' = cos(''x''), and ''s''=sin(''x''). Then use the Binomial theorem again to expand out:
: (''c''+i''s'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=''c''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 3i ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''s'' - 3''cs''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - i ''s''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
Collect real and imaginary parts
: (''c''+i''s'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=''c''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  - 3''cs''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + i(3''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''s'' - ''s''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

Now, this is of course equal to cos(3''x'')+i sin (3''x''). So, substituting back cos(''x'') for ''c'' and similarly for sin(''x''), we can equate real and imaginary parts, and we get
: sin(3''x'')=3 cos(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;sin(''x'') - sin(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
and we get
: cos(3''x'')=cos(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  - 3 cos(''x'')sin(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
for free.

NB: In the cosine expansion, one could write sin(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as 1-cos(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to obtain a formula consisting completely of cosines. (analogously one could write the sine expansion using only sines)

&lt;!--

==== Problem set ==== 
Given the above rules, answer the following (answers follow to even-numbered questions).
# Prove that ''r''e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r''e&lt;sup&gt;-i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; are conjugate pairs.
# Write ''z''=1+1i in the form ''r'' (cos &amp;theta; + i sin &amp;theta;)
## Thus calculate ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by de Moivre's theorem.
# Write &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt; in the exponential form.
## Thus calculate ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by de Moivre's theorem.

Love your HSE book!  Hope you update it soon :)

Hey :) I changed your modifications to [[Discrete mathematics]] back, sorry: there  is already a link to intro logic. I'm trying to keep the intro section to have info that will give one the basics of the topics, and the upper level section to be the ideas and concepts that build on the intro topics.

Hope you don't mind :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 02:50, 13 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Question for you on [[Talk:HSE Primes]] [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:08, 20 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Some helpful hints

hi xiaodai,

i've been on wikipedia for a while, but only had a look at wikibooks since i need to code [[Basic Polish language course]] into my carbon-based processor/soft-disk ;)

Looks good, and nice to see the HSE stuff you're doing. Say hi to terry gagen for me. :)

== HSE! ==

Love your HSE book, thanks so much! I usually feel as if I have exactly enough hints to think about something for a few minutes, and then think ''Eureka''! ;)

For the programming section, I think I could help (see my [http://www.livejournal.com/users/r3m0t/ Livejournal]) if you want Lisp/Scheme (go Scheme!). [[w:Haskell|Haskell]] is the only other mathematically-oriented language I can think of - are you planning on using that?

Oh - and aren't Venn diagrams best suited in the logic category? [[User:R3m0t|R3m0t]] 17:35, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I'm glad you liked HSE so much! I'm trying my best to do a good job, but as so often is the case in my first drafts, glaring spelling and grammar mistakes seem to plague my work. Lucky you pick them out for me.

I do not know enough about Lisp, Prolog, Scheme (never heard of it) or Haskell to decide whether they are suitable for high school students or not. If you think a coherent course can be taught using one of those languages, then please go ahead! Create a new chapte if you have to. But I was thinking of teaching a more conventional language like Pascal. Anyway we are not just writing about programming, but mathematical programming. Haskell seems to be a good choice, but where can I find a good programming IDE/compiler for it? I simply haven't done the research.

And nice to meet you. How do you do?[[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo Jia Dai]]

: Just being a stickybeak, but
:* If you want Haskell, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler is an excellent Windows/*nix based Haskell interpreter and compiler environment. Some systems may only run the Hugs system. I'm about to go to bed so I can't give you an exact link but I'm sure you can google it :)
:* Haskell is a good choice of language for pure, functional programming. It's not quite the best language for exploring mathematical concepts in since it's a strict functional programming language. You may want to concentrate on looking at programming in common Computer Algebra systems such as Maple and Mathematica (I do know both systems, but Mathematica's better) for stuff like numerical approximations and all that funky jazz. Haskell is nice for exploring recursion, but more conventional looping structures are easier taught in some other language. With teaching Mathematica (You guys should still have it at Sydney, right?) you get the best of both worlds, really.

::''Think free. Learn free.'' is the Wikibooks concept, but Mathematica seems to be a commercial thing. I wouldn't encourage people to use a propriety language on Wikibooks.

::: It doesn't mean we can't teach non-free software, at all. And it's not exactly proprietary software either - it's well used. I merely mention this to Xiaodai as an option. In any case, are we to forbid the creation of a Windows guidebook here because it is non-free software? We cannot be bigoted on the forbidding of teaching ''just'' because of its origins now, can we? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:43, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::::A Windows guidebook would be created for users of Windows who wish to (manipulate/configure/whatever) their installation. By teaching Mathematica in a textbook not created ''specifically'' for teaching Mathematica, that is encouraging people to use Mathematica. Lisp, Scheme, Ruby, Haskell seem different to me - it is hard to make any money out of them (plenty of compilers or interpreters are free already) so it's offering a choice of compiler, etc. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 21:55, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Well I read it, it reads ok, except i think the command line and how to issue command part should be clarified upon. I think it's pretty confusing for someone who is not highly computer-literate.[[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo Jia Dai]]

== HSE is great ==

Your HSE book is great, it's easy enough to read at a reasonable speed and difficult enough to be challenging. I tried to read several real books but those weren't as fun to read because I had to stop regularly to check if I understood everything correctly. So, thanks for the book.[[User:mmartin|mmartin]]

:Thanks, but you may only have read the first chapter, the rest are still horrible. I think they need huge improvements. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 22:40, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Attention! Attention! ==

I would like to inform you that I've come up with a alternative solution(actually the final answer is less complex) to question 4 in logic-problem set.
[[Talk:HSE_PS_Logic|Click here to go to the talk page to see the solution]]

And also, Nov 21st is coming soon, and does that means editing work are going to be restarted to full strength soon?

:Yeah, uni holidays starts now and i will do more editing than during the semester. What does &quot;more&quot; mean? I'm uncertainty. See how it goes. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 09:10, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Concerning logic puzzle item deletion ==

Concerning the 5th question in logic-problem set page...
Yes, I do agree this question is out of ability for most people, but I think may be at least you put it in the logic puzzle page? This way it has a place to rest.
(And consider I spent some good time thinking hard and finally managed to come up with a solution--when I wrote and submitted it, the system kicked me out so the history page didn't log down it was me who submitted the solution)

:Hmmm, i mean this problem is a bit out of reach. Thanks for contribution and i am sorry that i have to take it down. But the question is just so out of left field and you dont necessarily have to use the techniques taught in the chapter to do it properly. So i need to delete it. Congratulations on being able to solve the problem though, it's a tough one, you must be a genius. ^__^ I will put it in puzzle's page then [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 12:42, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Nominated! ==

I'm excited to see that the book &quot;High School Extensions&quot; get nominated for march book of the month. Let's hope we'll win!

Also, I would like to inform you that I've written a starter-a stub, for the discrete probability part. I want to learn some more about it. And I've came up with how to write the starting, so leave that to me as I'm having holiday now and have more free time to do it. Thanks.
--[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 13:10, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/5 Houses]] ==

I have just cleaned up the page a bit.  However, the puzzle as it stands is impossible, so obviously you made a mistake/omission in copying it.  Please see [[Talk:5 Houses]] and then make corrections.

Also, the point of puzzle books is to challenge the reader.  By putting the solution on the puzzle page, you are depriving the reader of this challenge, in which case what was the point of giving us the puzzle in the first place?  I have cut and pasted it onto a solution page.  I haven't cleaned the solution up, since I for one would like to have a go at the puzzle once it is complete. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 17:52, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Well, I'm the one who wrote the solution, and Xiaodai just copied it to the puzzle page, so at most he is responsible for copying it to a wrong place.

As for the content of the solution, I looked at it and remembered that my school's maths club did mentioned this problem on club meeting, and I remember that the detail are different. I quickily find out that the question itself has mistake, and I just searched and choose a random complete version of that question.

Anyway, the task to do now is to find out who wrote the question in the first place, and which version of the question should we use.--[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 12:30, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Vote too late ==

Hi Xiaodai. I just want to let you know that your vote for the book of the month for Mandarin Chinese was 37 minutes after the deadline, and has not been counted therefore. I encourage you to vote again in the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month/April 2005 voting|current voting for April 2005]], as soon as possible, since early votes seem to have a steering effect. Thanks, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 13:37, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Withdrawing adminship request ==

I'm surprised that you withdrew your request for adminship after waiting only five days. You had two votes of support already (you only need four), and they do say that the process could take months. I've been waiting for over a month, and that's not unusual (things move pretty slowly in Wikibooks).

Greetings! I noticed your edit summary on your most recent contribution: &quot;i will have the time and energy to start editing again soon. hopefully improve the quality by heaps. so it's more deserving of a recognition.&quot; Currently images without proper licensing and sourcing are being deleted. I noticed that many of yours are without a license or a source. If you would consider licensing them under an appropriate license (GFDL, PD, CC, BSD) and a source (yourself, I assume) I would greatly appreciate it. I noticed that many of your images are still be used! It would be great to be able to keep them.

And don't worry: you don't have to go through every image description page and tag it manually. You may ask an administrator (try [[User:Whiteknight]]) to run a bot to tag them all simultaneously.

Again, thank you very much, and welcome back! --[[User:Iamunknown|Iamunknown]] 03:48, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

== Help! ==

Hi Zhuo Jia Dai]]. 

I'm probably not doing this right, but I can't see any other way.  I'm new to Wikibooks and am just trying to send you a message.

I would like to help with your High School Mathematics Extensions with an addition, or possible follow-up, to your Set Theory and Infinite Processes.  I have read your Chapter and like it (and have a couple of suggestions).

Here is the introduction to a ten-page sample I've written:
&quot;Cantor’s diagonal method is elegant, powerful, and simple.  It has been the source of fundamental and fruitful theorems as well as devastating, and ultimately, fruitful paradoxes.  These proofs and paradoxes are almost always presented using an indirect argument.  They can be presented directly.  The direct approach, I believe, (1) is easier to understand, (2) unifies the proofs and paradoxes by exhibiting a single strategy, (3) shows Russell’s paradox to be the (obvious?) ultimate, set theoretic application of the method, and (4) is extendable to some of the semantic paradoxes.&quot;

If you're interested, please contact me; I just registered with Wikibooks, and maybe that allows you to contact me, but I wouldn't know where to look for your response.  So please email me at TomSchaffter@Mac.Com.

Respondens Simon dixit: &quot;Aestimo quia is, cui plus donavit&quot;. At ille dixit ei: &quot;Recte iudicasti&quot;. Et conversus ad mulierem, dixit Simoni: &quot;Vides hanc mulierem? Intravi in domum tuam: aquam pedibus meis non dedisti; haec autem lacrimis rigavit pedes meos et capillis suis tersit. Osculum mihi non dedisti haec autem, ex quo intravi non cessavit osculari pedes meos. Oleo caput meum non unxisti; haec autem unguento unxit pedes meos. Propter quod dico tibi: Remissa sunt peccata eius multa, quoniam dilexit multrum: cui autem minus dimittitur, minus diligit.&quot; Dixit autem ad illam: &quot;Remissa sunt peccata tua&quot;. Et coeperunt, qui simul accumbebant, dicere intra se: &quot;quis est hic, qui etiam peccata dimittit?&quot;. Dixit autem ad mulierem: Fides tua te salvam fecit; vade in pace!&quot;.

Ubi ex ea turri, quae circum essent opera, tueri se posse confisi sunt, musculum pedes LX longum ex turrim murumque perducerent, facere instituerunt cuius musculi haec erat forma. Duae primum trabes in solo aeque longae distantes inter se pedes IIII collocantur, inque eis columellae pedum in altitudinem V defiguntur. Has inter se capreolis molli fastigio coniungunt, ubi tigna, quae musculi tegendi causa ponant, collocentur. Eo super tigna bipedalia iniciunt eaque laminis clabisque religant. Ad extremum musculi tectum trabesque extremas quadratas regulas IIII patentes digitos difigunt, quae lateres, qui super musculo struantur, contineant. Ita fastigato atque ordinatim structo, ut trabes erant in capreolis collocatae. lateribus lutoque musculus, ut ab igni, qui ex muro iaceretur, tutus esset, contegitus. Super lateres coria inducuuntur, ne canalibus aqua immissa lateres diluere posset. Coria autem, ne rursus igni ac laidibus corrumpantur, centonibus conteguntur. Hoc opus omne tectum vineis ad ipsam turrim perficiunt subitoque inoopinantibus hostibus machinatione navali, phalangis subiectis, ad turrim hostium admovent, ut aedificio iungatur.

Quo malo perterriti subito oppiindani saxa quam maxima possunt vectibus promovent praecipitataque muro in musculum devolvunt. Ictum firmitas materiae sustinet, et quicquid incidit fastigio musculi elabitur. Id ubi vident, mutant consilium: cupas taeda ac pice refertas incendunt easque de muro musculum devolvunt. Involutae labuntur, delapsae ab lateribus longuriis furcisque abopere removentur. Interim sub musculo milites vectibus infima saxa turris hostium, quibus fundamenta continebantur convellunt. Musculus ex turri latericia a nostris telis tormentisque defenditur; hostes ex muro  ac turribus submoventur: non datur libera muro defendendi facultas. Compluribus iam lapidibus ex ea, quae suberat, turri subductis repentina ruina pars eius turrisconcidit, pars reliqua consequens procumbebat: cum hostes urbis direptione perterriti inermes cum infulis se porta foras universi proripiunt, ad legatos atque exercitum supplices manus tendunt.

:No, but they deserve mention. This chapter is pre-Jamestown, not much is happening in NA. Also you should have a clear idea of what's happening in other areas of the new world and europe, for perspective. There might even be a sub-chapter devoted to european history at this time, because it's so important in the formation of the US. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 01:46, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Not much happening! Remember that there were Spanish settlements in New Mexico (often confused with Mexico, but it was occupied by U.S. forces and clained by the U.S. in 1848) by 1598 under the leadership of Don Juan de Oñate, a few years before Jamestown was settled.  Also long before that, the Chaconian culture which lead to the Pueblo Culture was in the Southwest as well.  The Aztec and other cultures of the Valley of Mexico traded with the Chaconians, and they may have lived in the Southwest (Atzlan)  before their journey to the valley of Mexico, but other than that they weren't part of U.S. History.

==Henry VIII and the Church of England==

I am not sure I like the section here.  The Anglican church was intended as a Catholic church that the King rather than Pope controlled. It was not intended to incorporate any of the protestant doctrines around at the time.  I have not edited this as I am unsure as to what extent and when the Anglican church (C of E) became protestant (or viewed itself as such) thereafter.

One of the great failures of the American education system is to make Colombus, a man who slaughtered the native people of the US out of greed for gold, look like a hero.

You will have already studied series and parallel circuits before, so should be familiar with what a series and parallel circuit is and their basic properties.But in this module we will be looking at them in a little more detail. We will apply Ohm's law to see how we can work out the resistance of a whole circuit that is made up of a large number of components. Before we begin You might want to try some revision questions. Follow the link then come back here when you are finished.
 [[GCSE Science/Parallel and series circuits revision questions]].

==Resistors in Series Circuits==
As we know, 'in a series circuit the current in all parts of the circuit is the same and the current has a one way system'''. The current depends on the applied voltage and the number of and nature of other components in the circuit. 

Consider two resistors in a series circuit with a battery. As you might expect the total resistance in this circuit is higher than the resistance of each resistor, because the battery has to &quot;push&quot; the charge through both resistors one after the other. So the total potential difference of the supply is &quot;shared&quot; between the two resistors.

[[Image:2_resistors_in_series.png]]

Think about what is happening to the current as it flows around the circuit. There are no branches, nowhere for the electric current to escape to, so obviously the same current must flow through both resistors. Let's call this current I.

The total resistance for the whole circuit is very simple. It's just R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; plus R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

=== Formula for resistance of two resistors in series ===
R&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

'''The total resistance in a series circuit is the sum of the resistances of all the components.'''

Using this formula we can calculate the voltage across each resistor.
But it could depend on how many resistors there are.

===Example: Calculating voltages in a series circuit===

&lt;u&gt;Question:&lt;/u&gt;

Suppose R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;Omega; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 4&amp;Omega;. If the battery supplies 2.5 Volts what is the voltage across each resistor.

'''Answer:'''

First use the total resistance of the circuit to work out how much current is flowing through the circuit.

Step 1: Work out the total resistance

*identify formula:         R&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
*insert numbers and units   R&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;Omega; + 4&amp;Omega; = 5&amp;Omega;

Step 2: Use Ohms's law to calculate the current in the circuit. Decide which resistance to use.

*identify formula(using the triangle):         I = V / R (Ohms's law)
*decide which resistance to use:                Use R&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;; so formula becomes I = V / R&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt;
*insert numbers and units                       I amps = 2.5V / 5&amp;Omega; = 0.5A

Now we know how much current is flowing through both resistors, we can work out the voltage across each resistor.

Step 3: Use Ohm's law to calculate the voltage across '''each''' resistor:

*identify formula(using the triangle):         V = I x R
*insert numbers for resistor 1:                 V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; volts = 0.5A x 1&amp;Omega; = '''0.5 Volts'''
*insert numbers for resistor 2:                 V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; volts = 0.5A x 4&amp;Omega; = '''2.0 Volts'''

===Practice questions===
*'''Q1)'''Let R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;Omega;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 3&amp;Omega;, and V=5V what is the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ?
*'''Q2''')Let R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3&amp;Omega;, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 3&amp;Omega;, and V=6V what is the voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ?
*'''Q3)'''Let R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&amp;Omega;,  V=5V  and I= 1A what is the value of resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ?

==Resistors in Parallel Circuits==
[[Image:2_resistors_in_parallel.png ]]

Parallel circuits are a bit more complicated than series circuits, because they contain a branch - the electric current will take more than one route. Look at the diagram. At point X the current splits into 2 paths, and flows through both resistor R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and resistor R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It may not split in equal amounts.
When several(two or more) components are connected in parallel branches, '''the voltage (potential difference) across each parallel branch is the same'''. And this is the same as the voltage across the battery.

The current through each component is the same as if it were the only component present. '''So the total current flowing through the battery is the sum of the currents flowing through each branch.''' Here is the '''formula for the currents flowing through a parallel circuit.''' 

I&lt;sub&gt;Main&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Because the voltage is the same for all branches, the branch with the lowest resistance has the highest current flowing through it.
Because there are more paths for the charge to flow along, '''the total resistance is less than either of the two paths on their own.''' And therefore (with the same battery) the current is bigger.

To find out the resistance of the whole circuit , we can't just add together the resistors as we did in the series circuit, we have to apply Ohm's law to each branch of the circuit.

Imagine we replaced the resistors with bulbs. You should now be able to answer the following questions from your previous knowledge.

*'''Q4)'''You disconnect one of the bulbs, does the other stay lit?
*'''Q5)'''You reconnect the disconnected bulb, does the other dim or brighten?
*'''Q6)'''Would it be reasonable to say &quot;each branch of the circuit behaves as if the other branch weren't there&quot; ?

If you answered the above questions correctly you should find this next section easy!
===Example: Calculating the resistance of several resistors in parallel===
It's best to break the process down into a number of simple steps. Some books may give you a formula to use, but you shouldn't use any formula without understanding where it comes from (otherwise you are likely to remember it incorrectly or apply it inappropriately).By using a simple step by step method instead you can get a feel for why it works, and you will be far less likely to make a mistake in the exam.

'''Step1''' considering each branch on its own, as if the other branch didn't exist use Ohm's law to work out the current flowing through each branch.

'''Step 2''' Add the currents together to find out the total amount of current flowing through the whole circuit.

'''Step 3''' Apply Ohm's law again to work out the total resistance of the circuit.

===Example===
Suppose V=2V R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;Omega; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;= 1&amp;Omega;. 

Applying Ohm's law to the branch containing R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; gives

I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=V/R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =2/1 =2A 

Applying Ohm's law to the branch containing R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives
I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=V/R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =2/1 =2A

Total current = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = 4A

Applying Ohm's law again, to the whole circuit.

R&lt;sub&gt;Total&lt;/sub&gt; =V/I&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 2/4 =0.5&amp;Omega;

Notice that the resistance of the whole circuit is ''lower'' than the resistance of either branch!

===Practice questions===
*'''Q7)''' Calculate the resistance of the above pair of resistors ''if'' they had been in ''series'' rather than parallel.
*'''Q8)''' A parallel circuit has two resistors, one is 2&amp;Omega; the other is 3&amp;Omega;. The voltage is 6V. What is the total resistance of the circuit?
*'''Q9)''' Three resistors are in parallel (three separate branches) their resistances are 2&amp;Omega;, 2&amp;Omega; and 3&amp;Omega;. The voltage is 6V. What is the resistance of the circuit?

| '''Summary'''
|-
| ''Series Circuits'' The current through each component is the same. To find the total resistance just add the individual ones up. The total voltage is the sum of the voltages across the individual components.
|-
| ''Parallel Circuits'' Each branch acts as if the other branches were not there. The Voltage across each branch is the same. Ohm's law can be applied to each branch separately. The total current, is just the sum of the currents through each branch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Further Discussion ==
The questions posed in '''Chapter 1. Introduction''' are discussed further on this page. Remember, some questions are intended to be thought-provoking and more than one answer may be &quot;correct&quot;. Users are encouraged to expand upon the discussions here.   

 1-1. ''Do you think the ''scientific method'' is something only a scientist would use?''

The ''scientific method'' is something that is taught, so we might question just how natural or intuitive an approach it is. Think about how you discovered answers to interesting or difficult questions as a child. You might have first sought the opinion of an expert (like your dad, right?). That is the first step used by a scientist as well.  Scientists learn to seek the expertise of others that have asked similar questions and come up with at least partial answers. This does not require contacting other scientists; more often it is a matter of becoming very familiar with the literature (the written and published record) on the subject of interest. Scientists rarely formulate ''hypotheses'' without first learning all they can about a subject from what has been published already. In effect, they learn how to put their question at the very forefront of knowledge about a subject.  There are so many questions to be answered in science that no one would want to expend a lot of energy asking and answering questions to mysteries already solved. Of course learning is different.  Asking questions and seeking answers from books, journals, and other sources is a valid approach to this first step of learning, and one you and any scientist would have in common.

Formulating a proper question or a hypothesis is perhaps the most difficult step. Recall that the '''hypothesis''' is not really a question but an answer.  The question is the wonder about something; the hypothesis is a testable answer to that question. It is not THE answer, just a reasonable one posed in such a way that an experiment can be conducted to ascertain its validity.  You may see this step expressed as ''making a guess''; but consider that after he or she has completed the step described above&amp;mdash;learning everything written about a subject&amp;mdash;the scientist is in a position to make a pretty good guess. This step could be difficult for the scientist because he or she must have in mind one or more experiments to conduct to test the hypothesis. This step may be difficult for you for the same reason, and because it probably feels odd to answer a question before investigating it. The hypothesis step is included in the scientific method to promote intellectual honesty and to allow others to better understand a scientist's reasoning when reviewing what was done and how a conclusion was reached.
Compare these scenarios:
:&lt;tt&gt;Conversation over a radio from technician defusing a bomb&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;ndash;

::''OK. I have the device out. There are two black wires and a red one to the timer. Let me try this''...&lt;BOOM&gt;!

&lt;center&gt;Or&lt;/center&gt;

::''OK. I have the device out. There are two black wires and a red one to the timer.''
::''I think the red one controls the detonation'' (Hypothesis: An intact red wire is necessary for detonation)
::''I am going to cut the red wire'' (Testing the hypothesis)
::''oops'' &lt;BOOM&gt;

In the absence of any further report from this technician, only the second procedure provides any information to the next technician faced with a second, similar bomb. He at least knows what not to do! Note also that the hypothesis is '''falsifiable'''. Testing demonstrated whether an intact red wire was or was not needed for detonation (apparently it controlled the undetonated state).  Framing the hypothesis thusly: ''the red wire serves a purpose'' cannot be proven false; what test could you devise to satisfactorily demonstrate it has no purpose? It may in fact have no purpose (not in the example above), but eliminating by testing every possible purpose under the sun is an unsatisfactory approach.

  1-3. When you catch a cold a virus has infected your body.
       ''Why do you think there is reason to question whether the virus is living or not?''
       After all, if you took some ricinin (a plant poison), you would get very sick,
       but no one would suggest the toxin were alive or that the plant had entered your body.

Ricinin is an alkaloid and, along with the toxalbumin ricin (a plant protein), constitute extremely toxic substances found in the seeds of the castor bean (''Ricinus communis'')  plant. Were you to ingest several raw seeds, you would experience nausea and vomiting, stomachache, bloody diarrhea, headache, cold sweat, sleepiness, disorientation, fever, shortage of breath, seizures, and possibly collapse and death. While there are a number of different ways that a virus could enter your body, the most common would be breathing in virus particles while in the presence of an infected person. The outcome of such exposure could be pretty much the same as that described for ricinin ingestion, depending upon the type of virus and your body's ability to respond appropriately to the &quot;infection&quot;.  Or, perhaps the infection you &quot;catch&quot; is cholera&amp;mdash;the ''Vibrio cholerae'' bacterium. These bacteria are typically ingested in drinking water contaminated by improper sanitation.  Again, you might display many of the same symptoms described, including the really unpleasant part about dying. The point here is to consider which of these problems constitute an &quot;attack&quot; by another living organism and which represent simply a poisoning of your living body by a non-living chemical.  You cannot use the resulting symptoms as an indication because....; well, because they are just symptoms: what you &quot;feel&quot; as your body reacts to the chemical or biological attack.

In the case of ricin, this protein inhibits protein synthesis within the cells of the body.  Organ damage results. ''Vibrio cholerae'' in the body produce a chemical that results in a loss of fluid and salts across the lining of the gut. The resulting diarrhea allows the bacterium to spread to other people under unsanitary conditions, and can result in death due to dehydration (an inability to retain water). So both the non-living chemical and the living bacterium cause illness by toxicity to our bodily functions.

You should recognize one pretty significant difference between an illness caused by a living organisms and an illness caused by a non-living, but toxic, chemical.  In the latter case, the severity of our symptoms will be pretty much dependent upon the dose of toxin we ingest. There will be just so much chemical entering the body, and the damage should be proportional to that amount.  In the case of the bacterium, something like a million cells need to be ingested to result in an infection, but once established, the living organism is a tiny factory that cranks out toxin and reproduces more identical factories (more cells) that themselves produce toxin.  So the dose of toxin we get from the bacterial infection is not obviously limited.  Living cells metabolize (break down and produce chemicals for various purposes) and reproduce (increase their numbers).  

In essence, this is what is meant by an '''infection''': another life form has taken up residence in or on our body, and is utilizing organic substances that are a part of our life processes to carry out its life functions, to further its existence and numbers. In the case of chlorea, the bacterium has some nasty habits that make us very ill; but there are a number of other bacteria (''Escherichi coli'', for example) that live in perfect harmony within or digetive tract and help us digest food.  So not every &quot;alien&quot; that invades our body necessarily causes an infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Articles of Confederation ==

''(The following text is taken from Wikipedia)''

The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''', also the '''Articles of Confederation''', was the governing constitution of the alliance of thirteen independent and sovereign states styled &quot;United States of America.&quot; The Article's ratification (proposed in 1777) was completed in 1782, legally uniting the states by compact into the &quot;United States of America&quot; as a union with a confederation government. Under the Articles (and the succeeding Constitution) the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically deputed to the confederation. 

The final draft of the Articles was written in the summer of 1777 and adopted by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777 in York, Pennsylvania after a year of debate. In practice the final draft of the Articles served as the ''de facto'' system of government used by the Congress (&quot;the United States in Congress assembled&quot;) until it became ''de jure'' by final ratification on March 1, 1781; at which point Congress became the Congress of the Confederation. The ''Articles'' set the rules for operations of the &quot;United States&quot; confederation. The confederation was capable of making war, negotiating diplomatic agreements, and resolving issues regarding the western territories; it could mint coins and borrow inside and outside the United States. An important element of the Articles was that Article XIII stipulated that &quot;their provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state&quot; and &quot;the Union shall be perpetual.&quot; This article was put to the test in the American Civil War.

The Articles were created by the chosen representatives of the states in the Second Continental Congress out of a perceived need to have &quot;a plan of confederacy for securing the freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the United States.&quot; Although serving a crucial role in the attainment of nationhood for the thirteen states, a group of reformers, known as &quot;federalists&quot;, felt that the Articles lacked the necessary provisions for a sufficiently effective government. Fundamentally, a federation was sought to replace the confederation. The key criticism by those who favored a more powerful central state (i.e. the federalists) was that the government (i.e. the Congress of the Confederation) lacked taxing authority; it had to request funds from the states. Another criticism of the Articles was that they did not strike the right balance between large and small states in the legislative decision making process. Due to its ''one-state, one-vote'' plank, the larger states were expected to contribute more but had only one vote. The Articles were replaced by the United States Constitution on June 21, 1788. 

===Background===
The political push for the colonies to increase cooperation began in the French and Indian Wars in the mid 1750s.  The opening of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 induced the various states to cooperate in seceding from the British Empire. The Second Continental Congress starting 1775 acted as the confederation organ that ran the war. Congress presented the Articles for enactment by the states in 1777, while prosecuting the American Revolutionary war against the Kingdom of Great Britain.

===Ratification===
Congress began to move for ratification of the Articles in 1777:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The articles can always be candidly reviewed under a sense of the difficulty of combining in one general system the various sentiments and interests of a continent divided into so many sovereign and independent communities, under a conviction of the absolute necessity of uniting all our councils and all our strength, to maintain and defend our common liberties...''&lt;ref name=ratificationletter&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc00941)) Monday, November 17 1777], Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774–1789. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lawhome.html A Century of Lawmaking, 1774-1873]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The document could not become officially effective until it was ratified by all of the thirteen colonies. The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Maryland was the last holdout; it refused to go along until Virginia and New York agreed to cede their claims in the Ohio River valley. A little over three years passed before Maryland's ratification on March 1, 1781.

===Article summaries===
Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people, the two documents were very different. The original five-paged Articles contained thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section.  The following list contains short summaries of each of the thirteen articles.

#Establishes the name of the confederation as &quot;The United States of America.&quot;
#Asserts the precedence of the separate states over the confederation government, i.e. &quot;Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.&quot;
#Establishes the United States as a league of states united &quot;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&quot;
#Establishes freedom of movement&amp;ndash;anyone can pass freely between states, excluding &quot;paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice.&quot; All people are entitled to the rights established by the state into which he travels. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be extradited to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.
#Allocates one vote in the Congress of the Confederation (United States in Congress Assembled) to each state, which was entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress were appointed by state legislatures; individuals could not serve more than three out of any six years.
#Only the central government is allowed to conduct foreign relations and to declare war.  No states may have navies or standing armies, or engage in war, without permission of Congress (although the state militias are encouraged).  
#When an army is raised for common defense, colonels and military ranks below colonel will be named by the state legislatures.
#Expenditures by the United States will be paid by funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states based on the real property values of each.
#Defines the powers of the central government: to declare war, to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states. 
#Defines a Committee of the States to be a government when Congress is not in session.
#Requires nine states to approve the admission of a new state into the confederacy; pre-approves Canada, if it applies for membership.
#Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the Articles.
#Declares that the Articles are perpetual, and can only be altered by approval of Congress with ratification by ''all'' the state legislatures.

Still at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, the colonists were reluctant to establish another powerful national government. Jealously guarding their new independence, members of the Continental Congress created a loosely-structured unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. While calling on Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, the Articles of Confederation provided no mechanism to force the states to comply with requests for troops or revenue. At times, this left the military in a precarious position, as George Washington wrote in a 1781 letter to the governor of Massachusetts, John Hancock.



===The end of the war===
The Treaty of Paris (1783), which ended hostilities with Great Britain, languished in Congress for months because state representatives failed to attend sessions of the national legislature. Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. Writing to George Clinton in September 1783, George Washington complained:

:''Congress have come to no determination &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; respecting the Peace Establishment nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss &lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt; National points.''&lt;ref name=washingtonclinton&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field(DOCID+@lit(gw270170)) Letter George Washington to George Clinton], September 11 1783. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gwhtml/gwhome.html The George Washington Papers, 1741-1799]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
The Articles supported the Congressional direction of the Continental Army, and allowed the 13 states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure, but since guerrilla warfare was correct strategy in a war against the British Empire's army, this &quot;failure&quot; succeeded in winning independence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;While Washington and Steuben were taking the army in an ever more European direction, Lee in captivity was moving the other way — pursuing his insights into a fullfledged and elaborated proposal for guerrilla warfare. He presented his plan to Congress, as a &quot;Plan for the Formation of the American Army.&quot;

Bitterly attacking Steuben's training of the army according to the &quot;European Plan,&quot; Lee charged that fighting British regulars on their own terms was madness and courted crushing defeat: &quot;If the Americans are servilely kept to the European Plan, they will … be laugh'd at as a bad army by their enemy, and defeated in every [encounter]… . [The idea] that a decisive action in fair ground may be risqued is talking nonsense.&quot; Instead, he declared that &quot;a plan of defense, harassing and impeding can alone succeed,&quot; particularly if based on the rough terrain west of the Susquehannah River in Pennsylvania. He also urged the use of cavalry and of light infantry (in the manner of Dan Morgan), both forces highly mobile and eminently suitable for the guerrilla strategy.

This strategic plan was ignored both by Congress and by Washington, all eagerly attuned to the new fashion of Prussianizing and to the attractions of a &quot;real&quot; army.&quot; - Murray N. Rothbard, [http://mises.org/story/2885 Generalissimo Washington: How He Crushed the Spirit of Liberty] excerpted from Conceived in Liberty, Volume IV, chapters 8 and 41.{{relevance|date=June 2008|rather long &amp; agenda driven quote, with little relevance to article's main topic}} &lt;/ref&gt;
Under the articles, Congress could make decisions, but had no power to enforce them.  There was a requirement for unanimous approval before any modifications could be made to the Articles.  Because the majority of lawmaking rested with the states, the central government was also kept limited.

Congress was denied the power of taxation: it could only request money from the states. The states did not generally comply with the requests in full, leaving the confederation chronically short of funds. Congress was also denied the power to regulate commerce, and as a result, the states fought over trade as well.{{Fact|date=February 2008}} The states and the national congress had both incurred debts during the war, and how to pay the debts became a major issue. Some states paid off their debts; however, the centralizers favored federal assumption of states' debts.

Nevertheless, the Congress of the Confederation did take two actions with lasting impact. The Land Ordinance of 1785 established the general land survey and ownership provisions used throughout later American expansion. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up western land claims and cleared the way for the entry of new states.

Once the war was won, the Continental Army was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man frontier forts and protect against Indian attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, Washington defused the Newburgh conspiracy, but riots by unpaid Pennsylvania veterans forced the Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Signatures===
The Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the Congress. The copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and a cover letter had only the signatures of Henry Laurens and Charles Thomson, who were the President and Secretary to the Congress.

But, the ''Articles'' at that time were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the ''Articles'' on June 27 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.

On July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and South Carolina signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland could not, since their states had not ratified. North Carolina and Georgia also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.

After the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the ''Articles'' on July 21 1778.

The other states had to wait until they ratified the ''Articles'' and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the ''Articles'' until every state had ceded its western land claims.

On February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the Maryland General Assembly in Annapolis&lt;ref name=lawsofmaryland&gt;[http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html Friday, February 2 1781], Laws of Maryland, 1781. [http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html An ACT to empower the delegates]&lt;/ref&gt;. As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, &quot;among engrossed Bills&quot; was &quot;signed and sealed by Governor Thomas Sim Lee in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses… an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation&quot; and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned &quot;to the first Monday in August next.&quot; The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The formal signing of the ''Articles'' by the Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781 and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles entered into force and the United States came into being as a united, sovereign and national state.

Congress had debated the ''Articles'' for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The ''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union'' were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time. 

The signers and the states they represented were:
* New Hampshire: Josiah Bartlett and John Wentworth Jr.
* Massachusetts Bay: John Hancock, Samuel Adams, Elbridge Gerry, Francis Dana, James Lovell, and Samuel Holten
* Rhode Island and Providence Plantations: William Ellery, Henry Marchant, and John Collins
* Connecticut: Roger Sherman¹, Samuel Huntington, Oliver Wolcott, Titus Hosmer, and Andrew Adams
* New York: James Duane, Francis Lewis, William Duer, and Gouverneur Morris
* New Jersey: John Witherspoon and Nathaniel Scudder
* Pennsylvania:Robert Morris², Daniel Roberdeau, Jonathan Bayard Smith, William Clingan, and Joseph Reed
* Delaware: Thomas McKean, John Dickinson³, and Nicholas Van Dyke
* Maryland: John Hanson and Daniel Carroll³
* Virginia: Richard Henry Lee, John Banister, Thomas Adams, John Harvie, and Francis Lightfoot Lee
* North Carolina: John Penn, Cornelius Harnett, and John Williams
* South Carolina: Henry Laurens, William Henry Drayton, John Mathews, Richard Hutson, and  Thomas Heyward Jr.
* Georgia: John Walton, Edward Telfair, and Edward Langworthy
&lt;br /&gt;
:¹ The only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the Articles of Association, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
:² One of only 2 people to sign three of the great state papers of the United States: the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.
:³ One of only 4 people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.

===Presidents of the Congress===
The following list is of those who led the Congress of the Confederation under the ''Articles of Confederation'' as the Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled. Under the Articles, the president was the presiding officer of Congress, chaired the Cabinet (the Committee of the States) when Congress was in recess, and performed other administrative functions.  He was not, however, a ''chief'' executive in the way the successor President of the United States is a chief executive, but all of the functions he executed were under the auspices and in service of the Congress. 

* Samuel Huntington (March 1, 1781 &amp;ndash; July 9, 1781)
* Thomas McKean (July 10, 1781 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1781)
* John Hanson (November 5, 1781 &amp;ndash; November 3, 1782)
* Elias Boudinot (November 4, 1782 &amp;ndash; November 2, 1783)
* Thomas Mifflin (November 3, 1783 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1784)
* Richard Henry Lee (November 30, 1784 &amp;ndash; November 6, 1785)
* John Hancock (November 23, 1785 &amp;ndash; May 29, 1786)
* Nathaniel Gorham (June 6, 1786 &amp;ndash; November 5, 1786)
* Arthur St. Clair (February 2, 1787 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1787)
* Cyrus Griffin (January 22, 1788 &amp;ndash; November 2, 1788)

===Revision and replacement===
In May 1786, Charles Pinckney of South Carolina proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting Congress power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus.

In September, five states assembled in the Annapolis Convention to discuss adjustments that would improve commerce. Under their chairman, Alexander Hamilton, they invited state representatives to convene in Philadelphia to discuss improvements to the federal government. Although the states' representatives to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution.  The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government,  but characterization of the result is disputed. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:

{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states.  The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of Patrick Henry, George Mason, and other antifederalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:

{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the &quot;consolidated government&quot; proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a &quot;splendid empire&quot; that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Ketcham, [http://books.google.com/books?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&amp;pg=PA381&amp;lpg=PA381&amp;dq=ralph+ketcham+%22anti+federalist%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=BQZCnGjA9c&amp;sig=rVp_ZBF9cEFFN8R5yJsW2xTMyf0#PPA381,M1 Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted, pg. 383]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to their own terms for modification (Article XIII), the Articles would still have been in effect until 1790, the year in which the last of the 13 states ratified the new Constitution. The Congress under the Articles continued to sit until November 1788,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines. 

Rakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by Rhode Island. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures &quot;stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rakove 1988 p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy.  Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.

When the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new &quot;merchant state,&quot; much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.

===Historical importance===
The Articles are historically important for two major reasons: ''i)'' they were the first constitution or governing document for the United States of America and ''ii)'' they legally established a union of the thirteen founding states; a Perpetual Union. Early on, tensions developed surrounding the Union, not least because of the fact that with the US Constitution the basis of government was changed from that of confederation to federation. Thomas Jefferson and John C. Calhoun were in their time leading proponents of guaranteeing the constitutional rights of states in federal legislation. Over time, a legal view developed that if the union violated the constitutional rights of states they might rightfully seceed.&lt;ref&gt;In his book Life of Webster Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge writes, &quot;It is safe to say that there was not a man in the country, from Washington and Hamilton to Clinton and Mason, who did not regard the new system as an experiment from which each and every State had a right to peaceably withdraw.&quot; A textbook used at West Point before the Civil War, A View of the Constitution, written by Judge William Rawle, states, &quot;The secession of a State depends on the will of the people of such a State.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A significant tension in the 19th century surrounded the expansion of slavery (which was generally supported in agricultural Southern states and opposed in industrial Northern states). As the secessionist view gained support in the South, the opposing view in the North was that since the U.S. Constitution declared itself to be &quot;a more perfect union&quot; than the Articles, it too must be perpetual, and also could not be broken without the consent of the other states. This view was promoted by Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln. In 1861, these constitutional contracts were cited by President Lincoln against any claims by the seceding states that unilaterally withdrawing from the Union and taking federal property within those states was legal.&lt;!-- Lincoln, in inaugural, does not say he would take force to prevent secession--&gt;&lt;ref name=inauguraladdress&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/inaug/lincoln1.htm |title=First Inaugural Address of Abraham Lincoln, Monday, March 4, 1861| quote=...no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Northwest Ordinance ==

The Congress established the Northwest Territory around the Great Lakes between 1784 and 1787. In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance banning slavery in the new Territory. Congressional legislation divided the Territory into ''townships'' of six square miles each and provided for the sale of land to settlers. The Northwest Territory would eventually become the states of Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.

== Problems with the Confederation ==

The Confederation faced several difficulties in its early years. Firstly, Congress became extremely dependent on the states for income. Also, states refused to require its citizens to pay debts to British merchants, straining relations with Great Britain. France prohibited Americans from using the important port of New Orleans, crippling American trade down the Mississippi river.

== Shays' Rebellion ==

Due to the post-revolution economic woes, agitated by inflation, many worried of social instability.  This was especially true for those in Massachusetts. The legislature's response to the shaky economy was to put emphasis on maintaining a sound currency by paying off the state debt through levying massive taxes.  The tax burden hit those with moderate incomes dramatically.  The average farmer paid a third of their annual income to these taxes from 1780 to 1786.  Those who couldn't pay had their property foreclosed and were thrown into crowded prisons filled with other debtors.

But in the summer of 1786, a revolutionary war veteran named Daniel Shays began to organize western communities in Massachusetts to stop foreclosures, with force, by prohibiting the courts from holding their proceedings.  Later that fall, Shays marched the newly formed &quot;rebellion&quot; into Springfield to stop the state supreme court from gathering.  The state responded with troops sent to suppress the rebellion.  After a failed attempt by the rebels to attack the Springfield arsenal, and other small skirmishes, the rebels retreated and then uprising collapsed.  Shays retreated to Vermont by 1787.

While Daniel Shays was in hiding, the government condemned him to death on the charge of treason.  Shays pleaded for his life in a petition which was finally granted by John Hancock on June 17, 1788.  With the threat of treason behind him, Shays moved to New York and died September 25, 1825

==US Presidents before George Washington==
Who was the first president of the United States? Ask any school child and they will readily tell you &quot;George Washington.&quot;  And of course, they would be correct—at least technically. Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, and yet, the United States continually had functioning governments from as early as September 5, 1774 and operated as a confederated nation from as early as July 4, 1776. During that nearly fifteen year interval, Congress—first the Continental Congress and then later the Confederation Congress—was always moderated by a duly elected president.  This officer was known as the &quot;[[w:President of the Continental Congress|President of the Continental Congress]]&quot;, and later as the &quot;President of the United States, in Congress Assembled&quot;.

However, the office of President of the Continental Congress had very little relationship to the office of President of the United States beyond the name.  The President of the United States is the head of the executive branch of government, while the President of the Continental Congress was merely the chair of a body that most resembled a legislature, although it possessed legislative, executive, and judicial powers.  The following brief biographies profile these &quot;forgotten presidents.&quot; 

'''Peyton Randolph of Virginia (1723-1775)'''
[[Image:PeytonRandolph.jpeg|thumb|left|A portrait of Peyton Randolph.]]
When delegates gathered in Philadelphia for the first Continental Congress, they promptly elected the former King's Attorney of Virginia as the moderator and president of their convocation. He was a propitious choice. He was a legal prodigy—having studied at the Inner Temple in London, served as his native colony's Attorney General, and tutored many of the most able men of the South at William and Mary College—including the young Patrick Henry. His home in Williamsburg was the gathering place for Virginia's legal and political gentry—and it remains a popular attraction in the restored colonial capital. He had served as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses, and had been a commander under William Byrd in the colonial militia. He was a scholar of some renown—having begun a self-guided reading of the classics when he was thirteen. Despite suffering poor health served the Continental Congress as president twice, in 1774 from September 5 to October 21, and then again for a few days in 1775 from May 10 to May 23. He never lived to see independence, yet was numbered among the nation's most revered founders. 

'''Henry Middleton (1717-1784)'''

America's second elected president was one of the wealthiest planters in the South, the patriarch of the most powerful families anywhere in the nation. His public spirit was evident from an early age. He was a member of his state's Common House from 1744-1747. During the last two years he served as the Speaker. During 1755 he was the King's Commissioner of Indian Affairs. He was a member of the South Carolina Council from 1755-1770. His valor in the War with the Cherokees during 1760-1761 earned him wide recognition throughout the colonies—and demonstrated his leadership abilities while under pressure. He was elected as a delegate to the first session of the Continental Congress and when Peyton Randolph was forced to resign the presidency, his peers immediately turned to Middleton to complete the term. He served as the fledgling coalition's president from October 22, 1774 until Randolph was able to resume his duties briefly beginning on May 10, 1775. Afterward, he was a member of the Congressional Council of Safety and helped to establish the young nation's policy toward the encouragement and support of education. In February 1776 he resigned his political involvements in order to prepare his family and lands for what he believed was inevitable war—but he was replaced by his son Arthur who eventually became a signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation, served time as an English prisoner of war, and was twice elected Governor of his state. 

'''John Hancock (1737-1793)'''
[[Image:John_Hancock_painting.jpg|thumb|right|John Hancock, signer of the Declaration of Independence.]]
The third president was a patriot, rebel leader, merchant who signed his name into immortality in giant strokes on the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The boldness of his signature has made it live in American minds as a perfect expression of the strength and freedom—and defiance—of the individual in the face of British tyranny. As President of the Continental Congress during two widely spaced terms—the first from May 24 1775 to October 30 1777 and the second from November 23 1785 to June 5, 1786—Hancock was the presiding officer when the members approved the Declaration of Independence. Because of his position, it was his official duty to sign the document first—but not necessarily as dramatically as he did. Hancock figured prominently in another historic event—the battle at Lexington: British troops who fought there April 10, 1775, had known Hancock and Samuel Adams were in Lexington and had come there to capture these rebel leaders. And the two would have been captured, if they had not been warned by Paul Revere. As early as 1768, Hancock defied the British by refusing to pay customs charges on the cargo of one of his ships. One of Boston's wealthiest merchants, he was recognized by the citizens, as well as by the British, as a rebel leader—and was elected President of the first Massachusetts Provincial Congress. After he was chosen President of the Continental Congress in 1775, Hancock became known beyond the borders of Massachusetts, and, having served as colonel of the Massachusetts Governor's Guards he hoped to be named commander of the American forces—until John Adams nominated George Washington. In 1778 Hancock was commissioned Major General and took part in an unsuccessful campaign in Rhode Island. But it was as a political leader that his real distinction was earned—as the first Governor of Massachusetts, as President of Congress, and as President of the Massachusetts constitutional ratification convention. He helped win ratification in Massachusetts, gaining enough popular recognition to make him a contender for the newly created Presidency of the United States, but again he saw Washington gain the prize. Like his rival, George Washington, Hancock was a wealthy man who risked much for the cause of independence. He was the wealthiest New Englander supporting the patriotic cause, and, although he lacked the brilliance of John Adams or the capacity to inspire of Samuel Adams, he became one of the foremost leaders of the new nation—perhaps, in part, because he was willing to commit so much at such risk to the cause of freedom. 

'''Henry Laurens (1724-1792)'''
[[Image:Henry_laurens.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Laurens, &quot;father of our country.&quot;]]
The only American president ever to be held as a prisoner of war by a foreign power, Laurens was heralded after he was released as &quot;the father of our country,&quot; by no less a personage than George Washington. He was of Huguenot extraction, his ancestors having come to America from France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes made the Reformed faith illegal. Raised and educated for a life of mercantilism at his home in Charleston, he also had the opportunity to spend more than a year in continental travel. It was while in Europe that he began to write revolutionary pamphlets—gaining him renown as a patriot. He served as vice-president of South Carolina in1776. He was then elected to the Continental Congress. He succeeded John Hancock as President of the newly independent but war beleaguered United States on November 1, 1777. He served until December 9, 1778 at which time he was appointed Ambassador to the Netherlands. Unfortunately for the cause of the young nation, he was captured by an English warship during his cross-Atlantic voyage and was confined to the Tower of London until the end of the war. After the Battle of Yorktown, the American government regained his freedom in a dramatic prisoner exchange—President Laurens for Lord Cornwallis. Ever the patriot, Laurens continued to serve his nation as one of the three representatives selected to negotiate terms at the Paris Peace Conference in 1782. 

'''John Jay (1745-1829)'''
[[Image:John Jay (Gilbert Stuart portrait).jpg|thumb|right|John Jay, Chief Justice.]]
America's first Secretary of State, first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, one of its first ambassadors, and author of some of the celebrated Federalist Papers, Jay was a Founding Father who, by a quirk of fate, missed signing the Declaration of Independence—at the time of the vote for independence and the signing, he had temporarily left the Continental Congress to serve in New York's revolutionary legislature. Nevertheless, he was chosen by his peers to succeed Henry Laurens as President of the United States—serving a term from December 10, 1778 to September 27, 1779. A conservative New York lawyer who was at first against the idea of independence for the colonies, the aristocratic Jay in 1776 turned into a patriot who was willing to give the next twenty-five years of his life to help establish the new nation. During those years, he won the regard of his peers as a dedicated and accomplished statesman and a man of unwavering principle. In the Continental Congress Jay prepared addresses to the people of Canada and Great Britain. In New York he drafted the State constitution and served as Chief Justice during the war. He was President of the Continental Congress before he undertook the difficult assignment, as ambassador, of trying to gain support and funds from Spain. After helping Franklin, Jefferson, Adams, and Laurens complete peace negotiations in Paris in 1783, Jay returned to become the first Secretary of State, called &quot;Secretary of Foreign Affairs&quot; under the Articles of Confederation. He negotiated valuable commercial treaties with Russia and Morocco, and dealt with the continuing controversy with Britain and Spain over the southern and western boundaries of the United States. He proposed that America and Britain establish a joint commission to arbitrate disputes that remained after the war—a proposal which, though not adopted, influenced the government's use of arbitration and diplomacy in settling later international problems. In this post Jay felt keenly the weakness of the Articles of Confederation and was one of the first to advocate a new governmental compact. He wrote five Federalist Papers supporting the Constitution, and he was a leader in the New York ratification convention. As first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Jay made the historic decision that a State could be sued by a citizen from another State, which led to the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. On a special mission to London he concluded the &quot;Jay Treaty,&quot; which helped avert a renewal of hostilities with Britain but won little popular favor at home—and it is probably for this treaty that this Founding Father is best remembered.
 
'''Samuel Huntington (1732-1796)'''
An industrious youth who mastered his studies of the law without the advantage of a school, a tutor, or a master—borrowing books and snatching opportunities to read and research between odd jobs—he was one of the greatest self-made men among the Founders. He was also one of the greatest legal minds of the age—all the more remarkable for his lack of advantage as a youth. In 1764, in recognition of his obvious abilities and initiative, he was elected to the General Assembly of Connecticut. The next year he was chosen to serve on the Executive Council. In 1774 he was appointed Associate Judge of the Superior Court and, as a delegate to the Continental Congress, was acknowledged to be a legal scholar of some respect. He served in Congress for five consecutive terms, during the last of which he was elected President. He served in that office from September 28, 1779 until ill health forced him to resign on July 9, 1781. He returned to his home in Connecticut—and as he recuperated, he accepted more Councilor and Bench duties. He again took his seat in Congress in 1783, but left it to become Chief Justice of his state's Superior Court. He was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1785 and Governor in 1786. According to John Jay, he was &quot;the most precisely trained Christian jurists ever to serve his country.&quot; 

'''Thomas McKean (1734-1817)'''
During his astonishingly varied fifty-year career in public life he held almost every possible position—from deputy county attorney to President of the United States under the Confederation. Besides signing the Declaration of Independence, he contributed significantly to the development and establishment of constitutional government in both his home state of Delaware and the nation. At the Stamp Act Congress he proposed the voting procedure that Congress adopted: that each colony, regardless of size or population, has one vote—the practice adopted by the Continental Congress and the Congress of the Confederation, and the principle of state equality manifest in the composition of the Senate. And as county judge in 1765, he defied the British by ordering his court to work only with documents that did not bear the hated stamps. In June 1776, at the Continental Congress, McKean joined with Caesar Rodney to register Delaware's approval of the Declaration of Independence, over the negative vote of the third Delaware delegate, George Read—permitting it to be &quot;The unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States.&quot; And at a special Delaware convention, he drafted the constitution for that State. McKean also helped draft—and signed—the Articles of Confederation. It was during his tenure of service as President—from July 10, 1781 to November 4, 1782—when news arrived from General Washington in October 1781 that the British had surrendered following the Battle of Yorktown. As Chief Justice of the supreme court of Pennsylvania, he contributed to the establishment of the legal system in that State, and, in 1787, he strongly supported the Constitution at the Pennsylvania Ratification Convention, declaring it &quot;the best the world has yet seen.&quot; At sixty-five, after over forty years of public service, McKean resigned from his post as Chief Justice. A candidate on the Democratic-Republican ticket in 1799, McKean was elected Governor of Pennsylvania. As Governor, he followed such a strict policy of appointing only fellow Republicans to office that he became the father of the spoils system in America. He served three tempestuous terms as Governor, completing one of the longest continuous careers of public service of any of the Founding Fathers. 

'''John Hanson (1715-1783)'''
He was the heir of one of the greatest family traditions in the colonies and became the patriarch of a long line of American patriots—his great grandfather died at Lutzen beside the great King Gustavus Aldophus of Sweden; his grandfather was one of the founders of New Sweden along the Delaware River in Maryland; one of his nephews was the military secretary to George Washington; another was a signer of the Declaration; still another was a signer of the Constitution; yet another was Governor of Maryland during the Revolution; and still another was a member of the first Congress; two sons were killed in action with the Continental Army; a grandson served as a member of Congress under the new Constitution; and another grandson was a Maryland Senator. Thus, even if Hanson had not served as President himself, he would have greatly contributed to the life of the nation through his ancestry and progeny. As a youngster he began a self-guided reading of classics and rather quickly became an acknowledged expert in the juridicalism of Anselm and the practical philosophy of Seneca—both of which were influential in the development of the political philosophy of the great leaders of the Reformation. It was based upon these legal and theological studies that the young planter—his farm, Mulberry Grove was just across the Potomac from Mount Vernon—began to espouse the cause of the patriots. In 1775 he was elected to the Provincial Legislature of Maryland. Then in 1777, he became a member of Congress where he distinguished himself as a brilliant administrator. Thus, he was elected President in 1781. He served in that office from November 5, 1781 until November 3, 1782. He was the first President to serve a full term after the full ratification of the Articles of Confederation—and like so many of the Southern and New England Founders, he was strongly opposed to the Constitution when it was first discussed. He remained a confirmed anti-federalist until his untimely death. 

'''Elias Boudinot (1741-1802)'''
He did not sign the Declaration, the Articles, or the Constitution. He did not serve in the Continental Army with distinction. He was not renowned for his legal mind or his political skills. He was instead a man who spent his entire career in foreign diplomacy. He earned the respect of his fellow patriots during the dangerous days following the traitorous action of Benedict Arnold. His deft handling of relations with Canada also earned him great praise. After being elected to the Congress from his home state of New Jersey, he served as the new nation's Secretary for Foreign Affairs—managing the influx of aid from France, Spain, and Holland. The in 1783 he was elected to the Presidency. He served in that office from November 4, 1782 until November 2, 1783. Like so many of the other early presidents, he was a classically trained scholar, of the Reformed faith, and an anti-federalist in political matters. He was the father and grandfather of frontiersmen—and one of his grandchildren and namesakes eventually became a leader of the Cherokee nation in its bid for independence from the sprawling expansion of the United States. 

'''Thomas Mifflin (1744-1800)'''
By an ironic sort of providence, Thomas Mifflin served as George Washington's first aide-de-camp at the beginning of the Revolutionary War, and, when the war was over, he was the man, as President of the United States, who accepted Washington's resignation of his commission. In the years between, Mifflin greatly served the cause of freedom—and, apparently, his own cause—while serving as the first Quartermaster General of the Continental Army. He obtained desperately needed supplies for the new army—and was suspected of making excessive profit himself. Although experienced in business and successful in obtaining supplies for the war, Mifflin preferred the front lines, and he distinguished himself in military actions on Long Island and near Philadelphia. Born and reared a Quaker, he was excluded from their meetings for his military activities. A controversial figure, Mifflin lost favor with Washington and was part of the Conway Cabal—a rather notorious plan to replace Washington with General Horatio Gates. And Mifflin narrowly missed court-martial action over his handling of funds by resigning his commission in 1778. In spite of these problems—and of repeated charges that he was a drunkard—Mifflin continued to be elected to positions of responsibility—as President and Governor of Pennsylvania, delegate to the Constitutional Convention, as well as the highest office in the land—where he served from November 3, 1783 to November 29, 1784. Most of Mifflin's significant contributions occurred in his earlier years—in the First and Second Continental Congresses he was firm in his stand for independence and for fighting for it, and he helped obtain both men and supplies for Washington's army in the early critical period. In 1784, as President, he signed the treaty with Great Britain which ended the war. Although a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, he did not make a significant contribution—beyond signing the document. As Governor of Pennsylvania, although he was accused of negligence, he supported improvements of roads, and reformed the State penal and judicial systems. He had gradually become sympathetic to Jefferson's principles regarding State's rights, even so, he directed the Pennsylvania militia to support the Federal tax collectors in the Whiskey Rebellion. In spite of charges of corruption, the affable Mifflin remained a popular figure. A magnetic personality and an effective speaker, he managed to hold a variety of elective offices for almost thirty years of the critical Revolutionary period. 

'''Richard Henry Lee (1732-1794)'''
His resolution &quot;that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States,&quot; approved by the Continental Congress July 2, 1776, was the first official act of the United Colonies that set them irrevocably on the road to independence. It was not surprising that it came from Lee's pen—as early as 1768 he proposed the idea of committees of correspondence among the colonies, and in 1774 he proposed that the colonies meet in what became the Continental Congress. From the first, his eye was on independence. A wealthy Virginia planter whose ancestors had been granted extensive lands by King Charles II, Lee disdained the traditional aristocratic role and the aristocratic view. In the House of Burgesses he flatly denounced the practice of slavery. He saw independent America as &quot;an asylum where the unhappy may find solace, and the persecuted repose.&quot; In 1764, when news of the proposed Stamp Act reached Virginia, Lee was a member of the committee of the House of Burgesses that drew up an address to the King, an official protest against such a tax. After the tax was established, Lee organized the citizens of his county into the Westmoreland Association, a group pledged to buy no British goods until the Stamp Act was repealed. At the First Continental Congress, Lee persuaded representatives from all the colonies to adopt this non-importation idea, leading to the formation of the Continental Association, which was one of the first steps toward union of the colonies. Lee also proposed to the First Continental Congress that a militia be organized and armed—the year before the first shots were fired at Lexington; but this and other proposals of his were considered too radical—at the time. Three days after Lee introduced his resolution, in June of 1776, he was appointed by Congress to the committee responsible for drafting a declaration of independence, but he was called home when his wife fell ill, and his place was taken by his young protégé, Thomas Jefferson. Thus Lee missed the chance to draft the document—though his influence greatly shaped it and he was able to return in time to sign it. He was elected President—serving from November 30, 1784 to November 22, 1785 when he was succeeded by the second administration of John Hancock. Elected to the Constitutional Convention, Lee refused to attend, but as a member of the Congress of the Confederation, he contributed to another great document, the Northwest Ordinance, which provided for the formation of new States from the Northwest Territory. When the completed Constitution was sent to the States for ratification, Lee opposed it as anti-democratic and anti-Christian. However, as one of Virginia's first Senators, he helped assure passage of the amendments that, he felt, corrected many of the document's gravest faults—the Bill of Rights. He was the great uncle of Robert E. Lee and the scion of a great family tradition. 

'''Nathaniel Gorham (1738-1796)'''
Another self-made man, Gorham was one of the many successful Boston merchants who risked all he had for the cause of freedom. He was first elected to the Massachusetts General Court in 1771. His honesty and integrity won his acclaim and was thus among the first delegates chose to serve in the Continental Congress. He remained in public service throughout the war and into the Constitutional period, though his greatest contribution was his call for a stronger central government. But even though he was an avid federalist, he did not believe that the union could—or even should—be maintained peaceably for more than a hundred years. He was convinced that eventually, in order to avoid civil or cultural war, smaller regional interests should pursue an independent course. His support of a new constitution was rooted more in pragmatism than ideology. When John Hancock was unable to complete his second term as President, Gorham was elected to succeed him—serving from June 6, 1786 to February 1, 1787. It was during this time that the Congress actually entertained the idea of asking Prince Henry—the brother of Frederick II of Prussia—and Bonnie Prince Charlie—the leader of the ill-fated Scottish Jacobite Rising and heir of the Stuart royal line—to consider the possibility of establishing a constitutional monarch in America. It was a plan that had much to recommend it but eventually the advocates of republicanism held the day. During the final years of his life, Gorham was concerned with several speculative land deals which nearly cost him his entire fortune. 

'''Arthur St. Clair (1734-1818)'''
Born and educated in Edinburgh, Scotland during the tumultuous days of the final Jacobite Rising and the Tartan Suppression, St. Clair was the only president of the United States born and bred on foreign soil. Though most of his family and friends abandoned their devastated homeland in the years following the Battle of Culloden—after which nearly a third of the land was depopulated through emigration to America—he stayed behind to learn the ways of the hated Hanoverian English in the Royal Navy. His plan was to learn of the enemy's military might in order to fight another day. During the global conflict of the Seven Years War—generally known as the French and Indian War—he was stationed in the American theater. Afterward, he decided to settle in Pennsylvania where many of his kin had established themselves. His civic-mindedness quickly became apparent: he helped to organize both the New Jersey and the Pennsylvania militias, led the Continental Army's Canadian expedition, and was elected Congress. His long years of training in the enemy camp was finally paying off. He was elected President in 1787—and he served from February 2 of that year until January 21 of the next. Following his term of duty in the highest office in the land, he became the first Governor of the Northwest Territory. Though he briefly supported the idea of creating a constitutional monarchy under the Stuart's Bonnie Prince Charlie, he was a strident Anti-Federalist—believing that the proposed federal constitution would eventually allow for the intrusion of government into virtually every sphere and aspect of life. He even predicted that under the vastly expanded centralized power of the state the taxing powers of bureaucrats and other unelected officials would eventually confiscate as much as a quarter of the income of the citizens—a notion that seemed laughable at the time but that has proven to be ominously modest in light of our current governmental leviathan. St. Clair lived to see the hated English tyrants who destroyed his homeland defeated. But he despaired that his adopted home might actually create similar tyrannies and impose them upon themselves. 

'''Cyrus Griffin (1736-1796)'''
Like Peyton Randolph, he was trained in London's Inner Temple to be a lawyer—and thus was counted among his nation's legal elite. Like so many other Virginians, he was an anti-federalist, though he eventually accepted the new Constitution with the promise of the Bill of Rights as a hedge against the establishment of an American monarchy—which still had a good deal of currency. The Articles of Confederation afforded such freedoms that he had become convinced that even with the incumbent loss of liberty, some new form of government would be required. A protégé of George Washington—having worked with him on several speculative land deals in the West—he was a reluctant supporter of the Constitutional ratifying process. It was during his term in the office of the Presidency—the last before the new national compact went into effect—that ratification was formalized and finalized. He served as the nation's chief executive from January 22, 1788 until George Washington's inauguration on April 30, 1789.

This page looks at three components that are used in electrical circuits. The three components in question are: The diode, the thermistor, and the light dependent resistor. You will see how the components work and how they are used.

==The Diode==

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Diode_circuit_symbol.png]]
|} 

A diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction but not in the reverse direction. Its circuit symbol consists of a triangle pointing in the direction that current ''is'' allowed to flow with a line at the point, inside a circle. Diodes are useful for stopping current flowing in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction.

[[Image:V-I_diode.png]] 

Above is a current voltage graph for a typical diode. Note that the diode needs a small voltage (about 0.6V) to work. Below 0.6V in the  forward direction very little current flows. At or above 0.6V the resistance drops dramatically and a huge current can flow. In the reverse direction, virtually no current flows no matter how large the voltage is. (Eventually, when the voltage gets high enough, the diode &quot;breaks down&quot; and current is able to flow in the  reverse direction. For normal diodes however this &quot;break down voltage&quot; is very high and can be ignored.  A diode that is connected in reverse to use the break down effect is called a Zener diode.  It is used to provide voltage control in power supplies (called the Zener voltage).)

Diodes are useful for turning AC current into DC current (AC/DC converters are called rectifiers). In AC the electricity flows back and forth in cycles. Mains electricity is AC. It cycles 50 times every second. This is fine for something like a lightbulb, where the bulb does not care in which direction the electricity flows. Some devices however can only work off DC. A toy electric train for example would not go with AC. The current would be saying &quot;go forwards&quot;, &quot;go backwards&quot; over and over again 50 times a second! With a diode in the circuit the ''negative'' part of the cycle is stopped.

[[Image:AC_current_through_a_diode.png]]

The graph on the left shows AC current. Note that the current cycles positive, negative, positive, and so on. The electricity is flowing to and fro. Putting the current through a diode has the result seen on the right. The positive part of the cycle in unaffected, but the negative is wiped out. The current goes positive, zero, positive and so on.

==The Thermistor==
[[Image:R_against_T_for_a_thermistor.png]] 

A thermistor is a just a resistor whose resistance depends on temperature. Most thermistors have lower resistance when the temperature is high. They are used in circuits which are temperature dependent. For example, fire alarms, the temperature gets too high; the alarm sounds.

==The LDR==
A light dependent resistor is a resistor whose resistance depends on the amount of light shining on it. Its resistance gets less the more light shines on it. It can be used in circuits that are light dependent. For example, switching circuits for street lights. The ambient light gets too low; the lamp turns on. It is also known as a photoresistor from photo, the Latin for light.

Mains electricity is potentially dangerous. There are, however, safety features included in plugs. This module looks at how to wire a plug correctly. 


==The three pin plug==

Nowadays most appliances are sold with moulded plugs already fitted. Nevertheless, it is still important to understand the correct wiring of a plug because enough of the old plugs still exist. It is also the case when you bring in equipments overseas. British Standard compliant adaptors are not always available for such non-UK plugs. You are very likely to need to change a plug at some time in your life. In the UK mains electricity is 230V. (In Hong Kong, it is 220V.) If you were to touch a live wire a current would flow through your body to the ground. This current may be enough to kill you. 

The cable from the appliance usually consist of three wires, an earth and two live wires (line and neutral) which carry the current (people often think that only the line wire is called live, but both neutral and line are live wires). The wires are made of copper surrounded by a plastic sheath. The sheath is made of plastic and is coloured:

*The live wire is &lt;font color=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;'''brown'''&lt;/font&gt;
*The neutral wire is &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;'''blue'''&lt;/font&gt;
*The earth wire is &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''green'''&lt;/font&gt; and &lt;font color=&quot;eedd00&quot;&gt;'''yellow'''&lt;/font&gt;

The three wires are covered by an outer sheath made of plastic.

'''Q1)''' Use your knowledge of insulators and conductors to explain
:Why the wires are insulated&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;.
:Why the sheaths are made of plastic.


[[Image:Plug_diagram.png]]

The plug has the following features:
* A cable grip, to grip the ''outer sheath'' of cable and prevent it being pulled out of the plug
* Three pins made of brass, one of which is the earth pin.
* A fuse.
* A case made of plastic.

'''Q2)''' Why are the pins made of brass and why is the case plastic?

==The purpose of the parts of a plug==
===The live and neutral wires===
The live and neutral wires carry the current around the circuit. Mains current is A.C. (alternating current); this means that it is going backward and forwards in cycles (clockwise and anticlockwise around the circuit). The frequency of the cycle is 50 hertz (50 times per second). This cycling of current is achieved by varying the voltage on the line wire from about +325V to - you to the earth. This is where the earth wire is included, for your safety. The earth wire connects the case of the appliance out  down the flex to the earth pin on its plug. This connection goes into the socket, then inside the wiring of your house down to the earth through the earthing system (not necessarily plumbing). 

If the live wire were to touch the case a huge current would flow through the earth wire. This would probably blow the fuse and break the circuit (see next section). However even if the fuse doesn't blow the current would still prefer to flow through a wire with low resistance than a human body with relatively higher resistance. 

Thus the earth wire helps protect you if you touch the case of an appliance that is &quot;live&quot;. 

The earth pin on a plug is longer than the line and neutral pins. This ensures that the earth pin always connects with the socket first. All sockets have shutters which prevent access to the live contacts when there is no plug in the socket.  On some sockets these shutters are operated by the earth pin pushing the shutter mechanism down to uncover the line and neutral socket contacts, on other sockets there is a mechanism which opens the shutters when the two live pins are inserted simultaneously, and on other sockets when all three pins are inserted simultaneously.

===The fuse===
A fuse is simply a very thin wire. The wire has a quite low melting point. As current flows through the wire it heats up. If too large a current flows, it melts, breaking the circuit. Fuses are used to protect the flexible lead between the plug and the appliance. If too large a current flows through a lead it may overheat or catch fire. Fuses are unlikely to act quickly enough to prevent human electrocution &amp;ndash; their main purpose is to prevent fires due to large currents.

Fuses are rated according to how much current they can carry before melting. In plugs fuses are usually 3A (red), 5A (black), or 13A (brown). The correct fuse is the one that matches the current rating of the lead.

All plug fuses must comply to British Standard BS1362. The rating and &quot;BS1362&quot; should be explicitly marked on such fuses. 

'''Q4)''' A table lamp usually carries a current of 0.5A. What fuse should be put in the plug: 3A, 5A, or 13A?

'''Q5)''' An iron usually carries a current of 5.2A. What fuse should be put in the plug: 3A, 5A, or 13A?

'''Q6)'''  A kettle is protected by an earth wire and a 13A fuse. The line wire comes loose and touches the side of the kettle. The fuse blows. Explain why.

'''Q7)''' Explain why the fuse is always located on the line wire and not the neutral wire?

'''Q8)''' Describe and Explain what happens in the following scenarios:
        a) The earth and line wire switch terminals on the plug
        b) The line and neutral wire switch terminals on the plug
        c) The neutral and earth wire switch terminals on the plug
        d) When the earth wire is removed


{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
| '''Summary of this topic'''
|-
| The ''line wire'' is brown, and has A.C. voltage of 230V&lt;br&gt;
The ''neutral wire'' is blue  and has A.C. voltage of approximately zero.&lt;br&gt;
The ''earth wire'' is green and yellow and is a safety device designed to protect people from shocks.&lt;br&gt;
The ''fuse'' is a device that melts and breaks the circuit when the current gets too high.&lt;br&gt;
The case is made of plastic (an insulator) for safety.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Number theory''' is a large encompassing subject in its own right. Here we will examine the key concepts of number theory. 

== Introduction ==
Unlike real analysis and calculus which deals with the dense set of real numbers, number theory examines mathematics in discrete sets, such as '''N''' or '''Z'''. If you are unsure about sets, you may wish to revisit [[../Set theory/]].

Number Theory, the study of the integers, is one of the oldest and richest branches of mathematics.  Its basic concepts are those of divisibility, prime numbers, and integer solutions to equations -- all very simple to understand, but immediately giving rise to some of the best known theorems and biggest unsolved problems in mathematics.  The Theory of Numbers is also a very interdisciplinary subject.  Ideas from combinatorics (the study of counting), algebra, and complex analysis all find their way in, and eventually become essential for understanding parts of number theory.  Indeed, the greatest open problem in all mathematics, the Riemann Hypothesis, is deeply tied into Complex Analysis.  But never fear, just start right into ''Elementary Number Theory'', one of the warmest invitations to pure mathematics, and one of the most surprising areas of applied mathematics!

== Divisibility ==
Note that in '''R''', '''Q''', and '''C''', we can ''divide'' freely, except by zero. This property is often known as ''closure'' -- the quotient of two rationals is again a rational, etc..  However, if we move to performing mathematics purely in a set such as '''Z''', we come into difficulty. This is because, in the integers, the result of a division of two integers might not be another integer. For example, we can of course divide 6 by 2 to get 3, but we ''cannot'' divide 6 by 5, because the fraction 6/5 is not in the set of integers.

However we can introduce a new relation where division '''is''' defined. We call this relation ''divisibility'', and if &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt; is an integer, we say:
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a factor of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is divisible by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, if there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;b = qa&lt;/math&gt; then we say that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; '''divides''' &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and write &lt;math&gt;a \mid b&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; does not divide &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; then we write &lt;math&gt;a \nmid b&lt;/math&gt;:

'''Proposition.'''  The following are basic consequences of this definition.  Let a, b, and c be integers:
* (a) If a|b then a|(bc).
* (b) If a|b and b|c, then a|c.
* (c) If a|b and a|c, then for any integers x and y, a|(xb+yc) -- in other words a divides any ''linear combination'' of its multiples.
* (d) If both a|b and b|a, then a = b or a = -b.
* (e) If c is not 0, then a|b is equivalent to ca|cb.

== Quotient and divisor theorem ==
For any integer ''n'' and any ''k'' &amp;gt; 0, there is a unique ''q'' and ''r'' such that:

:''n'' = ''qk'' + ''r'' (with 0 &amp;le; ''r'' &amp;lt; ''k'')

Here n is known as dividend.


We call ''q'' the ''quotient'', ''r'' the ''remainder'', and ''k'' the ''divisor''.

It is probably easier to recognize this as division by the algebraic re-arrangement:

:''n/k'' = ''q'' + ''r/k'' (0 &amp;le; ''r/k'' &amp;lt; 1)

== Modular arithmetic==
What can we say about the numbers that divide another? Pick the number 8 for example. What is the remainder on dividing 1 by 8? Using the division theorem above

: 0 = 8*0 + 0
: 1 = 8*0 + 1
: 2 = 8*0 + 2
: :
: 8 = 8*1 + 0
: 9 = 8*1 + 1
: 10 = 8 * 1 + 2
: : 
: ''and so on''

We have a notation for the remainders, and can write the above equations as 

:0 mod 8 = 0
:1 mod 8 = 1
:2 mod 8 = 2
:3 mod 8 = 3
:4 mod 8 = 4
:5 mod 8 = 5
:6 mod 8 = 6
:7 mod 8 = 7
:8 mod 8 = 0
:9 mod 8 = 1
:10 mod 8 = 2
: :

We can also write
:1 &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8)
:2 &amp;equiv; 2 (mod 8)
:3 &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 8)
:4 &amp;equiv; 4 (mod 8)
:5 &amp;equiv; 5 (mod 8)
:6 &amp;equiv; 6 (mod 8)
:7 &amp;equiv; 7 (mod 8)
:8 &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 8)
:9 &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8)
:10 &amp;equiv; 2 (mod 8)
: :



These notations are all short for

: ''a'' = 8''k''+''r'' for some integer ''k''.

So ''x'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8), for example, is the same as saying

: ''x'' = 8''k''+1

Observe that the remainder here, in comparing it with the division algorithm is 1. ''x'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 8) asks what numbers have the remainder 1 on division by 8? Clearly the solutions are ''x''=8&amp;times;0+1, 8&amp;times;1+1,... = 1, 9, ...  

Often the entire set of remainders on dividing by ''n'' - which we say ''modulo n'' - are interesting to look at. We write this set '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Note that this set is finite. The remainder on dividing 9 by 8 is 1 - the same as dividing 1 by 8. So in a sense 9 is really &quot;the same as&quot; 1. In fact, the relation &quot;&amp;equiv;&quot; 

: ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''y'' iff ''x'' mod ''n'' = ''y'' mod ''n''.

is an equivalence relation. We call this relation ''congruence''.
Note that the equivalence classes defined by congruence are precisely the elements of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

We can find some number ''a'' modulo ''n'' (or we say ''a'' congruent to ''n'') by finding its decomposition using the division algorithm. 

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication work in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; - for example 3 + 6 (mod 8) = 9 (mod 8) = 1 (mod 8). The numbers do look strange but they follow many normal properties such as commutativity and associativity. 

If we have a number greater than ''n'' we often reduce it modulo ''n'' first - again using the division algorithm. For example if we want to find 11+3 mod 8, its often easier to calculate 3 + 3 (mod 8) rather than reducing 14 mod 8. A trick that's often used is that, say, if we have 6 + 7 (mod 8) we can use ''negative'' numbers instead so the problem becomes -2 + -1 = -3 = 5 (mod 8).

We often use the second notation when we want to look at equations involving numbers modulo some ''n''.  For example, we may want to find a number ''x'' such that
: 3''x'' &amp;equiv; 5 (mod 8)

We can find solutions by trial substitution (going through all the numbers 0 through 7), but what if the moduli are very large? We will look at a more systematic solution later.

'''Note''': we often say that we are working in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and use equals signs throughout. Familiarize yourself with the three ways of writing modular equations and expressions.
== Number Bases ==

Converting between various number bases is one of the most tedious processes in [[mathematics]]. 

The numbers that are generally used in transactions are all in base-10. This means that there are 10 digits that are used to describe a number. These ten digits are {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. 

Similarly, base-4 has 4 digits {0,1,2,3} and base-2 has two digits {0,1}. Base two is sometimes referred to as Binary.

There are also bases greater than 10. For these bases, it is customary to use letters to represent digits greater than 10. An example is Base-16 (Hexadecimal). The digits used in this base are {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F}. 

In order to convert between number bases, it is critical that one knows how to divide numbers and find remainders. 

To convert from decimal to another base one must simply start dividing by the value of the other base, then dividing the result of the first division and overlooking the remainder, and so on until the base is larger than the result (so the result of the division would be a zero). Then the number in the desired base is the remainders read from end to start.

The following shows how to convert a number (105) which is in base-10 into base-2.

| 1
|}


Answer : 1101001


After finishing this process, the remainders are taken and placed in a row (from bottom to top) after the final quotient (1101001, in this example) is shown as the base-2 equivalent of the number 105. 

To sum up the process, simply take the original number in base 10, and divide that number repeatedly, keeping track of the remainders, until the quotient becomes less than the numerical value of the base.

This works when converting any number from base-10 to any base. If there are any letters in the base digits, then use the letters to replace any remainder greater than 9. For example, writing 11(of base-10) in base 14.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
! Operation
! Remainder
|-
| 11 / 14 = 0
| B (=11)
|}


Answer: B


As 11 is a single remainder, it is written as a single digit. Following the pattern {10=A, 11=B, 12=C...35=Z}, write it as B. If you were to write &amp;quot;11&amp;quot; as the answer, it would be wrong, as &quot;11&quot; Base-14 is equal to 15 in base-10!

In order to convert from a number in any base back to base ten, the following process should be used:

Take the number 3210 (in base-10). In the units place (10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 0. In the tens place (10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 1. In the hundreds place (10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 2. In the thousands place (10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 3.

The formula to find the value of the above number is:

3×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 2×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 0×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 3000 + 200 + 10 + 0 = '''3210'''.

The process is similar when converting from any base to base-10. For example, take the number 3452 (in base-6). In the units place (6&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 2. In the sixths place (6&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) there is a 5. In the thirty-sixths place (6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 4. In the 216th place (6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a 3.

The formula to find the value of the above number (in base-10) is:

3×6&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4×6&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 5×6&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 2×6&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 648 + 144 + 30 + 2 = '''824'''.

The value of 3452 (base-6) is '''824''' in base-10.

A more efficient algorithm is to add the left-most digit and multiply by the base, and repeat with the next digit and so on.

((3 * 6 + 4) * 6 + 5) * 6 + 2 = 824

The processes to convert between number bases may seem difficult at first, but become easy if one practices often.

== Prime numbers ==
Prime numbers are the building blocks of the integers. A prime number is a positive integer greater than one that has only two divisors: 1, and the number itself. For example, 17 is prime because the only positive integers that divide evenly into it are 1 and 17. The number 6 is not a prime since more than two divsors 1, 2, 3, 6 divide 6. Also, note that 1 is not a prime since 1 has only one divisor.

=== Some prime numbers ===
The prime numbers as a sequence begin
: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, ...

=== Euclid's Proof that There are Infinitely Many Primes ===
The Greek mathematician [[w:Euclid|Euclid]] gave the following elegant proof that there are an infinite number of primes. It relies on the fact that all non-prime numbers --- composites --- have a unique factorization into primes.

Euclid's proof works by contradiction: we will assume that there are a finite number of primes, and show that we can derive a logically contradictory fact.

So here we go. First, we assume that that there are a finite number of primes:

: p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

Now consider the number M defined as follows:

: M = 1 +  p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; *  p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; * ... *  p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

There are two important --- and ultimately contradictory --- facts about the number M:

# It cannot be prime because p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the biggest prime (by our initial assumption), and M is clearly bigger than p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, there must be some prime p that divides M.
# It is not divisible by any of the numbers p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.   Consider what would happen if you tried to divide M by any of the primes in the list p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  From the definition of M, you can tell that you would end up with a remainder of 1. That means that p --- the prime that divides M --- must be bigger than any of p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Thus, we have shown that M is divisible by a prime p that is not on the finite list of all prime. And so there must be an infinite number of primes.


These two facts imply that M must be divisible by a prime number bigger than p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, there cannot be a biggest prime.

Note that this proof does not provide us with a direct way to generate arbitrarily large primes, although it always generates a number which is divisible by a new prime. Suppose we know only one prime: 2.  So, our list of primes is simply p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=2. Then, in the notation of the proof, M=1+2=3.  We note that M is prime, so we add 3 to the list.  Now, M = 1 +2 *3 = 7.  Again, 7 is prime.  So we add it to the list.  Now, M = 1+2*3*7 = 43: again prime.  Continuing in this way one more time, we calculate M = 1+2*3*7*43 = 1807 =13*139.  So we see that M is not prime. 

Viewed another way: note that while 1+2, 1+2*3, 1+2*3*5, 1+2*3*5*7, and 1+2*3*5*7*11 are prime, 1+2*3*5*7*11*13=30031=59*509 is not.

=== Testing for primality ===
There are a number of simple and sophisticated primality tests. We will consider some simple tests here. In upper-level courses we will consider some faster and more sophisticated methods to test whether a number is prime.

====Inspection====
The most immediate and simple test to eliminate a number n as a prime is to inspect the units digit or the last digit of a number. 

If the number n ends in an even number 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 we can show that number n cannot be a prime. For example, take n = 87536 = 8753(10) + 6. Since 10 is divisible by 2 and 6 is divisible by 2 then 87536 must be divisible by 2. In general, any even number can be expressed in the form n = a*10 + b, where b = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Since 10 is divisible by 2 and b is divisible by 2 then n = a*10 + b is divisible by 2. Consequently, any number n which ends in an even number such as 7777732 or 8896 is divisible by 2 so n is not a prime.

In a similar type of argument, if a number n ends in a 5 we can show the number n cannot be a prime. If the last digit of n, call it b, is a 5 we can express n in the form n = a*10 + b, where b = 5. Since 10 is divisible by 5 and b = 5 is divisible by 5 then n = a*10 + b is divisible by 5. Hence, any number n which ends in a 5 such as 93475 is divisible by 5 so n is not a prime. 

Thus, if a number greater than 5 is a prime it must end with either a 1, 3, 7, or 9. Note that this does not mean all numbers that end in a 1, 3, 7, or 9 are primes. For example, while the numbers 11, 23, 37, 59 are primes, the numbers 21 = 3*7, 33 = 3*11, 27 = 3*9, 39 = 3*13 are not primes. Consequently, if a number ends in a 1, 3, 7, or 9 we have to test further.

====Trial Division Method====
To test if a number n that ends in a 1, 3, 7, or 9 is prime, we could simply try the smallest prime number and try to divide it in n. If that doesn't divide, we would take the next largest prime number and try again etc. Certainly, if we took all primes numbers in this manner that were less than n and we could not divide n then we would be justified in saying n is prime. However, it can be shown that you don't have to take all primes smaller than n to test if n is prime. We can stop earlier by using the Trial Division Method.

The justification of the Trial Division Method is if a number n has no divisors less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt; then n must be a prime. We can show this by contradiction. Let us assume n has no divisors less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;. If n is not a prime, there must be two numbers a and b such that &lt;math&gt;a*b = n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, by our assumption &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n} &lt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n} &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;. But then &lt;math&gt;n = \sqrt{n}\sqrt{n} &lt; a*b = n&lt;/math&gt;. Since a number can not be greater than itself the number n must be a prime.

Trial Division Method is a method of primality testing that involves taking a number n and then sequentially dividing it by primes up to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, is 113 prime? &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{113}&lt;/math&gt; is approximately 10.63...
We only need to test whether 2, 3, 5, 7 divide 113 cleanly (leave no remainder, i.e., the quotient is an integer).
:113/2 is not an integer since the last digit is not even.
:113/3 (=37.666...) is not an integer.
:113/5 is not an integer since the last digit does not end in a 0 or 5.
:113/7 (=16.142857...) is not an integer.

So we need not look at any more primes such as 11, 13, 17 etc. less than 113 to test, since 2, 3, 5, 7 does not divide 113 cleanly, 113 is prime.

Notice that after rejecting 2 and 3 as a divisor, we next considered the next prime number 5 and not the next number 4. We know not to consider 4 because we know 2 does not divide 113. If 2 cannot divide 113 then certainly 4 cannot because if 4 divided 113 and since 2 divides 4 then 2 would divide 113. So we only use the next cheapest available prime to test not the next consecutive number.

If we test 91 we get,

:91/2 is not an integer since that last digit is not even.
:91/3= (30.333) is not an integer.
:91/5= is not an integer since the last digit does not end in a 0 or 5.
:91/7=13 is an integer

So we know since 7 divides 91, 91 is not a prime.

Trial division is normally only used for relatively small numbers due to its inefficiency. However this technique has the two advantages that firstly once we have tested a number we know for sure that it is prime and secondly if a number is not prime it also gives us the number's factors.

To obtain a few small primes, it may be best to use the [[w:Sieve of Eratosthenes|Sieve of Eratosthenes]] than to test each number sequentially using trial division. The Sieve of Eratosthenes method is basically a process of finding primes by elimination. We start by taking a list of consecutive numbers say 1 to 100. Cross out the number 1 because the number is not prime. Take the next least uncrossed off number which is 2 and circle it. Now cross out all multiples of 2 on the list. Next take the next least uncircled number which is 3. Circle the number 3 and cross out all multiples of 3. The next least uncircled number should be 5 since 4 is a multiple of 2 and should have been crossed off. Circle the number 5 and cross out all multiples of 5. The next least uncircled number should be a 7 since 6 is a multiple of 2. Circle the 7 and mark off all multiples of 7. Now the next uncrossed off number should be 11 since 8,9,10 is a multiple of 2, 3, and 2. If we continue in this manner what is left is the circled numbers which are primes. But notice we can actually stop now and circle all the unmarked numbers after crossing off multiples of 7 because of the result that since &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{100} = 10&lt;/math&gt; any number less than 100 which is not prime must be divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.

== The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic ==
'''The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic''' is an important theorem relating to the factorization of numbers. The theorem basically states that every positive integer can be written as the product of prime numbers in a unique way (ignoring reordering the product of prime numbers).

In particular, '''The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic''' means any number such as 1,943,032,663 is either a prime or can be factored into a product of primes. If a number such as 1,943,032,663 can be factored into primes such as 11&amp;times;13&amp;times;17&amp;times;19&amp;times;23&amp;times;31&amp;times;59 it is futile to try to find another different combination of prime numbers that will also give you the same number.

To make the theorem work even for the number 1, we think of 1 as being the product of zero prime numbers.

More formally,
:For all ''n''&amp;isin;'''N'''
::''n''=p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;...
:where the p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are all prime numbers, and can be repeated.

Here are some examples.
: 4 = 2 &amp;times; 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 12 = 2 &amp;times; 2 &amp;times; 3 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; 3
: 11 = 11.
A proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic will be given after Bezout's identity has been established.

== LCM and GCD ==
Two characteristics we can determine between two numbers based on their factorizations are the ''lowest common multiple'', the ''LCM'' and ''greatest common divisor'', the ''GCD'' (also ''greatest common factor'', ''GCF'')

=== LCM===
The lowest common multiple, or the least common multiple, for two numbers a and b is the smallest number designated by LCM(a,b) that is divisible by both the number a and the number b. We can find LCM(a,b) by finding the prime factorization of a and b and choosing the maximum power for each prime factor.

In another words, if the number a factors to &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;, and the number b factors to &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\beta_1}p_2^{\beta_2}\cdots p_n^{\beta_n}&lt;/math&gt;, then LCM(a,b) = &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\gamma_1}p_2^{\gamma_2}\cdots p_n^{\gamma_n}&lt;/math&gt;  
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i = Maximum (\alpha_i, \beta_i)&lt;/math&gt; for ''i'' = ''1 to n''.

An example, let us see the process on how we find lowest common multiple for 5500 and 450 which happens to be 49500. First, we find the prime factorization for 5500 and 450 which is
:5500=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11  
:450=2 3&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

Notice the different primes we came up for both the number 5500 and the number 450 are 2, 3, 5, and 11. Now let us express 5500 and 450 completely in a product of these primes raised to the appropriate power.
:5500=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;1 
:450=2 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;0

The LCM(5500,450) is going to be in the form 2&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;. All we now have to do is find what the powers of each individual prime will be.

So now we compare the power of each prime for 5500 and 450. Let us consider the powers of the first prime 2. In the number 5500, the prime 2 is raised to the second power and in the number 450, prime 2 is raised to the first power. Since the maximum between 2 and 1 for the power of the prime 2 is 2, we use 2 for the power of the prime 2.

Now let us consider the powers of the prime 3. In the number 5500, the prime 3 is raised to the zero power and in the number 450 the prime 3 is raised to the second power. Since the maximum between 0 and 2 for the power of the prime 3 is 2, we use 2 for the power of the prime 3.

Similarly, let us consider the powers of the next prime 5. In the number 5500, the prime 5 is raised to the third power and in the number 450 the prime 5 is raised to the second power. Since the maximum between 3 and 2 for the power of the prime 5 is 3, we use 3 for the power of the prime 5.

Finally, let us consider the powers of the prime 11, the last prime on our list. In the number 5500, the prime 11 is raised to the first power and in the number 450 the prime 11 is raised to the zero power. Since the maximum between 1 and 0 for the power of the prime 11 is 1, we use 1 for the power of the last prime 11.

Consequently, the product of our results is LCM(5500,450)=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 49500.

=== GCD===
The greatest common divisor for two numbers a and b is the biggest number designated by GCD(a,b) that divides both the number a and the number b. In a similar process to finding LCM(a,b), we can find GCD(a,b) by finding the prime factorization of a and b but choosing the minimum power for each prime factor instead.

In other words, if the number a factors to &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_n^{\alpha_n}&lt;/math&gt;, and the number b factors to &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\beta_1}p_2^{\beta_2}\cdots p_n^{\beta_n}&lt;/math&gt;, then GCD(a,b) = &lt;math&gt;p_1^{\gamma_1}p_2^{\gamma_2}\cdots p_n^{\gamma_n}&lt;/math&gt;  
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i = Minimum (\alpha_i, \beta_i)&lt;/math&gt; for ''i'' = ''1 to n''.

An example, let us see the process on how we find the greatest common divisor for 5500 and 450 which happens to be 50. First, we find the prime factorization for 5500 and 450 which is
:5500=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11  
:450=2 3&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 

Notice the different primes we came up for both the number 5500 and the number 450 are 2, 3, 5, and 11. Now let us express 5500 and 450 completely in a product of these primes raised to the appropriate power.
:5500=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11 = 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;1 
:450=2 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;0

The GCD(5500,450) is going to be in the form 2&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;?&lt;/sup&gt;. All we now have to do is find what the powers of each individual prime will be.

So now we compare the power of each prime for 5500 and 450. Let us consider the powers of the first prime 2. In the number 5500, the prime 2 is raised to the second power and in the number 4&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
50, prime 2 is raised to the first power. Since the minimum between 2 and 1 for the power of the prime 2 is 1, we use 1 for the power of the prime 2.

Now let us consider the powers of the prime 3. In the number 5500, the prime 3 is raised to the zero power and in the number 450 the prime 3 is raised to the second power. Since the minimum between 0 and 2 for the power of the prime 3 is 0, we use 0 for the power of the prime 3.

Similarly, let us consider the powers of the next prime 5. In the number 5500, the prime 5 is raised to the third power and in the number 450 the prime 5 is raised to the second power. Since the minimum between 3 and 2 for the power of the prime 5 is 2, we use 2 for the power of the prime 5.

Finally, let us consider the powers of the prime 11, the last prime on our list. In the number 5500, the prime 11 is raised to the first power and in the number 450 the prime 11 is raised to the zero power. Since the minimum between 1 and 0 for the power of the prime 11 is 0, we use 0 for the power of the last prime 11.

Consequently, the product of our results is GCD(5500,450)=2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 11&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 50.

==== Properties ====
*gcd(''a'',''b'')=gcd(''b'',''a'')
*gcd(''a'',''b'') = gcd(''b'',''q''), where ''q'' is the remainder of a divided by b
*gcd(''a''/''d'', ''b''/''d'')=1, where ''d'' is gcd(''a'',''b'')

== The Euclidean algorithm ==
The Euclidean algorithm is such that we can find the gcd of two numbers without finding the factorization&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The Euclidean algorithm consists of only addition and multiplication, and uses the above properties of gcd as its basis.

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; Factorization is a &quot;hard&quot; process, that is, to factor a number takes a long time depending on the length of the number. This is why later, when you need to find the gcd of a pair of numbers, you will most likely ''never'' factorize the numbers and use the properties of the primes but will use the Euclidean algorithm instead.

=== An example ===
We will see how this works by calculating gcd(458,44)
&lt;!-- Chosen so the k and r below are different to each other --&gt;

First, divide 458 by 44 and obtain the remainder: 
: 458 = 44 &amp;times; 10 + 18

Now suppose that a number is a common divisor of 458 and 44.  Then it must also be a divisor of 18.  To see this, rearrange the above equation to:
:458 - 44&amp;times;10 =18

When this equation is divided by a common divisor of 44 and 458, an integer is obtained on the left, and so must also be obtained on the right.  This, by definition, means that the number is also a divisor of 18.  By the same reasoning, any common divisor of 18 and 44 is also a divisor of 458.  Since all of the common divisors of 458 and 44 are equal to common divisors of 44 and 18, then in particular the greatest common divisors are equal. So we have gcd(458,44)=gcd(44,18)

The next step in the algorithm is to divide 44 by 18 and find the remainder.
: 44 = 18 &amp;times; ''k'' + ''r''
: 44 = 18 &amp;times; 2 + 8
Repeat this process; keep dividing the previous divisor by the previous remainder:
: 18 = 8 &amp;times; 2 + 2
: 8 = 2 &amp;times; 4 + 0

Our gcd is the last remainder before the zero, in this case, 2.  This is because the reasoning that proved gcd(458,44)=gcd(44,18) applies at every step, so gcd(458,44)=gcd(44,18)=gcd(18,8)=gcd(8,2)=gcd(2,0)=2.

=== The Matrix Method ===

We can construct a matrix that provides an alternative method for calculating the greatest common divisor.  In its general form, the matrix is

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; b \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; a \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that one way to write the gcd of two numbers is as an '''integral linear combination'''.  If we are finding the gcd, for example, we could represent it as ''as + bt'', where ''a'' and ''b'' are the two numbers we are comparing, and ''s'' and ''t'' are integers.  We also know that ''b = aq + r'' where ''r'' is the remainder upon division of ''b'' by ''a''.  After we subtract row 2 from row 1, we get

&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -q_{1} &amp; r_{1} \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; a \\
 \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

If r_2 is nonzero, we must continue the process; this time, subtracting row 1 from row 2.  We continue this process until one of the '' r's '' has been reduced as far as possible.  We now have our gcd.  The numbers that are in that row, where the 1 and the 0 used to be, represent ''t'' and ''s'', respectively.

Let us now look at a computational example.

&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 99 \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 \\
 \end{bmatrix} \rightsquigarrow 
\begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; 0 &amp; 99 \\
   0 &amp; 14 &amp; 98 \\
   \end{bmatrix} \rightsquigarrow
 \begin{bmatrix}
   1 &amp; -14 &amp; 1 \\
   0 &amp; 14 &amp; 98 \\
   \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We see that it would be trivial at this point to go any further; we would just end up with row-2 containing a zero where ''a'' used to be.  So we look at row-1 and remember that the ''1'' represents our remainder, 1(=t) multiplies ''b'' and -14(=s) multiplies ''a'' such that


&lt;math&gt;1 = 99 \times 1 + -14 \times 7 &lt;/math&gt;

This can be checked by the Euclidean algorithm that gcd(7,99)=1.

== The extended Euclidean algorithm ==
What happens if we try and reverse the process of the Euclidean algorithm by substituting back? &lt;!-- note to self: give example. --&gt;Back-substitution is rather tedious and prone to error, so here is a faster method. 

Draw up a table with four columns, label these from left to right ''q'', ''r'', ''u'', ''v''. For convenience label a column ''i'' representing the step we're currently up to. Place ''a'' and ''b'' with the greater of these on top in the column ''r'', and place 1s and 0s accordingly:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
i &amp; q &amp; r &amp; u &amp; v \\
-1 &amp; . &amp; b &amp; 0 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; . &amp; a &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now iterate downwards by taking the quotient of ''b''/''a'' and putting it in the next space in the ''q'' column, then of ''b''-''aq'' in the ''r'' column. 

To update ''u'' and ''v'', take 
:''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;i-2&lt;/sub&gt;-''u''&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
:''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i-2&lt;/sub&gt;-''v''&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Indeed, you are looking for ''u'' and ''v'' such that a''u'' + b''v'' = gcd (a,b).
At some point, gcd (a,b) is in fact the remainder at the
ith stage, so you might as well compute u&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; such
that a''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + b''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, at EACH stage.

Deriving the recurrences found above results from these three
equations (the second equation is Euclid's algorithm's basic property, the other two are constraints we set to attain our desired goal):

:a''u''&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; + b''v''&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt;
:r&lt;sub&gt;i-2&lt;/sub&gt; = q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;i-1&lt;/sub&gt; + r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;
:a''u''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + b''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

The trick is to then appropriately express r&lt;sub&gt;i-2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

Stop writing when you obtain a 0 in the ''r'' column. 

Finding then, gcd(450,44) (this is the same as gcd(44,450) )

&lt;!-- unroll this --&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
i  &amp; q  &amp; r   &amp; u  &amp; v \\
-1 &amp; .  &amp; 450 &amp; 0  &amp; 1 \\
0  &amp; .  &amp; 44  &amp; 1  &amp; 0 \\
1  &amp; 10 &amp; 10  &amp; -10  &amp; 1 \\
2  &amp; 4  &amp; 4   &amp; 41 &amp; -4 \\
3  &amp; 2  &amp; \mathbf{2}   &amp; -92  &amp; 9 \\
4  &amp; 2  &amp; 0   &amp; -  &amp; - \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The bold number is the gcd. Observe (9)&amp;times;450+(-92)&amp;times;44=2
Clearly these ''u'' and ''v'' are very special. What can we say about the general case?

=== Bezout's identity ===
In the above case we have 9&amp;times;450+(-92)&amp;times;44=gcd(450,44). So the greatest common divisor of 450 and 44 can be written as a linear combination of 450 and 44 with integer coefficients.  This turns out to be true of any pair of integers.  This result is known as &quot;Bezout's Identity&quot; and can be stated as follows:
: For any pair of nonzero integers, ''a'' and ''b'', there exists integers ''u'' and ''v'' such that
:: ''au''+''bv''=''gcd(a,b)''
''Proof''
:If ''a'' and ''b'' are any pair of integers, not both 0, then clearly there exist integers ''u'' and ''v'' such that ''au''+''bv'' is positive (just match the signs of ''u'' and ''v'' to those of ''a'' and ''b'', respectivly, for instance), and for all integer ''u'' and ''v'', ''au''+''bv'' is also an integer (because the integers are closed under addition and multiplication).  So there is a non-empty set of positive integers consisting of numbers of the form ''au''+''bv''; call it S.  Since S is a non-empty set of positive integers, it must have a smallest element (this is the so called  [[w:Well-ordering principle|Well-ordering principle]]).  Call this number ''d''.  The claim is that &lt;math&gt;d=gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.  Since ''d'' belongs to S, then 

:(1)&lt;math&gt;d=ua + vb&lt;/math&gt; 

:for suitable ''u'' and ''v''.  Let ''n'' be any positive common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''.  Since ''n'' divides the right side of (1), it also divides d.  So &lt;math&gt;d=qn&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;q\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.  So any common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' is less than or equal to ''d''.  Therefore, if ''d'' is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', it is the greatest one.  It only remains to show that ''d'' is in fact a common divisor.  

:To prove this, it will be shown that any element of S is divisible by ''d''.  This will prove that ''d'' is a common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'' because ''a'' and ''b'' are both elements of S  (because ''a'' = 1&amp;times;a + 0&amp;times;b and''b'' = 0&amp;times;a + 1&amp;times;b). Let ''t'' be any element of S.  Then, by the division algorithm 
:&lt;math&gt;t=qd+r&lt;/math&gt;

:for some  &lt;math&gt;0\leq r&lt;d&lt;/math&gt;.  If ''r'' is not 0, then it is in S.  This is because ''d'' and ''t'' are in S, so
:&lt;math&gt;r=t-qd=(u_1a+v_1b)-q(u_2a+v_2b)=(u_1-qu_2)a+(v_1-qv_2)b=u'a+v'b&lt;/math&gt; 
:But, since &lt;math&gt;r&lt;d&lt;/math&gt; and ''d'' is the least element of S, this is impossible.  The only other possibility is that ''r=0''.  Therefore any element, ''t'', of S is divisible by ''d''.  Since this includes both ''a'' and ''b'', ''d'' is a common divisor.  Combining this with the previous result establishes Bezout's Identity.

The numbers ''u'' and ''v'' can either be obtained using the tabular methods or backsubstitution in the Euclidean Algorithm.

== Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic ==
One use of Bezout's identity is in a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.  Before this is proven, two other results are needed:
Lemma 1: If a prime number, ''p'', divides a product of two integers, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;, then it must divide ''a'' or ''b'' (or both).
:''Proof:'' If ''p'' divides both ''a'' and ''b'', there is nothing to prove.  Assume ''p'' does not divide ''a''.  If it can be proven under that assumption that ''p'' does divide ''b'', the lemma will be proven.  
:Since ''p'' does not divide ''a'', then ''gcd(a,p)''=1 (because the only divisors of ''p'' are 1 and ''p'', but ''p'' is not a common divisor).  Therefore, by Bezout's Identity, there exist integers ''u'' and ''v'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;1=ua+vp&lt;/math&gt;
:Multiply this equation by ''b'' to obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;b=uab+vbp&lt;/math&gt;
:''p'' divides both terms on the right hand side and, therefore, divides the left hand side.  Hence, ''p'' divides ''b'', as was to be shown.
Lemma 2: If a prime number, ''p'', divides a product of integers, &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_n&lt;/math&gt;, then it must divide at least one of the factors.
:''Proof'': The proof is by [[w:mathematical induction|induction]] on ''n'', the number of factors.  The statement is true for n=2, by Lemma 1.  Assume the statement is true for ''n=k'' and consider a product of ''k''+1 factors.  If ''p'' divides more than one of the factors, once again there is nothing to prove.  Assume that ''p'' does not divide any of the factors &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, ... a_k&lt;/math&gt;.  It will be shown that ''p'' must divide &lt;math&gt;a_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the statement is true for n=k, then since ''p'' does not divide any of the factors in &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_k&lt;/math&gt;, it must not divive the product (by [[w:Contrapositive|Contrapositive]]).  Let &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_k=b&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_ka_{k+1}=ba_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.  The conclusion then follows by Lemma 1.
'''Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic''':Any positive integer, ''n'', can be expressed as a product of primes.  This product is unique up to the order in which the terms appear.
:''Proof'':  The proof of the first part of the theorem is by induction on ''n''.  If ''n''=1, it is the product of 0 primes.  Assume all positive integers less than ''n'' can be expressed as a product of primes.  If ''n'' is prime, then it is the product of 1 prime.  Assume ''n'' is not prime or 1.  Then &lt;math&gt;n=ab&lt;/math&gt;,for some positive integers ''a'' and ''b'' both less than ''n''.  Since ''a'' and ''b'' are both less than ''n'', they can be written as a product of primes by the induciton hypothesis.  Combining these products gives ''n'' as a product of primes as required.
:Now to prove the second part.  Assume there are two prime factorizations of ''n'', 
:&lt;math&gt;n=p_1p_2...p_k=q_1q_2...q_s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; divides the left side and so must also divide the right side.  By Lemma 2, this means that &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; must divide one of the &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  But these are all prime, so the only way &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; can divide &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; is if &lt;math&gt;p_1=q_i&lt;/math&gt; for some ''i''.  Canceling &lt;math&gt;p_1&lt;/math&gt; from both sides of the equation forms another equation of the same form.  So it can likewise be proven that &lt;math&gt;p_2=q_i&lt;/math&gt; for some other ''i'', and so on until all the factors on the left are exhausted.  After this, there must not be any factors remaining on the right side since it must equal 1.  This proves that any two prime factorizations consist of the same prime factors, as was to be shown.

== Solving linear modular equations - back to Bezout ==
Bezout's identity above provides us with the key to solving equations in the form
: ''ax'' &amp;equiv; ''b'' (mod ''m'')

=== Coprime case - gcd(''a'', ''m'') is 1 ===
Consider the case where 
: ''ax'' &amp;equiv; ''b'' (mod ''m'')
but with gcd(''a'', ''m'')=1

Because of Bezout's identity 
: 1 = ''au''+''mv''
When we calculate ''u'', this number is special.

Say if we have the equation
: 4''x''=11 (mod 21)
4 and 21 are coprime since gcd(4,21)=1. Now 1=4*16+(-3)*(21). Our ''u'' in this case is 16. Observe now that 4*16=64. 64 (mod 21) = 1. This number ''u'' is very special - it is known as the ''multiplicative inverse''. It is the number ''u'' on multiplication by ''a'' gives 1 mod ''m''. Bezout's identity on calculating gcd(''a'', ''m'') will always give you the multiplicative inverse of ''a'' modulo ''m''. The multiplicative inverse of ''a'' is often written ''a''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; but note that this does '''''not''''' mean 1/''a'' since we have seen in the first sections that we can not always divide in the integers.

Note that in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; there is one number ''without'' a multiplicative inverse - 0. It may be useful to exclude 0 when considering modular arithmetic, so instead of having to say '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;\{0} all the time, we merely write '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

Now since we have the magic multiplicative inverse, our problem becomes relatively easy to solve. 4&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=16 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; and now, on multiplying throughout by 16
: ''x'' = 11 &amp;times; 16 (mod 21)
(since 4&amp;times;16=1 because 16 is 4's multiplicative inverse mod 21). 11&amp;times;16=176 and using a calculator or using the division theorem we obtain
: ''x'' = 8 (mod 21)

which is our solution! Verify - 8&amp;times;4 = 32 = 11 (mod 21).

=== The general case ===
Consider the general case where 
: ''ax'' &amp;equiv; ''b'' (mod ''m'')
with no restrictions on ''a'', ''b'' and ''m''.

Firstly we calculate 
== gcd ==
gcd(''a'', ''m'') again to obtain ''d''. Now ''d'' is a ''divisor'' since the ''d'' in gc''d'' means greatest common divisor. So we can now divide ''a'' and ''m'' - but what about ''b''? Since we have calculated the gcd of ''a'' and ''m'' '''but not ''b''''' we have no guarantees that ''d'' will divide ''b''. This then becomes a condition that the equation has no solution.

Now we have reduced the problem to the previous coprime case because gcd(''a''/''d'', ''m''/''d'')=1 with ''d'' as above. However we do not have 1 solution any more - this is true because we have reduced the solution to being ''x'' = ''c'' (mod ''m''/''d'') and we must bring the solution back mod ''m''. This will be come clearer in the examples.

Let's work through some examples.

'''Example 1.''' Solve 4''x'' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 20).
Firstly, gcd(4, 20) = 4. 4 does not divide 3 and we have no solution.

'''Example 2.''' Solve 9''x'' &amp;equiv; 6 (mod 15).
gcd(9, 15) = 3 and 3 does divide 6 and we have 3 solutions. 

Now, divide through by 3 to obtain
: 3''x'' &amp;equiv; 2 (mod 5)
gcd(3, 5) = 1 = 3 &amp;times; 2 + -1 &amp;times; 5
So the inverse of 3 mod 5 is 2. Now we obtain the solution
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; 4 (mod 5) 
Now in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; we must obtain the two extra solutions 9 and 14 mod 15 - 9 mod 5 = 4 and 14 mod 5 = 4.

Generally we can say that if we have the solution to the reduced equation ''x'', the general solution is ''x''+(''m''/''d'')''k'' for ''k''={0, 1, .., ''d''-1}.

Are we planning to add complex vector notation (polar notation) here or add that on a separate page?

(Descriptions provided for people inexperienced with complex math)

Essentially: R''e''^(&amp;theta;''i''), where R = the absolute value of the complex number and theta is the angle from the (1,0''i'') in the counterclockwise direction.

To convert R''e''^(&amp;theta;''i'') to rectangular notation or complex number format, multiply R times sin(&amp;theta;) for the imaginary and R times cos(&amp;theta;) for the real dimension.  Ergo, from this method of calculation we can determine that ''e''^(&amp;pi;&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;''i'') = -1.

Additionally, what about hypercomplex numbers, such as [[w:quaternions|quaternions]] and [[w:octonions|octonions]]?

Quaternion = a + b''i'' + c''j'' + d''k''&lt;br&gt;
where ''i'' = (-1)^(1/2); ''j'' = (-1)^(1/2); ''k'' = (-1)^(1/2)&lt;br&gt;
and ''ijk'' = -1; ''ij'' = ''k''; ''ji'' = -''k''; et al...

-- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 23:34, 20 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Yes yes, you'll get polar notation and a whole lot more, just wait till I add it! I'm trying to expound this in a logical manner, don't worry :) Quaternions and octonions won't be in complex numbers because they are hypercomplex. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:19, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Just seeing if you needed help, that's all.  BTW, should we start a hypercomplex number article, then? -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 20:47, 21 Sep 2003 (UTC)
:: Sorry about the belatedness...sure, why not? :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:58, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)
:::It looks like hypercomplex numbers would best go in [[Discrete mathematics]] so I think I'll add it there... -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 17:38, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)

==Introduction Section Editing==
Guys, I just edited the introduction section by adding the last para which makes the concept of complex numbers more coherent. - HellKing
==i==
It is a common mistake to define
:&lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The right definition is to introduce a new number i such that:
:&lt;math&gt;\,i^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;.
which is not equivalent to the first!

==Complex numbers==
Better than considering complex numbers as matrices, it is more didactical considering them as pairs of real numbers.

== Engineering notation ==

A suggestion: maybe it would be interesting to add the fact that in engineering notation the imaginary part of a complex number is usually referred to as j instead of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (because electric current is also referred to as I). Of course, I don't know about American engineering standards, but as a (European) engineering student I was told to adapt to this convention, even though I of course surely also do understand what is meant by using &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; as a means to indicate the complex part of a complex number.






There's also a convention (in some old engineering texts), to use cis &amp;theta; instead of (cos&amp;theta; + &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;sin&amp;theta;). --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 19:31, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

== Euler's formula ==

How come one prove that
: ''r''e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; = r (cos &amp;theta; + i sin &amp;theta;)
if ''r''e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; is not even defined?


''i'' is defined, and so is e&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt; via Taylor series.  If you want, you can define ''r''e&lt;sup&gt;i&amp;theta;&lt;/sup&gt; through a Taylor series, and see that this has the same radius of convergence of e&lt;sup&gt;z&lt;/sup&gt; and equate them.  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 19:34, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

== Cauchy ==

Is stuff about Cauchy's Line integral theorem &amp;c. with line integrals under the Argand Plane, going to be included here?  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 19:39, 17 April 2006 (UTC)


== Wow ==

I think this page goes way too far. Half this stuff deserves to be in Calculus, not Algebra. We all learned primary ideas about Complex Numbers in Algebra, but this definitely will confuse most readers</text>

The reason electricity has become so popular over the last 100 years or so is because it is a very good way of moving ''energy'' from one place to another. When you buy a light bulb is usually rated in watts. The watt is a unit of ''power''. In this unit you are going to lean some equations rating current voltage, energy and power and apply the equations.

==Definition of power==
Power is defined as the rate of energy flow. Its unit is the watt &amp;mdash; one watt is one joule per second.

In electrical circuits the power can be found by multiplying the current and voltage together. One way of remembering this is to use an equation triangle like the one below. Memorize the positions of the symbols. ''P'' is power, ''V'' is voltage and ''I'' is current. If you want to know the power, cover its symbol up and what you have left is ''I''&amp;times;''V'', or current times voltage. Want to know the voltage? Cover it up and what you have left is ''P''&amp;divide;''I'', or power divided by current.
[[Image:Power_is_V_times_I_triangle.png]]


===Where does the equation ''P'' equals ''VI'' come from?===

From the definition above power is energy ''E'' per unit time ''t''. ( how many joules '''per''' second}
:''P'' = ''E''/''t''

So where does ''P'' = ''IV'' come from?

To find out we look at what ''I'' and ''V'' are defined as. ''I'' is electrical current. It is the amount of charge ''Q'' flowing past any point every sec. The voltage also determines the current, so the power is directly proportional to the voltage and the current. We know that from the definition of the volt, if 1 amp flows for 1 second, with a 1 volt potential difference, 1 joule of energy is used up per second, and therefore the power is 1 Watt.

==Examples==
Michael plugs a 100 W light bulb into the mains, what is the resistance of the bulb?
To find the resistance we need to know the current, to find the current we use the equation for power.Covering up the ''I'' in the triangle gives:

::''I'' = ''P''/''V'' = (100 W)/(230 V)
::= 0.435 A

Now we can use this in the equation for resistance. 

::''R'' = ''V''/''I''
::= (230 V)/(0.435 A)
::= 529 &amp;Omega;

How much charge flows through this bulb in 15 seconds?

We use the definition of current, to work this out.

''I'' = ''C''/''t''   

So ''C'' =''It''  = (0.435 A)(15 s)  = 6.53 coulombs (C)

How much electrical energy is converted into heat and light energy in 15 s?

For this we use the equation for power in its energy per second form.

''P'' = ''E''/''t''

So ''E'' = ''Pt'' = (100 W)(15 s) = 1500 joules (J)

'''Q1)''' Put Ohm's law into a triangle like the one above.

'''Q2)''' If a current of 3 A flows through a 12 V heater, how much energy will it transfer in half an hour? How much charge will have flowed through the heater in the same time?

'''Q3)''' In the USA mains voltage is only 120 V. If a 60 W light bulb is connected to the mains in the USA, what current flows through it ? 

'''Q4)'''What current would flow through the same bulb if plugged into the mains in the UK (230 V) and what would be the power?
----
Before we go on to looking at power transmission in the power lines of the national grid, we need to look at how energy is generated. We'll come back to this topic later on, after we look at the next module, which is on the magnetic effects of current.

'''Summary'''
* Power is the ''rate'' of flow of energy. Power = energy/time
* The unit of power is the watt, where 1 watt is 1 joule per second
* Electrical power can be found by multiplying current and voltage. (''P'' = ''IV'')

----
The '''endoplasmic reticulum''' (endoplasmic=&quot;within the [[w:cytoplasm|cytoplasm]]&quot;, reticulum=&quot;little net&quot;; short : ER) is an important organelle in all [[w:eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]]. [[w:prokaryote|Prokaryotic organisms]] do not have organelles and thus do not have an ER. It's base structure and composition is similar to the [[w:plasma membrane|plasma membrane]], though it is an extension of the [[w:nuclear membrane|nuclear membrane]]. The ER is the site of the [[w:protein synthesis|translation]] and folding of and transport of [[w:protein|protein]]s that are to become part of the [[w:cell membrane|cell membrane]] (e.g., [[w:transmembrane receptor|transmembrane receptor]]s and other [[w:integral membrane protein|integral membrane protein]]s) as well as proteins that are to be secreted or &quot;[[w:exocytosis|exocytosed]]&quot; from the cell (e.g., digestive [[w:enzyme|enzyme]]s).

The ER consists of an extensive membrane network of tubes and [[w:cisterna|cisterna]]e (sac-like structures). The membrane encloses a space, the cisternal space (or internal lumen) from the [[w:cytosol|cytosol]]. This space is acting as a gateway. Parts of the ER membrane are continuous with the outer membrane of the [[w:nuclear envelope|nuclear envelope]], and the cisternal space of the ER is continuous with the space in between the two layers of the nuclear envelope.

Parts of the ER are covered with [[w:ribosome|ribosome]]s (which assemble amino acids into proteins based on instructions from the nucleus). Their rough appearance under electron microscopy led to their being called rough ER (RER), other parts are free of ribosomes and are called smooth ER (SER). The ribosomes on the surface of the rough ER insert the freshly produced proteins directly into the ER, which processes them and then passes them on to the [[w:Golgi apparatus|Golgi apparatus]] (Fig. 1).

Rough and smooth ER differ not only in appearance, but also in function. While the rough ER manufactures and transports proteins destined for membranes and secretion, the smooth ER has functions in several metabolic processes. It takes part in the synthesis of various [[w:lipid|lipid]]s (e.g., for building membranes) and [[w:steroid|steroid]]s (e.g., [[w:hormone|hormone]]s), and also plays an important role in [[w:carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrate metabolism]], detoxification of the cell, and [[w:calcium|calcium]] storage.

Proteins that are transported by the ER and from there throughout the cell are marked with an address tag that are called a [[w:protein targeting|signal sequence]]. [[w:Günter Blobel|Günter Blobel]] was awarded the [[w:1999|1999]] [[w:Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for his discovery of these signal sequences in 1975. The N-terminus (one end) of a [[w:polypeptide|polypeptide]] chain (e.g., a protein) contains a few [[w:amino acid|amino acid]]s that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Proteins that are destined for places outside the ER are packed into transport [[w:vesicle|vesicle]]s and moved along the [[w:cytoskeleton|cytoskeleton]] towards their destination.

== The Ablative Case ==

The ablative case in Latin has 4 main uses:

# With certain prepositions, eg. in, cum, sub
# Instrumental ablative, expressing the equivalent of English &quot;by&quot;, &quot;with&quot; or &quot;using&quot;
# Locative Ablative, using the ablative by itself to mean &quot;in&quot;, locating an action in space or time
# Ablative of separation or origin, expressing the equivalent of English &quot;from&quot;

The different uses of the ablative will be dealt progressively.  For a summary of all forms of the ablative, please consult the Appendix.

== Grammar Part 5: The Power of the Ablative Case ==

Ablative generally indicates position in time and/or space (i.e. when and where). It can also indicate the idea of ways of getting to a location, abstractly or concretely.

===Ablative of Means===
====Exercise====
How would you translate &quot;I made the toga by hand&quot;?

*'''''Hint:''' You would not (and should not) use the genitive. The case you are studying right now can be used &lt;u&gt;by itself&lt;/u&gt; for this goal.''
*'''''Hint:''' Remember that you won't need to use the pronoun &quot;I,&quot; since Latin is based not on word order, but on the endings!''
*'''''Glossary:'''''
*: &quot;to make&quot; - ''Facio'' (&quot;I make&quot;), ''facere'' (&quot;to make&quot;), ''feci'' (&quot;I made&quot;), ''factus'' (&quot;made&quot;)  
*: &quot;toga&quot; - ''Toga'', ''togae'' feminine
*: &quot;hand&quot; - ''Manus'', ''manus'' feminine (This is fourth declension)

=====Answer=====
Answer: ''Togam manu feci''. 

In this case, the word &quot;manu&quot; is in the ablative (see fourth declension list) and thus means &quot;by hand.&quot; 

====Exercise====
I have my wisdom by means of my teacher.

*''''Glossary''':''
*: &quot;wisdom&quot; - ''Sapientia, sapientiae'' feminine 
*: &quot;to have&quot; - ''Habeo'' (&quot;I have&quot;), ''habere'' (&quot;to have&quot;), ''habui'' (&quot;I had&quot;), ''habitus'' (&quot;had&quot;)
*: &quot;teacher&quot; - ''Magister, magistri'' masculine (This is a second declension word, despite the 'r' at the end, like puer.)

=====Answer=====
Answer: ''Habeo sapientiam magistro.''

===Ablative of Time ===
How would you say: ''I will arrive at the 5th hour.''

'at the 5th hour' is indicating position of time. Thus, it can be put into the ablative case, giving:

&lt;i&gt;adveniam quinta hora&lt;/i&gt;

In general, therefore, in order to say &quot;In the morning&quot;, &quot;At nine O'clock,&quot; or &quot;In the tenth year,&quot; use ablative. It is generally used to refer to a specific time in which something has, does, or will occur.

Example: I will leave in the night.

Hint: Future tense can be looked up in the appendices of this Wikibook!

Hint: to leave- discedo, discedere; night- nox, noctis(This is a third declension word!)

=====Answer=====

Answer: Discedam nocte.

Note the simplicity in which Latin translates the six words into simply two. The ending based language completely negates the need for the words &quot;I,&quot; &quot;will,&quot; &quot;in,&quot; and &quot;the.&quot;

===Ablative of Place===
''Naves navigabant mari.'' The ships were sailing on the sea. 

The ablative is also useful for showing the location of things, in general where you would use the words on, in, or at. There is an exception for the slightly more archaic locative, which is used with the words ''domi'' (from ''domus, domus, f.'', home), ''ruri'' (from ''rus, ruris, n.'', country [as opposed to city]), and ''Romae'' (from ''Roma, Romae, f.'', Rome), as well as with the names of towns, cities and small islands. 

Latin has its own way of handling prepositions depending on the nouns and their cases in the sentence, including the versatile ''in'', which can take many different meanings depending upon the case of the object.

==Ablative with prepositions==

Here are a few prepositions that can take the ablative (for a fuller list, see the lesson on adverbs and prepositions in the previous chapter):

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| &lt;B&gt;Latin&lt;/B&gt; || &lt;B&gt;English&lt;/B&gt;
|-
| ''in''&lt;ref&gt;Means &quot;into&quot; or &quot;against&quot; when used with the accusative&lt;/ref&gt; || in, on
|-
|''a/ab'' || from
|-
|''de'' || down from, concerning
|-
|''e/ex'' || out of, out from
|-
|''cum'' || with
|-
|''sine'' || without
|-
|''pro'' || on behalf of, in front of
|-
|''super''&lt;ref&gt;Has static meaning when used with the ablative but connotes motion when used with the accusative&lt;/ref&gt; || upon, above, beyond
|-
|''sub''&lt;ref&gt;Usually means &quot;up to&quot; or &quot;up to the foot of&quot; when used with the accusative&lt;/ref&gt; || under, beneath
|}


&lt;references/&gt; 

As a general rule, when motion is implied, use the accusative, but when location is implied

&lt;!--
A legal metaphor: To accuse a noun is to get into a long process, and stay in the same place. (with the direct object.) If you use the ablative,you are pouncing on them and prepositioning them in a position of guilt.
--&gt;

===Example 3===

''Servus ex agris venit.''
:&quot;The slave came from the fields.&quot;

Note: ''Ager'' (''ager, agri, m.'', field) must take an ablative suffix to match the preceding preposition, in this case ''e''/''ex''. 

Incidentally, both ''ager'' and ''campus'' mean &quot;field,&quot; but ''ager'', like its English derivative &quot;agriculture&quot;, connotes a farming field, while ''campus'' (think &quot;camping&quot; or &quot;college campus&quot;) means &quot;open field.&quot; The ''Campus Martius'' was a large field in Rome used for military training.
&lt;!-- Updated Oct. 6 2004 after accuracy was confirmed. 

--Um, the original example, &quot;servus est ab agris,&quot; is not even Latin. Fixed. 7/3/2008--&gt;

==The Vocative Case==

While you will rarely need to ask Lupus where the bathroom is in Latin, you may find yourself reading either quotes or letters in which a person is being directly addressed. The case it will be in is the vocative.

For example, &quot;Hail, Augustus&quot; will appear in Latin as Ave Auguste, and not Ave Augustus.


Each declension has its own form of the vocative singular and plural. They are listed in the table below.

Furthermore, in all but the second declension, the nominative and vocative are exactly the same!
{|border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Number || First ||    Second*    || Third || Fourth || Fifth
|-
| Singular || a || us-&gt;e, ius-&gt;i, r-&gt;r|| -- || us || es
|-
| Plural** || ae || i || es || us || es 
|-
|}
* In the second declension singular, there are three separate possibilities for the vocative, depending on its nominative ending. Hence, if it is a us word, it will become an e and so forth.

====Examples for different declensions in the second declension==== 
*'''-us:'''
*: Lupus -&gt;Lupe (given name, wolf)
*'''-ius:''' 
*:Filius -&gt; Fili (son)
*:Horatius-&gt; Horati (given name)
*'''-r:''' 
*:Puer-&gt; Puer (boy)

:''In all cases, the plural vocative is exactly the same as the plural nominative. This extends to those words which are neuter, which always have an 'a' for the nominative and vocative.''
  
====Examples====
#Hello, Sextus.(Hello= ''Salve'')*
#: Salve, Sext'''e'''. 
#Speak, girl! (Speak= ''dico, dicere, dixi'')*
#: Dic, puell'''a'''.
#Knee, run!*(Knee= ''genu''; run= ''curro, currere, cucurri'')*
#: Gen'''u''', curre!
#Oh, heart, why do you lead me? (Oh-o; heart- cor, cordis-f.; lead-duco, ducere; 
#: O, cor! Cur ducis tu me?

*Note that the first three also require use of the imperative. The imperative is used when ordering or telling someone what to do, e.g.- &quot;Stop,&quot; or &quot;Get away from me.&quot;

The basic form of the imperative is created by dropping the &quot;re&quot; off of the infinitive form of the verb, as in: Amare, which becomes Ama; at least in the singular active form, which is all that these exercises require. More can be found about this subject in the chapter on verbs.</text>

== The Kinds of Plants ==

The total number of species of plants is tremendous. Any attempt at representing their great diversity requires a system of ordering or arranging the many plant types&amp;mdash;hopefully a system that itself contributes to our knowledge and understanding. We could take the straightforward approach of listing all plants alphabetically by their common name, or perhaps by their species name. This index approach would be handy, but would not tell us much about the plants themselves. We would have to know the plants whose names are included for the list itself to have any meaning to us. However, botanists developed a hierarchical system based on the fact&amp;mdash;considering a variety of characteristics&amp;mdash;that some plants are clearly more similar to each other than to other plants. Arranging all of the world's plants (and animals and minerals) by similarities to each other was an idea first promoted by '''Carolus Linnaeus'''.

* Reread [[Wikipedia:en:Plant|Plants]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be perused&lt;/small&gt;)
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean taxonomy]] (&lt;small&gt;follow links&lt;/small&gt;)

Categorizing is an important process by which we humans gain understanding of the world around us, and something we all do to some degree as part of our observation of things and events that we encounter. In biology, as the concept of evolution was formulated, it became obvious that this concept could be the basis for categorization.  If plants that are similar in form are indeed closely related&amp;mdash;at least more closely related than plants that are dissimilar in form&amp;mdash;then a system of classification could be devised that reflected these relationships. This approach has important implications. Related plants have common properties, a fact that can be exploited in agriculture and other practical botanical fields.

Initially, botanists had but one approach: physical examination. The careful examination (and detailed description) of plant structures allowed for arranging each species within a system that placed all more or less similar plants (in certain &quot;important&quot; features) together.  This approach is not as easy as it sounds, but played off of and contributed to the expansion of descriptive botany in the 18th and 19th centuries. One problem that became evident is that as species evolved, unrelated plants could come to resemble each other in many respects. After all, form and function are closely related. Within similar habitats (say deserts), species of very distantly related plants might well evolve towards a similar form. Species do not have (or certainly did not have over geological time) unrestricted access to all places on the planet and species distribution is then an important part of interpreting the evolutionary process.    As species evolved, they did so within the constraints to dispersion that existed at the time. This fact provides an important clue: unrelated but similar plants are likely to be distributed far from each other on the Earth's surface; and the corollary: plants that have similar structures but have widely separated distributions, may not be so closely related in an evolutionary sense.

At this point it is worthwhile to consider some examples. There are many succulent plants, as this form (typically thick, fleshy stems and/or leaves; often reduction or complete loss of leaves) incorporates adaptations necessary for a plant to survive very dry conditions. Non-botanists are tempted to classify all such plants as types of cacti.  In fact, cacti evolved in the New World (the Americas), yet there are many succulents (and many plants that resemble cacti) that are not native to the New World, and evolved independently on the African continent. A large group of such plants are known as the euphorbs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Web grew out of a project at [[w:CERN|CERN]], beginning around 1989, where [[w:Tim Berners-Lee|Tim Berners Lee]] and [[w:Robert Cailliau|Robert Cailliau]] built the prototype system that became the core of what is now the World Wide Web.  The original intent of the system was to make it easier to share research papers among colleagues. The original name of the first prototype was Enquire Within Upon Everything, after a famous 19th century reference work of how-tos. Berners-Lee released files describing his idea for the &quot;World Wide Web&quot; onto the Internet on August 6, 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''World Wide Web''' (the &quot;'''Web'''&quot; or &quot;'''WWW'''&quot; for short) is a [[w:hypertext|hypertext]] system that operates over the [[w:Internet|Internet]].  To view the information, you use a software program called a [[w:web browser|web browser]] to retrieve pieces of information (called &quot;documents&quot; or &quot;[[w:web page|web page]]s&quot;) from [[w:web server|web servers]] (or &quot;[[w:web site|web site]]s&quot;) and view them on your screen.  You can then follow [[w:hyperlink|hyperlinks]] on the page to other documents or even send information back to the server to interact with it.  The act of following hyperlinks is often called ''&quot;surfing&quot;'' the web.

Looking further at web browsers, a web browser is an application program that accesses the World Wide Web, which then searches for wanted information on the Internet.  The first web browser named Mosaic was developed in the early 1990s.  The ease of information access provided by web browsers greatly added to the popularity of the Internet.  Companies and individual users alike can use a browser to access untold amounts of information, and its as easy to find as clicking a mouse.  The three most popular web browsers are Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Netscape.  Tight competition has caused for continual improvement in the programs and associated technologies.  Web browsers are loaded with ease-of-use features and are customizable to an individual user’s preference.  

==URLs, HTTP and HTML==
The core functionality of the Web is based on three standards: the ''[[w:URL|Uniform Resource Locator]]'' (URL), which specifies how each page of information is given a unique &quot;address&quot; at which it can be found; ''[[w:HTTP|Hyper Text Transfer Protocol]]'' (HTTP), which specifies how the browser and server send the information to each other; and ''[[w:HTML|Hyper Text Markup Language]]'' (HTML), a method of encoding the information so it can be displayed on a variety of devices.

Tim Berners-Lee now heads the [[w:World Wide Web Consortium|World Wide Web Consortium]], which develops and maintains these standards and others that enable computers on the Web to effectively store and communicate all kinds of information.

==Beyond text==
The initial &quot;www&quot; program at CERN only displayed text, but later browsers such as [[w:Pei Wei|Pei Wei]]'s [[w:Viola web browser|Viola]] (1992) added the ability to display graphics as well.  [[w:Marc Andreessen|Marc Andreessen]] of [[w:NCSA|NCSA]] released a browser called &quot;[[w:Mosaic web browser|Mosaic]] for X&quot; in 1993 that sparked a tremendous rise in the popularity of the Web among novice users.  Andreesen went on to found Mosaic Communications Corporation (now [[w:Netscape Communications|Netscape Communications]], a unit of [[w:AOL Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]]).  Additional features such as dynamic content, music and animation can be found in modern browsers. 

Frequently, the technical capability of browsers and servers advances much faster than the standards bodies can keep up with, so it is not uncommon for these newer features to not work properly on all computers, and the web as seen by [[w:Netscape Navigator|Netscape]] is not at all the same as the web seen by [[w:Internet Explorer|Internet Explorer]]. The ever-improving technical capability of the WWW has enabled the development of real-time web-based services such as [[w:webcasts|webcasts]], [[w:web radio|web radio]] and live [[w:web cam|web cam]]s.

==Java and Javascript==

Another significant advance in the technology was [[w:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]]' [[w:Java programming language|Java programming language]], which enabled web servers to embed small programs (called [[w:applet|applet]]s) directly into the information being served that would run on the user's computer, allowing faster and richer user interaction.

The similarly named, but actually quite different, [[w:ECMAScript programming language|JavaScript]] is a scripting language developed for Web pages.
In conjunction with the [[w:Document Object Model|Document Object Model]] (DOM), &lt;nowiki&gt;JavaScript&lt;/nowiki&gt; has become a much more powerful language than its creators originally envisaged.

==Sociological Implications==

The [[w:exponential growth|exponential growth]] of the Internet was primarily attributed to the emergence of the [[w:Mosaic web browser|web browser Mosaic]], followed by another, [[w:Netscape Navigator|Netscape Navigator]] during the mid-1990s. 

It brought unprecedented attention to the Internet from media, industries, policy makers, and the general public. 

Eventually, it led to several visions of how our society might change, although some point out that those visions are not unique to the Internet, but repeated with many new technologies (especially information and communications technologies) of various era. 

Because the web is global in scale, some suggested that it will nurture mutual understanding on a global scale.

==Publishing web pages==

The web is available to individuals outside mass media. In order to &quot;publish&quot; a web page, one does not have to go through a publisher or other media institution, and the potential reader is around the globe, some thought. This to some is a oppportunity to enhance democracy by giving voices to alternative and minority views. Some others took it as a path to anarchy and unrestrained freedom of expression. Yet others took it as a sign that hierarchically organized society, mass media being a symptomatic part of it, will be replaced by so-called network society. 

In addition, the hyper-text seemed to promote non-hierarchical and non-linear way of expression and thinking. Unlike books and documents, hypertext does not have a linear order from the beginning to the end. It is not broken down into the hierarchy of chapters, sections, subsections, etc. This reminded some of the idea of [[w:Marshall McLuhan|Marshall McLuhan]] that new media change people's perception of the world, mentality, and way of thinking. While not unique issue to the web, hypertext in this sense is closely related to the notion of &quot;[[w:death of author|death of author]]&quot; and [[w:intertextuality|intertextuality]] in [[w:structuralism|structuralist]] literary theory. 

These bold visions are at least not fully realized yet. We can find both supporting and countering aspects of web usage. 

First, regarding the increased global unity, it is true that many different kinds of information are now available on the web, and for those who wish to know other societies, their cultures and peoples, it became easier. When one travels to a foreign country or a remote town, s/he might be able to find some information about the place on the web, especially if the place is in one of developed countries. Local newspapers, government publications, and other materials are easier to access, and therefore the variety of information obtainable with the same effort may be said to have increased, for the users of the Internet. 

At the same time, there are some obvious limitations. The web is so far a very text-centered medium, and those who are illiterate cannot make much use of it. Even among the literate, usage of a computer may or may not be easy enough. It has been known during the late 1990s, though with ample exceptions, that web users are dominantly young male in college or with a college degree. Now the trend has been changing and female and elderly are also using the web, level of education and income are related to the web use, some think (See also the Wikipedia article [[w:Digital divide|Digital divide]]). Another significant obstacle is the language. Currently, only a limited number of languages are useable on the web, due to software and standard issues, and none would understand all the available languages. These factors would challenge the notion that the World Wide Web will bring a unity to the world.

Second, the increased oppportunity to individuals are certainly observable in the countless personal pages, as well as other groups such as families, small shops, which are not among those who publish materials. The emergence of free [[w:web hosting|web hosting]] services are perhaps an important factor in bringing this possibility into the reality. The activities of alternative media expanded into the web as well. 

Yet not a small part of those pages seem to be either prematurely abandoned or one-time practice. Very few of those pages, even when they are well-developed, are popular. When it comes to the expression of ideas and provision of information, it seems that the major media organizations and those companies who became major organizations through their online operations are still favored by the dominant majority. In addition, the Web is not necessarily a tool for political self-education and deliberation. The most popular uses of the Web include searching and downloading of pornography, which perhaps have very limited effect in improving democracy. The most intensively accessed web pages include the document detailing the former U.S. president Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct with Monica Lewinsky, as well as the lingerie fashon show by Victoria's Secret. In sum, both in terms of writers and readers, the Web is not popularly used for democracy. While this is not enough to categorically reject the possibility of the Web as a tool for democracy, the effect so far seems to be smaller than some of the expectations for a quite simple reason, lack of interest and popularity. Anarchistic freedom of expression may be enjoyed by some, but many web hosting companies have developed their acceptable use policy over time, sometimes prohibiting some sensitive and potentially illegal expressions. And again, those expressions may not reach great many. The web is still largely a hierarchical place, some may argue. 

Third, regarding non-linear and non-hierarchical structure of the Web, the effect of those on people's perception and psychology are still largely unknown. Some argue that our culture is changing to that of [[w:postmodernity|postmodernity]], which is closely related to non-linear and non-hierarchical way of thinking, being, and even social organization. Yet the counter evidences are available as well. Among the most notable would be the existence of [[w:web directory|web directories]] and [[w:search engine|search engine]]s. Those sites often provide navigations to most popular sites to the visitors. In addition, it is quite obvious that many web sites are organized according to a simple hierarchy, having the &quot;home page&quot; at the top. At least the present state of the Web and web users seem to suggest the change has not been as great as envisioned by some.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electric currents produce magnetic fields and moving magnetic fields produce electric currents. This module looks that this property of electric and magnetic fields in detail. You will learn about the magnetic fields generated by a wire and a solenoid, then go on to look at motors generators and transformers. 

===Review of Magnetism===
From work in lower school you should already be familiar with the basic properties of magnets. They are:
*Magnets strongly attract magnetic materials such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, and some alloys and ceramics.
*Magnets have two poles: a north and a south. 
*Like poles repel, unlike poles attract.

Notice the similarity between magnetism and electricity. Electricity attracts neutral materials (recall a rubbed balloon picking up small bits of paper). Electricity comes in two forms:positive and negative. Like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Physicists long ago realised that these similarities were important. It is now realised that electricity and magnetism are closely related forces. They are really two different aspects of the same force! We call that force electromagnetism. This next section of the electricity module is probably the hardest. But it is also the most interesting. Work the problems in the text as you go along and you ''will'' be able to cope.

==Question 5==

[[Image:Two_polythene_strips.png]]

A student rubs a polythene strip with fur and suspends it from a clamp stand. She then rubs another polythene strip with fur and brings it up to the first strip. The two strips repel each other.

Look at the following four statements: 

*A) One of the strips is neutral, the other charged.
*B) The strips are both negatively charged.
*C) The strips are both positively charged.
*D) The strips are both neutral.

Which two of the above statements are '''false'''?

* A and B
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. B is quite possibly true, both rods could be negative because two like charges repel. Hit back and try again.}}
* A and C
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. C is quite possibly true! two positively charged rods would repel each other. Hit back and try again.}}
* A and D
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|This is the correct answer. Well done!}}
* B and C
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. If both strops are negative they repel. If ther are both positive they also repel. But the question asked which statements are false. Hit back and try again.}}
* B and D
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. B may very well be true as &quot;like charges repel&quot;. Hit back and try again.}}
* C and D
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. C may well be true. Two positively charged strips would repel.}}

==Question 6==

[[Image:Silver_plating_a_fork_(exam_Q).png]]

A student decided to silver plate his/her mother's forks. S/he set up the apparatus above.  S/he set the power pack and variable resistor so that the ammeter read 0.1 A. S/he allowed the fork to remain in the electrolysis apparatus for 10 min.  Once s/he removed the fork s/he tested it by trying to scratch the silver off. S/he found that the layer of silver was too thin and decided that s/he would have to take steps to make the layer a lot thicker.

Which one of the following steps would '''not''' produce a thicker layer of silver ?

* Increasing the voltage of the power pack
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer.

Increasing the voltage would increase the current making the layer of silver thicker. But the question asked which one of the four possible measures would not increase the thickness of the layer.}}
* Increasing the resistance of the variable resistance
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|This is the correct answer. Well done!

Increasing the resistance would ''decrease'' the current and so decrease the thickness of the silver.}}
* Increasing the time spent in the apparatus
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. Increasing the time gives the silver more time to build up. This means the layer ''will'' be thicker.}}
* Increasing the concentration of the silver nitrate solution
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. Increasing the concentration of silver nitrate will mean there are more ions to carry the current. The current will therefore be larger and so the silver layer ''will'' be thicker.

The question asked which method ''would not'' produce a thicker layer.}}

==Question 7==

What is the maximum power that an appliance should have if it is connect to a 230V supply by a 5A cable ?

* 46W
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is an incorrect answer. Remember that to find the power you need to ''multiply'' the current and the voltage.}}
* 1.15kW
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Well done this is the correct answer.}}
* 115W
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry but this isn't the correct answer. Be careful about powers of ten when you when you do a calculation, especially when using a calculator.}}
* 4600W
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is an incorrect answer. Remember that to find the power you need to ''multiply'' the current and the voltage.}}

==Question 8==
[[Image:VC wire.png]]

The graph above shows how the potential difference across a conductor varied with the current flowing through it. Which of the following statements is true ?

* The resistance of the conductor increases as the current increases
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is the wrong answer. 

From Ohm's Law
: R is V/I. 
But V/I is also the slope (or gradient) of the line on the graph. So with a constant slope, we must have a constant resistance.}}
* The resistance of the conductor decreases as the current increases
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is the wrong answer.

From Ohm's Law
:R is V/I
But V/I is also the slope (or gradient) of the line on the graph. So with a constant slope, we must have a constant resistance.}}
* The resistance of the conductor stays constant as the current increases
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Well done this is the correct answer.
Recall by Ohm's Law that V is IR and then V/I is R. Observe on the graph that as voltage increases, current increases also. So as these values increase, their quotient must remain relatively constant. So the resistance remains relatively constant.Hence a straight line graph.}}
* It is not possible to say anything about the resistance of the conductor based on the information given
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is the wrong answer. It is quite possible to answer this question from the information given.

From Ohm's Law
:R is V/I
But V/I is also the slope (or gradient) of the line on the graph. So with a constant slope, we must have a constant resistance.}}

==Question 9==

Two students, Jane and John are working together to make an electromagnet. John coils some plastic coated wire around a pencil and attaches the two ends to a 1.5V cell. He finds the electromagnet that he has made will deflect a compass placed near it but will not pick up a paperclip.

Jane suggest that using an iron nail rather than a pencil will make the magnet stronger. Is she correct, and why?

* She is correct, the iron core will make the magnet stronger, because iron conducts electricity.
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is the wrong answer. Iron is a good conductor of electricity but no electricity actually flows through the iron core, so it being a good conductor makes no difference.}}
* She is correct, the iron core will make the magnet stronger because iron is a magnetic material.
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|This is the correct answer. Well done! Magnetic materials, such as iron, will increase the strength of an electromagnet if used in the core.}}
* She is incorrect, the iron core will not make the magnet stronger, because iron conducts electricity.
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is the wrong answer. The iron core certainly will make the magnet stronger.}}
* She is incorrect, the iron core will not make the magnet stronger because iron is a magnetic material.
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer.|Sorry this is the wrong answer. The iron core certainly will make the magnet stronger.}}

==Question 10==

Jane and John have made an electromagnet using a soft iron core with 10 windings of insulated copper wire and a voltage of 1.5V. They found that they could pick up 3 paper clips with this magnet if they were careful. Which of the following changes would ''not'' result in more paper clips being picked up?

*Increasing the voltage (and therefore the current).
*Using 15 turns of wire instead of 10.
*Reverse the connections to the battery so that the current flows in the opposite direction.
*Add a resistor in series with the electromagnet.

{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|Solution|Reverse the connections to the battery so that the current flows in the opposite direction. The strength of the magnet produced does not depend on the direction of the current.}}

==Question 11==

A photocopying machine creates a picture by making use of static electricity. Put the following statements about how the process works in the correct order.

# Paper is given an opposite charge to the toner and pressed onto the plate. This causes the toner to stick to the paper rendering a copy of the picture.
# A plate is given a charge, an image is projected onto the plate. Where the image was dark, a dark area forms on the plate.

==Question 12==

A wire is connected to a power pack and placed in the magnetic field of two bar magnets. When the power pack is switched on the wire jumps upwards.[[Image:Force_on_a_current_carrying_wire_GCSE_question.png]]

What effect will increasing the current in the wire have ?

*There will be no effect because the magnets haven't been changed.
*The wire still moves upwards, but this time the greater current causes it to move more slowly.
*The wire will now move downwards.
*The wire will move upwards more quickly than before.

{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|Solution|The wire will move upwards more quickly than before.}}

==Question 13==

This is the same setup as in question 12. 

[[Image:Force_on_a_current_carrying_wire_GCSE_question.png]]

What can be done to make the wire move downwards ?
(Choose two methods from the list)

* increase the current
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer|No. This will just make the wire move upwards faster.}}
* reverse the current
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer|Wrong Answer. This makes no difference.}}
* make the wire shorter
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer|Sorry. This will still move upwards.}}
* reverse the magnetic field
{{hidden|bg1=lightgreen|I choose this answer|Well done! This is the correct answer}}

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Formulax. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Formulax~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The current is determined by the voltage and the resistance of the kettle element. The fuse can't contol the current.

Although the circuit symbol for a fuse looks a bit like a resistor, inside a fuse is just a piece of wire. It can't keep the current down to below 13A in this way.

When a current flows down a wire it creates a magnetic field. To see this, place a small plotting compass near the wire and turn the current on. The compass needle will deflect. The shape of the magnetic field around a wire is circular. Look at the diagram on the right. The wire is coming straight out of the screen so you only see it's cross section (the red circle) The plotting compasses show how the field wraps around the wire.

==Creating an electromagnet==
Solenoids are made by coiling wire. The magnetic field of a solenoid looks like the field of an ordinary bar magnet.
[[Image:Electromagnet_with_an_air_core.png]]

A solenoid makes a pretty weak bar magnet on its own, but if a piece of iron is put inside the solenoid, the field becomes much much stronger.

Try the following experiment:
*Wrap a piece of plastic coated wire around a pencil.Remove the pencil then connect to a power supply set at 1V DC current. Sprinkle iron filings around the coil of wire. Put a plotting compass near the wire. Try to pick up a paper clip. 
*Wrap a piece of plastic coated wire around a large nail. Repeat all of the above experiments

You will find that the solenoid with the iron core is much much stronger than the one with the air core.

'''Q1)''' Why is it important to use plastic-coated wire?

===Making the field stronger===
To make the field stronger we can:
*Use a soft iron core
*Increase the amount of current flowing in the wire
*Increase the number of turns on the solenoid.

===Reversing the field===
To make the north pole and south pole swap positions we can:
*Reverse the direction of the current by swapping the positive and negative leads on the power pack.
*Wind the wire the other way round. {So if you wound it clockwise, take it off and wind it counterclockwise.

Speaking of north and south poles, there is a little trick to help find out which end is the north pole and which is the south.

Look down the solenoid and work out which way the current is flowing. Remember, current flows from the positive to the negative terminal on the power pack. If the current is flowing clockwise, the end will be a south pole. If it is going counterclockwise, the end will be a north pole. The easy way to remember this is to put arrows on the end of a capital N and S like this:

[[Image:North_and_south_poles_of_an_electromagnet.png]]

If you do not understand how to determine the pole using the clockwise and anti-clockwise way you can use the right hand grip rule

=== Prerequisites for geometry readers ===

I love math but I know the frustration of trying to learn math by myself when the source is obtuse, ambiguous and incomplete. Wiki's geometry readers might not have teachers or tutors to help them. We should specify particular prerequisites for such readers. We should build only on material already presented in previous more elementary wikibooks. 

*In this case that means [[Geometry for elementary school]] which is great. Some arithmetic and simple algebra is needed, but unfortunately I haven’t found a good wikibook source that isn't too advanced.

*Each new paragraph should be tested to be sure it is built on these basic assumed skills plus what was taught in the previous paragraphs. It is easier for a well prepared reader to deal with a presentation that is too basic in the first few chapters than for someone new to geometry to bridge that gap when advanced material is introduced too early.

===Aligning with California Standards===
Okay I like the concept aligning with California standards and creating a High School Level textbook. Nothing has been done in awhile. I am thinking about taking this up. My only qualification is that I teach this subject in a CA highschool. 

A great looking intro page. I can't wait 'till it's finished as I really want to learn about advanced geometries. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 22:25, 26 Sep 2003 (UTC)

===Who has a right to dictate the syllabus?===
However, why is the book set up so the contents are set in stone?  Why did I only have that chapter available to edit for where I wanted to define R^3?  I am asking not just because it seems hard to find out, but because it might help me as a student but also tutor who may one day more formally teach math.  If there is some sort of 'standard curricula' in academia I need to know who thinks they are qualified to make it up and why.--[[User:Dchmelik|Dchmelik]] ([[User talk:Dchmelik|talk]]) 23:55, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

===Book 1 / Book 2 Structure===
This book is gaining a similar structural problem to what the [[Trigonometry]] book had - advanced material being added that is beyond a high school level.  The solution there was to split the ToC into two parts, a book 1 and a book 2.  I think the same could and should be done for this book.  [[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|talk]]) 11:35, 13 November 2010 (UTC)

==Requests==
===Categorisation of pages, please===

Please fix the links so that each chapter of this book is not categorized as a whole book of its own! --[[User:Daniel|Daniel]] 09:47, 3 May 2004 (UTC)

=== More illustration, please ===

* A book about Geometry with few or none ilustrations...
Seconded.[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 12:24, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

===Appendix for definitions and postulates, please ===
I think there should be an appendix listing out all the major postulates and definitions, grouping them by topic (e.g., SSS and SAS would go in &quot;Triangle Congruency,&quot; whereas the Corresponding Angles Postulate and that parallel-transitivity property would go in &quot;parallel lines.&quot;[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 12:24, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

===Appendix for Theorems, please===
I think there should also be an appendix listing all of the important theorems, also grouped by categories. I think there should also either be a list of the theorems with their proofs or, since that might be seen as helping students cheat, doing what my old geometry textbook did: having a two-column proof chart with only some of the boxes filled in, and having the student fill statements for a given reason or reasons for a given statement to have the complete the proof.[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 12:24, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

===Vocab, please===
I think there should be bolded vocabulary words throughout the text, and a glossary. These don't need to be the precise words used by California (we should try to keep this pretty even and not tailored to one state!), but whatever comes up.--[[:en:User:HereToHelp|HereToHelp]] ([[:en:User talk:HereToHelp|talk]]) 02:45, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

=== I'm adding information as I go ===

I'm starting to add information on some of the subjects listed in geometry.
--[[User:Isipeoria|Isipeoria]] 01:08, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

=== Possibility of students working on this ===

I am a teacher in a small high school and would like to use this text next semester and have my students help edit and illustrate as we work through the subject. I am new to Wikiland and would appreciate any comments or suggestions. Is anyone working on this subject intensely right now?
--[[User:Forrestbrinker|Forrestbrinker]] 18:41, 2 December 2006 (UTC)Forrestbrinker

==Issues==
=== Chapter Order ===

Hello, I'm currently editing &quot;Parallel Lines, Quadrilaterals, and Circles&quot; and noticed that it comes before polygons. I think polygons should come before it and before triangles since a discussion of either requires a knowledge of what a polygon is.

=== Exercises Too Complex ===

The exercises at the end of chapter 2 require concepts that have not yet been introduced.  These should be simpler exercises that clearly explain the basic proof concepts introduced in chapter 2.  I'm going to change these exercises shortly, if nobody objects.

==Euclid==
===Euclid Old Fashioned===
The five postulates of Euclidean geometry? Which set of postulates are you using? Euclid's? That's has been shown not to stand up to rigorous standards a long time ago...

Isn't it a bit old-fashioned to teach 2D Euclidean geometry along the lines of Euclid's elements?

I agree. And I believe that Euclid's fifth &quot;postulate&quot; was derived from his other four in the 19th century.[[User:DroEsperanto|DroEsperanto]] 12:24, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

===Euclid's fifth postulate===
Euclid's Fifth was shown to be independent of (i.e., not derivable from) the other four axioms by the work of Lobachevsky, Bolyai, and Riemann, and secretly by Gauss, in the 19th century, a result reconfirmed by many others in the years since.  Although Euclid did not have the insight we have today, Euclidean Geometry is every bit as good a tool for helping build a working understanding of deduction as it has been for the past 2300 years.  It is the responsibilty of the instructors and modern mathematicians to point out and amend the program as needed.

=== Seriously try Euclid ===

The original [[wikisource:The Elements of Euclid|The Elements of Euclid]], and the best. I wish I had this when I was learning geometry at school. It is crystal clear and free of &quot;pedagogical&quot; techniques. It takes time to gain any mastery over the content, but it is better then any textbook I have had to suffer through in 16 years of schooling (up to Bachelors degree). As a bonus it's in the public domain. --[[Special:Contributions/41.243.101.252|41.243.101.252]] ([[User talk:41.243.101.252|talk]]) 14:39, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

=== More modern than Euclid ===

I think I agree with the poster that says 'seriously try Euclid,' except I wrote the chapter 11 that defines R^3, etc., so I think there is value in a geometry text using modern set theory--surely it is necessary now that Topology exists or just that some teachers and even students think it is worth it to them.--[[User:Dchmelik|Dchmelik]] ([[User talk:Dchmelik|talk]]) 23:55, 26 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Introduction==

The United States Constitution divides government into three separate and distinct branches: the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches. The concept of separate branches with distinct powers is known as '''separation of powers.''' That doctrine arose from the writings of several European philosophers. The Englishman John Locke first pioneered the idea, but he only suggested a separation between the executive and legislative. The Frenchman Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, added the judicial branch. 

Each branch is theoretically equal to each of the others. The branches check each others powers and use a system known as ''' checks and balances'''. Thus, no branch can gain too much power and influence, thus reducing the opportunity for tyrannical government.

The Preamble to the American Constitution sets out these aims in the general statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Legislative==

The Congress is the Legislative Branch. Its main function is to make laws. It also oversees the execution of these laws, and checks various executive and judicial powers. 
The Congress is ''bicameral'' - it is composed of two houses. One house is the House of Representatives and the other is the Senate. 

The House of Representatives is currently composed of four hundred and thirty-five members. Each of the fifty states is allocated one or more representatives based on its population which is calculated on a decennial basis (once in ten years) . Each state is guaranteed at least one representative. A state that is allocated more than one representative divides itself, as state procedures dictate, into a number of districts equal to the number of representatives to which it is entitled. The people of each district vote to elect one representative to Congress (States that have only one representative allocated choose ''at-large'' representatives - the state votes as one entire district). The District of Columbia and a number of U.S. territories have been permitted to elect delegates to the House of Representatives. These delegates may participate in debates, and sit and vote in committee, but are not allowed to vote in the full House. Every House member faces re-election in an even-numbered year and is elected to a two-year term. The House is presided over by a Speaker, who is directly elected by the members of the House.

The Senate is the upper house of the legislative branch of the United States and possesses one hundred members which is considerably less than the four hundred and thirty-five members of the House of Representatives. Each state chooses two senators, regardless of that state's population. The Constitution originally dictated that a state's senators were to be chosen by the state's legislature; after the Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, senators were elected directly by the state's population. In contrast to the House's two-year terms, Senators are elected to a six-year stint in office. In addition, only one-third of the Senate stands for election during an even year. These differences between the two houses were deliberately put into place by the Founding Fathers; the Senate was intended to be a more stable, austere body, whereas the House would be more responsive to the people's will.

The Vice-President is President of the Senate, but he/she only votes if there is a tie. The Senate also chooses a President Pro Tempore to preside in the Vice-President's absence (though, in practice, most of the time, senators from the majority take turns presiding for short periods).

The Senate and the House are both required to approve legislation before it becomes a law. The two houses are equal in legislative power, but revenue bills (bills relating to taxation) may only originate in the House. However, as with any other bill, the Senate's approval is still required, and the Senate may amend such bills.

The Senate holds additional powers relating to treaties and the appointments of executive and judicial officials. This power is known as &quot;advice and consent.&quot; The Senate's advice and consent is required for the President to appoint judges and many executive officers, and also to ratify treaties. To grant advice and consent on treaties, two-thirds of the Senators must concur (agree).

While most votes require a simple majority to pass, it sometimes takes three-fifths of senators to bring a bill to a vote. This is because Senate rules hold that a bill cannot be voted on as long as it is being debated--and there is no limit on how long a senator may debate a bill. Senators sometimes use this rule to filibuster a bill--that is, continue debating a bill endlessly so that it cannot be voted on.  The only way to end a filibuster is for three-fifths of all Senators to vote for a cloture resolution, which ends all debate and brings the bill up for voting. Use of the filibuster tends to be controversial. Whichever party is in the majority tends to call its use &quot;obstructionism,&quot; while the other side sees it as an important check on the majority. 

The House has the sole power to impeach federal executive and judicial officers. According to the Constitution, officers may be impeached for &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The Senate has the sole power to try all such impeachments, a two-thirds vote being required for conviction. The Constitution requires that any individual convicted by the Senate to be removed from office. The Senate also has the power to bar that individual from further federal office. The Senate may not impose any further punishment, although the parties are still subject to trial in the courts. As the Vice-President (being next-in-line to the Presidency) would have an obvious conflict of interest in presiding at a trial of the President, in such cases, the Chief Justice presides. Interestingly, no similar provision prevents the Vice-President from presiding at his or her own trial.

==The Executive==

The President, Vice President, and other executive officials make up the Executive Branch. The main function of this branch is to execute the laws created by Congress. The President and the Vice-President are chosen by the Electoral College, a body of people elected for the purpose of electing the President. One may wait to consider the Electoral College in further detail.

The President appoints several ''Secretaries'' to head executive departments. An executive department is a body covering a broad topic of law- examples include the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Justice. The several secretaries (in the case of the Justice Department, the Attorney General) serve as advisors to the President and also as the chief officers of their own departments. This group of advisors is collectively known as the President's ''cabinet''. The President nominates these Secretaries, as well as other important federal officials, and the Senate ''advise and consents'' to them .

==The Judicial==

The Supreme Court and the lower courts compose the Judicial Branch. The judiciary must interpret the laws of the United States. In the course of such interpretations, the courts may find that a law violates the constitution. If so, the court declares the law unconstitutional. Thus, the judiciary also has a role in determining the law of the land.

The judges of federal courts are nominated by the President and advised and consented to by the Senate. The number of judges and the exact structure of the courts is set by law, and not by the Constitution.

==The Legislative Process: How A Bill Becomes A Law==

After both houses of Congress pass a bill, perhaps observing the different rules and procedures in each house, but with the exact same final text, the bill is submitted to the President. Immediately, a ten-day clock for the president to act in starts to tick. Sundays are excluded in this calculation.

Once he receives the bill, the President has many options. The outcome of the process depends on the route taken by him.
* Signature- If the President signs a bill, it immediately takes effect as law.
* Veto- The President may, if he pleases, return a bill to the house in which it originated. That house may then consider the President's objections. If it wishes to pass the law in any event, it must repass the bill with a two-thirds majority. If the same occurs, then the other house considers the bill, perhaps repassing it with the same two-thirds majority. If both houses pass the bill with the requisite majority, then the bill becomes law despite the President's veto. If one or both houses fail to provide an adequate majority, then the bill fails
* No Action- The President may decide to take no action at all on a bill. If, for ten days, the President has neither signed nor returned the bill, the bill becomes law without a signature.
* Pocket veto- The pocket veto is an absolute veto- Congress may not override it by any majority (though it may choose to repass the bill). The pocket veto occurs near the end of a Congressional session. If the bill is with the President, and he has not signed it or returned it, and the ten-day limit has not expired, '''and''' Congress adjourns for the year (that is, it decides to meet no longer for the rest of the year), then the President may pocket veto the bill.

==Checks and Balances==

In order to prevent any branch of government from becoming too powerful, the Framers of the Constitution created a system of checks and balances. Each branch of government has checks on the others, while it is itself also checked. The complex system can be outlined as follows:

'''Checks of the Legislative'''

''Checks on the Executive''
* Power to override vetoes
* Power to confirm the President's appointment of a Vice President when a vacancy in the Vice Presidency occurs
* Power to tax and allocate tax revenues for executive activities
* Oversight and investigation of executive activities
* (Senate) Power to approve treaties
* (Senate) Power to approve Presidential nominees
* (House) Impeachment, or accusation of a federal official for bribery, treason, or another high crime
* (Senate) Trial of Impeachment 
''Checks on the Judicial''
* Power to set size and structure of courts
* (Senate) Power to approve Presidential nominees for judgeships
* (House) Impeachment
* (Senate) Trial of Impeachment
''Internal Checks''
* Approval of both houses required for passage of a law

'''Checks of the Executive'''

''Checks on the Legislative''
* Power to veto
* Power to pocket veto
* Power to call a special session of Congress when Congress is not already meeting
* Vice President presides over Senate meetings as President of the Senate
* Congress cannot reduce the salary of the President while he continues in office
''Checks on the Judicial''
* Power to nominate judges
* Power to fully or partially pardon convicted criminals

'''Checks of the Judicial'''

''Checks on the Legislative''
* Power to declare bills unconstitutional
* Congress cannot reduce the salary of a judge while he continues in office
* The Chief Justice presides over an Impeachment Trial of a President
''Checks on the Executive''
* Power to declare executive acts unconstitutional

== Preface ==
{{Prerequisite|Arithmetic}}

'''Algebra''' is the branch of mathematics concerning the study of the rules of operations and relations, and the constructions and concepts arising from them, including terms, polynomials, equations and algebraic structures.

You've been asked to buy peanuts for you and your friends at a football game. You've collected $12.50. One bag is $2.75. You want to know how many bags you can buy. This is an algebra problem!  Related problems are how much money will be left over, and what should you buy or in what proportions should you return the extra money to your friends.

Algebra helps us to predict things that we don't yet know and to determine the relationships between the things we do. Algebra is a powerful and rich branch of mathematics that is useful in everyday life as well as business, engineering, and other technical fields.

==Objectives==
*Define expressions.
*State the definition of a variable and an expression.
*State the definition of a constant.
*Explain the difference between an expression and an equation.
*Given a written description of a situation, write expressions for the unknowns, and then relate those expressions with equations.
==Balancing variables ==

Mathematics began with the concept of [[w:counting | counting]], but it grew because of the idea of [[w:Equivalence_relation|equivalence]].  Tally marks or counters are equivalent to a value depending on the concept being expressed.  For instance a shepherd could use a bag of rocks to make sure that he brought home the same number of sheep he left with.  The idea of equivalence as shown with an equal sign allows us to state &quot;is the same as&quot;. 

An expression is a statement that is well formed.  The neolithic shepherd used his bag of rocks to create expressions for managing his herd.  For instance, the shepherd hoped that the size of his flock remained constant between the time he took his flock out to graze and the time that he returned them home.  When he used the bag of rocks the shepherd used two expressions: # Sheep and # Rocks to create the equation # Sheep = # Rocks.  Mathematics describes the operations the shepherd performed on the expressions in order to keep the equation in balance.  For instance, when the shepherd used his bag of rocks to count his flock at night he might put his rocks in a bowl next to the gate on his pen.  Each time a sheep went into the pen the shepherd would move a rock from the bag into the bowl.  If rocks were left over in the bag, then the shepherd knew he needed to return to the field to find his lost sheep.

== Expressions ==
An expression is the arrangement of mathematical symbols denoting values and operations, while the equation is a form of an expression that indicates that two values are equal.  While equations are generally expressions, you will discover that some expressions are not equations.  Expressions in the form of functions or inequalities will be more apparent later in the book.

When you simplify an expression, you are performing simple arithmetic steps until you receive the simplest answer, which is usually an integer or fraction. 

== Equations ==
[[Image:Eo-scale of justice.gif|thumb|left|A balance (scale).]] 

An equation is just like a balance. A balance is a machine that compares whether two quantities are the same or not the same.  In mathematics, two quantities balanced translates to &quot;having the same value.&quot;  An equation is ''true'' if the two sides are balanced and ''false'' if the two sides are not balanced.
As 5=5. this is a very simple equation. We can use variable too(almost used in mathematics)e.g. x=5. This is same as while using a balancing machine, we use some quantity on one side and some matter on the other which is to be measured.
As a example we know that 5 is equal to 5 and x is equal to x(whatever is the value). the simplest example of a false equation is that 5 is not equal to 20.

* Add examples.

Remember from the previous section, a [[Algebra/Variable|variable]] is a symbol, usually a letter, that stands for a number. We'll use the letters &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; most often. If &lt;math&gt;x=5&lt;/math&gt; is true, then any time I use &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, you can replace &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by 5. We're saying &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and 5 have the ''same value, but different appearance''.  In the equation &lt;math&gt;x=5&lt;/math&gt;, the equal sign is like the balance.  If &lt;math&gt;x=5&lt;/math&gt; is true, we know that whenever we see an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; we can substitute the number 5 if that helps us understand. Even more important, we can check if a given number substituted for a variable in an equation makes that equation true.

* Add examples.

Frequently we don't know what the value of a variable is that would make the equation true, and we need to find out! 
Finding out the values that make an equation true is called [[Algebra/Solving_Equations|Solving an Equation]], which we will do without guessing in the next section. 

* Add examples.

== Lesson Quiz ==
You might be tempted to rush ahead, but please quickly check your understanding first!

#&lt;math&gt;C = 2\pi\!r&lt;/math&gt; is the formula to find the Circumference of a circle with a given radius. Find the Circumference if the diameter was 4 inches long. ''Remember: 2r = d''
#&lt;math&gt;I = PRT \,&lt;/math&gt; when ''I'' represents interest earned, ''P'' represents the principal (starting money), ''R'' represents interest rate, and ''T'' represents the time, usually express in years. This formula is often used for banking and account. After 2 years, how much interest would have been built up if you placed $5000 into an account that has an interest rate of 9.5% per year?

== Quadratic equations ==
Up to now you have only dealt with equations and expressions involving just x; in this section we'll move onto solving things which have &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; in them.

All quadratic equations can be arranged in the form 
&lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0\ (a \ne 0)&lt;/math&gt;, and ''a'',''b'',''c'' are all constants. Now let's look at some examples:

'''Examples:''' Rearrange the following equations in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0 \qquad&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;

(1)\qquad x(x-3)=3-5x; \qquad 

&lt;/math&gt;


'''Solution for''' (1)''':'''

:&lt;math&gt; x^2 - 3x = 3 - 5x \qquad&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + 2x = 3      \qquad&lt;/math&gt;  
:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + 2x - 3 =0   \qquad&lt;/math&gt;  


:Note that in the first step you distributed the x on the left side of the equation.  The second step was obtained by adding a 5x to both sides of the equation and subsequently subtracting a 3 from both sides of the equation.


:&lt;math&gt;
(2)\qquad 2x+1=(x^2+2)\sqrt{3}
&lt;/math&gt;


'''Solution for''' (2)''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
2x+1&amp;=&amp;x^2\sqrt{3}+2\sqrt{3}\\
-x^2\sqrt{3}+2x+1-2\sqrt{3}&amp;=&amp;0\\
x^2\sqrt{3}-2x-1+2\sqrt{3}&amp;=&amp;0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:Note that in the last step, both sides are multiplied by -1, to make the term &lt;math&gt;-x^2\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; positive, so that the solving of the equation would be easier.

====Factorization====
Factorization is the most common way to solve quadratic equations. Let us consider again the first example above:
&lt;math&gt;
x(x-3)=3-5x
&lt;/math&gt;
We have already simplified the equation into 

:&lt;math&gt;
x^2+2x-3=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we want to factorize the equation - that is to say, get it into a form such as: 

:&lt;math&gt;
(x+''\text{something}'')(x+''\text{something else}'')=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Look at the number term c. In this example, it is -3. Now, if we are lucky, the numbers &quot;something&quot; and &quot;something else&quot; will turn out to be nice whole numbers, so let's think of two numbers that will multiply together to give -3. Either 3 and -1, or -3 and 1. But we also need to get the x term correct (here, b=2). In fact, we need our two factors of c to add together to make b. And (3)+(-1)=2. So, we have found our 'somethings': they are 3 and -1. Let's fill them in.

:&lt;math&gt;
(x+3)(x-1)=0
&lt;/math&gt;
Just to check, we can multiply out the brackets to check we have what we started with:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(x+3)(x-1)=0\\
x^2 +3x -1x -3=0\\
x^2 +2x -3=0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we know that in an equation the left side is always equal to the right side. And in this case the right side of the equation is 0, so from that we can conclude the term &lt;math&gt;(x+3)(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; must equal to zero as well. And that means that either &lt;math&gt;(x+3)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; must equal zero. (Not convinced? Remember (x+3) and (x-1) are just numbers. Can you find two non-zero numbers which multiply to make zero?)

Let's write that algebraically:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x^2 +2x -3=0\\
x+3=0 \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad x-1=0\\
x=-3 \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad x=1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, there are two different solutions to the same equation! This is the case for all quadratic equations. We say that this quadratic equation has ''two distinct and real roots''.

With practice, you will often be able to write down the equation in factorised form almost immediately. Here is another example, in this case the x easily factorises out:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
2x^2&amp;=9x\\
2x^2-9x&amp;=0\\
x(2x-9)&amp;=0\\
x=0&amp;\qquad \mbox{or} \qquad x=\frac{9}{2}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Completing the square====

Sometimes the roots (solutions) of a quadratic equation cannot be easily obtained by factorisation. In such cases, we have to solve the equation by completing the square, or using the quadratic formula (see below).

In order to complete the square, we need to rewrite the given equation in the form &lt;math&gt;(x+a)^2=b&lt;/math&gt;. Now here is an example:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x^2+8x+9&amp;=&amp;0\\
x^2+8x&amp;=&amp;-9\\
x^2+8x+4^2&amp;=&amp;4^2-9\\
(x+4)^2&amp;=&amp;7\\
&amp;x+4=\sqrt{7}&amp; \quad \mbox{or} \quad x+4=-\sqrt{7}\\
&amp;x=-4+\sqrt{7}&amp; \quad \mbox{or} \quad x=-4-\sqrt{7}\\
&amp;x=-1.35&amp; \quad \mbox{or} \quad x=-6.65
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

In general, we get

:&lt;math&gt;
x^2+kx+\left({k \over 2}\right)^2=\left(x+{k \over 2}\right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that when we reach the stage of taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we might have a negative left-hand side. In this case, the roots will be [[../Complex Numbers|complex]]. If you have not yet learned about [[../Complex Numbers|complex numbers]], it is possible to simply state that the equation &quot;has no real roots&quot;.

====Quadratic Formula====
The quadratic formula is a special generalization of completing the square that allows the two roots of a quadratic equation to be obtained by simple substitution. It can be used to solve any quadratic equation and is very quick to work out on a calculator.


:&lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx = -c \Rightarrow x^2 + \frac {b}{a}x = \frac {-c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Complete the square:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac {b}{a}x + \left(\frac {b}{2a}\right)^2 = \frac {-c}{a} + \left(\frac {b}{2a}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Simplify:


Which equals 4y to the 19th power.

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac {b}{2a} \right )^2 = \frac {-c}{a} + \left(\frac {b}{2a}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x + \frac {b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt {\frac {b^2}{4a^2} + \frac {-c}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x + \frac {b}{2a} = \pm \sqrt {\frac {b^2}{4a^2} + \frac {-4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {-b}{2a} \pm \sqrt {\frac {b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {-b}{2a} \pm \frac {\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the desired form of the quadratic formula.

Hence, given that a quadratic is in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0&lt;/math&gt;, the two roots are:
:&lt;math&gt;x={-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;{b^2-4ac}&lt;/math&gt; in the equation, known as the '''discriminant''', is an indication of the solubility and nature of the roots:
* discriminant is positive -- soluble over '''R''', real roots
* discriminant is zero -- soluble over '''R''', real repeated (single) roots
* discriminant is negative -- insoluble over '''R''' (yet soluble over '''C'''),  no real roots

=== Weda's Theorem ===

If the quadratic equation &lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0\ (a\ne0)&lt;/math&gt; has two real roots &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
x_1+x_2&amp;=&amp;-\cfrac{b}{a}\\
x_1x_2&amp;=&amp;\cfrac{c}{a}
\end{matrix}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

This is because &lt;math&gt;x_1=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;. By simply adding or multiplying the two roots we will get the above two equations. This is called Weda's Theorem'''.

Using Weda's Theorem we can find the second root of a given quadratic equation without solving the equation.

'''Example:''' Given that one of the real roots of the equation &lt;math&gt;4x^2-13x+10=0&lt;/math&gt; is 2, find the other root without solving the equation.

'''Solution:'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x_1 \cdot x_2 &amp;=&amp; \cfrac c a \\
\Rightarrow x_1 \cdot 2 &amp;=&amp; \cfrac{10}{4}\\
x_1&amp;=&amp;\cfrac{5}{4}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We can also determine the signs of two roots by applying the following rules:
# the equation has two positive roots if &lt;math&gt;\Delta\ge0,\ \frac{c}{a}&gt;0,\ \mbox{and}\ \frac{b}{a}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;;
# the equation has two negative roots if &lt;math&gt;\Delta\ge0,\ \frac{c}{a}&gt;0,\ \mbox{and}\ \frac{b}{a}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;;
# the equation has two roots with different signs if &lt;math&gt;\ \frac{c}{a}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; represents the discriminant of the equation.)

Another problem involving Weda's Theorem:

'''Example:''' For the equation &lt;math&gt;2x^2+ax+1=0&lt;/math&gt;, given that the sum of squares of roots is &lt;math&gt;7\frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;, find the value of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Solution:'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(x_1+x_2)^2-2x_1x_2&amp;=&amp;x_1^2+x_2^2\\
\left(-\cfrac{a}{2}\right)^2-2\cdot\cfrac{1}{2}&amp;=&amp;7\cfrac{1}{4}\\
\cfrac{a^2}{4}&amp;=&amp;8\cfrac{1}{4}\\
a^2&amp;=&amp;33\\
a&amp;=&amp;\pm\sqrt{33}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Solving simultaneous linear and nonlinear equations ==
In previous chapters you have already learned how to solve simultaneous linear equations. Now we will learn how to solve a system of simultaneous linear and non-linear equations with two unknowns. It is usually done by '''substitution method'''.

'''Example:''' Solve the following simultaneous equations:

&lt;math&gt;
\left\{
\begin{matrix}
2x^2+y^2-5xy&amp;=8 &amp; \mbox{------ (1)}\\
y-x&amp;=2 &amp; \mbox{------ (2)}
\end{matrix}
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution:'''

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\mbox{Rearrange (2):} &amp; y=x+2 &amp; \mbox{------ (3)}\\
\mbox{Substitute(3) into (1):} &amp; 2x^2+(x+2)^2-5x(x+2)=8\\
&amp; 2x^2+x^2+4x+4-5x^2-10x-8=0\\
&amp; x^2+3x+2=0\\
&amp; (x+2)(x+1)=0\\
&amp; x=-2 \quad \mbox{or} \quad -1\\
\mbox{Substitute x=-2 back into (3):} &amp; y=-2+2=0\\
\mbox{Substitute x=-1 back into (3):} &amp; y=-1+2=1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

&amp;there4; x=-1 and y=1, or x=-2 and y=0.

==Introduction==

The United States is exactly that--a Union of states. Each state has its own individual powers. However, that does not mean that the states have power to legislate on all matters. The Constitution of the United States spells out the powers of the federal government and of the &quot;several states.&quot; The Union government (known as the '''federal''' government) has its own fields of legislation, and if federal legislation conflicts with the state laws, the federal legislation prevails.  If this occurs, the state must defer to the federal government. The alternative, that any state may at any time leave the Union and thus be free from Union interference in the state's internal affairs, was tried during the American Civil War.

==Types of Federalism==

There are two types of federal systems. The first, '''dual federalism''', holds that the Union and the state are equal; under this view of federalism, the Union government only has the powers expressly granted to it, while the states retain all other powers. The second view, '''cooperative federalism''', states that the federal government is definitively superior to the state government, and the federal government should stretch its powers as far as possible. The US is a Union that does not completely fit either definition. The type of federalism in effect really depends on who is in power at the time. In any case, the Constitution prevents stretching federalism too far in either extreme.



All powers retained by the states are known as '''reserved powers'''. Those specifically granted only to the Union government are known as '''enumerated powers'''. Finally, matters over which both the Union and the state governments have control are known as '''concurrent powers'''.

The Tenth Amendment provides that the Union government has only the powers expressly designated to it by the Constitution, and the states control all other matters.



Enumerated powers relate to the following:
* Regulation of interstate and foreign commerce
* Immigration and Citizenship
* Bankruptcy
* Weights and Measures 
* Currency
* Copyrights and Patents (Special rights granted to authors and inventors relating to the writing or discovery)
* Crimes at sea
* Military
* Declaration of War
* Control of the District of Columbia
* Federal Courts
* &quot;Necessary and Proper&quot;- The necessary and proper clause allows the Union government to make laws necessary to utilize other powers. For instance, this clause allows the government to jail persons who violate laws created under the aforestated powers.

==Reserved Powers==

As has been mentioned, the states have control over all matters not controlled by the Union government. Some of these matters include:
* Education
* Police protection
* Licensing 
* Control local governments
* Regulate individual and corporate activities in order to protect and enhance public health, welfare, safety, morals, and convenience.

==Concurrent Powers==

Several powers belong concurrently to the Union and the state governments. These include:
* Transportation 
* Taxation
* Make and enforce laws
* Establish courts
* Borrow
* Spend money for general welfare
* Take private property for public purposes, with just compensation.
* Charter banks and corporations

==Introduction==

The Constitution provides for many things other than the Union and member state government operation.

==Supreme Law==

The Constitution calls itself, the United States laws, and treaties, the Supreme Law of the land. No state law may conflict with the Supreme Law. If they do, the conflicting parts are ruled void. However the supremacy of federal law over state law only applies if the federal government is acting in pursuance to its constitutionally granted powers.  

Also, the Constitution is itself superior to federal laws and treaties. If either of these, or any Executive order made by the President, or a state law, or other regulation similar to law, conflicts with the constitution, the Courts may declare it unconstitutional, and the law or regulation becomes void. Note that this is not explicitly provided for by the Constitution. Chief Justice John Marshall originally used '''judicial review'''- the power to declare laws unconstitutional- in the early 1800's when he decided the case ''Marbury v. Madison''.

==Oaths==

The Union and member state officers take an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Only the Union President's oath is explicitly spelled out- the form of the other oaths is left to the appropriate government. The Constitution, while mentioning oaths, specifically prohibits the United States or a member state from requiring a religious oath or observance of a certain religion in order to qualify for any office.

==Amendment==

The Constitution is not an unchangeable document. Changes to it are known as '''amendments'''. By tradition, an amendment does not strike out words and insert others. In order to leave the original Constitution whole, Amendments are added as separate Articles at the end of the Constitution. 

There are two ways in which an amendment can be proposed, and two ways in which it can be '''ratified''', or approved. First, the Amendment can be proposed by Congress. For this to occur, two-thirds of the House of Representatives and two-thirds of the Senate must vote for the Amendment. Second, an Amendment can be proposed by a Constitutional Convention. If two-thirds of the member states make an application to Congress, Congress must call this Convention, which then proposes Amendments. However, a Constitutional Convention has never been called. 

Regardless of the way in which the Amendment is proposed, it must be ratified by three-fourths of the member states. The first manner in which ratification by a member state may occur is through the legislature. Secondly, a state convention can be called to ratify an amendment. The second method has only been used once. Note that each member state cannot decide which method it wishes to use. Whoever proposed the Amendment- the Congress or a Union Convention- will decide if legislatures or state conventions will ratify. 

There have been twenty-seven Constitutional Amendments to date. The first ten guarantee certain already existing rights to the people and member states- they are therefore known as the Bill of Rights.

==First Amendment==


&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&quot;

The First Amendment is the best-known amendment to most Americans. It provides for and guarantees certain fundamental and basic human rights, such as:

1. '''''Freedom of religion.''''' The amendment states: &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.&quot; This means that Congress cannot make one religion official, or require people to worship in a certain way. It also forbids Congress, Federal and State courts, and State legislatures from prohibiting any one religion from being practiced. 

2. '''''Freedom of speech and of the press.''''' The amendment also guarantees that Americans have freedom of speech, and forbids both the Federal Government and State Governments from punishing a person for expressing their views. It also calls for the freedom of the press and bars the Government from interfering with/censoring the press. Therefor the government cannot control the press (i.e. controlling what the press publishes or punishing the same for publishing a particular article or airing on television or radio a particular segment/video.)       

3. '''''Freedom of assembly and petition.''''' The amendment guarantees that the people have the right to assemble in a peaceful manner and to consult for their common good. This has also be interpreted by the courts to also guarantee freedom of association. It also states that Americans may petition the Federal Government for a redress of grievances.    

==Second Amendment==

&quot;A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;

The second amendment guarantees that individual Americans have the right to keep and bear firearms. The amendment is subject to many controversies about whether it applies to only people in the armed forces or everyday citizens. The Supreme Court has ruled however in ''District of Columbia vs Heller (2008)'' that the amendment applies to everyday citizens. A majority of gun laws and regulation in the USA are at State level.
==Third Amendment==

&quot;No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.&quot;


Soldiers, according to the Third, may not during peacetime be '''quartered''' or housed in a residence without the consent of the owner. Furthermore, even in wartime, a law is required to force people to quarter soldiers.

The Supreme Court and others have also attributed a right to personal privacy within this amendment.

==Fourth Amendment==
The fourth amendment of the United States Constitution reads as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fourth amendment can be broken into two distinct parts. The first part provides protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, although unreasonable has been defined in a myraid of different ways.  However, the framers did not qualify how a violation of this amendment was to be punished.  Case law has afforded the exclusionary rule to ensure that evidence improperly collected is excluded from trial. (See ''Wolf v. Colorado'', ''Mapp v. Ohio'', and ''United States v. Leon'' for more information on the progression of the exclusionary rule.) This gives law enforcement officers the incentive to respect the amendment.

The second part of the amendment provides for the proper issue of warrants.  However, it is important to note that it does not require that warrants be obtained prior to a search or seizure, only that searches and seizures are reasonable.  When warrants are issued, their must be probable cause. Probable cause is tested using the &quot;totality of circumstances&quot; test as defined in ''Illinois v. Gates''. (See ''Spinelli v. United States'' and ''Illinois v. Gates'' for the progression on probable cause tests. Also see ''Maryland v. Garison'' and ''Richards v. Wisconsin'' for more on search warrants.)  

'''Interesting Search and Seizure Cases'''
*http://www.wdnweb.com/2011/02/17/city-beefs-up-code/
*''Katz v. United States'': use of electronic eavesdropping by law enforcement
*''California v. Greenwood'': examination of curbside garbage
*''Florida v. Riley'': use of aerial surveillance by law enforcement
*''United States v. Karo'': use of electronic tracking by law enforcement
*''Kyllo v. United States'': use of thermal imaging by law enforcement

==Fifth Amendment==


&quot;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;


While the Fourth protects one against the police, the Fifth guarantees one's rights relating to actual charges of criminal activity. Firstly, the Fifth requires that a Grand Jury (a special body of lay-people) indict, or accuse, a person of a serious crime before he may be tried for it. The sole exception relates to the military, where Grand Juries are not used.

2:  the Amendment prohibits &quot;double jeopardy.&quot; Once a person has been tried and acquitted (found not guilty), the prosecutor cannot retry him, even if new evidence is discovered. However, the prohibition against double jeopardy does not extend to mistrials. If a jury cannot reach a verdict and the judge declares a mistrial, then the case may be retried.

3:   the Amendment provides that a person cannot be compelled to testify against themselves. A person may &quot;plead the Fifth&quot; to avoid self-incrimination. However, the government may grant immunity, or formal protection from prosecution, to a person. Then, the person cannot be punished for what crimes he might have committed, and can be forced to give evidence.

4:  the Fifth requires due process to be used. While due process is not defined in the Constitution, one may conclude that it involves fair trials with impartial juries and judges. 

5:  the Fifth prohibits government from taking away a person's property unless it provides fair compensation.

==Sixth Amendment==

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

The sixth amendment, like the fifth amendment, also guarantees and lays out a person's rights when that person had been accused of committing a crime. Firstly, a person is entitled to a &quot;speedy and public trail by an impartial jury.&quot; This means a person cannot be arrested/detained for an unreasonable amount of time before that person goes to trail, and the trail cannot be private, unless the person accused waivers this right and ask that the trail be private. The Supreme Court has also ruled that a trail can be held in private, if by having excess publicity would serve to undermine the accused person's right to due process. Also an accused person has the right to trail by jury, and the trail must held in the State or district in which the crime was alleged to be committed. 

Secondly, an accused person has the right to be informed of the &quot;nature and cause of the accusation&quot; against him. Therefore, an indictment must allege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision that it would allow the accused person to assert double jeopardy if the same charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution.

Thirdly, an accused person has the right to confront/cross-examine the wittiness against him, this also includes the right to cross-examine physical evidence that the prosecution will use against the accused person during the trail. An accused person also has the right to call witness to testify in his favor. If the witness refuses to testify, the court may, at the accused's request, order the witness to do so. However, in some cases the court may refuse to permit a defense witness to testify. For example, if a defense lawyer fails to notify the prosecution of the identity of a witness to gain a tactical advantage, that witness may be precluded from testifying

Fifthly, an accused person has the right to be represented by counsel (i.e. a lawyer) and if the accused person does not have a lawyer, and cannot afford one, the court must, upon the accused's request, appoint a lawyer to represent him. If the accused person is non compos mentis and incapable adequately of making his own defense, the court must, with or without the accused's request, appoint a lawyer to represent him.     

==Seventh Amendment==

&quot;In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.

The seventh amendment guarantees the right to trail by jury in common law (i.e. civil) suits.

==Eighth Amendment==

&quot;Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&quot;

The eighth amendment prohibits excessive bail from being required. This means that bail must appropriately match the crime in which the arrested/detained person is accused of committing. Therefor a person arrested for littering cannot be put on bail for 50,000 dollars, as that would be excessive for that respective offense. However bail may be denied if a person is arrested on murder charges. It also prohibits excessive fines from being imposed as punishment for crime and again must appropriately match the respective crime. Lastly, it forbids cruel and unusual punishments. 

==Ninth Amendment==

The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

The ninth amendment states that Americans have more rights than what are listed in the Bill of Rights and that all because a right is not listed in the same, does not mean Americans do not posses that right.

==Tenth Amendment==

&quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.

The Tenth Amendment prevents the Union government from regulating a matter it is not constitutionally entitled to regulate. The Union government, therefore, cannot infringe upon a state's reserved powers.

Law.

their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for
any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other

In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death,
Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said
Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by

proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of
Departments.

the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End

===Section 3===
New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States

without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of
the Congress.

The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and
Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United
States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice
any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.

===Section 4===
The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican
Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on
Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature

==Article V==

The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall
propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the
Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for
proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and
Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of
three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths

without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.

==Article VI==

All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this
Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this
Constitution, as under the Confederation.

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in
Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the
Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the
several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of
the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or
Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be
required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United
States.

==Article VII==

In Congress, July 4, 1776

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new guards for their future security -- Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. -- The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our People, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:

For abolishing the free system of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislature, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

No State shall engage in any war without the consent of the United States in Congress assembled, unless such State be actually invaded by enemies, or shall have received certain advice of a resolution being formed by some nation of Indians to invade such State, and the danger is so imminent as not to admit of a delay till the United States in Congress assembled can be consulted; nor shall any State grant commissions to any ships or vessels of war, nor letters of marque or reprisal, except it be after a declaration of war by the United States in Congress assembled, and then only against the Kingdom or State and the subjects thereof, against which war has been so declared, and under such regulations as shall be established by the United States in Congress assembled, unless such State be infested by pirates, in which case vessels of war may be fitted out for that occasion, and kept so long as the danger shall continue, or until the United States in Congress assembled shall determine otherwise.

==Article VII==

When land forces are raised by any State for the common defense, all officers of or under the rank of colonel, shall be appointed by the legislature of each State respectively, by whom such forces shall be raised, or in such manner as such State shall direct, and all vacancies shall be filled up by the State which first made the appointment.

==Article VIII==

All charges of war, and all other expenses that shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare, and allowed by the United States in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of a common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several States in proportion to the value of all land within each State, granted or surveyed for any person, as such land and the buildings and improvements thereon shall be estimated according to such mode as the United States in Congress assembled, shall from time to time direct and appoint.

The taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and levied by the authority and direction of the legislatures of the several States within the time agreed upon by the United States in Congress assembled.

==Article IX==

The United States in Congress assembled, shall have the sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, except in the cases mentioned in the sixth article -- of sending and receiving ambassadors -- entering into treaties and alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made whereby the legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever -- of establishing rules for deciding in all cases, what captures on land or water shall be legal, and in what manner prizes taken by land or naval forces in the service of the United States shall be divided or appropriated -- of granting letters of marque and reprisal in times of peace -- appointing courts for the trial of piracies and felonies committed on the high seas and establishing courts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of captures, provided that no member of Congress shall be appointed a judge of any of the said courts.

The United States in Congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more States concerning boundary, jurisdiction or any other causes whatever; which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following. Whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of any State in controversy with another shall present a petition to Congress stating the matter in question and praying for a hearing, notice thereof shall be given by order of Congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other State in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question: but if they cannot agree, Congress shall name three persons out of each of the United States, and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven, nor more than nine names as Congress shall direct, shall in the presence of Congress be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose names shall be so drawn or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear and finally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination: and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without showing reasons, which Congress shall judge sufficient, or being present shall refuse to strike, the Congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each State, and the secretary of Congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgement and sentence of the court to be appointed, in the manner before prescribed, shall be final and conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence, or judgement, which shall in like manner be final and decisive, the judgement or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to Congress, and lodged among the acts of Congress for the security of the parties concerned: provided that every commissioner, before he sits in judgement, shall take an oath to be administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court of the State, where the cause shall be tried, 'well and truly to hear and determine the matter in question, according to the best of his judgement, without favor, affection or hope of reward': provided also, that no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States.

All controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under different grants of two or more States, whose jurisdictions as they may respect such lands, and the States which passed such grants are adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time claimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of jurisdiction, shall on the petition of either party to the Congress of the United States, be finally determined as near as may be in the same manner as is before prescribed for deciding disputes respecting territorial jurisdiction between different States.

The United States in Congress assembled shall also have the sole and exclusive right and power of regulating the alloy and value of coin struck by their own authority, or by that of the respective States -- fixing the standards of weights and measures throughout the United States -- regulating the trade and managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the States, provided that the legislative right of any State within its own limits be not infringed or violated -- establishing or regulating post offices from one State to another, throughout all the United States, and exacting such postage on the papers passing through the same as may be requisite to defray the expenses of the said office -- appointing all officers of the land forces, in the service of the United States, excepting regimental officers -- appointing all the officers of the naval forces, and commissioning all officers whatever in the service of the United States -- making rules for the government and regulation of the said land and naval forces, and directing their operations.

The United States in Congress assembled shall have authority to appoint a committee, to sit in the recess of Congress, to be denominated 'A Committee of the States', and to consist of one delegate from each State; and to appoint such other committees and civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the United States under their direction -- to appoint one of their members to preside, provided that no person be allowed to serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of three years; to ascertain the necessary sums of money to be raised for the service of the United States, and to appropriate and apply the same for defraying the public expenses -- to borrow money, or emit bills on the credit of the United States, transmitting every half-year to the respective States an account of the sums of money so borrowed or emitted -- to build and equip a navy -- to agree upon the number of land forces, and to make requisitions from each State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white inhabitants in such State; which requisition shall be binding, and thereupon the legislature of each State shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men and cloath, arm and equip them in a solid- like manner, at the expense of the United States; and the officers and men so cloathed, armed and equipped shall march to the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled. But if the United States in Congress assembled shall, on consideration of circumstances judge proper that any State should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number of men than the quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised, officered, cloathed, armed and equipped in the same manner as the quota of each State, unless the legislature of such State shall judge that such extra number cannot be safely spread out in the same, in which case they shall raise, officer, cloath, arm and equip as many of such extra number as they judge can be safely spared. And the officers and men so cloathed, armed, and equipped, shall march to the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States in Congress assembled.

The United States in Congress assembled shall never engage in a war, nor grant letters of marque or reprisal in time of peace, nor enter into any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the value thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses necessary for the defense and welfare of the United States, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor borrow money on the credit of the United States, nor appropriate money, nor agree upon the number of vessels of war, to be built or purchased, or the number of land or sea forces to be raised, nor appoint a commander in chief of the army or navy, unless nine States assent to the same: nor shall a question on any other point, except for adjourning from day to day be determined, unless by the votes of the majority of the United States in Congress assembled.

The Congress of the United States shall have power to adjourn to any time within the year, and to any place within the United States, so that no period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space of six months, and shall publish the journal of their proceedings monthly, except such parts thereof relating to treaties, alliances or military operations, as in their judgement require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the delegates of each State on any question shall be entered on the journal, when it is desired by any delegates of a State, or any of them, at his or their request shall be furnished with a transcript of the said journal, except such parts as are above excepted, to lay before the legislatures of the several States.

==Article X==

The Committee of the States, or any nine of them, shall be authorized to execute, in the recess of Congress, such of the powers of Congress as the United States in Congress assembled, by the consent of the nine States, shall from time to time think expedient to vest them with; provided that no power be delegated to the said Committee, for the exercise of which, by the Articles of Confederation, the voice of nine States in the Congress of the United States assembled be requisite.

==Article XI==

Canada acceding to this confederation, and adjoining in the measures of the United States, shall be admitted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this Union; but no other colony shall be admitted into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine States.

==Introduction==

Since the Bill of Rights, there have been seventeen Amendments to the Constitution.

==Eleventh Amendment==

&quot;The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.&quot;

The eleventh amendment was adopted in response to the Supreme Court case ''Chisolm v. Georgia'', (1793) which the court rules that the Constitution granted federal courts the power to hear cases brought against states from its own citizens or citizens of different state or citizens of subject or foreign countries and as such states lacked sovereign immunity from suits brought in federal courts. The amendment superseded and overruled the supreme court ruling and established the states have sovereign immunity from from suits brought against them from citizens of another states or citizens of foreign countries.          

==Twelfth Amendment==

The Twelfth Amendment fine-tuned the process for electing the President. [[United States Government/The Executive Branch#Elections|(See Part III, Chapter 2 for details.)]]

==Thirteenth Amendment==

The Thirteenth Amendment abolished and outlawed slavery everywhere in the United States and every place subject to their jurisdiction. It also abolished and outlawed involuntary servitude except to punish crime.  

==Fourteenth Amendment==

Amended in 1868, the [[w:Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] served to extend much of the Bill of Rights to the states by requiring that &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.&quot; It was essentially a reaffirmation that all citizens are considered equal regardless of race. 

Secondly, the Amendment provided that a State cannot deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.

Thirdly, the amendment required that every State provide equal protection to all of its citizens- this clause intended to prevent discrimination against African-Americans, although due to several supreme court rulings the clauses effects were almost rendered invalid.   

Fourthly, it removed the original Constitutional requirement that &quot;other persons&quot; (slaves) count as three-fifths of a person when determining the official state population and that all persons count toward a States population.

Fifthly, it stated that a State's representation in Congress would be reduced if that State prohibited males over twenty-one from voting for a reason other than commission of a crime. 

Sixthly, the Amendment prohibited any person who participates in a rebellion such as the Civil War from serving in government unless the Congress formally agrees, by a two-thirds vote in each house, to exempt the person from this disqualification. 

Seventhly, the Fourteenth required that any debts incurred by the Union (the North) during the Civil War were to be held valid and as such had to be paid, but that any and all debts incurred by the Confederacy were illegal and void and as such could not and would not be paid. It also stated that any person who lost slaves during the civil war could not sue the Government because of the loss thereof. 

==Fifteenth Amendment==
The Fifteenth Amendment took another barrier away from minorities right to vote by barring the creation of laws that barred someone from voting based on their color, race, or having been former slaves.

==Sixteenth Amendment==

The Sixteenth Amendment made Income Taxes constitutional. It was passed to resolve disputes regarding the matter. At one time, the Supreme Court ruled that the Tax was constitutional, while ruling at another time that it was not. All doubts were removed by the Sixteenth.

==Seventeenth Amendment==

The Seventeenth provided that the people of a state, and not the legislature, would be the electors of Senators. However, it retained the power of legislatures to temporarily fill vacancies until an election can be held.

==Eighteenth Amendment==

The Eighteenth Amendment created Prohibition, banning intoxicating liquors in the United States. It allowed both the federal and the state governments to concurrently legislate on the matter.

==Nineteenth Amendment==

The Nineteenth granted women the right to vote on an equal basis with men.

==Twentieth Amendment==

The Twentieth Amendment was known as the &quot;lame duck&quot; amendment.  According to the original constitution and the twelfth amendment, a newly elected president did not take office until March 4.  In the early days of the Republic, elections were held on different days in different jurisdictions, and travel and communication were slow.  By the 1930s, however, the election was uniformly held in early November, and the winner of a presidential election was usually apparent by the next morning.  This meant that a newly elected president had to wait four months take take office, leavin the outgoing president a &quot;lame duck.&quot;

This amendment moved up the date for a new president to take office from March 4 to January 20.  The first day for the newly elected Congress was moved up to January 3, allowing Congress time to select the president or vice president should the need arise.  The amendment also required that Congress meet each year on January 3, unless a different day was chosen.

The amendment also provided for several remote circumstances involving deaths or resignations of presidents-elect and vice presidents-elect, as well presidential and vice presidential candidates.

==Twenty-First Amendment==

The Twenty-First is the only Amendment that repeals, or cancels/invalidates, a previous Amendment. The Twenty-First repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended Prohibition at a national level, although it exclusively gave the States the power to prohibit the sale, manufacture or distribution of intoxicating liquors within their respective borders. 

==Twenty-Second Amendment==

George Washington set a standard for all future Presidents when he declined to seek a third term. This standard was either voluntarily followed by the President, or enforced by the voters, in every case until Franklin Roosevelt, who was elected four times. In order to restore Washington's tradition, the Amendment limited all future Presidents to a maximum of two terms.

==Twenty-Third Amendment==

The Twenty-third Amendment gave citizens of the District of Columbia the right to vote in Presidential election.

==Twenty-Fourth Amendment==

The Twenty-fourth prohibited the denial of a vote based on failure to pay a tax such as the poll tax. Southern states had used the poll tax to deny poor African-Americans the right to vote.

==Twenty-Fifth Amendment==

The Twenty-fifth provided special provisions for an emergency such as a disabled but still living President. The Amendment allowed the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet to formally declare the President unable to carry out his duties. If this was the case, then the Vice President would become Acting President until the President declared himself fit to continue. If the Vice President still felt that the President was not capable of continuing, then he and the Cabinet could again declare the President's disability. If this was the case, then Congress had to assemble to decide the matter. The President would continue unless the Congress, by a vote of two-thirds of each house, agreed with the Vice President and Cabinet.

==Twenty-Sixth Amendment==

The Twenty-sixth provided that all persons eighteen years or older could not be denied the right to vote due to age. 

==Twenty-Seventh Amendment==

The Twenty-seventh Amendment was originally proposed by Congress in 1789 at the same time as the Bill of Rights. However, it was not ratified by legislatures of the required three-fourths of the states until 1992. It provides that Congressional salary changes cannot take effect until an election (of Representatives) occurs.

==Congress==
As has been stated earlier, Congress includes two distinct houses- the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives represents the people of the States based upon the population of each, while the Senate allows two Senators to each state regardless of population.

==The Legislative==

The Congress is the Legislative Branch. Its main function is to make laws. It also oversees the execution of these laws, and checks various executive and judicial powers.

The Congress is ''bicameral''- it is composed of two houses. One house is the House of Representatives, the other is the Senate. 

The House of Representatives, or House for short, is currently composed of four hundred and thirty-five members. Each of the fifty states is allocated one or more representatives based on its population as calculated by the decennial (once in ten years) census. Each state is guaranteed at least one representative. A state that is allocated more than one representative divides itself, as state procedures dictate, into a number of districts equal to the number of representatives to which it is entitled. The people of each district vote to elect one representative to Congress (States that have only one representative allocated choose ''at-large'' representatives- the state votes as one entire district). The District of Columbia and a number of U.S. territories have been permitted to elect delegates to the House. These delegates may participate in debates, and sit and vote in committee, but are not allowed to vote in the full House. Every House member faces re-election in an even-numbered year and is elected to a two-year term. The House is presided over by a Speaker, who is directly elected by the members of the House.

The Senate is the upper house of the United States' legislative branch, possessing only one hundred members to the house's four hundred thirty-five. Each state chooses two senators, regardless of that state's population. The Constitution originally dictated that a state's senators were to be chosen by the state's legislature; after the Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, senators were elected directly by the state's population. In contrast to the House's two-year terms, Senators are elected to a six-year stint in office. In addition, only one-third of the Senate stands for election during an even year. These differences between the two houses were deliberately put into place by the Founding Fathers; the Senate was intended to be a more stable, austere body, whereas the House would be more responsive to the people's will.

The Vice-President is President of the Senate, but he/she only votes if there is a tie. The Senate also chooses a President Pro Tempore to preside in the Vice-President's absence (though, in practice, most of the time, senators from the majority take turns presiding for short periods).

The Senate and the House are both required to approve legislation before it becomes a law. The two houses are equal in legislative power, but revenue bills (bills relating to taxation) may only originate in the House. However, as with any other bill, the Senate's approval is still required, and the Senate may amend such bills.

The Senate holds additional powers relating to treaties and the appointments of executive and judicial officials. This power is known as &quot;advice and consent.&quot; The Senate's advice and consent is required for the President to appoint judges and many executive officers, and also to ratify treaties. To grant advice and consent on treaties, two-thirds of the Senators must concur (agree).

While most votes require a simple majority to pass, it sometimes takes three-fifths of senators to bring a bill to a vote. This is because Senate rules hold that a bill cannot be voted on as long as it is being debated--and there is no limit on how long a senator may debate a bill. Senators sometimes use this rule to filibuster a bill--that is, continue debating a bill endlessly so that it cannot be voted on.  The only way to end a filibuster is for three-fifths of all Senators to vote for a cloture resolution, which ends all debate and brings the bill up for voting. Use of the filibuster tends to be controversial. Whichever party is in the majority tends to call its use &quot;obstructionism,&quot; while the other side sees it as an important check on the majority. 

The House has the sole power to impeach federal executive and judicial officers. According to the Constitution, officers may be impeached for &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” The Senate has the sole power to try all such impeachments, a two-thirds vote being required for conviction. The Constitution requires that any individual convicted by the Senate to be removed from office. The Senate also has the power to bar that individual from further federal office. The Senate may not impose any further punishment, although the parties are still subject to trial in the courts. As the Vice-President (being next-in-line to the Presidency) would have an obvious conflict of interest in presiding at a trial of the President, in such cases, the Chief Justice presides. Interestingly, no similar provision prevents the Vice-President from presiding at his or her own trial.

==House of Representatives==

Every ten years, the United States conducts a Census to determine the population of each state. Then, each state is apportioned, or allocated, a number of seats based on its Census population, with the more populous states receiving more seats than the less populous ones. Currently, one seat equals roughly 600,000 constituents. However, no matter how low a state's population is, it is always entitled to at least one seat.

The state then conducts a process known as redistricting. In this process, the state divides itself into a number of districts of equal population; each district may then elect one representative. Of course, in states entitled to only one representative, the entire state is one district and redistricting does not occur. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymander gerrymandering])

In addition to representatives for the states, five American territories- the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands, and American Samoa- each choose non-voting members. Puerto Rico chooses a &quot;Resident Commissioner&quot; for a four-year term, while the others choose &quot;Delegates&quot; for two-year terms.

Representatives hold office for two-year terms. The election for Representatives is held on the Tuesday immediately after the first Monday in November of every even numbered year. A Representative actually takes office on January 3rd after the election.

No person may be a Representative unless he qualifies under the Constitution as follows. The requirements are: at least twenty-five years of age, inhabitance in the state of election, and citizenship of the United States for at least seven years.

Though no specific number of Representatives is set by the Constitution, the law of the United States sets the number of Representatives at 435.

The House of Representatives elects a Speaker who presides over the House.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Speaker is traditionally the leader of the majority party of the House.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, B. (1995). ''Legislators, leaders, and lawmaking the U.S. House of Representatives in the postreform era.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; The Speaker of the House does have a significant role outside of the Congress in that she or he is  third in line to the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt; Presidential Succession Act(3 U.S.C. § 19) and Section 4 of Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its size, the House relies heavily upon fixed rules and strict timetables for debate.  When bills are debated on the floor of the House, each party's leader is allocated a fixed amount of time to present their argument for or against the bill, and they can appropriate this time to members of their party as they see fit.  During House debates, it is common for representatives to &quot;yield their time&quot; to one another.  Times for debate and other procedures are set by the House Rules Committee, which is generally considered to be one of the most powerful committees in Congress.

==Senate==

Each state is entitled to two senators regardless of population. Originally, the state legislatures chose the senators. However, the people of the states choose their own senators at present.

Senators hold office for six-year terms. Elections are held every two years, at the same time as the election for Representatives. The Senators are classified into three separate classes. At each election, the Senate seats of one particular class are up for election. 

Constitutional requirements for Senators are slightly more strict than those for Representatives. The qualifications are: at least thirty years of age, inhabitance in the state of election, and citizenship of the United States for at least nine years. 

The Vice President of the United States presides over the Senate and holds the title of President of the Senate. His power is considerably lesser than that of the Speaker of the House. He also does not have a vote in the Senate, unless the Senate is tied. As the Vice President normally does not attend unless there is a likelihood of a tie vote, the Senate chooses one of its members to be President of the Senate ''pro tempore'', or temporarily. The President pro tem, as he is often called, is normally the most senior Senator of the majority party. Just as in the house, the President or President pro tem does not preside during most meetings; this task is often given to new Senators so that they may learn the procedures of the body. This is not as easily possible in the House because of the much greater authority of whoever presides over the Representatives.

In comparison to the House, the Senate has relatively few procedural rules, and no fixed schedules for debate.  It is possible for a Senator to continue speaking for hours on end to delay unwanted legislation: this tactic is called a &quot;filibuster.&quot;  Any individual Senator is also allowed, by Senate rules, to stop the introduction of a bill with a motion from the floor, although this is almost never done in practice.

==Party leaders, committees, and caucuses==

Both major political parties (the Republican Party and the Democratic Party) have designated floor leaders in both houses of Congress.  The floor leader for the majority party is called the House (or Senate) Majority Leader, while the floor leader for the minority party is called the House (or Senate) Minority Leader.  The second-in-command of each party's delegation is called the Whip, as their job is to &quot;whip&quot; other members of the party into action on various legislative measures.

Each party's leadership is responsible for allocating its members to committees.  There are a number of &quot;standing committees&quot; in each house, dedicated to various government functions such as the armed forces, education, and transportation.  At any time, there are also several &quot;select committees&quot; that are set up for more timely problems such as government reforms.  Occasionally, both houses of Congress will establish a &quot;joint committee&quot; to deal with certain issues.

There are also many less formal associations in Congress, known as &quot;caucuses,&quot; which are formed by members interested in various issues, such as relations with specific countries, ethnic issues, and industrial sectors.

The Executive Branch, which executes and enforces the laws, is headed by the President and the Vice President. In addition, it includes the executive departments, which deal with general topics, and the heads of departments, who are known as Secretaries (Attorney-General in the Department of Justice). Each Department, in turn, is divided into a number of bodies, which are known as agencies, services, commissions, councils, bureaus, authorities, offices, administrations, and boards.

==The President==

The President is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The President leads the Executive Branch and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. 

Article Two of US Constitution vest the executive power in the President. The power includes execution of federal law, alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers and making treaties with foreign nations, however all treaties made by the President must be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves, and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances. The President is also largely reasonable for dictating the legislative agenda of the party to which he is enrolled. 

The President of the United States is considered one of the most powerful people in the world, as he leads the wolds only superpower. 

===Powers and Duties===
'''Article One: Legislative Powers.'''

The first power the President is given in the Constitution, is the power to veto bills of legislation. The Constitution requires that all bills passed by Congress to be presented to the President before it can obtain legal force. Once a bill has been presented, the President as one of three options:
# The president may sign the bill, it which case it obtains legal force.
# The President may veto (refuse to sign) the bill, in which case it does not obtain legal force. The President then returns the bill, expressing any obligation he may have had on it, to Congress. Congress may override a veto by a two-thirds vote in both houses. Upon overriding the veto, the bill obtains legal force.
# The President may take no action on a bill. In this case the President does not sign or veto the legislation. If after ten day, not including Sundays, the President has still neither signed nor vetoed the bill, two possible outcomes emerge:
#* If Congress is still convened, the bill becomes law.
#* If Congress has adjourned, thus preventing the return of the legislation, the bill does not become law. This latter outcome is known as the pocket veto. 
'''Article Two: Executive Powers.'''

One of the most important Presidential powers is the command-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the United States. While the Constitution vest the power to declare war solely in Congress, the President is ultimately reasonable for the disposition and direction of the Armed Forces. 

Along with the armed forces, the president also directs U.S. foreign policy. Through the Department of State and the Department of Defense, the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the United States. The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiates treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States when approved by two-thirds vote of the Senate.&lt;sup&gt;[''citation needed'']&lt;/sup&gt;

Although not constitutionally provided, presidents also sometimes employ &quot;executive agreements&quot; in foreign relations. These agreements frequently regard administrative policy choices germane to executive power; for example, the extent to which either country presents an armed presence in a given area, how each country will enforce copyright treaties, or how each country will process foreign mail. However, the 20th century witnessed a vast expansion of the use of executive agreements, and critics have challenged the extent of that use as supplanting the treaty process and removing constitutionally prescribed checks and balances over the executive in foreign relations. Supporters counter that the agreements offer a pragmatic solution when the need for swift, secret, and/or concerted action arises

The President is the head/leader of the Executive Branch of the federal government and is Constitutionally bound to &quot;take care that the law be faithfully executed.&quot; The President has the power to make appointments within the Executive branch. Ambassadors, members of the Presidential Cabinet, and federal court officers are appointed by the President, although every appointed official by him must be approved by the Senate. 

The President also has the power to fire/remove purely executive officials at will, although Congress has the authority to curtail or constrain the Presidents power to fire/remove commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute. 

The president possesses the ability to direct much of the executive branch through executive orders that are grounded in federal law or constitutionally granted executive power. Executive orders are reviewable by federal courts and can be superseded by federal legislation.

The president also has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations do require Senate confirmation. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of Senatorial courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves for offense recognizable under federal law. The President cannot, however, grant pardons in impeachment cases, or grant pardons for persons convicted under State law/Jurisdiction.

The President also cannot be simultaneously a member of Congress, neither can any other executive officer. Therefore, the President cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in Congress. However, the President can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially if the President's political party has a majority in one or both houses of Congress. For example, the President or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. The President can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated, periodic reports to Congress. These reports may be either written or oral, but today are given as the State of the Union address, which often outlines the President's legislative proposals for the coming year. Additionally, the President may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.

===Succession===

If the President dies, resigns, is removed from office, or is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the Presidency, the Vice-President becomes President. 

Under the Twenty-Fifth amendment, the President may declare himself disabled and upon doing so, transfers the powers and duties of the Presidency to the Vice-President, who then becomes acting President. The President may resume the powers and duties of the Presidency by declaring himself again able to discharge the same. Under the same amendment, the Vice-President, along with a majority of the members of the President's cabinet, may declare the President disabled by submitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House and the president ''pro tempore'' of the Senate, stating that President is disabled from discharging the powers and duties of the Presidency, and upon doing so, transfer the Presidential powers to the Vice-President as acting President. The President may resume discharging the powers and duties of the Presidency by submitting a written declaration to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President ''pro tempore'' of the senate stating that such disability does not exist. If the Vice-President and Cabinet contest this claim, it is up to Congress, which must meet within two days if not already in session, to decide the merit of the claim.

A President is: 
# required to be natural born citizen, 
# required to be at least thirty-five years of age, 
# required to have been a permanent resident in the United States for at least Fourteen years, 
# barred from being elected to the office more than twice. 
A person may not hold the office of President, if that person:
# was impeached by the Senate and voted by the same to be disqualified from holding any federal office, including that of President,
# Once swore to uphold the Constitution and latter rebelled against the United States, although such disqualification can be removed by a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress. 

==The Vice President==

The Vice President's only executive function in the Constitution is to become President in the event that the President dies or is incapacitated. The 25th Amendment provides that this may occur when:

#&quot;the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary;&quot; or

#&quot;the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.&quot;

Additionally, &quot;whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.&quot;

In practice, the Vice President often takes an active role in policy making.

The Vice President also serves as president of the Senate, but cannot vote except to break a tie.

==Elections==

Each state is entitled to choose a number of Electors equal to the number of Representatives and Senators it elects to Congress. Thus, a state will choose no less than three electors- two for the Senators, and one for the minimum of one Representative.

The state may choose its Electors in any way it pleases. However, all the states allow the people to choose all Electors. Forty-eight states use the following system: each candidate nominates a panel of electors. When a voter votes for a candidate, they actually vote for the nominated panel. Then, the candidate who wins more votes than any other candidate has his nominated panel appointed. Thus, a candidate who does not necessarily win all the votes will receive all of the state's electors. The exceptions to this system are Maine and Nebraska. These states allow a candidate to nominate one state panel of two electors, plus one elector for each district. Then, the candidate who wins the state has his two-member state panel appointed as electors, while the candidate who wins an individual district has his  nominee for that district appointed. In all cases, the election for the Electors is held on the same day as Congressional elections.

Regardless of how they are chosen, the Electors all assemble in their own states in December. The manner of the voting by Electors has changed. Firstly, the following is the original system:
* Each Elector casts two votes for President. One of those votes must be for a person not an inhabitant of the same state as the Elector. Then, if a candidate receives the votes of a majority of Electors becomes President, while the runner-up becomes Vice President. If one compares the Presidency to a gold medal, then one may say that the Vice Presidency was like a silver medal.
If, however, no candidate received a majority, then the House of Representatives would choose one of the top five candidates as President. In voting for President, each state casts one block vote. In any case, whichever other candidate holds the greatest number of votes other than the candidate elected President becomes Vice President. In case of a tie for second-place, the Senate elects the Vice President.
* The above system seems to allow for all contingencies, but it did not allow for the development of political parties. Prior to the election of 1800, parties did not nominate candidates. However, in 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party nominated Thomas Jefferson for President and Aaron Burr for Vice President. The pair won a clear majority of the votes. However, both had an equal number of Electoral votes. Though the original intention was clearly for Jefferson to become President and Burr to become Vice President, the House still had to vote to choose one or the other as President. The House votes tied thirty-five times until Jefferson was finally elected President.
* In order to prevent a recurrence, the Twelfth Amendment was passed. Under the Amendment, the electors would vote separately for President and Vice President. In each case, a majority was required for someone to be elected. If no majority was apparent for President, then the House would choose among the top three candidates, again voting by states. Similarly, the Senate would vote between the top two candidates for Vice President.

The District of Columbia chooses Electors like the other states, but the District can in no event choose more Electors than any other state.

==Executive departments==

At present, there are fifteen executive departments. They are the departments of:

*Department of Agriculture (USDA)
*Department of Commerce (DOC)
*Department of Defense (DOD)
*Department of Education (ED)
*Department of Energy (DOE)
*Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
*Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
*Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
*Department of Justice (DOJ)
*Department of Labor (DOL)
*Department of State (DOS)
*Department of the Interior (DOI)
*Department of the Treasury
*Department of Transportation (DOT)
*Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

Each department is subdivided into a number of agencies, bureaus and other divisions.

==Executive agencies==

In addition to the Cabinet departments, there are certain independent bodies which are not part of any department, but report directly to the Executive Office of the President. These include:

* Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
* National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
* Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
* Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)
* Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR)

==The Cabinet==
The Cabinet currently consists of the Vice President, the White House Chief of Staff, the heads of each executive department, and the heads of the EPA, OMB, ONDCP and USTR.

==The Courts==

The United States judicial system includes the Supreme Court of the United States and the inferior federal courts. The President nominates an individual to serve as a judge, after which the Senate must grant its advice and consent before the President can formally appoint the judge. A judge holds office during &quot;good behavior&quot;, which is usually interpreted as meaning a life term.

==The Supreme Court==

The Constitution creates the Supreme Court, but permits Congress to set the number of Justices. Currently, the Supreme Court includes the Chief Justice of the United States and eight Associate Justices. The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over limited categories of cases, such as cases between two or more states.  It hears most of its cases through its appellate jurisdiction, in which it hears appeals from lower federal and state courts. It exercises its appellate jurisdiction selectively; four of the nine Justices must grant a ''writ of certiorari'' before a case can be heard.

==The Court of Appeals==

The United States is divided into twelve regional ''circuits'', each of which has a Court of Appeal. Additionally, there is a Federal Circuit which hears appeals from certain special tribunals and courts. The regional circuits (which are officially known by a number only, except for the DC circuit) are as follows:
* District of Columbia
* First Circuit- Northern New England (Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island plus the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico)
* Second Circuit- Southern New England (Vermont, New York, and Connecticut)
* Third Circuit- Middle Atlantic (Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey plus US Territory Virgin Islands)
* Fourth Circuit- Upper Southeast (Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina)
* Fifth Circuit- Deep South (Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi)
* Sixth Circuit- Eastern Great Lakes (Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee)
* Seventh Circuit- Western Great Lakes (Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana)
* Eighth Circuit- Midwest (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska)
* Ninth Circuit- West (Alaska, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona plus US Territories Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands)
* Tenth Circuit- Southwest (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico)
* Eleventh Circuit- Lower Southeast (Alabama, Georgia, and Florida)

Each Court of Appeal includes a different number of members. The First Circuit has the fewest with six members, while the Ninth Circuit has the most with twenty-eight.

==District Court==

Every state is divided into one or more Court Districts (which are distinct from Congressional districts). The total number of districts is ninety-four. 

Each district court includes a different number of members. The Eastern and Western District of Kentucky, the Eastern District of Oklahoma, and the Northern, Eastern, and Western District of Oklahoma, each have the fewest number of judges with one, while the Central District of California has the most with twenty-seven.

==Other Courts==

The Congress has established special bankruptcy courts and other courts to rule on specific matters.

{{Japanese related|content|
* [[../Sentence ending particles/]]}}
The Japanese language uses post-position particles (助詞; じょし) to denote the direction of an action and who is performing the action.  They consistently come after the word that they modify.

There are three particles used very frequently in the language: は, を and が. This module covers these along with a few other common ones but an exhaustive list would run very long.

== The topic and subject markers は and が ==

The particle &quot;は&quot; (pronounced as &quot;わ&quot; when used as a particle) is the ''topic marker'' denoting topic of discussion, while &quot;が&quot; is the ''subject marker'' and marks a noun that performs an action. The difference between the two tends to cause confusion among beginners but their usage can be summed up as matter of focus.

The topic particle &quot;は&quot; is used when introducing a topic and gives focus to the ''action'' of the sentence (i.e., the verb or the adjective). The subject marker &quot;が&quot; is used when emphasising the subject giving  focus to the ''subject'' of the action.

One can also think of it as replacing &quot;~は&quot; with the phrase &quot;as for ~&quot;, &quot;on the topic of ~&quot; or &quot;regarding ~&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;が&quot;. While these phrases aren't common in English we can use these expressions here to better show the main difference between &quot;は&quot; and &quot;が&quot;. 
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | ねこ'''は''' たべて います。 || The cat is eating (or: Regarding the cat, it is eating.)
|-
| ねこ'''が''' たべて います。 || The ''cat'' is eating (as opposed to someone else).
|-
| きみ '''は''' つよい。 || You are strong.
|-
| きみ '''が''' つよい。 || ''You'' are strong (only you and not anyone else)
|-
| あれ '''は''' でんわ だ。 || That's the telephone.
|-
| あれ '''が''' でんわ だ。 || ''That's'' the telephone (and not anything else)
|}

The difference can also be displayed by using both subject and topic markers in one sentence: 
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | わたし'''は''' あなた'''が''' すき です。 || I like you. (Or literally: as for me, like you.)
|-
| わたし'''は''' わさび'''が''' きらい です。 || I dislike/hate wasabi. (Or: As for me, hate wasabi.)
|-
| あなた'''は''' えいご'''が''' じょうず です。 || Your English is good! (Or: As for you, English good!)
|}
One has to be careful using both &quot;は&quot; and &quot;が&quot; in one sentence. If a verb is actually acting on the (direct) subject, usually a different particle (like を) has to be used.

&quot;は&quot; is generally more flexible, because the &quot;it&quot; can be assumed, and is therefore recommended to novices who have not grasped the difference between the two.

&quot;は&quot; also has the specialized function of being used for comparisons as well. 
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | ねこ'''が''' います。 || There is a cat.
|-
| いぬ'''が''' います。 || There is a dog.
|-
| ねこ'''は''' たべて います けど, いぬ'''は''' たべて いません。 || The cat is eating, but the dog is not.
|}

Often the grammatical subject may also be the topic. In this case, &quot;は&quot; normally replaces &quot;が&quot;. However, if the subject is never known, you cannot use &quot;は&quot; and must use &quot;が&quot;. This is similar to using pronouns: You can't state, &quot;It is over there&quot;, without first stating what &quot;it&quot; may be.

== The direct object marker を ==

The particle &quot;を&quot; (pronounced &quot;お&quot;) is the ''direct object marker'' and marks the recipient of an action.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | おさけ '''を''' のむ。 || To drink sake.
|-
| ざっし '''を''' よむ。 || To read a magazine.
|-
| ねこ が みず '''を''' のんで います。 || The cat is drinking water.
|}

It also indicates the place through which the action occurs:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | そら '''を''' とぶ。 || To fly through the sky
|-
| みち '''を''' あるく。 || To walk down the street
|}

As with much of the language, parts of a sentence that can be assumed from context are often omitted and the direct object particle is commonly dropped in conversational (colloquial) Japanese.

== The indirect object marker に ==

&quot;に&quot; marks the verb's ''indirect object'' (i.e. the destination of a targeted verb action) translating as &quot;to&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot; or &quot;by&quot;. It also indicates the location touched or affected by an event or action:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | ほし'''に'''とんでいく。 || Fly '''to''' the stars.
|-
| 友だち'''に''' プレゼントを あげる。 || Give a present '''to''' a friend.
|-
| せんせい '''に''' いう。 || To tell (something) to the teacher.
|-
| 学校'''に''' いる。 || To be '''at''' school.
|-
| うち '''に''' いる。 || To be '''at''' home.
|-
| どようび '''に''' あう。 || To meet '''on''' Saturday
|}

The particle &quot;へ&quot; described below is used exclusively for marking the destination.

== The destination marker へ ==
へ (pronounced &quot;え&quot; when used as a particle) indicates the direction of an action, roughly the equivalent of &quot;to&quot; or &quot;toward&quot; in English.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | おかあさんはみせ'''へ''' いく。 || Mother is going to the store.
|-
| 東京'''へ''' いく。 || To go to Tokyo.
|}

== The question marker か ==

Placing か at the end of a sentence changes a statement into a question. Use it at the end of a verb to make it a question, or at the end of an interrogative [[../Pro-forms|pro-form]] to make it into a demonstrative pronoun.

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | 私は男です'''か''' || Am I a man?
|-
| これは どういうもの です '''か'''。 || How do you describe this?
|-
| ねこ　は います '''か'''。 || Is there a cat?
|-
| どこ '''か''' いきました '''か'''。|| Did you go somewhere?
|}

For more on the question marker, see: [[../Sentence ending particles/]].

== The possessive marker の ==

&quot;の&quot;, is most commonly used as a ''possessive marker'' (similar to the English &quot;'s&quot;).
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | せんせい'''の'''りんご。 || The teacher''''s''' apple
|-
| わたし '''の''' かばん。 || '''My''' bag.
|-
| かれ '''の''' とけい。 || '''His''' watch.
|}
The particle can also function as a noun link, indicating that the preceding noun (or [[Japanese/Lessons/Na-adjectives|adjectival noun]]) modifies the following noun.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | とうきょう'''の''' たてもの。 || Buildings '''in/of''' Tokyo.
|-
| みどり '''の''' ほん。 || A green book.
|}
It can also be used for ''nominalisation'', converting verbs and [[Japanese/Lessons/I-adjectives|(proper) adjectives]] into nouns.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | よむ '''の''' が いい。 || Read'''ing''' is good.
|}
Note that in this last example two particles are used together: の and が: the first makes the action a noun, and the second tells that this action is what the sentence is all about.

== The exhaustive list conjunction と ==

This particle acts as a conjunction on the words it separates. Unlike conjunctions of more than two words in English, where only the last two are separated with an &quot;and&quot; and the rest with commas, the Japanese conjunction separates each word and commas are not used.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | これ '''と''' それ が みどり です。 || This '''and''' that are green.
|-
| ほん '''と''' ざっし。 || A book '''and''' a magazine.
|-
| かばんに ペン '''と''' えんぴつ '''と''' 消しゴム '''と''' 定規がある。 || There is a pen''',''' a pencil''',''' an eraser '''and''' a ruler in the bag.
|}

This applies to exhaustive lists, i.e. when all objects are explicitly mentioned.

The particle is used to indicate parallelism with the subject, often meaning &quot;with&quot;:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | 彼 '''と''' 話をしました。 || I spoke '''with''' him.
|-
| 彼女 '''と''' いった。 || {I/He/She/They} went '''with''' her.
|-
| スミスさん '''と''' テニス を しました。 || (I) played tennis with Smith&quot;
|-
| わたし は あなた '''と''' けっこん する。 || I will marry you. (I will get married '''with''' you)
|}

== The incomplete list marker や ==

This particle is used to connect various words implying that the listing is not exhaustive. The particle &quot;など&quot; may be added after the list to emphasise that the list is incomplete.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Noun || Particle || Noun || ...
| style=&quot;color:gray&quot; | など
|}
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | ほん '''や''' ペン があります。 || There are books '''and''' pens (among other things).
|-
| ほん '''や''' ざっし。 || A book '''and''' a magazine (among other things).
|-
| 卵 '''や''' サラダ '''や''' 鳥肉 '''など''' が必要だ。 || (I) need eggs''',''' salad''',''' chicken '''and such'''.
|}

== The &quot;also&quot; marker も ==

も is quite simply a marker that says &quot;also&quot;. It replaces the particles は, が and を but can also follow other particles. This can also be used to form a large list of words all acting as though one of the basic particles (は, を, or が) were affecting the whole list.  
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Subject || Particle || Verb

{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | ねこ '''も''' のみます。 || The cat also drinks.
|-
| わたし '''も''' いく || I'm going too.
|-
| しょうねん '''も''' しょうじょ '''も''' じょせい '''も''' だんせい '''も''' にんげん です。 || Boys, girls, women and men are human.
|}

* [[../Pro-forms/]]}}
Worth noting is that used with an interrogative pro-form (e.g. who, where, how) the も particle negates the pro-form:
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | だれも① || anybody
|-
| e.g. だれもが知っていること || General knowledge.
|-
| だれも② || nobody
|-
| e.g. だれもいない || Nobody's here.
|}

== The means particle で ==

The particle で can be used in several situations indicating means. These can be for example an instrument, a location or a language.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| Means || Particle || Verb
|}
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | だいがくに なん'''で''' いきますか。 || '''By''' what means do you go to University?
|-
| じてんしゃ'''で''' いきます。 || I go '''by''' bicycle.
|-
| くるま'''で''' いく。 || I go '''by''' car.
|-
| わたしは レストラン '''で''' たべます。 || I eat '''at''' a restaurant.
|-
| スミスさんと こうえん '''で''' テニスを しました。 || I played tennis with Smith '''at''' the park.&quot;
|-
| がっこう '''で''' ならう。 || To learn '''at''' school.
|}

As a note of interest, the で from the copula である is also actually an instrumental-maker. で marks the whole previous expression instrumental to the verb ある. However, this is the classical meaning of the copula and rarely ''explicitly'' treated this way in modern Japanese.

== Origin and limit から and まで ==

These particles indicate the starting point or border of an action. This may be a location as well as a time and corresponds roughly with &quot;from&quot; and &quot;until&quot;.
{| {{Japanese example}}
| style=&quot;width:20em&quot; | とうきょう '''から''' くる。 || Come '''from''' Tokyo.
|-
| やま '''まで''' いく。 || To go '''to''' the mountains.
|-
| {{furi|時間|じかん}}は{{furi|9時|きゅうじ}}'''から''' {{furi|5時|ごじ}}'''まで''' です。
| The hours are '''from''' 9 '''to''' 5.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">''The Once and Future King''  is a novel by [[w:T. H. White|T. H. White]] about the legend of King Arthur. It is often assigned reading in English literature classes and is composed of five books:

#[[/The Sword in the Stone/]]
#[[The Queen of Air and Darkness]]
#[[/The Ill-Made Knight/]]
#[[/The Candle in the Wind/]]
#[[/The Book of Merlyn/]]

While the first four were originally published separately, and reworked for inclusion in ''The Once and Future King'', the last was to be published in the greater work for the first time. This was vetoed by White's publisher, supposedly due to wartime paper restrictions.  It wasn't until after White's death that The Book of Merlyn joined the other four.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[The Once and Future King]] - Book I: [[The Sword in the Stone]] - '''Chapter 17'''

==Plot summary==
The chapter begins a few months after the boar-hunt. [[The Once and Future King/King Pellinore|King Pellinore]] gives the [[The Once and Future King/Questing Beast|Questing Beast]], now healthy, a two-hour headstart in the chase. [[Merlyn (OaFK)|Merlyn]], [[The Once and Future King/Archimedes|Archimedes]], and the [[Arthur (OaFK)|Wart]] discuss the birds, a subject that has arisen due to spring's arrival. The Wart asks to become a bird again, because the last time he didn't get a chance to fly; Archimedes plans to go with him at night. The Wart then mentions his favorite bird is the rook, because rooks fly just for pleasure, not necessarily with a purpose. Archimedes mentions rooks are one of few birds with a legal and social system, and in response to Merlyn says his favorite are pigeons. Then Merlyn says he prefers the chaffinch, and continues that bird calls arise out of imitation of their prey or their environment. Finally [[The Once and Future King/Kay|Kay]] enters, ironically saying that he was shooting birds.

==Analysis==
'''Anachronisms''' - Merlyn mentions both [[en:Gilbert White|Gilbert White]] and [[en:Carolus Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]], and Archimedes compares pigeons to [[en:Quakers|Quakers]]. All came much later.
'''Animals as forms of government''' - Archimedes mentions that the rooks have &quot;parliaments...and a social system;&quot; (a play upon the [[en:Collective noun|collective noun]] for rooks being a &quot;parliament&quot;) they make &quot;laws about the defense of the rookery, and marriage, and so forth&quot;

Under the Kingdom of Great Britain, the American colonies experienced five situations which would guide them in creating a constitution. The British Parliament believed that it had the right to impose taxes on the colonists; it had ''virtual'' representation over the entire empire, while the colonists believed Parliament had no such right, as they had no ''direct'' representation in Parliament. By the 1720s all but two of the colonies had a locally elected legislature and a British appointed governor. Often, these two branches of government would clash, with the legislatures imposing their &quot;power of the purse&quot; to control the British governor. Thus, Americans viewed their legislative branch as a guardian of their liberty, while the executive branches was deemed tyrannical.

There were several examples of royal actions that upset the Americans. For example, taxes on the importation of lead, paint, tea, paper, spirits, rum, wine, molasses, sugar, and other products were imposed at various times. Also, the Parliament provided for a duty to be paid on court documents, certificates, licenses, deeds, other legal documents, playing cards, pamphlets, books, calendars, newspapers, and other papers, as well as dice. The variety of taxes imposed, as well as other causes, led to the Americans' disdain for the British system of government.

After the Boston Tea Party, the Parliament of Great Britain and the King passed Acts that outlawed the Massachusetts legislature. The Parliament also provided for special courts in which British judges, rather than American juries, would try colonists. The Quartering Act and the Intolerable Acts required Americans to provide room and board for British soldiers. Americans especially feared British actions in Canada, where civil law was once suspended in favor of British military rule. 

American distaste for the system of British government would lead to revolution.  Americans had formed their own local institutions which were not British at all, but American.  The political ideas of the Americans actually had their root in the British radicals of the early 18th century.  England had passed beyond those ideas by 1776 and the resulting conflict resulted in the first American attempts at a national government.

==The Articles of Confederation==
The Articles of Confederation accomplished certain things, but without a strict leader, they were bad. First, they expressly provided that the states were sovereign. (A ''sovereign state'' is a state that is both self-governing and independent.) The United States as a Confederation was much like the present-day European Union. Each member was able to make its own laws; the entire Union was merely for the purposes of common defense.

The reason for the independence of the colonies is clear- the colonies were afraid of the power of a central government such as the one in the State of Great Britain. 

The Articles provided that a Congress, consisting of two to seven members per state, would hold legislative power. The states, regardless of the number of Congress members representing them, each have one total vote. 

The Congress was empowered to settle boundary and other disputes between states. It could also establish courts with jurisdiction over the seas. Also, it could tax the states, even though it did not possess the power to require the collection these taxes by law.

==Faults of the Articles==

The Congress, overall, was absolutely ineffectual. The Congress had to rely on the states for its funding. Since it could not forcibly collect taxes, the states could grant or withhold money and force Congress to accept their demands. 

Because it could not collect taxes, Congress printed paper dollars. This policy, however, absolutely wrecked the economy because of an overabundance of paper dollars, which had lost almost all value. 

The several states also printed their own currency. This led to much confusion relating to exchange rates and trade; some states accepted the currency of others, while other states refused to honor bills issued by their counterparts.

Furthermore, the Articles included certain fallacies. For instance, it suggested that the approval of &quot;nine states&quot; was required to make certain laws. However, it made no provision for additional states. Thus, it would appear that the number nine would be in effect even if that number would actually be a minority of states. 

Also, the Articles required the approval of all states for certain important decisions such as making Amendments. As the number of 'States&quot; would grow, securing this approval would become more and more difficult.

==The Conference at Annapolis==

At Annapolis, Maryland, the delegates of the thirteen states were supposed to meet to discuss various changes to the Articles to grant more authority to Congress. However, eight of the states failed to send representatives. Thus, the Conference did not even occur. However, another Conference was called for 1787. This Conference at Philadelphia is what we now know to be the Constitutional Convention.

==Philadelphia==

After the Annapolis Conference, the Congress called a more important conference at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. States, except for Rhode Island, appointed delegates. Some delegates did not attend due to the perceived inconvenience. Others stayed home because they held important political offices in their state. Furthermore, some refused to attend because they disagreed with the very concept of a more powerful central and less powerful state governments.

==The Legislature==

The United States were basically divided into two classes- the large (more populous) states and the small (less populous) states. The large states included Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Massachusetts. The small states included New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maryland, and even New York. Also, one may consider Georgia and the two Carolinas as small states, but these states hoped to increase their population and become large by importing slaves and attracting &quot;immigrants&quot; from other states.

The large states wanted to have '''proportional representation''' in Congress. They wished that the more populous states have more representatives than the less populous states. However, fearing that they would be overwhelmed by large numbers of representatives from other states, the small state delegates suggested that all states receive '''equal representation''' like under the Articles.

James Madison of Virginia proposed a plan, which was presented by Edmund Randolph, supported by the large states, the Virginia Plan. It entailed:
* A very powerful Congress of two houses based on proportional representation
* One house elected by the people, and the second house elected by the first one
* An executive chosen by Congress
* Congressional power to cancel any state law
* Based on population


Meanwhile, New Jersey politician William Paterson proposed a plan on behalf of the small states. It involved:
* A Congress equivalent in structure to the Articles Congress
* A Congress more powerful than the Articles Congress, but not as powerful as the Virginia Plan Congress
* An executive chosen by Congress
* Congressional law being supreme over state law

Thirdly, Alexander Hamilton of New York proposed a plan extremely similar to the British government. The British plan included:
* A legislature of two houses
* One house chosen by the people for limited terms
* Another house chosen by a special body for life terms
* An executive chosen by a special body for a life term
* Congressional power to cancel any state law.
* Based on population
Hamilton's plan was rejected very quickly- it reminded the delegates too much of the tyranny and unhappiness under the King of the State of Great Britain.

Connecticut Delegate Roger Sherman suggested that the small and large states compromise. He felt that the large states would never accept equal representation, while the small ones would never accept just proportional representation. His compromise, known as the Great Compromise, suggested the following:
* A Congress with two houses
* One house based on proportional representation
* Another house based on equal representation

Though Sherman's compromise was initially rejected, the delegates were forced to accept it eventually. Otherwise, the Convention would have clearly broken down on the issue of representation.

==The Executive==

Once the issue of representation was resolved, other issues seemed relatively easy to negotiate. The delegates continued to compromise on several issues, including the executive.

Firstly, the delegates were concerned about a single individual as executive. The King, they said, was an individual with too much power. However, the argument failed when some pointed out that every single state in the union had one Chief Executive called a President or a Governor, rather than a Council of Presidents or Governors, and none of the states suffered from that Governor's tyranny. Similarly, the executive was granted substantial but not absolute power, after the example of the individual states. 

(Pennsylvania at one time in its history had a council of three Presidents.)

The manner of choosing the executive was the only one of concern. The following were proposed as electors for the President:
* The People
* The state Legislatures
* The state Governors
* The Congress

The Framers rejected the idea of election by the People because they felt that, it would be impractical in the days of difficult communication, and inappropriate because the people would &quot;naturally&quot; vote for local candidates without any regard for those from other states. Also, they rejected the state or Congressional choice because they assumed that the President would feel indebted to and controlled by the states or the Congress. Such a problem would be present with any permanent body. Thus, they established a temporary body whose sole purpose was to elect the President- the Electoral College. (See Part III, Chapter 2.)

==Slavery==

The problem of slavery, after the issue of representation, was probably the most dangerous one for the Convention to tackle. If the Convention adopted a plan that upset one region, then the states of that region might have withdrawn from the Convention, breaking up the meeting. 

Related to the issue of representation was the counting of slaves to decide the population of a state for the purpose of proportional representation in Congress. The South wanted slaves to count, but the North feared that the South could increase its power in Congress by importing more slaves. The Three-Fifths Compromise suggested the same standard as the Article of Confederation-&quot;other persons,&quot; or slaves would be counted as three-fifths of persons. The three-fifths rule would be applied for deciding proportions in Congress '''and''' amounts of direct tax due from each state.

Another compromise relating to slavery involved the importation of slaves. The Constitutional Convention compromised by allowing the slave trade to continue until 1808, when the Congress could lawfully ban it.

==Conclusion==

The tired delegates were faced with a problem - that of a Bill of Rights. The delegates, however, refused to take the risk of breaking up the Convention and wasting hard work by debating specific rights. Thus, they assumed that a newly assembled Congress would add these Amendments, or they felt that the present Constitutional protections were sufficient. 

In order for the Constitution to gain effect, the Convention required that nine states approve it. In addition, the states not ratifying, or approving, the Constitution would not be subject to it.

==Introduction==

The Constitution required ratification by nine states in order to come into effect. The fight for ratification was long and difficult.  An important factor in ratifying the constitution was the fact the delegates to the Constitutional Convention required that ratification be done by special ratifying conventions, not by state legislature.  Being interested in retaining state powers, the states would understandably have been resistant to ratifying a new, stronger central government.

==Federalists versus Anti- Federalists==

Those who favored ratification were known as '''Federalists''',while those who opposed it were considered '''Anti- Federalists'''. 

The Federalists attacked the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation. They acknowledged that the Constitution was not perfect, but they said that it was much better than any other proposal then made.

Three Federalists- Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay- wrote a series of essays called ''The Federalist Papers''. The essays explained the constitution and defended its provisions. The documents were intended for the state of New York, though people from across the country read them.

The Federalists defended the weakest point of the Constitution- a lack of a Bill of Rights- by suggesting that current protections were sufficient and that the Congress could always propose Amendments.

Anti- Federalists such as Patrick Henry attacked the Constitution, suggesting that it would lead to a dangerously powerful national government. The Anti- Federalist arguments relating to the Bill of Rights were especially powerful. However, many were convinced by the assurances provided by the Federalists.

==State Conventions==

Each state was to hold a convention to debate the Constitution and ratify or reject it. The Constitution was proposed in September, 1787. By the end of the year, some states that were in favor of the document ratified. Delaware's convention approved it by a vote of 30- 0; Pennsylvania's by a vote of 46- 23; New Jersey's by a vote of 38- 0. The next year, Georgia ratified by a vote of 26- 0 and Connecticut followed with a vote of 128- 40.

The Federalists were already more than halfway to the nine-state margin. However, the states that did not ratify the Constitution in that year included the extremely important states of Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia. Massachusetts ratified the document by a close margin (187- 168) in February, 1788. Maryland followed with a 63- 11 vote, and South Carolina did the same with a 149- 73 vote. Then, New Hampshire provided the all-important ninth ratification by a 57- 47 vote.

The United States was established under the new Constitution, but the important commercial state of New York and the populous state of Virginia, among others, still did not ratify. After tough battles, these states also ratified, Virginia by a 89- 79 margin and New York with 30- 27.

The Bill of Rights was then created under the new Constitution, leading to North Carolina's ratification by a vote of 194- 77. Seeing itself alone, Rhode Island finally agreed to ratify with a 34- 32 vote.

All thirteen colonies had ratified the Constitution by May, 1790.

== Introduction ==
{{Reading level|Intermediate}}
{{RenderPNG}}
This online textbook is intended for, but not limited to, 14 to 18 year old teenagers who have a general interest in mathematics. The text's language is aimed at high school students without a rigorous understanding and knowledge of university-level mathematics.

This book introduces several interesting topics not covered in the standard high school curriculum of most countries.

The materials presented can be challenging, but at the same time, we strive to make this book readable to all with 9–10 years of formal education.

''' From the authors '''

It is our firm belief that math textbooks should not just be a collection of mathematical facts carefully laid out for rote memorization and cram sessions.  A math textbook, especially for the youth, should be full of questions, not just exercises.  These questions require some thought to answer and spark curiosity.  After all, the questions keep the students engaged, not the answers.

:''&quot;In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.&quot;''
:- [[w:Georg_Cantor|Georg Cantor]]

We sincerely hope to interest, stimulate, and challenge all those who read this book.

'''Slovio''' is a newly-constructed language created by linguist Mark Hučko.  It is an international auxiliary language primarily created to help Slavic speakers communicate.  The grammar of Slovio is similar to Esperanto, but the vocabulary is derived from the most common words from Slavic languages, that of the largest European-language group. 

It also includes many internationally-understandable words from Latin, English, French, German, and Spanish. As soon as one learns Slovio one can communicate with over 400 million people in such countries as: [[w:Poland|Poland]], [[w:Russia|Russia]], [[w:Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[w:Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[w:Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[w:Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[w:Croatia|Croatia]], [[w:Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[w:Bosnia|Bosnia]], [[w:Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[w:Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[w:Belarus|Belarus]], [[w:Lithuania|Lithuania]], [[w:Latvia|Latvia]],  [[w:Moldavia|Moldavia]], [[w:Serbia|Serbia]], [[w:Montenegro|Montenegro]] and so on. 

The name of the language, '''Slovio''', comes from the old-Slavic word '''&quot;slovo&quot;''' which means '''&quot;word&quot;'''.

I feel a bit ambivalent about this page; most of the content is in other sections which is not really a bad thing in itself because of the way this is presented as a extension topic thing, but I think this should be different; perhaps as a [[Mathematics extension topics]], for students at all levels, not just high school?

What do we think? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:20, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)

The work on the included pages looks great to me. Lets not bother the author with strictures. If the work can be used later in other spots then so be it but redundancy is not a problem. Let him be free to write as he desires, especially now in such early stages. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]


Well, Dysprosia, I think each book has its intended audience. The online book on High school extensions are aimed at 14-18 year olds. The language we'll use to write the book are more accessible to high schools student with no university-type rigour. For this reason we need new material written just for the high school students, with the appropriate theme, tone, register and whatever else. I totally disagree with what you did to the project! I will be converting it back to what it was like. A new book aimed at 14 -- 18 year olds. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

Ok, sorrysorrysorry''sorrysorry''... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 06:53, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Ok, you are forgiven. We are trying our best to contribute. That's good to see.[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

To Whoever wrote the Crytography basic thing: I'm not familiar with the cryptography side of things, so if you wrote a section on it and it will be great.

Would the proof for the infinitude of primes fit in the chapter on Primes or in the chapter on Mathematical proofs? [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 01:45, 29 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Give it in the primes page.
----

== Content removed? ==

Why was so much content removed from the front page? I don't mind reading that the first two chapters are easier than the rest, nor that Australian high schools may not offer enough material. What happened?

:The reason why I removed them is because I didn't want people to think I'm bossy and that to edit this book they need to follow all those rules. I want this to be more rules-free, so anyone can contribute without having to worry too much about what they write or how they go about writing it.

== Premise ==

Hmm...not sure I understand the intended premise of this book.  Is it simply a collection of math topics not covered by the Australian school system?  Or is there a more continuous thread running through it? --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 19:48, 14 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:This online-book is intended to be a &quot;teach yourself&quot; kind of book. High school students are its intended audience. This textbook covers topics not taught in Australian high schools, and it's not meant to be taught, it's meant to be read. &lt;br&gt;To answer your question regarding ''thread'', this book may seem disconnected, but it does have a few interesting things that are threaded e.g. Fibonacci numbers in Matrices, Infinite Processes and Mathematical programming; ''Logic'' and ''Mathematical Proofs'' come hand in hand; also Probabilities &amp; counting is connected with Infinite processes. Modular arithmetic together with Matrices will make an interesting section on cryptography. As you can see, the chapters, although independent on their own, are connected, or if you liked threaded. Is that what you meant by a ''thread''? -- [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] GMT+10:00 11:53 (15 Dec 03)

::Yeah, that explains it.  Thanks!  Sounds like something I'd love to work on.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 02:04, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Navigation ==

Can we decide on something along the lines of [[High school extensions|Contents]] on the top of each chapter? Meanwhile though, just type HSE into the top bar and press Go - it's a redirect. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 21:57, 1 Jan 2004 (UTC)

== &quot;Further modular arithmetic&quot;? ==

What's this, and why is it on the Topics list (haven't noticed it before) without being in the Plan section? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 19:57, 4 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:The modular arithmetic section didn't go far enough into this beautiful subject. So i thought an extension would be nice, just haven't written up a plan. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 07:59, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==Puzzle==

Anybody tell the area of the rectangle inside this other rectangle of area 1?

In short, the answer is... variable. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 09:29, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)


ah hell i met that question in a math comp i put between 3/8 and 7/16, is it right???

-protecter

: I'm going to agree with Lemontea. It's not at all obvious what the height/width aspect ratio of the outer rectangle is. If the aspect ratio is very small (short and wide), the area of the inner rectangle could be nearly 1/2 the outer rectangle. If the aspect ratio is exactly 2:1 (tall and narrow), the inner rectangle is exactly square with area 1/4 the outer rectangle.
: So ... I suppose we could specify the height and width of the outer rectangle, and then solve for the area for that one aspect ratio. Or we could change the question and ask for a formula for the area as a function of the height/width aspect ratio. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 08:35, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

== Problems with coming up with problems ==
I've enormous trouble coming up with (hard) problems for this book. Can you guys please contribute some problems? Please. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 06:03, 14 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== curved geometry ==

sorry for asking but i really want to learn basic curved geometry, is it possible that you people can add it? or do you know any place that gives a introduction?

:Sorry for not being able to answer this q for so long. I think most high school will teach that sooner or later, so i have no plan to do a chapter on it. But if later one of the chapters requires Cartesian geometry then i will add a supplementary section. So no plan to write such a section yet. 
:If you want to learn more the topic then search google for &quot;coordinate geometry&quot;, &quot;cartesian plane&quot;, &quot;graphing functions&quot; should turn up some useful pages. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 8 July 2005 11:21 (UTC)


don't you think that modulo chapter is still difficult for beginners
-- registered in wikipedia as &quot;kushal_one&quot;

Yeah. Everything can be improved. Maybe i will review the material once i have time. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 12:59, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

== Proposals for new topics? ==

After an overview of this wikibook (a very clever idea by the way), I observed that it mainly focuses on many algebraic topics. What about some extension topics more ''geometry-oriented'', interesting topics. Examples:
-Vectors (possibly with basic elements of Vector Analysis)
-Elementary Topological Concepts
. I am aware that this is a ''High School'' extension wikibook on maths but I believe that if a student is interested in maths, he or she will have a better and mainly broader understanding of what mathematics exists beyond high school books by exploring such topics.
Could anyone provide any similar proposals?

:Sounds like a good idea, although it will take lots of work. Go for it if you have the time. I am too busy doing my uni studies to do anything with book until perhaps next year.[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 02:49, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

== Primes and Goldbach's Conjecture ==

As with Riemann's hypothesis, a lot of theory has been built presuming Goldbach's is correct.  Some may be worth mentioning somewhere.  For example, Schinzel proof that Goldbach's conjecture implies that every odd integer
larger than 17 is the sum of three distinct primes.--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] 04:07, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

== Context? ==

There's a lot of information here, but personally I found it all too disjointed. It reads less like a book and more like scrap notes and collected stray thoughts. There's also a lot of information that is entirely unexplained. For instance, a large &quot;X&quot; with a bar over it. How is a student to understand what that is all about without any explanation? Step back and try to imagine it from a ''student's'' viewpoint.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already considered moduli and modular arithmetic back in [[../Number theory/]], however in this section we will take a more in depth view of modular arithmetic.

For revision, you should review the material in [[../Number theory|number theory]] if you choose.

== Simultaneous equations ==
When we speak of simultaneous equations with relation to modular arithmetic, we are talking about simultaneous solutions to sets of equations in the form
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (mod m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
: :
: :
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; (mod m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;)

There are two principal methods we will consider, ''successive substitution'' and the ''Chinese remainder theorem''.

=== Successive substitution ===
The method of successive substitution is that where we use the definition of the modulus to rewrite these simultaneous equations, and then successively make substitutions.

It will probably be best to motivate the idea with an example.

'''Example:''' Solve 3''x'' &amp;equiv; 10 (mod 19), and ''x'' &amp;equiv; 19 (mod 21) using successive substitution.

First:

:3''x'' &amp;equiv; 10 (mod 19)
Find the inverse of 3 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;; 3&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=-6, then
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; -60 (mod 19)
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; 16 (mod 19)
: ''x'' = 16 + 19''j'' &amp;exist; ''j''&amp;isin;'''Z''' (*)

Substitute in the second equation
: (16+19''j'') &amp;equiv; 19 (mod 21)
: 19''j'' &amp;equiv; 3 (mod 21)

Find the inverse of 19 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;; 19&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=10


: ''j'' = 30 (mod 21)

: ''j'' = 9 (mod 21)

Writing in the equivalent form
: ''j'' = 9 + 21''k'' &amp;exist; ''k''&amp;isin;'''Z'''

Substituting back j in (*)
: ''x'' = 16 + 19(9+21''k'')
: ''x'' = 187+399''k''

Writing back in the first form
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; 187 (mod 399)

which is our solution.

=== Chinese remainder theorem ===
The ''Chinese remainder theorem'' is a method for solving simultaneous linear congruences '''when the moduli are coprime'''. 

Given the equations 
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (mod m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
: :
: :
: ''x'' &amp;equiv; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; (mod m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;)

multiply the moduli together, i.e. N=m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,
then write n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=N/m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=N/m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;.

We then set y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the inverse of n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; mod m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for all i, so y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=1 mod m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

Our solution will be
:x &amp;equiv; a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+...+a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;  (mod N)

To see why this works consider what values x mod m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; takes. The term a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; mod m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; becomes equal to a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; as y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;=1 mod m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, and all the terms a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; mod m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; become equal to zero as when &lt;math&gt;j \neq k&lt;/math&gt; m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is a factor of n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.


&lt;!-- This needs an example...I'll work out the above example on paper using CRT and post it up later --&gt;
The Chinese Remainder Theorem is of immense practical use, as if we wish to solve an equation mod M for some large M, we can instead solve it mod p for every prime factor of M and use CRT to obtain a solution mod M.

== Powers and roots ==
This section deals with looking powers of numbers modulo some modulus. We look at efficient ways of calculating
: ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; (mod ''m'')

If we tried to calculate this normally - by calculating ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; and then taking the modulus - it would take an ''exorbitant'' amount of time.  However some of the theory behind modular arithmetic allows us a few shortcuts.

We will look at some of these and the theory involved with them.

=== Fermat's (little) Theorem ===
Fermat's theorem allows us to see where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; (mod ''m'') is 1. This has an application in disproving primality.

It states
:If p is prime, and gcd(a,p)=1, then, in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
:''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''-1&lt;/sup&gt;=1.

So, for example, 13&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Primitive elements ===
If in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, can we write some elements as powers of an element? This is conceivably possible. 

Let's look at '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. 
:2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=1
:2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;=2
:2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1

The elements {1,2} constitute in fact :'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

Generally, we have
:If ''p'' prime, then there is an element ''g''&amp;isin;'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; such that every element of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a power of g.

=== Orders ===
We can express this idea in a different way, using the concept of the ''order''. 
We denote the order of ''a'' &amp;isin; '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; by the smallest integer ''k'' written O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(a) such that
: ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, O&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(-1)=2 for all n except 2, since
:(-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1

except when n = 2, since in that field -1 = 1 and thus has order 1.

'''Note''' if gcd(''a'',''n'')&amp;ne;1, that is, ''a'' &amp;notin; '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the order ''is not defined''. 
&lt;!-- put some more examples in --&gt;

==== Properties of orders ====
The orders obey some properties, the first of which was originally proven by Lagrange:

If p prime, gcd(a,p)=1,
* O&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(a) divides p-1
* a is primitive iff O&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;(a)=p-1

=== Orders and finding primitive elements ===
Given these facts above, we can find primitive elements in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; for ''p'' &gt; 2 fairly easily. 

Using the above facts, we only need to check ''a''&lt;sup&gt;(''p''-1)/''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;=''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''i'', where the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are the prime factors of ''p''-1. If any of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are 1, ''a'' is not a primitive element, if none are, it is.

'''Example:''' Find a primitive element of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.

Try 2. ''p''-1 = 10 = 2 . 5
Check:
: 2&lt;sup&gt;10/2&lt;/sup&gt;=2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=10
: 2&lt;sup&gt;10/5&lt;/sup&gt;=2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=4

Neither is 1, so we can say that 2 is a primitive element in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Problem set ====
Given the above, answer the following. (Answers follow to even-numbered questions)
# Is 4 primitive in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;?
# Is 5 primitive in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;?
# Find a primitive element of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Find a primitive element of '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;.
=====Answers=====
:2. Yes: In '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, (23-1)=2*11, and 5&lt;sup&gt;22/11&lt;/sup&gt;=2, 5&lt;sup&gt;22/2&lt;/sup&gt;=22 and then 5&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;=1. No lesser base gives this.
:4. 2. Check: (19-1) has distinct prime factors 2 and 3. In '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;, 2&lt;sup&gt;18/2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;ne;1 and 2&lt;sup&gt;18/3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;ne;1 but 2&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;=1 so 2 is primitive.

=== Euler's totient function ===
Euler's totient function is a special function that allows us to generalize Fermat's little theorem above. 

It is defined as
: &amp;phi;(n) = |'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;|
::=|{a&amp;isin;'''Z'''|1 &amp;le; ''a'' &amp;le; ''n'' and gcd(a,n) = 1}|
::''that is the number of elements that have inverses in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''

==== Some results ====
We have the following results leading on from previous definitions.
# &amp;phi;(''p'') = ''p'' - 1
# &amp;phi;(''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-''p''&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt;
# &amp;phi;(''mn'')=&amp;phi;(''m'')&amp;phi;(''n'') for gcd(''m'',''n'')=1
# For any integer n, the sum of the totient values of each of its divisors equals n.
In other symbols:
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\ divisor\ of\ n} \phi(d) = n&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof of 2.'': There are ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; elements in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. The non-invertible elements in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are the multiples of ''p'' and there are ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt; of them: ''p'', 2''p'', 3''p'', ..., (''p''&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt;-1)''p'', ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;. Removing the non-invertible elements from the invertible ones leaves ''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-''p''&lt;sup&gt;k-1&lt;/sup&gt; left. ∎


''Corollary to 1, 2 and 3'': 
If ''n'' has distinct prime factors (i.e. not counting powers) ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for i=1,...,r we have
:&lt;math&gt;\phi(n)=n\prod_{i=1}^r (1-\frac{1}{p_i})&lt;/math&gt;
For example:
:16=2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, so &amp;phi;(16)=(16)(1-1/2)=16/2=8
:&amp;phi;(11)=(11)(1-1/11)=(11)(10/11)=10 
::''(confirm from before 11 prime so &amp;phi;(11)=11-1=10)''.

''Proof of 3.'': We can prove this equality using a special case of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, where the CRT is now just a system of 2 congruences, namely:
:x == a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (mod m)
:x == a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (mod n)

(remember that the CRT is applicable here because m and n are assumed coprime in the equality).

Note that a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can take on m values (from 0 to m-1), and a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can take on n values (from 0 to n-1). Also note that, for each and everyone of the m*n (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) tuples, there is a unique solution x that is strictly smaller than m*n. Moreover, for each x strictly smaller than m*n, there is a unique tuple (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) verifying the congruence system (these two assertions are a component of the Chinese Remainder Theorem: a solution to the congruence system is unique modulo m*n).

With this bijective uniqueness property in mind, the proof is simple. Go through each x, from 0 to m*n-1, and show that if x is a totient of m*n (i.e., gcd (x,m*n) = 1), then a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a totient of m and a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a totient of n. Furthermore, you must also show that if a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are totients of m and n respectively, then it follows that x must be a totient of m*n.

If gcd (x,m*n) = 1, then according to Bezout's identity, there exist X and Y integers such that x*X + m*n*Y = 1. Furthermore, we have:

:x = a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + k*m
:x = a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + q*n

Therefore, a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*X + m*(k + n*Y) = 1, &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; should this be a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;*X + m*(k*X + n*Y) = 1 ?? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
so gcd (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,m) = 1, and therefore a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a totient of m. Proceed similarly to prove that a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a totient of n.

Proving the other direction is very similar in that it requires some simple replacement algebra.

So what have we shown? In the above we have shown that for every totient x of m*n, there is a unique tuple of totients of m on the one hand and n on the other hand. Furthermore, that for each tuple of totients of m on the one hand and n on the other hand, there is a unique totient of m*n. Therefore, phi(m*n) = phi(m)*phi(n).

''Proof of 4.'': Let Q(g) be the set of all integers between 1 and n inclusive, such that
gcd(x,n) = g. Q(g) is nonempty if and only if g divides n. If g doesn't divide n, then good luck
finding an x such that g is the greatest common DIVISOR of x and n. Secondly, if x belongs to
Q(g) for a given g, then it can't belong to another Q(...), since, if n is fixed, then
gcd(x,n) is unique, by definition of the GREATEST common divisor. Thirdly, for all x between
1 and n inclusive, there exists a g such that gcd (x,n) = g (in the &quot;worst&quot; case, it's 1).
Put together, these three properties imply that the union of all the Q(g) sets (for each g a
divisor of n), which are pairwise mutually exclusive, is the set {1,2,3,...,n}. And therefore, the sum of the cardinalities of each Q(g) equals n.

Now we show that |Q(g)| = &amp;phi;(n/g).

One direction: Let x be an arbitrary member of Q(g) for some g. Therefore, we have that
gcd (x,n) = g =&gt; gcd (x/g, n/g) = 1 =&gt; x/g belongs to the set of numbers coprime to n/g (whose cardinality of course is &amp;phi;(n/g)). For diff\
erent x's, the two values x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/g and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/g are distinct. So for each x in Q(g), there is a correspondingly unique x/g in
the set of numbers coprime to n/g.

Other direction: Let x be an arbitrary member of the set of numbers coprime to n/g. This implies
gcd (x,n/g) = 1 =&gt; gcd (xg,n) = g =&gt; xg belongs to Q(g). For different x's, the two values
x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;g and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;g are distinct. So for each x in the set of numbers coprime to
n/g, there is a correspondingly unique xg in Q(g).

Therefore, |Q(g)| = &amp;phi;(n/g).

=== Euler's theorem ===
We can now generalize Fermat's theorem to extend past just '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

Euler's theorem says: 
: If a &amp;isin; '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
:: a&lt;sup&gt;&amp;phi;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;=1
: equivalently if gcd(''a'',''n'')=1, 
:: a&lt;sup&gt;&amp;phi;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;equiv;1 (mod ''n'')

'''Example:''' Find 3&lt;sup&gt;216&lt;/sup&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;.
We need to calculate firstly &amp;phi;(14)=&amp;phi;(7)&amp;phi;(2)=(7-1)(2-1)=6.
Then write the exponent as: 216 = 6 &amp;times; 36
So: 3&lt;sup&gt;216&lt;/sup&gt;=(3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;

But Euler's theorem tells us 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., mod 14) since 3&lt;sup&gt;&amp;phi;(14)&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; as above.
So we have: 3&lt;sup&gt;216&lt;/sup&gt;=1&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;=1.

=== Calculating large powers efficiently ===
When Euler's or Fermat's theorem fails us in the calculation of a high power, there is a way to decompose an exponent down so calculation is still easy.

Let us work through an example as motivation.

'''Example.''' 5&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

First write 28 in base 2 = (11100)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16 + 8 + 4

Now 5&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; = 5&lt;sup&gt;16+8+4&lt;/sup&gt; = 5&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; 5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 
Now rewrite these powers of 2 as repeated exponents:
: (((5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; ((5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; (5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

When you calculate each exponent, reduce mod 4 each time.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above, calculate the following powers. (Answers follow to even-numbered questions)
# 3&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 13)
# 2&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 43)
# 6&lt;sup&gt;168&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 30)
# 2&lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 19)
# 2&lt;sup&gt;61&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 22)
# 8&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 5)
# 11&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; (mod 11) (''Tricky!'')
=====Answers=====
:2. Since gcd(2,43)=1 and the exponent is one less than the modulus, use Fermat's theorem - the answer is 1
:4. Observe that &amp;phi;(19)=18 and 18|252. 252/18=14. Decompose the exponent then as 2&lt;sup&gt;18&amp;times;14&lt;/sup&gt;=(2&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;=1.
:6. Use fast exponentiation by squaring: the answer is 3

      <text xml:space="preserve">Marshman, what do you think if we classify this page into a textbook instead of a study guide for the sake of listing it on the front page ? Even though it is a study guide format in terms of brevity, it isn't a study guide in the sense of notes relating to another book. How can we classify these different things ? Your comments plz. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:I certainly have no problem either way.  I see the Study Guide as a way to eventually get to a textbook, and it is a Guide only in the sense that it is meant to guide one through Wikipedia; could, of course supplement any other text books, but is not a guide specific to any other text.  It could be a &quot;Botany text in formation&quot;. I would keep the title the same for now, just because the sense of a guide to Wikipedia articles is presently the central concept. But could move it to Science Books and I woill rethink the title - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 00:11, 30 Sep 2003 (UTC)

== Need to correct chapter link text ==

The chapter links on each page show two chapter 12's.
:You are right, but I can no longer recall how to get to that page. Will take some reasearch to fix. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 19:08, 23 Sep 2004 (UTC)

== Very nice book ==

I like your book very much! The chapters starting from 7 need to be adjusted (chapter numbers on the pages don`t fit the number of the contents). I fixed some chapter renumbering in chapters 4 and 5. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 22:15, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:Thanks.  I did add in some chapters, and that required chapter number changes.  I guess I did not catch them all. Really appreciate your attention to such details - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:34, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== good sources ==

Where can we find good public domain sources for references?
I am not even a graduate student, so I do not have too much credability in things I say just out of my head, I usually type the term I'm looking for information on with the term &quot;.gov&quot; into google to see if nasa or the FWS have anything to say about it. 

http://www.biocrawler.com/ is a biology wiki, but they aren't especially in the habit of having public domain sources.

Of course, wikipedia is a fantastic source. - [[User:Lotusduck|Lotusduck]] 02:01, 4 November 2005 (UTC)lotusduck
:I'm not sure what your question is.  Are you looking for sources (references) to back up things that you &quot;know&quot; and want to write about at Wikibooks? Although sources are always a great addition to facts you provide, they are not absolutely necessary.  The quality of your writing is the real test.  If you introduce &quot;facts&quot; that others then question, be prepared to provide outside sources for the information, but those sources can typically be as simple a textbook. You still may lose an &quot;argument&quot;, but most of what you contribute is not going to be questioned heavily (but may be edited) unless you are a complete flake 8^) - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:16, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

==Botany Introduction Botany merger==
This isn't worth merging, just junk it, it doesn't contain any really useful info, and is hopelessly local-POV biased - [[User:82.39.130.135|82.39.130.135]] 23:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

== secret wishes ==

I have always dreamed that when this book is &quot;finished&quot; a version of it will be frozen (while leaving this version still wiki format) and certified, backed by some university like ordinary textbooks are. Then schools could print this book royalty free instead of going the extra costs of publishers. That frozen version would be the &quot;first edition&quot; and whenever a professor decided that enough new, good changes had occured on this botany wikibook, a new version would be frozen and offered for printing that would be the second printing, similar to new editions of textbooks. 
In many ways the wiki format is a great learning tool. In other ways it is not. If students were all asked to copy a lab from this wikibook on a large scale, it would have to be 100% reliable 100% of the time. But then that reliability and un-chang-ability would also have negative consequences. I think that some day soon we can have it both ways. We can have the learning benefits of a hard copy and of a wiki for botany. 
Thank you. [[User:128.101.70.97|128.101.70.97]] 15:57, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

::Why not do it now?
You just need to make a downloadable pdf version with a date and update it as changes occur.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hail, Lord Emsworth! Welcome to Wikibooks! I noticed your page [[Glossary]] for either American history or civics - can you rename it to a more book-scoped title, such as [[American history:glossary]] or [[Glossary of American History terms]]? Many other books will probably have glossaries, too, and they would conflict if they were all called [[Glossary]]. [[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 23:23, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Lord Emsworth, keep up the good work and I hope you find as much fun and satisfaction here as I do. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Wow! I'm gone for just a few days and suddenly the US History text is full of writing. :) Well, glad to have you on board. I hope to do some stuff in bits and pieces as I get free time(I'm a student so that's essentially never) I guess now I'll have to contribute something now. :) Anyways, nice work. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 05:42, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC)

==US Constitution and Government ==
I wanted to read the whole [[US Constitution and Government|book]] before commenting but that may take a while and I've read a good part. Its exciting for a person to get up so much content so quickly, and have it be relatively good too. Could you add a bit more content to [[The United States under Great Britain]] ? The lead paragraph gives a lot of leads that could use followup. Eventually I would like to get some pictures up there .. there has to be some public domain imagery that we could include of Philadelphia, the Continental Congress, etc. But if you can flesh out a bit of content there I think we can declare the book essentially &quot;done.&quot; 

As for further work, I see you are active on the [[US History]] page as well as [[French]]. If you subscribe to the wikibooks email list then I suggest you ask the group what you could work on in terms of new material. It would help to know what your other areas of expertise are. I prefer personally to work on what is fun for me. 

Oh yeah, I thought you should have a user page, so I wrote anything that sounded like it meant something even if it really didnt mean anything. I am guessing that you use Internet Explorer, which is technically property of Micro$oft and just lent to you for use. Its what I use until I get my Linux box back from my friends house, and figure out why it isnt connecting to the 'Net. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Dude, can I pay you ? You deserve to be payed. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==US History standards==
Lord E, what would you think about using a set of official high school standards from CA for a reference for this book ? We are in touch with a schools rep out there and he is eager to get these books in use in the schools there. He is convinced that we can have the books inthe hands of &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; of students if we adhere to the CA standards. I have not compared them to the AP standards that you are using but I will give you the link. What do you think ?

Here is the link for 12th grade US History.

http://www.cde.ca.gov/cdepress/Hist_SocSci_Stnd.pdf

Here is also a more general standards-related document. My contact person says that the particularly applicable pages are 28 and 155 as they talk about history.

http://www.cde.ca.gov/cdepress/hist-social-sci-frame.pdf

--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:I don't know what the CA content standards say, but I know the AP is made to be as &quot;generic&quot; as possible, because the 'US History 101' classes aren't the same at all universities, so they need to be applicable to all of their syllabuses(syllabi?) Plus they have AP US History classes in CA so I assume the AP syllabus is more 'inclusive' of topics than the CA standards. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 02:00, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:We have an associate who is working diligently to get one of our textbooks accepted for use in the CA schools. If we follow the CA standards he can help us get our foot in the door in a public way. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Lord Emsworth, what parts do you hail from ? Are you a grad student or just very well informed on topics of history ? Its obvious that you know your stuff inside and out. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

==Quel jour est-il?==
Hello, I'm french, and I was reading [[French Lesson 3]] you wrote.

You wrote :
  Quel jour est-il?  	What day is it?
and then :
  Quel jour sommes-nous? is equivalent to Quel jour est-il?.

While I'm quite sure that : '''Quel jour sommes-nous?''' is the only right sentence.

You can notice that '''Quel jour est-il venu ?''' is correct however. (form ''être'' + ''participe passé'')

  --[[User:AGiss|AGiss]] 22:59, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:While you are French, I am not. I remember being taught ''Quel jour est-il?'' Perhaps this is not proper usage any longer, or my references were mistaken. Feel free to correct the sentences in error. Thank you for pointing this out. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 23:30, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)

If you want to be a Wikibooks admin/sysop, reply at [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]], as you have been nominated there. Becoming an admin would mean that you can edit all of the protected pages (which I don't think there are any of yet), and delete nonsense pages (which I think there only has been one of so far).

Hi Lord Emsworth, you seem to be making fewer edits lately. Care for a bit of virtual lemonade to help regain your forces ? You are one of the &quot;power users&quot; who has already done a lot. You singlehandedly wrote two of the history books and have done a lot of work on the Elements of Style. I saw once where some &quot;anonymous coward&quot; wrote a disparaging comment about some historical trivia, but don't let that get to you. You have laid the groundwork for books that will be used some day by thousands of people around the globe. [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Hi Lord Emsworth. You're Constitution/Government book is great, and I'm using it as a model printed book. As I'll be typesetting it, I'd like to know your real name, so I credit you-- I presume to call you a &quot;lead editor&quot;, just for technicalty sake. You can e-mail me at beaubeaver@yahoo.co.uk, or tell me at [[w:user:zanimum]] Again, great work on your books! - [[user:zanimum]]

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Lord Emsworth. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Lord Emsworth~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Plot summary==
[[Arthur (OaFK)|Wart]] is sad, because Kay is being made a knight, and he will be only Kay's squire. [[Merlyn (OaFK)|Merlyn]] suggests that the Wart learn something, mentioning on the side the worthlessness of education to a laborer. As he warns that this is the last use of his magic, he turns Wart into a badger. Wart picks on a hedgehog and threatens to eat it, and the hedgehog asks for mercy by singing. Finally, when the hedgehog reveals he is one that was in Merlyn's hut, the Wart agrees to let the hedgehog go. Then, the Wart goes to see Badger, who tells a myth about how, when God was about to shape the embryos of the species, most animals requested specialization of their parts to help them. Man, though, said he would settle for the embryo shape, because God must have some plan in His mind. After God reveals man has solved the riddle, he gives them dominion over the other animals. Badger continues, questioning Man's ability at this leadership; he mentions he can only think of seven species that war against themselves. When the Wart protests, he asks, &quot;Which did you like best, the ants or the wild geese?&quot;

==Analysis==
'''Animals as governments''' - Badger ends by asking Wart whether he preferred the species that made war or the species that kept peace. Though Wart sees war as possibly noble, Badger reminds him that peace can accomplish much more. Badger also questions if humanity really holds the mankind is taken as an animal species.

==Introduction==
{{High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Supplementary/TOC}}

Although the real numbers can, in some sense, represent any natural quantity, they are in another sense incomplete. We can write certain types of equations with real number coefficients which we desire to solve, but which have no real number solutions. The simplest example of this is the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x^2 + 1 &amp;=&amp; 0 \\
x^2 &amp;=&amp; -1 \\
x &amp;=&amp; \sqrt {-1}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Your high school math teacher may have told you that there is no solution to the above equation. He/she may have even emphasised that there is no ''real'' solution. But we can, in fact, extend our system of numbers to include the ''complex'' numbers by declaring the solution to that equation to exist, and giving it a name: the ''imaginary unit'', &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's ''imagine'' for this chapter that &lt;math&gt;i = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; exists. Hence ''x'' = ''i'' is a solution to the above question, and &lt;math&gt;i^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;.

A valid question that one may ask is &quot;Why?&quot;. Why is it important that we be able to solve these quadratics with this seemingly artificial construction? It is interesting delve a little further into the reason why this imaginary number was introduced in the first place - it turns out that there was a valid reason why mathematicians realized that such a construct was useful, and could provide deeper insight. 

The answer to the question lies not in the solution of quadratics, but rather in the solution of the intersection of a cubic and a line. The mathematician Cardano managed to come up with an ingenious method of solving cubics - much like the quadratic formula, there is also a formula that gives us the roots of cubic equations, although it is far more complicated. Essentially, we can express the solution of a cubic &lt;math&gt;x^3 = 3px + 2q&lt;/math&gt; in the form 

&lt;math&gt;x=\sqrt[3]{q + \sqrt{q^2 - p^3}} + \sqrt[3]{q - \sqrt{q^2-p^3}}&lt;/math&gt;

An unsightly expression, indeed!

You should be able to convince yourself that the line &lt;math&gt;y = 3px + 2q&lt;/math&gt; must always hit the cubic &lt;math&gt;y=x^3&lt;/math&gt;. But try solving some equation where &lt;math&gt;q^2 &lt; p^3&lt;/math&gt;, and you run into a problem - the problem is that we are forced to deal with the square root of a negative number. But, we know that in fact there is a solution for x; for example, &lt;math&gt;x^3 = 15x + 4&lt;/math&gt; has the solution x = 4.

It became apparent to the mathematician Bombelli that there was some piece of the puzzle that was missing - something that explained how this seemingly perverse operation of taking a square root of a negative number would somehow simplify to a simple answer like 4. This was in fact the motivation for considering imaginary numbers, and opened up a fascinating area of mathematics.

The topic of '''Complex numbers''' is very much concerned with this number ''i''. Since this number doesn't exist in this real world, and only lives in our imagination, we call it the ''imaginary unit''. (Note that &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is not typically chosen as a variable name for this reason.)

===The imaginary unit===

As mentioned above
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
i^2 &amp; = &amp; -1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

Let's compute a few more powers of ''i'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
i^1 &amp; = &amp; i \\
i^2 &amp; = &amp; -1 \\
i^3 &amp; = &amp; -i\\
i^4 &amp; = &amp; 1\\
i^5 &amp; = &amp; i\\
i^6 &amp; = &amp; -1\\
&amp;\mbox{...}&amp;
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

As you may see, there is a pattern to be found in this.

===Exercises===
# Compute &lt;math&gt;i^{25}&lt;/math&gt;
# Compute &lt;math&gt;i^{100}&lt;/math&gt;
# Compute &lt;math&gt;i^{1000}&lt;/math&gt;

===Complex numbers as solutions to quadratic equations===

Consider the quadratic equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x^2 - 6x + 13 &amp; =&amp; 0 \\
x &amp; = &amp; \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4 \times 13}}{2}  \\
x &amp; = &amp; \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-16}}{2} \\
x &amp; = &amp; \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{16}}{2} \\
x &amp; = &amp; \frac{6 \pm 4i}{2} \\
x &amp; = &amp; 3 + 2i \ , \ 3 - 2i\\ 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
The ''x'' we get as a solution is what we call a complex number. (To be nitpicky, the solution set of this equation actually has two complex numbers in it; either is a valid value for x.) It consists of ''two'' parts: a ''real'' part of 3 and an ''imaginary'' part of &lt;math&gt;\pm 2&lt;/math&gt;. Let's call the real part ''a'' and the imaginary part ''b''; then the sum &lt;math&gt;a+bi = 3 \pm 2i&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number.

Notice that by merely defining the square root of negative one, we have already given ourselves the ability to assign a value to a much more complicated, and previously unsolvable, quadratic equation. It turns out that 'any' polynomial equation of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;  zeroes if we allow complex numbers; this is called the [[w:Fundamental theorem of algebra|Fundamental Theorem of Algebra]].

We denote the ''real'' part by ''Re''. E.g.:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re}(x) = 3&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- There seems to be a bug in the LaTeX rendering here. It shows the above as text sometimes and LaTeX other times, but the below is always rendered as LaTeX. --&gt;
and the ''imaginary'' part by ''Im''. E.g.:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Im}(x) = \pm 2&lt;/math&gt;

Let's check to see whether &lt;math&gt;x = 3 + 2i&lt;/math&gt; really is solution to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x &amp; = &amp;3 + 2i &amp;\\
x^2 &amp; = &amp; (3)^2 + 2(3)(2i) + (2i)^2 \\
&amp; = &amp; 5 + 12i\\
x^2 - 6x + 13 &amp;=&amp; 5 + 12i - 6(3+2i) + 13\\
&amp;=&amp; 0\\ 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercises ===
# Convince yourself that ''x = 3 - 2i''  is also a solution to the equation.
# Plot the points A(3, 2) and B(3, -2) on a XY plane. Draw a line for each point joining them to the origin.
# Compute the length of AO (the distance from point A to the Origin) and BO. Denote them by r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. What do you observe?
# Compute the angle between each line and the x-axis and denote them by &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt;. What do you observe?
# Consider the complex numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp; = &amp; r_1 \cdot (\cos{\phi_1} + i\sin{\phi_1})\\
w &amp; = &amp; r_2 \cdot (\cos{\phi_2} + i\sin{\phi_2})\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Substitute ''z'' and ''w'' into the quadratic equation above using the values you have computed in Exercise 3 and 4. What do you observe? What conclusion can you draw from this?
# Find the complex solutions to the equation &lt;math&gt;x^2-2x+2=0&lt;/math&gt;. Perform the same steps as above. What can you conclude here?

==Arithmetic with complex numbers==

===Addition and multiplication===
Adding and multiplying two complex number together turns out to be quite straightforward. Let's illustrate with a few examples. Let ''x''  =  3 - 2''i'' and ''y''  =  7 + 11''i'', and we do addition first
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt; x + y \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;= \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(3+7) + (-2+11)i  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                       || &lt;math&gt;= \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; 10 + 9i  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
and now multiplication
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt; x \cdot y \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;= \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(3 - 2i)\cdot(7 + 11i) \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            || &lt;math&gt;= \!&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;3\cdot 7 + 3\cdot 11i - 2i\cdot 7 - 2\cdot 11\cdot i^2\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|                            ||&lt;math&gt;= \!&lt;/math&gt;  || &lt;math&gt;43 + 19i\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Let's summarise the results here.
* When adding complex numbers we add the real parts with real parts, and add the imaginary parts with imaginary parts.
* When multiplying two complex numbers together, we use normal expansion. Whenever we see ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; we put in its place -1. We then collect like terms.

But how do we calculate:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{3 + 2i} {7 - \sqrt{5}i}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the square root is only above the 5 and not the ''i''. This is a little bit tricky, and we shall cover it in the next section.

===Exercises:===
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x &amp;=&amp; 3 - 2i \\
y &amp;=&amp; 3 + 2i
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Compute:
# x + y
# x - y
# x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# xy
# (x + y)(x - y)

===Division===
One way to calculate:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;
is to rationalise the denominator:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2}}=
\frac{2\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}}{(2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2})(2\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2})}=
\frac{2\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}}{10}
&lt;/math&gt;

Utilising a similar idea, to calculate
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{3 + 2i} {7 - \sqrt{5}i}
&lt;/math&gt;
we ''real''ise the denominator.

:&lt;math&gt;
z \ = \ \frac{3 + 2i} {7 - \sqrt{5}i}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
z \ = \ \frac{3 + 2i} {7 - \sqrt{5}i} \times \frac{7 + \sqrt{5}i} {7 +\sqrt{5}i}
&lt;/math&gt;
The denominator is the sum of two squares. We get:
:&lt;math&gt;
z \ = \ \frac{(3 + 2i) \times (7 + \sqrt{5}i)} {49 + 5}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
z \ = \ \frac{21 - 2\sqrt{5}}{54} + \frac {14+3\sqrt{5}} {54}i
&lt;/math&gt;

If somehow we can always find a complex number whose product with the denominator is a real number, then it's easy to do divisions.

If
:&lt;math&gt;
z \ = \ a + ib
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
w \ = \ a - ib
&lt;/math&gt;
Then ''zw'' is a real number. This is true for any 'a' and 'b' (provided they are real numbers).

===Exercises===
Convince yourself that the product of ''zw'' is always a real number.

===Complex Conjugate===
The exercise above leads to the idea of a complex conjugate. The complex conjugate of ''a'' + ''ib'' is  ''a'' - ''ib''. For example, the conjugate of ''2 + 3i'' is ''2 - 3i''. It is a simple fact that the product of a complex number and its conjugate is always a real number. If ''z'' is a complex number then its conjugate is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\bar{z}&lt;/math&gt;. Symbolically if 
:z = a + ib
then,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{z} = a - ib&lt;/math&gt;

The conjugate of 
''3 - 9i'' 
is 
''3 + 9i''.

The conjugate of 
''100'' 
is 
''100''.

The conjugate of 
''9i - 20'' 
is 
''-20 - 9i''.

''' Conjugate laws '''

Here are a few simple rules regarding the complex conjugate
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{z + w}= \bar{z} + \bar{w}&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{zw}= \bar{z}  \bar{w}&lt;/math&gt;

The above laws simply says that the sum of conjugates equals the conjugate of the sum; and similarly, the conjugate of the product equals the product of the conjugates.

Consider this example:
:&lt;math&gt;(3 + 2i) + (89 - 100i) = 92 - 98i&lt;/math&gt;
and we can see that
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{92 - 98i} = 92 + 98i&lt;/math&gt;
which equals to
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{3 + 2i} + \overline{89 - 100i} = 3 - 2i + 89 + 100i = 92 + 98i&lt;/math&gt;
This confirms the addition conjugate law.

===Exercise===
:Convince yourself that the multiplication law is also true.

==The complex root==
Now that you are equipped with all the basics of complex numbers, you can tackle the more advanced topic of root finding.

Consider the question: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp; = &amp; -3 + 4i \\
w &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{z}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Express ''w'' in the form of ''a + ib''.

That is easy enough.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
w &amp; = &amp; \sqrt{z}\\
w^2 &amp; = &amp; z\\

w &amp;=&amp; a + ib\\
w^2 &amp;=&amp; a^2 - b^2 + 2abi\\
\\
-3 &amp;=&amp; a^2 - b^2 &amp;\mbox{(1)}&amp;\\
4 &amp;=&amp;  2ab &amp;\mbox{(2)}&amp;\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Solve (1) and (2) simultaneously to work out ''a'' and ''b''.

Observe that if, after solving for ''a'' and ''b'', we replace them with -''a'' and -''b'' respectively, then they would still satisfy the two simultaneous equations above, we can see that (as expected) if ''w'' = ''a'' + ''ib'' satisfies the equation ''w''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z'', then so will ''w'' = -(''a'' + ''ib''). With real numbers, we always take the non-negative answer and call the solution &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x}&lt;/math&gt;. However, since there is no notion of &quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;less than&quot; with complex numbers, there is no such choice of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, which square root to take as &quot;the&quot; value of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{z}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the circumstances, and this choice is very important to some calculations.

===info -- Finding the square root===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
Finding the root of a real number is a very difficult problem to start with. Most people have no hope of finding a close estimate of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; without the help of a calculator. The modern method of approximating roots involves an easy to understand and ingenius piece of mathematics called the Taylor series expansion. The topic is usually covered in first year university maths as it requires an elementary understanding of an important branch of mathematics called calculus.

The Newton-Raphson method of root finding is also used extensively for this purpose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now consider the problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z &amp;=&amp; -2 + 2i \\
w &amp;=&amp; z^{1/3} 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Express ''w'' in the form of &quot;''a'' + ''ib''&quot;.

Using the methodology developed above we proceed as follows,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
w &amp;=&amp; z^{1/3} \\
w^3 &amp;=&amp; z \\
\\
w &amp;=&amp; (a + ib)\\
w^3 &amp;=&amp; (a^2 - b^2 + 2abi) \times (a + ib)\\
z &amp;=&amp; (a^3 - 3ab^2) + i(3a^2b - b^3)\\
\\
-2 &amp;=&amp; a^3 - 3ab^2 \qquad (1)\\
2 &amp;=&amp; 3a^2b - b^3 \qquad (2)\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that the simultaneous equations (1) &amp; (2) are hard to solve. Actually, there is an easy way to calculate the roots of complex numbers called the De Moivre's theorem, it allows us to calculate the ''n''th root of any complex number with ease. But to set the method, we need understand the geometric meaning of a complex number and learn a new way to ''represent'' a complex number.

===Exercises===
# Find (3 + 3i)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;
# Find (1 + 1i)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;
# Find i&lt;sup&gt;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;

==The complex plane==
===Complex numbers as ordered pairs===
It is worth noting, at this point, that every complex number, ''a'' + ''bi'', can be completely specified with exactly two real numbers: the ''real part'' ''a'', and the ''imaginary part'' ''b''. This is true of ''every'' complex number; for example, the number 5 has real part 5 and imaginary part 0, while the number 7''i'' has real part 0 and imaginary part 7. We can take advantage of this to adopt an alternative scheme for writing complex numbers: we can write them as ordered pairs, in the form ''(a, b)'' instead of ''a+bi''.

&lt;!-- This thing doesn't seem to speak non-math-mode LaTeX, so I don't know what to do about the ugly column headers below. --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\mbox{Instead of}  &amp; \mbox{We could write} \\
5+4i&amp;(5, 4) \\
3i&amp;(0, 3) \\
\frac{4+5i}{3}&amp;(\frac{4}{3}, \frac{5}{3}) \\
42&amp;(42, 0) \\
\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{2}i&amp;(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2}) \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
These should look familiar: they are exactly like the ordered pairs we use to represent points in the plane. In fact, we can use them that way; the plane which results is called the ''complex plane''. We refer to its x axis as the ''real axis'', and to its y axis as the ''imaginary axis''.

===The complex plane===
We can see from the above that a single complex number is a point in the complex plane. We can also represent ''sets'' of complex numbers; these will form ''regions'' on the plane. For example, the set
:&lt;math&gt;\{a+bi | -1 \le a \le 1, -1 \le b \le 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a square of edge length 2 centered at the origin (See following diagram).  [[Image:Region on complex plane.PNG]]

===Complex-valued functions===
Just as we can make functions which take ''real'' values and output ''real'' values, so we can create functions from complex numbers to real numbers, or from complex numbers to complex numbers. These latter functions are often referred to as ''complex-valued'' functions, because they evaluate to (output) a complex number; it is implicit that their argument (input) is complex as well. 

Since complex-valued functions map complex numbers to other complex numbers, and we have already seen that complex numbers correspond to points on the complex plane, we can see that a complex-valued function can turn regions on the complex plane into other regions. A simple example: the function

&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z + (0+1i)&lt;/math&gt;

takes a point in the complex plane and shifts it up by 1. If we apply it to the set of points making up the square above, it will move the entire square up one, so that it &quot;rests&quot; on the x-axis.

{To make more complicated examples, I will first have to go back and introduce the polar representation of complex numbers. Makes for much more interesting functions, :-)  You can use the diagrams below or modify them to make new diagrams.  I will make links to these diagrams in other places in Wikibooks:math.  In the 2nd diagram showing the point, r=4 and theta= 50 degrees.  These types of diagrams can be used to introduce phasors, which are notations for complex numbers used in electrical engineering.}

==de Moivre's Theorem==
If&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{z = r e^{i\theta} = r(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
then&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{z^n = r^n(\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta))}&lt;/math&gt;

==Complex root of unity==
The complex roots of unity to the nth degree is the set of solutions to the equation &lt;math&gt;x^{n} = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly they all have magnitude 1. They form a cyclic group under multiplication. For any given &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, there are exactly &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; many of them, and they form a regular n-gon in the complex plane over the unit circle.

A closed form solution can be given for them, by use of Euler's formula: 

&lt;math&gt;u^n = \cos(2\pi\cdot j/n)+i\sin(2\pi\cdot j/n) \quad 0 \leq j &lt; n&lt;/math&gt;

The sum of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th roots of unity is equal to 0, except for &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, where it is equal to 1.

The product of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th roots of unity alternates between -1 and 1.

Remember that each branch has the entire voltage across it.

Applying Ohm's law to the top branch:

I=V/R

=6/4 A

=1.5A

The lower branch has a combined resistance of 4&amp;Omega; because the two resistirs are in series.

Applying Ohm's law to the bottom branch:
I=V/R

=6/(2+2) A

=1.5A

Don't let it get you down. We all have the same problem, there are just too few of us at the moment. The page so far look really nice. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:18, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I hope my edits aren't unwelcome; I realize some of them are pretty major. I've been trying to order things such that they make sense to somebody who is completely unfamiliar with the concepts involved. I didn't realize I was invading someone's turf... I just got bored studying for finals, so I started clicking 'Random Page' until I found something I felt I could contribute to. :-) [[User:Glenn Willen|Glenn Willen]] 02:13, 10 May 2004 (UTC)

==Namespacing nitpick==
I can see right here one of the practical problems with book-specific namespacing (and also with &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; like &quot;&lt; High School Extensions&quot;). This page _should_ be useful for at least one of the &quot;standard&quot; math books in addition to HSE (which one depending on whose curriculum standards you like), but namespacing makes that awkward. Breadcrumbs are nice, but they inhibit reuse... the quickest, easiest solution I can see is to namespace more broadly (i.e. &quot;Math:Complex number&quot;) or not at all (just &quot;Complex number&quot; as this was previously named), and to provide multiple sets of breadcrumbs at the top of a multiply-used page...  what do people think?

:Keep it up r3m0t! I just want to say when i drew up those ''plans'', they are not meant to be the headings, they are there to remind me of what I want to talk about. So you might want to get creative and use your own headings, divide the chapter your way and write about things the way you desire. Don't let those ''plans'' dictate to you what you should write, or in what order you should write it. [[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo Jia Dai]]

Am I right in thinking that every integer is real? In other words, is a number such as 4 + 5''i'' an integer? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] (whoops, forgot to sign, nevermind)

yes. although 4 + 5i are sometimes called Gaussian integers, we mean integers when we say integers nothing else. [[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo Jia Dai]]

== Set theory not suitable for this level ==
I dont know what is taught in high school around the world. But set theory isn't taught in Australian high schoool. So one part of this chapter has to be rewritten, slightly. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 08:59, 10 Jul 2004 (UTC)

I learned basic set theory (Venn Diagrams, sets, intersections, unions) at the age of 9. It certainly is not too complicated to be taught at this level.--[[User:206.127.177.59|206.127.177.59]] 21:09, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

Yeah, some of the set stuff is really not hard at all. But we don't learn it at all in South African primary/secondary schools. --[[User:168.209.97.34|168.209.97.34]] 20:13, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) (Taejo in English Wikipedia)

== DeMoivre's theorem not suitable  ==
The student may not have had exposure to the natural logarithms at this level.  It would be acceptable to include information about polar complex plane in the form  z = r cos theta + ir sin theta. So a complex number in polar coordinates is like ( r, theta ).  --[[User:206.127.177.59|206.127.177.59]] 21:09, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

yeah i agree, it is too hard for me (lol im crap at math anyway)

Note on curricula: In South Africa logarithms are taught to Math &quot;Higher Grade&quot; students in the final year. Natural logarithms are not taught in high school. --[[User:168.209.97.34|168.209.97.34]] 20:13, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) (Taejo on English Wikipedia)

== SOMEONE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ==
alright im only in year 9 so dont get too technical. theres this question that goes:
find all values of a such that there are two real solutions to the equation
   x^3+(a-1)x^2+(9-a)x-9=0
can someone just tell me how to do cubics???

and i dunno whats calculus my teacher said i need it
DONT GET TOO HARD!!!

edit: sorry its supposed to be 1 after a (thanks for telling me)

First of all, don't use all capital letters LIKE THIS, this is considered shouting in internet culture.
To your question, I think either you wrote the wrong question here or your teacher made a mistakes(or you're in a pre-university class, then).
At first, I thought you could take one of these approaches
* Use the formula directly(involved matrix actually)
''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;18&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;27''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
* Use Vieta's Substitution to work out the solution directly.
* Differentiate it, then the discriminant of the resulting quadratic equation should be greater than zero, and one of the solution of the quadratic should also be the solution to the cubic, use vieta again to solve it.
* Let one of the root be k, then divide the cubic equation with x-k, the resulting quadratic should be a prefect square, that is, the discriminant of it should be zero.

Now, the trouble is that all of the method above are far too complex for a grade 9 student, and even if there is an answer, it is too clumsy..(I tried, but found out the algebra expression grows very long, I also tried using a grphic calculator, and the result seems to be an irrational number) Well, once we're at cubic things never go nicely, vieta's substitution itself are too complex already itself.--[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 10:51, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)


Edit:Ok, tried method one on a equation solver and the answer match with what I found on the graph. a= 9+2.788273389 or 9-35.48344244 , now both seems to be irrational numbers...

hmm, it isnt supposed to be hard. its in this noether student problem set, for year 9 (im in australia), and all the other problems are piece of cake. can you please just give me a link to vieta's substitution? i really dont no what it is. thanks


Well, in my country Vieta's substitution isn't in the core part of the course and is in the &quot;enrichment&quot; part. Anyway, be perpared that it is going to be a clumsy method, as in history, it is not developed until ~1541, long after the quadratic was solved.

There are more than one approaches to Vieta, but the first step is always to eliminate the quadratic terms. Let x = y + a, where a is a constant, substitute into the equation, and find &quot;a&quot; such that the quadratic term's coeifficient become zero.

There're two way to go after this, the first is to let y = p + q and compare coeifficient to find out p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and (pq)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The second method is to let y = z + b/z. Now find the value of b such that it reduces into quadratic, which can be solved with ease.

Hope these helps.


Opps, didn't notice your correction on the problem, now it is much easier. First, expand:

&lt;math&gt;x^3 + ax^2 - x^2 + 9x - ax - 9 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Then factorize:

&lt;math&gt;x^2(x-1) + 9(x-1) + ax(x-1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x^2 + ax + 9)(x-1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Now either x = 1 or x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ax + 9 = 0 . I think you should be able to do it now. --[[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 08:06, 24 Jun 2005 (UTC)



yea i done it, but only found -6 and 6, never thought of when one of the roots of the binomial would be one (damn)</text>

Pronouns are nouns which are used instead of another noun ('pro', in place of 'noun', noun.)

There are three categories of pronouns which are divided up into persons: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. In addition, pronouns can be singular or plural. They are declined like all other nouns.

|}  

Nota Bene: the genitive is used in certain phrases like:
#memor nostrī, mindful of us
#paucī vestrum, a few of you.

For the possessive uses (my sister, your bicycle), Latin does not use the genitive, but the possessive adjectives:

===3rd Person Pronouns===
Technically, 3rd person pronouns do not exist in Latin as they do in English. However, they do have equivalents.

Adjectives modify nouns and take the gender of the noun which they modify. However, adjectives do not necessarily need a substantive present in the sentence to modify. The substantive can be presumed. In this way, '3rd person' pronouns are formed. 

====Example 1====
Take the masculine form of the adjective 'ille'. Literally it means 'That (masculine) thing.' However one could take it for simply meaning 'he', depending on the context. Similarly, the pronoun 'iste' means 'this (masc.) thing'. Iste and ille are declined in exactly the same way.

If no substantive is provided assume words like these: 'man', 'woman', 'thing', 'idea', 'concept', 'reason' etc. Let context be your guide.

Ille is often used as a kind of pronoun. In situations with multiple phrases or sentences, however, it is syntactically different from is, ea, id (see below).

For example: &quot;Canis puero cibum dat. Is laborat in agro.&quot; means &quot;The dog gives food to the boy. The dog works in the field&quot;.

However: &quot;Canis puero cibum dat. Ille laborat in agro.&quot; means &quot;The dog gives food to the boy. The boy works in the field&quot;.

Thus, ille, unlike the other pronouns makes a previous object into the subject (and vice versa).

====Examples of the Usage of Ille:====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Latin
!bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;|English
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Ille est dominus. ||bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;| He is the master. (ille as pronoun)
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Ille dominus est malus. ||bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;| That master is bad. (ille as adjective) 
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Illam videt ||bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;| He sees her. (or 'she sees her' - illam as pronoun)
|-
|bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot;|Illam puellam videt ||bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;| He (or she) sees that girl (illam as adjective).

|}

====Uses of the Relative Pronoun====
The relative pronoun takes on the case depending on the function it serves in the relative clause.  For example, in the sentence &quot;He sees the man who has a slave,&quot; &quot;who&quot; is translated as nominative because it is the subject of the clause &quot;who has a slave.&quot;  The antecedent (noun to which the pronoun refers) is usually before the relative clause.

====Examples of the Usage of the Relative Pronoun====
# ''Virum [[wiktionary:videre#Latin|videt]] (he/she sees) '''qui''' [[wiktionary:servus#Latin|servum]] (servant) [[wiktionary:habere#Latin|habet]] (he/she has).''
#: He sees the man '''who''' has a slave
# '''''Ille''' est [[wiktionary:vir#Latin|vir]] cujus servus est [[wiktionary:malus#Latin|malus]].''
#: '''That''''s the man whose slave is bad.
# ''Quis '''[[wiktionary:is#Latin|eum]]''' videt?''
#: Who sees '''him'''?

'''[The Constitution begins with a Preamble. It is followed by Articles, which are divided into Sections, which are again divided into clauses.]'''

==Preamble==

*We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;PREAMBLE&quot;&gt;'''[The Preamble to the Constitution does not make any law. It merely states the reasons for which the Constitution is established.]'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Government/Constitution Preamble|Text]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Articles==

===Article One - Legislative Branch===

====Section 1. - Legislative Power Vested====

*All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[/Article One, Section 1 Annotations|Article One, Section 1 Annotations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 2. - House of Representatives====

#The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states, and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature. 
#No person shall be a Representative who shall not
## have attained to the age of twenty five years, and
## been seven years a citizen of the United States, and who shall not,
## when elected, be an inhabitant of that state in which he shall be chosen. 
#Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.&lt;ref&gt;The requirement that direct taxes be apportioned among the states was removed by the Sixteenth Amendment, which authorized Direct Income Taxes.)'''&lt;/ref&gt;
## The actual Enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall by law direct.
## The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand, but each state shall have at least one Representative; and
## until such enumeration shall be made, the state of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.
#When vacancies happen in the Representation from any state, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.
#The House of Representatives shall choose their speaker&lt;ref&gt;'''[Note that there is no constitutional requirement that the Speaker be a Representative, though he always has.]'''&lt;/ref&gt; and other officers; and shall have the sole power of impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;'''[When trying the impeachment of Senator William Blount, the first impeachment in US history, in 1799, the Senate dismissed the case, ruling that only executive and judicial officials were subject to impeachment.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 3. - Senate Elections====

#The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, chosen by the legislature thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Seventeenth Amendment superseded the above clause, requiring that the People of a state choose the Senators.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Immediately after they shall be assembled in consequence of the first election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three classes.
## The seats of the Senators of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the second year, of the second class at the expiration of the fourth year, and the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so that one third may be chosen every second year; and
## if vacancies happen by resignation, or otherwise, during the recess of the legislature of any state, the executive thereof may make temporary appointments until the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then fill such vacancies.
#No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen of the United States and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that state for which he shall be chosen.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Senate has the power to judge the qualifications of its members. The Senate did not enforce the thirty-year requirement on certain occasions. In 1806, 29-year-old Henry Clay took his seat, as did 28-year-old Armistead Mason in 1816, as also did 28-year old John Eaton in 1818. In 1934, Rush Holt- who was aged 29 at the time- agreed to wait six months until taking the oath. The Senate acquiesced, ruling that the thirty-year age requirement applied only to the time of oath-taking.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.
#The Senate shall choose their other officers, and also a '''President ''pro tempore'''''.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Latin, ''for the time being''.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;, in the absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the office of President of the United States
#(Impeachment)
## The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments.
## When sitting for that purpose, they shall be on oath or affirmation.
## When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And
## no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two thirds of the members present.
#Judgment in cases of impeachment
## shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States:
## but the party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Executive officers who are convicted upon impeachment are automatically removed from office.&lt;br&gt;The Senate ''may'' also disqualify such an executive officer from holding future offices.&lt;br&gt; In the case of judicial officers, the Senate has four options.&lt;br&gt; First, it may impose no punishment.&lt;br&gt;Second, it may remove the judge from office.&lt;br&gt; Third, it may disqualify the judge from holding future office.&lt;br&gt; Fourth, it may both remove the judge and disqualify him or her from holding future office.'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 4. - Elections of Senators and Representatives====

#The times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by law make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing Senators. 
#The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall be on the '''first Monday in December''', unless they shall by law appoint a different day.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Twentieth Amendment changed the reference to the first Monday in December to January 3rd.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 5. - Rules of House and Senate====

#Each House shall be the judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own members, and a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the attendance of absent members, in such manner, and under such penalties as each House may provide. 
#Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two thirds, expel a member. 
#Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall, at the desire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the journal. 
#Neither House, during the session of Congress, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.

====Section 6. - Compensation and Privileges of Members====

#The Senators and Representatives shall receive a compensation for their services, to be ascertained by law, and paid out of the treasury of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Twenty-Seventh Amendment prohibits a Congressional salary change from taking effect until an election of Representatives intervenes.]'''&lt;/ref&gt; They shall in all cases, except treason, felony and breach of the peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place. 
#No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time: and no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House during his continuance in office.

====Section 7. - Passage of Bills====

#All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives;  but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other Bills.&lt;ref&gt;'''[In practice, &quot;appropriation bills,&quot; or bills granting money for government services and actions, also originate in the House. The practice originates from the United Kingdom, where the House of Commons originates all revenue or appropriation bills, and the House of Lords does not, by tradition, even amend them.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;
#Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the bill, it shall be sent, together with the objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a law. But in all such cases the votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for and against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law. 
#Every order, resolution, or vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the same shall take effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill.

===Article Two - Executive Branch===

====Section 1. - Election, Installation, Removal====
# The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.
# He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice-President chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:
## Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress:
## but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
# The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not lie an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.
# And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each;
## which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate.
# The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted.
# The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed;
## and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President;
## and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President.
# But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote;
## a quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two-thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice.

# But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice-President.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Twelfth Amendment separated the Presidential and Vice-Presidential elections, while still using the same electors. Instead of making the Vice-Presidency the second prize of the Presidential election, the Electors were required by the Amendment to vote separately for each office. Also, the Amendment made changes in the manner in which the Houses of Congress chose a President or Vice-President when no one received a majority of Electoral Votes.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes;
## which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
# No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President;
## neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.
# In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President,&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Twenty-Fifth Amendment clarified the preceding statement by stating &quot;In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.&quot;]'''&lt;/ref&gt; and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. 
# The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
# Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:
## &quot;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''[George Washington established the tradition of adding &quot;So help me God&quot; to the oath.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

# The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.

# He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient;
## he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper;
## he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers;
## he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,
## and shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.

# In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction.
# In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make. 
# The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury;

# The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Corruption of blood indicates punishment of one's family for one's own crimes.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 3. - Admission of States====
# New states may be admitted by the Congress into this union;
# but no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other state;
# nor any state be formed by the junction of two or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of the states concerned as well as of the Congress.

But if the police believed that a truly defective warrant was indeed legal, then evidence seized &quot;in good faith&quot; need not necessarily be excluded.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amendment V - Grand Jury, Double Jeopardy, Self-Incrimination, Due Process (1791)====
#No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime,&lt;ref&gt;'''[&quot;Capital, or otherwise infamous crime&quot; means a crime punishable by death, life in prison, or by one or more years in prison.]'''&lt;/ref&gt; unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury,&lt;ref&gt;'''[A Grand Jury is a jury, usually composed of more than the traditional twelve jurors in petit juries (trial juries), that decides if there is enough evidence for a trial to occur.]'''&lt;/ref&gt; except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger;

====Amendment VIII - Excess Bail or Fines, Cruel and Unusual Punishment (1791)====
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The words of the Eighth Amendment were taken directly from the seventeenth century English Bill of Rights.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amendment X - Rights Reserved to States (1791)====
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Originally, the Congress proposed Twelve Amendments rather than ten. The Ten that were ratified by the states became the Bill of Rights. One amendment was not ratified at all, while the other was ratified more than two hundered years later to become the Twenty-Seventh Amendment.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Amendments===

====Amendment XI - Suits Against a State (1795)====
The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Under the Constitution, the Supreme Court had original jurisdiction in cases involving states. However, the Congress believed that the Court had abused this power when it decided against the state of Georgia in the case of'' Chisolm v. Georgia''. The Congress rapidly passed the Amendment to prevent federal courts from hearing cases against the states. Note that the reference to &quot;citizens of another state&quot; has been, by judicial interpretation, extended to citizens of the state being sued as well.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

#The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice-President, shall be the Vice-President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed,
#and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list, the Senate shall choose the Vice-President;
#a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two-thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice.

#nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Before the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights only applied to the Federal government. But the reference to &quot;privileges or immunities of citizens&quot; has been interpreted by the courts to extend certain parts of the Bill of Rights to the states themselves. Some Amendments, such as the Second Amendment, have not been &quot;incorporated,&quot; or extended to the states.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2.
#Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.
#But when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the executive and judicial officers of a state, or the members of the legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such state. 

Section 3. No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any state legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any state, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. 

Section 4.
# The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.
# But neither the United States nor any state shall assume or pay any debt or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation of any slave; but all such debts, obligations and claims shall be held illegal and void.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Amendment XIV, Section 4, essentially provides that the debt of the Union would be paid by the government, but Confederate debts would not be paid by either the federal or the state governments.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.

====Amendment XV - Rights Not to Be Denied on Account of Race (1870)====

The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Prior to this Amendment, the Congress had to apportion, or divide, taxes between the states based on the populations of the states. Under this Amendment, that requirement was removed and Income Taxes were legalized.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amendment XVII - Election of Senators (1913)====
The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each state, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures.&lt;ref&gt;'''[This Amendment provided that the People, rather than the Legislature, of the states would choose the Senate.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;
When vacancies happen in the representation of any state in the Senate, the executive authority of such state shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct. 
This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution.

====Amendment XVIII - Prohibition (1919)====
Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Eighteenth Amendment commenced the Prohibition era.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3d day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Prior to the Twentieth Amendment, terms commenced in March. However, this created the problem of lame ducks- Presidents who had not won reelection in November but were in office for four more months with little popular mandate to make important decisions.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Constitution fixed the meeting day for Congress in December.

Section 4. The Congress may by law provide for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the House of Representatives may choose a President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them, and for the case of the death of any of the persons from whom the Senate may choose a Vice President whenever the right of choice shall have devolved upon them.

Section 2. The transportation or importation into any state, territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited. 

Section 3. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by conventions in the several states, as provided in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission hereof to the states by the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Twenty-First Amendment is the only Amendment that was ratified by conventions, rather than legislatures, in the states.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amendment XXII - Two Term Limit on President (1951)====
Section 1. No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once. But this article shall not apply to any person holding the office of President when this article was proposed by the Congress, and shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of President, or acting as President, during the term within which this article becomes operative from holding the office of President or acting as President during the remainder of such term.&lt;ref&gt;'''[The Twenty-Second Amendment was passed after Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran for President (and won) four times, violating the past practice set by George Washington that Presidents run for only two terms.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2. This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states by the Congress.

A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a state, but in no event more than the least populous state; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the states, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a state; and they shall meet in the District and perform such duties as provided by the twelfth article of amendment. 

Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

====Amendment XXIV - Poll Tax (1964)====
Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.&lt;ref&gt;'''[Southern states utilized the poll tax to bar poor African-Americans from voting. The laws' direct provisions as well as their loopholes often provided exemptions to Caucasians.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

====Amendment XXV - Presidential Succession (1967)====
Section 1. In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President.&lt;ref&gt;'''[This was still the situation prior to the ratification of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, but the situation was murky due to the Constitution's lack of clarity similar to that provided by Section 1.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2. Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;'''[This Section was utilized twice in the 1970's. When Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned during the Watergate Controversy, President Richard Nixon nominated, and Congress confirmed, Gerald Ford as Vice President. When Nixon resigned and he became President, Ford nominated and Congress confirmed Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President. Since then, Section 2 has not been utilized.]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 3. Whenever the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until he transmits to them a written declaration to the contrary, such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President. 

Section 4. Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.

====Amendment XXVI - Right to Vote at Age 18 (1971)====
Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States, who are 18 years of age or older, to vote, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of age. 

Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Election of 1840==
President Martin Van Buren was blamed for the Panic of 1837, but felt that he deserved to be reelected in 1840. Van Buren was a Democrat from New York who had continued the policies of Andrew Jackson. To oppose him the Whig Party joined to bring in a hero of the Indian wars, William Henry Harrison, &quot;Old Tippecanoe.&quot; The ticket was balanced by the Vice Presidential candidate, a Southerner named John Tyler. 

The Harrison campaign was thoroughly managed. The campaign song, &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler Too,&quot; was headed with an image of the log cabin where Harrison had supposedly grown up. Paid staffers went to frontier towns rolling a huge canvas ball, inscribed, &quot;Keep it rolling for Tippecanoe and Tyler Too.&quot; (The American idiom &quot;Keep the ball rolling&quot; comes from this usage.) The ball would stop in front of a local tavern, then a common meeting place of the community. There they would stage a rally, typically with some free cider. Another sign of Harrison's plain man status was his title as &quot;the hard cider candidate.&quot; There was little discussion of the issues. For its part, Van Buren's campaign called Harrison a provincial, out-of-touch old man. (The latter was then sixty-eight years old, a rare age in those days.) 

Harrison won, and gave an hours-long, polished inaugural speech to prove his sophistication. Three weeks afterward, he came down with a cold which turned into pneumonia. He died in April of 1841, and John Tyler was sworn in as President. Thus the Whig Party, predominately Northern and ambivalent about slavery, elected a Virginian advocate of slavery and opponent of the American System. This was a startling omen for those like Clay who believed in American unity.

==John Tyler Presidency==

Tyler's dislike of Jackson had moved him to change his party from Democrat to Whig. His government marked the only Whig presidency. His supporters included formerly anti-Jackson Democrats and National Republicans. He supported states' rights; so when many of the Whig bills came to him, they were never voted in. In fact, Tyler vetoed the entire Whig congressional agenda. The Whigs saw this as a party leader turning on his own party. He was officially expelled from the Whig party in 1841.

The Tyler presidency threw the Whig party into disarray. Because of divisions between the two factions in the party, the Whigs could not agree on one goal. Much of the public did not take Tyler's presidency seriously. They saw his lack of appeal in Congress and the embarrassing resignations of all of but one of Harrison's cabinet appointees in a single month. Yet Tyler's administration helped polarize the two parties. When he appointed John C. Calhoun, a staunch pro-slavery Democrat, as his Secretary of State, he confirmed a growing feeling that Democrats were the party of the South and Whigs the party of the North. In the election of 1844, Whigs voted by sectional ties. Because of these weakening divisions within the party, the Democratic candidate, James Polk, won. After one term, the Whigs were out of power.

== Manifest Destiny ==

Many Western European-descended &quot;White&quot; Americans supported anti-Native American policies. The theme of conquest over the Indian was seen as early as John Filson's story of Daniel Boone in 1784. In the Nineteenth Century this was joined to the conviction that the United States was destined to take over the whole continent of North America, the process of '''Manifest Destiny''' articulated by John O' Sullivan in 1845.[source needed] America carried the Bible, civilization, and democracy: the Indian had none of these. Many European descendants believed other ethnic groups, including those people imported as slaves from Africa and their descendants, were childlike, stupid, and feckless. It was the duty of so-called superior groups to meet these inferior groups and to dominate them. So-called inferior ethnic groups could not advance technologically or spiritually. The idea of Manifest Destiny resulted in the murders and dislocation of millions of people. The Cherokee had been converted to Christianity, they were by-and-large peaceful, and they were using a self-invented alphabet to print newspapers. But their deportation, the &quot;Trail of Tears,&quot; was justified by Manifest Destiny. The conviction was behind the Louisiana Purchase, the final shaking of French colonialism in what would become the Continental United States. It was behind the defeat of Spanish and Mexicans in a succession of skirmishes and wars. It helped send out pro- and anti-slavery factions across new areas, and still later brought about legislation such as the Homestead Act.

== Amistad Case ==
In February of 1839, Portuguese slave hunters abducted a large group of Africans from Sierra Leone and shipped them to Havana, Cuba, a center for the slave trade. This abduction violated all of the treaties then in existence. Fifty-three Africans were purchased by two Spanish planters and put aboard the Cuban schooner Amistad for shipment to a Caribbean plantation. On July 1, 1839, the Africans seized the ship, killed the captain and the cook, and ordered the planters to sail to Africa. On August 24, 1839, the Amistad was seized off Long Island, NY, by the U.S. brig Washington. The planters were freed and the Africans were imprisoned in New Haven, CT, on charges of murder. Although the murder charges were dismissed, the Africans continued to be held in confinement as the focus of the case turned to salvage claims and property rights. President Van Buren was in favor of extraditing the Africans to Cuba. However, abolitionists in the North opposed extradition and raised money to defend the Africans. Claims to the Africans by the planters, the government of Spain, and the captain of the brig led the case to trial in the Federal District Court in Connecticut. The court ruled that the case fell within Federal jurisdiction and that the claims to the Africans as property were not legitimate because they were illegally held as slaves. The case went to the Supreme Court in January 1841, and former President John Quincy Adams argued the defendants' case. Adams defended the right of the accused to fight to regain their freedom. The Supreme Court decided in favor of the Africans, and 35 of them were returned to their homeland. The others died at sea or in prison while awaiting trial. The result, widely publicized court cases in the United States helped the abolitionist movement.

==Technology==

The canals had been a radical innovation. But they had their limitations. They could only overcome mountains with complicated, overland bypasses, and in winter they froze, stopping traffic completely. But an answer was found in the steam-driven, coal-powered engine. The steamboat was already bringing cotton and people up the rivers, erasing an age-old transportation problem. The development of railroad engines made travel and manufacture possible even in winter. It made the expensive canal obsolete: wherever you could run a rail, you could have a town. And the coal-fired, steam-powered engine could bring manufacturing to places without great rivers. The prosperity of the New England mill towns could be replicated elsewhere.

Coal and its byproducts became a major industry in America. (In the 1850s some German cities became known for creating coal-based dyes to make bold-colored fabrics.) Iron works and glass plants built large furnaces, fueled by coke, a coal derivative. They were contained by huge buildings. Steam-boats burned coke. So did steam-driven works. Smoke and smut from industry and household coal fires poured into city air. In his 1842 tour of Pittsburgh, Charles Dickens looked at the haze and fire and called it &quot;Hell with the lid off.&quot;

Canals, railroads, and the teletype system tied the country together in a way thought impossible in 1790. They increased the market for goods, and thus the demand. The Second Industrial Revolution produced faster ways of satisfying that demand. In 1855 Henry Bessemer patented a furnace which could turn iron into steel, in high quantity. Iron workers, &quot;puddlers,&quot; had worked slowly and regularly, had been paid a high wage, and had been considered craftsmen. The new steelworkers did not need that skill. They could be paid more cheaply. In other industries, faster processes of work either made a mockery of the apprenticeship system or eliminated it altogether. Manufacturers faced the same situation of the New England cloth makers a generation before, and solved it another way. To find fresh, fast, cheap labor, you could often hire children. You didn't have to pay them as much, and they didn't complain. Where children used to work on the farm, they now worked in groups in factories for higher wages. These children were, at the best, expected to work long and hard. (It was cheaper to run big machines in shifts than to have them idle all night.) Boys and girls worked naked in the coal mines; boys got burned in the glassworks; boys got maimed or killed running heavy machinery. None of them went to school, so even the ones who survived to adulthood were unfit for jobs when they came of age.

The ideals of Thomas Jefferson were dead. Instead of craftsmen and farmers living by their own hands, the cities were being filled by people who owned little or nothing, getting on by the wages paid by often indifferent employers. This was true in New England and the Middle States, though not in the South (except for the Tregar Ironworks in Richmond, Virginia, itself partially manned by slaves). Politicians such as John C. Calhoun jeered at Northern &quot;wage slaves,&quot; and dreamed of a South with the technology and government of Sparta.

==Compromise of 1850==

'''The Compromise of 1850''' was an intricate package of five bills passed in September 1850. It defused a four-year confrontation between the slave states of the South and the free states of the North that arose following the Mexican-American War. The compromise, drafted by Whig Henry Clay and brokered by Democrat Stephen Douglas, quieted sectional conflict for four years. The calm was greeted with relief, although each side disliked specific provisions. Texas surrendered its claim to New Mexico, but received debt relief and the Texas Panhandle, and retained the control over El Paso that it had established earlier in 1850. The South avoided the humiliating Wilmot Proviso, but did not receive desired Pacific territory in Southern California or a guarantee of slavery south of a territorial compromise line like the Missouri Compromise Line or the 35th parallel north. As compensation, the South received the possibility of slave states by popular sovereignty in the new New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory, which, however, were unsuited to plantation agriculture and populated by non-Southerners; a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, which in practice outraged Northern public opinion; and preservation of slavery in the national capital, although the slave trade was banned there except in the portion of the District of Columbia that adjoined Virginia. The Compromise became possible after the sudden death of President Zachary Taylor, who, although a slave owner himself, tried to implement the Northern policy of excluding slavery from the Southwest. Whig leader Henry Clay designed a compromise, which failed to pass in early 1850. In the next session of Congress, Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois narrowly passed a slightly modified package over opposition by extremists on both sides, including Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.


=== Texas and Mexico ===

Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821. Weakened by more than a decade of struggle, the new Republic of Mexico attempted to attract settlers from the United States to the then-sparsely populated Mexican state of Coahuila y Texas. The first white settlers were 200 families led by Stephen F. Austin as a part of a business venture started by Austin's father. Despite nominal attempts to ensure that immigrants would be double penetrated with Mexican cultural values -- by requiring, for example, acceptance of Catholicism and a ban on slave holding -- Mexico's immigration policy led to the whites, rather than Mexicans, becoming the demographic majority in Texas by the 1830's, their beliefs and American values intact.

Due to past US actions in Texas, Mexico feared that white Americans would convince the United States to annex Texas and Mexico. In April 1830, Mexico issued a proclamation that people from the United States could no longer enter Texas. Mexico also would start to place custom duties on goods from the United States. In October 1835, white colonists in Texas revolted against Mexico by attacking a Mexican fort at Goliad, defeating the Mexican garrison. At about the same time, the Mexican president, Antonio López de Santa Anna, provoked a constitutional crisis that was among the causes of the revolt in Texas, as well as a rebellion in the southern Mexican province of Yucután. An official declaration of Texas independence was signed at Goliad that December. The next March, the declaration was officially enacted at the Texan capital of Washington-on-the-Brazos, creating the Republic of Texas.

A few days before the enactment of the declaration, a Mexican force led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna laid siege to the Alamo, a mission in present day San Antonio. Vastly outnumbered, fewer than 200 Texans at San Antonio de Béxa, renamed the Alamo, held out for 12 days, until the final attack at dawn on March 6, 1836. Santa Anna, as he had promised during the siege, killed the few prisoners taken in the capture. Though the Alamo had been garrisoned in contravention of orders from Sam Houston, who had been placed in charge of Texan armed forces, the delay their defense forced on the Mexican army allowed the Texan government some crucial time to organize.

The next month saw the battle of San Jacinto, the final battle of the Texas Revolution. A force of 800 led by Sam Houston, empowered by their rallying war cry of &quot;Remember the Alamo!&quot;, defeated Santa Anna's force of 1600 as they camped beside the sluggish creek for which the 20-minute-long battle is named. Santa Anna himself was captured and the next day was tortured to sign the Treaties of Velasco, which ended Mexico-Texas hostilities. After the fighting had ended, Texas asked to be admitted to the Union, but Texas's request forced Congress to an impasse.

[[Image:Mexico states evolution.gif|thumb|Evolution of the Mexican territory.]]One of the most significant problems with the annexation of Texas was slavery. Despite Mexican attempts to exclude the practice, a number of white-Texans held slaves, and the new Republic of Texas recognized the practice as legitimate. In the United States, The Missouri Compromise of 1818 provided for an equality in the numbers of slave and non-slave states in the US, and to allow Texas to join would upset that power balance. For about ten years, the issue was unresolved, until President James Polk agreed to support the annexation of Texas. In 1845, Texas formally voted to join the US. The Mexicans, however, who had never formally recognized Texas's independence, resented this decision.

The southern boundary with Texas had never officially been settled and when the United States moved federal troops into this disputed territory, war broke out (assisted by raids carried out across the border by both sides). In the Mexican-American War, as this was called, the US quickly defeated the Mexican Army by 1848. The peace settlement, called the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ceded one-third of Mexico's territory to the United States. In addition to Texas, with the border fixed at the Rio Grande River, the United States acquired land that would become the present-day states of New Mexico, California, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming; the US paid Mexico $15 million. However, the new territories posed even more problems relating to slavery: the balance between slave and non-slave states seemed threatened again.

=== Oregon ===
In 1824 and 1825 Russia gave up its claim to Oregon. The U.S. and Canada jointly made an agreement for occupation. However, disputes surfaced over the northwestern boundary of the US and the southwestern boundary of Canada. The US claimed that it owned land south of Alaska, while the British claimed that the boundary was drawn at present-day Oregon. President Polk, who had initiated the dispute, gave Great Britain an ultimatum -- negotiate or go to war. On June 15, 1846, Britain agreed to give up the land south of the 49th parallel, while keeping Vancouver Island and navigation rights to the Columbia River. Polk agreed. Comparing this incident to the president's aggressiveness toward Mexico, several individuals [whom?] concluded that Polk favored the causes of the South over those of the North.

'''Oregon Trail'''

Sometimes Native Americans and white settlers met in peace. During the twenty years after 1840, around 250,000 to 500,000 people walked '''the Oregon Trail''' across most of the continent on foot, with the trek taking an average of seven months. Many of these settlers were armed in preparation for Native attack, but the majority of the encounters were peaceful. Most of the starting points were along the Missouri River, including Independence, St. Joseph, and Westport, Missouri. Many settlers set out on organized wagon trains, while others went on their own. Settlers timed their departures so they would arrive after spring, allowing their livestock days of pasture at the end, and yet early enough to not travel during the harsh winter. Walking beside their wagons, settlers would usually cover fifteen miles a day. Men, women and children sometimes endured weather ranging from extreme heat to frozen winter in their 2,000 mile journey West. If a traveler became ill, he or she would have no doctor and no aid apart from fellow travelers. Only the strong finished the trail. Although most interactions between Native Americans and settlers were undertaken in good faith, sometimes things went bad. Eventually hostile relations  would escalate into full blown war and many years of bloodshed.

=== California ===

When war broke out between the United States and Mexico in 1845, a few white settlers in the Sacramento Valley in the Mexican state of California seized the opportunity to advance white business interests by declaring independence from Mexico despite the wishes of many Mexicans and natives present in California. Before the arrival of Europeans, scholars place the population of California at 10 million natives.  The sparsely populated Bear Flag Republic, as the new nation was called, quickly asked the US for protection from Mexico, allowing US military operations in the new Republic's territory. As skirmishes occurred in California, Mexicans suffered many abuses at the hands of the new white government.

When the war ended, the California territory and a large surrounding territory were ceded by Mexico to the US in exchange for $15 million. The territory included what would become present day California, Nevada, Utah, most of New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado and a small part of Wyoming. The continental US was nearly complete. The final piece would come in 1853, when southern Arizona and New Mexico were bought from Mexico for $10 million. The land from the purchase, known as the Gadsden Purchase, was well suited for building a southern transcontinental railroad.

In 1848 gold was found at the mill of John Sutter, who lived in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, 40 miles east of Sacramento. Word of the gold on the American River (the river on which Sutter's mill was located on) spread, and hordes of people rushed into California to mine gold. The rush peaked in 1849, and those who came during that year were known as &quot;forty-niners.&quot; The population of the northern California city of San Francisco exploded as a result of the immigration to the region.

Many immigrants that joined the Gold Rush did not find opportunity but rather discrimination at the hands of white prospectors and newly changed government.  One of these, Joaquin Murrieta, known as the Mexican Robin Hood, had become a bandit and hero of those still loyal to Mexico.  As a reaction the Governor of California, John Bigler, formed the California Rangers.  This group went after and allegedly found Murrieta and his companions.  They cut off his head, which was later put on display.  Many still doubt whether the person the California Rangers decapitated was actually Murrieta or some other poor soul. Be that as it may, the memory of Murrieta is still much loved and respected by Mexican Americans today.

Apart from being gained by a handful of very lucky prospectors, a great deal of the wealth generated by the Gold Rush belonged to those who owned businesses that were relevant to gold mining. For example, Levi Strauss, a German Jew, invented denim pants for prospectors when he observed that normal pants could not withstand the strenuous activities of mining. Strauss eventually became a millionaire, and the Levi's brand still is recognized today.

== Mormonism ==

=== The Birth of the Latter Day Saints ===

One continuation of the Second Great Revival is seen in the birth of an American faith, '''Mormonism''', or The Church of God of the Latter Day Saints. Joseph Smith, a resident of New York State, said that he had found golden plates. The documents which he supposedly translated from these plates revealed what he said was a restoration of the faith which Jesus and the apostles had known, a new American-based order. In 1830 he organized what he designated The Church of Christ, or the Church of the Latter Day Saints. This body spread through conversion, its truth seen in its organization and its prosperity. It had several divergences from existing United States law, including the doctrine that men might have more than one wife. After Smith had been arrested in 1844 in Illinois, charged by civil officials with starting a riot and with treason, a crowd broke into the jail where he was being held and murdered him.

=== The Great Mormon Exodus ===

Yet the Latter Day Saints persevered. Smith's successor was another prophet, Brigham Young. Continued conflict between the U.S. Government, most signally the state of Illinois, and the Mormons led to the decision to leave the States and go to a less-settled place. The territory of Utah, obtained through the wars with Mexico, certainly counted as less-settled: a vast alkali desert, punctuated by grotesque mountains, and sparsely peopled by Spanish-speaking settlements and Indian tribes. 

The Mormons began sending out a few pioneers for the new territory as early as 1846. In the two decades afterward, while conversion and population growth further increased the Mormons, about 70,000 people made the trek through difficult conditions. In some cases the migrants walked on foot through hostile landscapes, carrying all their goods with them in handcarts they pulled themselves. 

When they reached Utah, they formed tightly-organized, top-down structures driven by doctrine and individual discipline. The settlers diverted mountain streams to their fields. In places which had been waste, they created fertile farms and productive vegetable gardens.

=== Continuing Skirmishes ===

Yet even in this new land, conflicts continued between Mormons and the U.S. government. In the spring of 1857, President James Buchanan appointed a non-Mormon, Alfred Cumming, as governor of the Utah Territory, replacing Brigham Young, and dispatched troops to enforce the order. The Mormons prepared to defend themselves and their property; Young declared martial law and issued an order on Sept. 15, 1857, forbidding the entry of U.S. troops into Utah. The order was disregarded, and throughout the winter sporadic raids were conducted by the Mormon militia against the encamped U.S. army. Buchanan dispatched (Apr., 1858) representatives to work out a settlement, and on June 26, the army entered Salt Lake City, Cumming was installed as governor, and peace was restored.

In 1890, the president of the Mormon Church, Wilford Woodruff, ruled that there would be no more plural marriages. Other distinctive practices which had become Church practice under Joseph Smith continued, including theocratic rule and declaration of people as gods. By 1896, when Utah became one of the United States, it was both Mormon and as American as Massachusetts or New York State.

== Public Schools and Education ==
The Board of Education in Massachusetts was established in 1837, making it the oldest state board in the United States. Its responsibilities were and are to interpret and implement laws for public education in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Public education in the Commonwealth was organized by the regulations adopted by the Board of Education, which were good faith interpretations of Massachusetts and federal law.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Education was also responsible for granting and renewing school applications, developing and implementing the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, submitting yearly budget proposals for public education to the Massachusetts General Court, setting standards for teachers, certifying teachers, principals, and superintendents, and monitoring achievements of districts in the Commonwealth.

There was a movement for reform in public education. The leader of this movement was Horace Mann, a Massachusetts lawyer and reformer. He supported free, tax-supported education to replace church schools and the private schools set up by untrained, young men. Mann proposed universal education, which would help Americanize immigrants. During Mann’s tenure as secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education from 1837 to 1848, Massachusetts led the common school movement brought training for teachers, lengthened school years and raised the teachers pay to attract people to that profession.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period education began being extended more and more to women. Early elementary schools had separate rooms for boy students and girl students. Now some elementary classes became co-educational, and women began to be hired as teachers. The first woman's college, Mt. Holyoke, was founded in South Hadley, Massachusetts. It was created by Mary Lyon, and intended as a liberal arts college.

==&quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;==

There was never much doubt that the settlers of Nebraska would, in the face of popular sovereignty, choose to bar slavery. Kansas, however, was another matter. Abolitionist and pro-slavery groups tried to rush settlers to Kansas in hopes of swinging the vote in the group's own direction. Eventually, both a free-state and a slave-state government were functioning in Kansas - both illegal.

Violence was abundant. In May 1856, a pro-slavery mob ransacked the chiefly abolitionist town of Lawrence, demolishing private property of the anti-slavery governor, burning printing presses, and destroying a hotel. Two days later, in retaliation, Abolitionist John Brown and his sons went to the pro-slavery town of Pottawatomie Creek and hacked five men to death in front of their families. This set off a guerilla war in Kansas that lasted through most of 1856.

Violence over the issue of Kansas was even seen in the Senate. Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner accused South Carolinian Andrew Butler of having &quot;chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows - Slavery.&quot; Upon hearing these words, Butler's nephew, Representative Preston Brooks, walked onto the Senate floor and proceeded to cane Sumner in the head. Sumner suffered so much damage from the attack that he could not return to the Senate for over three years. Brooks was expelled by the House. Cheered on by southern supporters (many of whom sent Brooks new canes, to show approval of his actions), came back after a resounding reelection.

After much controversy and extra legislation, Kansas found itself firmly abolitionist by 1858.

== Dred Scott v. Stanford - 1857 ==
'''Dred Scott''' was an African-American slave who first sued for his freedom in 1846. His case stated that he and his wife Harriet had been transported to both the state of Illinois and Minnesota territory. Laws in both places made slavery illegal. Dred and Harriet began with two separate cases, one for each of them. Slaves were not allowed legal marriage, but the two considered themselves married, and wanted to protect their two teenage daughters. As Dred became ill, the two merged their suit. At first it was the rule that state courts could decide if African-Americans in their jurisdictions were slave or free. After many years and much hesitation, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A People and A Nation&quot; eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of the slave master, citing precedent that found that neither Dred nor his wife could claim citizenship. As they were not  citizens, they did not have a claim in Federal Court. The majority argument cited the Missouri Compromise of 1854 to state that a temporary residence outside of Missouri did not immediately emancipate them, since the owner would be unfairly deprived of property.

==Ostend Manifesto==
Southern slave owners had a special interest in Spanish-held Cuba. Slavery existed on the island, but a recent rebellion in Haiti had spurred some Spanish officials to consider emancipation. The Southerners did not want freed slaves so close to their shores, and other observers thought Manifest Destiny should be extended to Cuba. In 1854 three American diplomats, Pierre Soulé (the minister to Spain), James Buchanan (the minister to Great Britain), and John Y. Mason (the minister to France), met in Ostend, Belgium. They held in common the same views as many Southern Democrats. The diplomats together issued a warning to Spain that it must sell Cuba to the United States or risk having it taken by force. This statement had not been authorized by the Franklin Pierce administration and was immediately repudiated. Reaction, both at home and abroad, was extremely negative.

== Women's History of the Period ==
=== Declaration of Sentiments ===
1848  marked the year of the Declaration of Sentiments; it was a document written as a plea for the end of discrimination against women in all spheres of Society. Main credit is given to Elizabeth Cady Stanton for writing the document. The document was presented at the first women's rights convention held at Seneca Falls, New York. Though the convention was attended by 300 women and men, only 100 of them actually signed the document which included; 68 women and 32 men.

=== Elizabeth Blackwell ===
In 1849 Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman to receive a medical degree. She attended Geneva College in New York and graduated on January 23, 1849. Even though she had her medical degree she was still banned from practicing in most hospitals. She then relocated to Paris, France and continued her training as a midwife instead of a physician. While in Paris she contracted an eye infection from a small baby that forced her to lose her right eye. It was replaced by a glass eye which ended her medical career.

=== Missouri v. Celia ===
This murder trial took place in Calloway County, Missouri beginning October 9, 1855. It involved a slave woman named Celia and her master Robert Newsome. After being purchased at the age of 14 in 1850 Celia bore two of her masters children.  Soon after becoming intimate with another slave while still being sought after by her master Celia became pregnant. On June 23, 1855, feeling unwell from the pregnancy, Celia pleaded with her master to let her rest; when Newsome ignored her pleas she struck him twice in the head with a heavy stick. She then spent the night burning his corpse in her fireplace and grinding the smaller bones into pieces with a rock. Although Missouri statutes forbade anyone &quot;to take any woman unlawfully against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be defiled,&quot; the judge residing over the case instructed the jury that Celia, being enslaved, did not fall within the meaning of &quot;any woman&quot; thus since the &quot;sexual abuser&quot; was her master the murder was not justified on the claim of self-defense. Celia was found guilty of the crime on October 10, 1855 and was sentenced to be hanged. The case still remains significant in history because it graphically illustrates the dreadful truth that enslaved women had absolutely no recourse when it came to being raped by their masters.

==Panic of 1857==

The Panic of 1857 introduced the United States, at least in a small way, to the intricate dealings of the worldwide economy. On the same day that the Central America wrecked, Cincinnati's Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company ceased operation thanks to embezzlement. News of the twin disasters spread quickly, in part because of the telegraph now becoming common. Investors, including British investors, began to withdraw money from Wall Street in massive numbers. Bank failures increased, mostly in the industrial Northeast and New England states, while the West and South, still more dependent on agriculture, seemed to weather the storm better. There were many underlying causes for the Panic of 1857, and by the time the twin disasters occurred the United States was well on its way into the economic downturn. For 3 years the Crimean War had involved European and Asian countries which increase foreign dependence on American agriculture. The return of the men and land to agricultural production meant an abundance of crops in 1857 which led to falling prices for farm goods. Land speculation, too, had become rampant throughout the United States. This led to an unsustainable expansion of the railroads. As investment money dried up, the land speculation collapsed, as did many of the railroads shortly thereafter. Attempts were made by the federal government to remedy the situation. A bank holiday was declared in October, 1857 and Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb recommended the government selling revenue bonds and reducing the tariff (Tariff of 1857). By 1859 the country was slowly pulling out of the downturn, but the effect lasted until the opening shots of the Civil War.

== Rebellion at Harper's Ferry, Virginia ==
=== John Brown ===
John Brown had been born in Connecticut on May 19, 1800. He grew up in Ohio, where his father worked as a tanner and a minister near Oberlin, Ohio. His father preached abolitionism, and John Brown learned from him. He married twice, his first wife dying while giving birth to their seventh child. He would ultimately father twenty children, eleven of them surviving to adulthood. He started several failed business ventures and land deals in Ohio and Massachusetts. For a while he settled in a community of both black and white settlers. He lived there peacefully until the mid-1850s. Then two of his sons who had moved to Kansas asked him for guns to defend themselves against Missouri Border Ruffians. After two failed defense efforts, Brown left the Kansas area to avoid prosecution for the Pottawatomie massacre. He was already gaining some mention in the press for his efforts. He moved back East and decided to  plan a way to destroy slavery in America forever.

=== Brown's Raid On Harper's Ferry ===
After the troubles in Kansas Brown decided on a plan. A lightly-defended armory in Harper's Ferry, Northern Virginia, contained 100,000 muskets and rifles. An attacker would need some monetary investment to obtain a battalion of men, a similar number of rifles, and a thousand pikes. With the weapons seized at the armory, Brown planned on arming sympathizers and slaves freed by his personal army as it swept through the South. Harper's Ferry had no plantations, and Brown expected no resistance from the local townspeople. On October 16, 1859, Brown carried out his raid, which he planned as the beginning of his revolution. However, instead of his battalion of 450 men, he went in with a group of twenty, including two of his sons. They easily overtook the single nightwatchman and killed several townspeople on the way in, including a free African American man who discovered their plot. Brown had also underestimated the resolve of the local townspeople, who formed a militia and surrounded Brown and his raiders in the armory. After a siege of two days, the U.S. Army sent in a detachment of Marines from Washington, D.C., the closest available contingent. The marines, led by Robert E. Lee, stormed the armory, and in a three minute battle ten of Brown's men were killed. Brown and six others were taken alive and imprisoned for a swift trial. Brown and five of his raiders were hung before the end of the year. Three others were killed in early 1860.

=== Public Reaction ===
News of the rebellion spread rapidly around the country by telegraph and newspaper, though opinions differed about what it meant. ''The Charleston Mercury'' of November seven, 1859, represents one Southern view: &quot;With five millions of negroes turned loose in the South, what would be the state of society? It would be worse than the 'Reign of Terror'. The day of compromise is passed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;reprinted at http://www.eastconn.org/tah/1011PJ1_RegionalReactionsJohnBrownRaidLesson.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction was most mixed and vigorous among those who called themselves Christians. Abraham Lincoln typified the response of many others when he said that, though Brown &quot;agreed with us in thinking slavery wrong,&quot; &quot;[t]hat cannot excuse violence, bloodshed, and treason.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, Abraham. Speech in ''The Illinois State Journal'' of December 12, 1859, &quot;in Leavenworth city on the 4th inst. as we find it in ''the Leavenworth Register.'' Basler, Roy P., editor; Marion Dolores Pratt and Lloyd A. Dunlap, assistant editors. Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln. New Brunswick, N.J: Rutgers University Press, 1953. Vol. 3, p. 502. http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln3/1:166?rgn=div1;view=fulltext&lt;/ref&gt; The Unitarian William Lloyd Garrison, already having swerved from his previously-held pacifism, on the day of Brown's death preached a sermon commemorating him. &quot;Whenever there is a contest between the oppressed and the oppressor, -– the weapons being equal between the parties, –- God knows that my heart must be with the oppressed, and always against the oppressor. Therefore, whenever commenced, I cannot but wish success to all slave insurrections.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted at http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/garrison.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregationalist Minister Henry Ward Beecher likewise supported Brown from the pulpit. In short, a faction of White people of faith both conservative and liberal began saying that only by violence could slavery be struck from America.

== Election of 1860 ==

The new-born Republican party supported Northern industry, as the Whigs had done. It also promised a tariff for the protection of industry and pledged the enactment of a law granting free homesteads to settlers who would help in the opening of the West. But by 1860, it had become the party of abolition. Many Republicans believed that Lincoln's election would prevent any further spread of slavery. It selected Abraham Lincoln of Illinois as its presidential candidate, and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine as its vice-presidential candidate. 

The Democratic party split in two. The main party or the Northern Democrats could not immediately decide on a candidate, and after several votes, their nominating convention was postponed when the Southern delegates walked out. When it eventually resumed, the party decided on Stephen Douglas of Illinois as its candidate. The first vice-presidential candidate, Benjamin Fitzpatrick, dropped his name from consideration once his home state of Alabama seceded from the Union. His replacement was Herschel Johnson of Georgia. The Southern delegates from the Democratic party selected their own candidate to run for president. John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky with Joseph Lane of Oregon as their vice-presidential candidate.

Former Whigs and Southern Republicans who supported the Union in the slavery issue formed the Constitutional Union party. Tennessee senator John Bell was chosen as the Constitutional Union party presidential candidate, over former Texas governor Sam Houston. Harvard President Edward Everett was chosen as the vice-presidential candidate.  

Abraham Lincoln won the election with only forty percent of the vote. But with the electorate split four ways, it led to a landslide victory in the Electoral College. Lincoln garnered 180 electoral votes without being listed on any of the ballots of any of the future secessionist states in the deep South (except for Virginia, where he received 1.1% of the vote). Stephen Douglas won just under 30% of the popular vote, but only carried 2 states for a total of 12 electoral votes. John Breckenridge carried every state in the deep South, Maryland, and Delaware, for a total of 72 electoral votes. Bell carried the border slave states of Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee, for a total of 39 electoral votes. Except for the split decision in the presidential election of 1824, no President in US History has won with a smaller percentage of the popular vote. 

Lincoln's election ensured South Carolina's secession, along with Southern belief that they now no longer had a political voice in Washington. Other Southern states followed suit. They claimed that they were no longer bound by the Union, because the Northern states had in effect broken a constitutional contract by not honoring the South's right to own slaves as property.

==Questions For Review==

1. What affect did proslavery sentiments have on the Mexican War?

2. Reconstruct Brown's raid in terms of what happened first, second, and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Electromagnets are used inside all sorts of devices. A very simple device is the electromagnet that is used in scrap yards to pick up cars. It can then drop them once the electric current is turned off. This page looks at some more complicated devices that use electromagnets.

==What are Electromagnets?==
Electromagnets are a type of magnet that you can make using a piece of iron, a wire (that you have to coil around the iron) and a battery.  You have to switch on the battery, which should be connected to the wire. The iron will attract other metals, just like a magnet.  If you leave the wire attached to the battery, it will begin to get hot. This will also work with a non magnetic core, but the electromagnet will be weaker. The more coils you have, the stronger the electromagnet will be.

You can use electromagnets for lots of things: loudspeakers, relays and circuit-breakers. They are also used in car scrap-yards to pick up magnetic waste (e.g. Old cars),cand with any form of magnetically recordable media: VCR tapes, computer hard drives, cassette tapes, and credit card stripes.

==How Do They Work?==
Every wire has a magnetic field around it, but this only happens if there is current flowing through it.  Every current produces a magnetic field. This effect is used in electromagnets.
The field which is produced by the electromagnet is similar to the field around a bar magnet. If it has no iron core it will still produce a field, only it won’t be so strong because the iron makes it stronger.
The iron core becomes magnetised when the current is switched on and it loses its magnetism when it is switched off. A steel core however, will always keep its magnetism.

==The electric bell==

===Step by Step Explanation===
Once the battery is connected a current flows in the wire loops around the U shaped soft iron core. 

This turns the core into an electromagnet.

The electromagnet attracts the armature which is also made of soft iron.

As the armature moves towards the electromagnet, it causes the hammer to strike the bell. At the same time it breaks the circuit at X.

The break in the circuit causes the current to stop flowing.

The soft iron core loses its magnetic field and releases the armature which springs back to its original position.

The contact screw touches the springy metal and completes the circuit. The whole cycle is repeated over and over until the battery is disconnected or runs down.

Hope you will find this information helpful!

==The Loud Speaker==

A speaker is made of a paper cone attached to a coil which acts as a small electromagnet. The coil is fitted over a permanent magnet, and as the current flows through the coil it is either attracted or repelled depending on which direction the current flows. A typical signal from an amplifier will be a varying current, and so the cone will vibrate back and forth at the same frequency as the current. As the cone vibrates, it sets up pressure waves in the air, which we hear as sound.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Causes of the Civil War ==

The immediate cause of the Civil War was the election of Abraham Lincoln. Four other and more fundamental causes include deep disagreement between advocates of slave ownership and abolitionists, the conflict between North and South over the rights of a state in the Union, social and economic differences between North and South, and whether it was constitutional to secede from the Union. &lt;ref&gt;http://americanhistory.about.com/od/civilwarmenu/a/cause_civil_war.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dixie's Constitution ==
By the end of March, 1861, the Confederacy had created a constitution and elected its first and only president, Jefferson Davis. The Constitution of the Confederate States of America was the supreme law of the Confederate States of America, as adopted on March 11, 1861 and in effect through the conclusion of the American Civil War. The Confederacy also operated under a Provisional Constitution from February 8, 1861 to March 11, 1861.

In regard to most articles of the Constitution, the document is a word-for-word duplicate of the United States Constitution. The original, hand-written document is currently located in the University of Georgia archives at Athens, Georgia. The major differences between the two constitutions was the Confederacy's greater emphasis on the rights of individual member states, and an explicit support of slavery.

== Fort Sumter and the Beginning of the War ==
Several federal forts were seized and converted to Confederate strongholds. By the time of Lincoln's inauguration only two major forts had not been taken. On April 11, Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard demanded that Union Major Robert Anderson surrender '''Fort Sumter''' in Charleston, South Carolina. Sumter had a strategic position on an island defending Charleston's harbor. The supplies of the besieged forts would only last a few weeks. The Union sent ships to resupply the fort, but they were held off by Confederate ships. Beauregard's troops surrounded the fort and opened fire. A tremendous cannon firefight remarkably claimed no casualties. By April 14, Anderson was forced to surrender the fort. The first casualties of the War occurred after the surrender: while the fort flag was being lowered, a Union cannon misfired. 

The next day, President Lincoln declared that the US faced a rebellion. Lincoln called up state militias and requested volunteers to enlist in the Army. In response to this call and to the surrender of Fort Sumter, four more states seceded; Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. The Civil War had begun.

Each side determined its strategies. The Confederate leadership felt that its army only needed to defend itself to gain independence. By its tactical strengths and its material shortages, it created what Jefferson Davis named an &quot;offensive defensive&quot; strategy. It would strengthen its defense posture, when conditions were right, by occasional offensive strikes into the North. However, three people who had important roles in Confederate plans had different strategies. While President Davis argued for a solely defensive war, General Robert E. Lee asserted they had to fight the Union head on, and General Thomas Jackson claimed they needed to invade the Union's important cities first and defeat the enemy to reclaim the cities. 

The strategy of aging Union General Winfield Scott became popularly known as the ''Anaconda Plan''. Named for the South American snake that strangles its victims to death, the plan aimed to defeat the Confederacy by surrounding it on all sides with a blockade of Southern ports and the swift capture of the Mississippi River.

== First Battle of Bull Run and the Early Stages of the War ==

Four slave states remained in the Union; Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. The four border states were all important, and Lincoln did not want them to join the Confederacy. Missouri controlled parts of the Mississippi River, Kentucky controlled the Ohio river, and Delaware was close to the important Pennsylvania city of Philadelphia. Perhaps the most important border state was Maryland. It was close to the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia, and the Union capital of Washington was located between pro-Confederate sections of Maryland and seceded Virginia. Lincoln knew he had to be cautious if he did not want these states to join the Confederacy. But after the Battle of Fort Sumter, all of these states except for Maryland joined the South. 

Both sides had strengths and weaknesses. The North had a greater population, more factories, more supplies, and more money than the South. The South had more experienced military leadership, better-trained armies, and the advantage of fighting on familiar territory. Robert E. Lee is an example of the leadership the South relied upon. Before the Civil War, President Lincoln asked him to lead the Union army. Even though Lee was himself against slavery, he followed the people of his home state of Virginia into succession.  

Support for secession and the war was not unanimous in the Confederacy, and all of the southern states provided substantial numbers of troops for the Union armies. Moreover, the presence of slavery acted as a drain of southern manpower, as adult males who might otherwise join the army were required to police the slaves. 

On July 21, 1861, the armies of General Beauregard and Union General Irvin McDowell met at Manassas, Virginia in the '''Battle of Bull Run'''. Here the North originally had the upper hand, but Confederate General Thomas Jackson and his troops blocked Northern progress. Jackson's men began to retreat but Jackson stayed, standing &quot;as a stone wall&quot; (he was hereafter nicknamed &quot;Stonewall Jackson&quot;). As Confederate reinforcements arrived, McDowell's army retreated in confusion and was totally defeated. Before this, the North had nurtured a hope of quick victory over the Confederacy. The loss killed that hope. Though the Confederates achieved victory, General Beauregard did not chase stragglers of the defeated Union Army. Angered by this, Davis replaced him with General Robert E. Lee. Northern general McDowell's defeat by Confederates caused his replacement by George McClellan.

Early Southern victories raised the complete defeat of the Union. The Confederacy appointed two representatives to the United Kingdom and France. Both traveled to Europe on a British ship, the ''RMS Trent''. A Union Captain, Charles Wilkes, seized the Trent and forced the Confederate representatives to board the Union ship. This seizure violated the neutrality of the United Kingdom. The British demanded apologies, and Lincoln eventually complied, even releasing the Confederate representatives. If he had failed to do so, the United Kingdom would have had an excuse to join with the Confederacy against the Union. Factories in the North of England depended upon Confederate cotton, and their neutrality was not assured.

==Technology==

The Civil War was affected by technological innovations that changed the nature of battle. The most lethal change was the introduction of rifling to muskets. In previous wars, the maximum effective range of a musket was between 70 to 110 meters. Muskets, which were smooth bore firearms, weren't accurate beyond that. Tactics involved moving masses of troops to musket range, firing a volley, and then charging the opposing force with the bayonet, which is a sword blade attached to a firearm. However, a bullet from an aimed rifled musket could hit a soldier more than 1300 meters away. This drastically improved any defense. Massed attacks were easier to stop from a longer distance. The standardization of the rifle during the revolutionary war was extended to these new armaments, and to other military supplies.

Some other key changes on land dealt with logistics -- the art of military supply -- and communications. By 1860, there were approximately 30,000 miles of railroad track, mostly in the Northern states. The railroads meant that supplies need not be obtained from local farms and cities, and that armies could operate for extended periods of time without fear of starvation. The advances in food preservation created during the Napoleonic Wars brought a wider variety of food to the soldier. In addition, armies could be moved across the country within days, without marching. Doctors could move to the wounded.  

The telegraph is the third of the key technologies that changed the nature of the war.  Washington City and Richmond, the capitals of the two opposing sides, could stay in touch with commanders in the field, passing on updated intelligence and orders. President Lincoln used the telegraph frequently, as did his chief general, Halleck, and field commanders such as Grant. 

At sea, the greatest innovation was the introduction of ironclad warships. In 1862, the Confederate Navy built the CSS ''Virginia'' on the half-burned hull of the USS Merrimack. This ship, with iron armor, was impervious to cannon fire that would drive off or sink a wooden ship. The Virginia sank the U.S. frigate ''Cumberland''. It might have broken the blockade of the Federal fleet if it had not been for the arrival of the ironclad USS ''Monitor'', built by Swedish-American John Ericsson. The two met in May 1862 off Hampton Roads, Virginia.  The battle was a draw, but this sufficed for the Union to continue its blockade of the Confederacy. The Virginia'had retreated into a bay where it could not be of much use, and the Confederacy later burned it to prevent Union capture.

The U.S. Civil War introduced the first American railroad artillery; a successful submarine; a &quot;snorkel&quot; breathing device; the periscope for trench warfare; field trenches, land-mine fields, and wire entanglements, as battles began to take place for days at a time; American use of flame throwers and naval torpedoes; aerial reconnaissance, using hot-air balloons and cameras, and antiaircraft fire; resultant camouflage and blackouts; repeating rifles; telescopic sights for rifles for the aid of snipers, fixed ammunition, and long-range rifles for general use; electronic exploding bombs and torpedoes; revolving gun turrets on boats; and a workable machine gun. As part of the organization of men and materiel, the Civil War introduced foreign social innovations such as incorporation of female and civilian support in the Northern Sanitation Fairs, an organized medical and nursing corps with bandages, opium, and other anesthetics, hospital ships, and an army ambulance corps. To supply newspapers and magazines, with their sophisticated new engraving devices, there arose a wide-range corps of press correspondents in war zones. New aids in communication included the bugle call, &quot;Taps,&quot; and other new calls, and the wigwag signal code in battle. To enable the federal prosecution of the war, the North inaugurated American conscription, legal voting for servicemen, The U.S. Secret Service, the income, withholding, and tobacco (cigarette) taxes, and the Medal of Honor. The Southern forces created a Confederate Department of Justice. The North created the first U.S. Navy admiral. Both sides commissioned Army Chaplains. The North commissioned African-American fighters, and its first African-American U.S. Army Officer, Major M.R. Delany.

== Shiloh and Ulysses Grant ==

While Union military efforts in the East were frustrated and even disastrous, the war west of the Appalachians developed differently, resulting in the first significant battlefield successes for the North. 

On the border between the Union and Confederacy, Kentucky was divided in its sentiments toward the two sides and attempted political neutrality. By the autumn of 1861, the Kentucky state government decided to support the Union, despite its being a slave state. Its indecision and the divided loyalties of its population directed the course of military operations in the West; neither North or South wished to alienate Kentucky.

Below the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers where the Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri borders come together, Union Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant, under command of Major General Henry W. Halleck, conducted a series of operations that would bring him national recognition. It was just across the Mississippi from Kentucky in Columbus, Missouri that Grant fought his first major battle.  

The western campaigns continued into 1862 under Halleck's overall direction with Grant continuing into Western Tennessee along the Mississippi. In February, Grant attacked and captured the Tennessean '''Fort Donelson''', providing a significant victory for the North. 

About two months after the victory at Fort Donelson, Grant fought an even more important battle at '''Shiloh'''. Confederate generals A. S. Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard made a surprise attack on the Union army. Though the initial attack was successful, the Union made a counter-attack and the Confederates were defeated.

After the Union took Fort Donelson, Grant wanted to push onto into Charleston and Memphis, perhaps gaining control of the Eastern railroad and supply line. But General Helleck vetoed their proposal.  

Grant's troops killed Confederate General Albert Johnston and defeated the Confederate troops, but at a steep price. Approximately thirteen thousand Union soldiers and eleven thousand Confederate soldiers died, and Grant lost a chance of capturing the West quickly.

== Peninsular Campaign ==

General Stonewall Jackson was nearing Washington. To prevent Jackson from invading, Union General George McClellan left over fifty thousand men in Washington. Yet Jackson's threat was deceptive, as he did not even have five thousand men in his army. McClellan's unnecessary fear forced him to wait over half a year before continuing the war in Virginia, allowing enough time for the Confederates to strengthen their position and earning him the nickname &quot;Tardy George. Jackson's deception had a further effect in '''the Peninsular Campaign''', the Union attempt to take the Confederate capital Richmond ''without'' the aid of the force remaining in Washington. (The Union strategy for a quick end to the war was capturing Richmond, which was close to Washington.)

In early April 1862, McClellan's troops began the Campaign, traveling over sea to the peninsula formed by the mouths of the York and James Rivers. This spit of land included Yorktown and Williamsburg and led straight to Richmond. By late May, McClellan was a few miles from Richmond, when Robert E. Lee took control of one of the Confederate Armies. After several victorious battles, it seemed as if McClellan could march to Richmond. But he refused to attack without reinforcements, which he saw as necessary to defeat Jackson's illusory troops. The forces he wanted were instead defending Washington. During the last week of June, Confederate General Robert E. Lee started '''the Seven Days' Battles''' that forced McClellan to retreat. By July, McClellan had lost over fifteen thousand men: there was little consolation in the fact that Lee had lost even more.

Other important skirmishes occurred in the course of the Peninsular Campaign. Flag Officer David Farragut of the Union Navy easily took control of the Mississippi River when he captured the key port of New Orleans in April, providing a key advantage to the Union and depriving the Confederacy of the river. The North raised a blockade around the ports of the South, cutting off dry goods such as shoes and vastly increasing inflation.&lt;ref&gt;MacPherson, 381.&lt;/ref&gt; (Although the Confederates produced raw materials, they did not have the industrial wherewithal to finish them -- for example, the cotton mills in the North and abroad -- or the railroads to fully distribute them.)

== Second Bull Run and Antietam ==

A new Union Army was organized at the same time under General John Pope. Pope attempted to join his army with McClellan's to combine their strengths. Stonewall Jackson headed this off by surrounding Pope's Army in Manassas, which the North called '''the Second Battle of Bull Run'''. Both sides fought on August 29, and the Confederates won against a much larger Union force.

Pope's battered Army did eventually combine with McClellan's. But the Second Battle of Bull Run had encouraged General Lee to invade Maryland. In Sharpsburg, Maryland, McClellan and Lee led their armies against each other. On September 17, 1862, '''the Battle of Antietam''' (named for a nearby creek) led to the deaths of over ten thousand soldiers from each side; no other one-day battle led to more deaths in one day. This day is called &quot;Bloodiest day of American History&quot;. McClellan's scouts had found Lee's battle plans with a discarded packet of cigars, but he did not act on the intelligence immediately. The Union technically won the Pyrrhic victory; McClellan lost about one-sixth of his Army, but Lee lost around one-third of his. Even though they could march and end the war, McClellan didn't go forward because he thought he's already lost too many soldiers. This was the victory needed for Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, so that it did not appear as an act of desperation.

== The Emancipation Proclamation ==
General McClellan seemed too defensive to Lincoln, who replaced McClellan with General Ambrose Burnside. Burnside decided to go on the offensive against Lee. In December 1862, at '''Fredricksburg''', Virginia, Burnside's Army of the Potomac assaulted built-up Confederate positions and suffered terrible casualties to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. The Federal superiority in numbers was matched by Lee's use of terrain and modern firepower. &quot;Burnside's Slaughter Pen&quot; resulted in over ten thousand Union casualties, as the North used Napoleonic tactics against the South's carbines. Burnside then again attempted to capture Richmond, but was foiled by winter weather. The &quot;Mud March&quot; forced the Army of the Potomac to return to winter quarters.

President Lincoln liked men who did not campaign on the abolition of slavery. He only intended to prevent slavery in all new states and territories. On the 22nd of August, 1862, Lincoln was coming to the decision that abolishing slavery might help the Union, in a letter from that time he wrote &quot;My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that.&quot;. Doing so would especially disrupt the Confederate economy. In September, 1862, after the Battle of Antietam, Lincoln and his Cabinet agreed to emancipate, or free, southern slaves. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued '''the Emancipation Proclamation''', which declared all slaves in rebel states &quot;forever free.&quot;
{{wikisource|The Emancipation Proclamation}}

The constitutional authority for the Emancipation Proclamation cannot be challenged. The Proclamation did not abolish slavery everywhere; it was restricted to states &quot;still in rebellion&quot; against the Union on the day it took effect. The Proclamation, technically, was part of a military strategy against states that had rebelled; this was to prevent internal conflict with the border states. Still, all the border states except Kentucky and Delaware had abolished slavery on their own. Naturally, the proclamation had no way of being enforced: the Executive in the form of military action was still trying to force the Confederacy to rejoin. Nonetheless, many slaves who had heard of the Proclamation escaped when Union forces approached.

The Proclamation had another profound effect on the war: it changed the objective from forcing the Confederacy to rejoin the Union to eliminating slavery throughout the United States. The South had been trying too woo Great Britain (which relied on the South's agricultural exports, especially cotton, for manufacturing) into an alliance; now all hopes for one were eliminated. Great Britain was firmly against the institution of slavery, and it had been illegal throughout the British Empire since 1833. In fact, some slaves freed via the Underground Railroad were taken to Britain, since it was safe from bounty hunters. (Canada was too close to the U.S. for some).

Although the Union did not at first accept black freedmen for combat, it hired them for other jobs. When troops became scarce, the Union began enlisting blacks. At the end of the war, the 180,000 enlisted blacks made up about 10% of the Union Army, and 29500 enlisted blacks to Navy. Until 1864, the South refused to recognize captured black soldiers as prisoners of war, and executed several of them at Fort Pillow as escaped slaves. Lincoln believed in the necessity of black soldiers: in August 1864, he said if the black soldiers of the Union army all joined the Confederacy, &quot;we would be compelled to abandon the war in three weeks.&quot;

== Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville ==

In 1863, Lincoln again changed leadership, replacing Burnside with General Joseph Hooker. Hooker had a reputation for aggressiveness; his nickname was &quot;Fighting Joe&quot;.  From May 1 to May 4, 1863, &lt;!--my book says 2-4, this used to say 1-3--&gt; near Chancellorsville, Virginia, General Lee, again outnumbered, used audacious tactics &amp;mdash; he divided his smaller force in two in the face of superior numbers, sending Stonewall Jackson to the Union's flank, and defeated Hooker. Again, the Confederacy won, but at a great cost. Shortly after the battle of Chancellorsville, Stonewall Jackson was accidentally shot by Confederate soldiers who didn't recognize him in the poor evening light, dying soon after.

== Vicksburg ==

The North already held New Orleans. If it could control the entire Mississippi River, it could divide the Confederacy in two, making Confederate transportation of weapons and troops more difficult. Vicksburg and Fort Hudson were major Confederate ports. General Scott's &quot;Anaconda Plan&quot; was based on gaining control of the Mississippi.   

The city of '''Vicksburg''', Mississippi, was located on high bluffs on the eastern bank of the river.  At the time, the Mississippi River went through a 180-degree U shaped bend by the city. (It has since shifted course westward and the bend no longer exists.) Guns batteries there prevented Federal steamboats from crossing. Vicksburg was also on one of the major railroads running east-west through the Confederacy. Vicksburg was therefore a key point under Confederate control.

Major General Ulysses Grant marched on land from Memphis, Tennessee, while General William Tecumseh Sherman and his troops traveled by water. Both intended to converge on Vicksburg. Both failed, at least for the time being. In December, 1862, Grant's supply line was disrupted, and Sherman had to attack alone.

Since Vicksburg had not fallen to a frontal assault, the Union forces made several attempts to bypass Vicksburg by building canals to divert the Mississippi River, but these failed. 

Grant decided to attack Vicksburg again in April. Instead of approaching from the north, as had been done before, his army approached Vicksburg from the south. Grant's Army of Tennessee crossed from the West bank to the East at Big Bluff on April 18, 1863. Then, in a series of battles, including '''Raymond''' and '''Champion's Hill''', defeated Southern forces coming to the relief of Confederate general Pemberton. Sherman and Grant together besieged Vicksburg. Two major assaults were repelled by the defenders of Vicksburg, including one in which a giant Union land mine was set off under the Confederate fortifications.

From May to July, Vicksburg remained in Confederate hands, but on July 3, 1863, one day before Independence Day, General Pemberton finally capitulated. Thirty thousand Confederates were taken prisoner, but released after taking an oath to not participate in fighting the United States unless properly exchanged (a practice called parole). 

This victory cut the Confederate States in two, accomplishing one of the Union total war goals. Confederate forces would not be able to draw on the food and horses previously supplied by Texas.

This victory was very important, giving the Union control of the whole Mississippi River and effectively splitting the Confederacy. Confederate forces were now deprived of food and supplies from Texas.

== Gettysburg ==

[[Image:Battle of Gettysburg.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''A Harvest of Death'': dead soldiers await burial following the Battle of Gettysburg. NARA, public domain.]]

At the same time as the opening of the Vicksburg Campaign, General Lee decided to march his troops into Pennsylvania. He had three reasons for doing this. He intended to win a major victory on Northern soil, increasing Southern morale, encouraging Northern peace activists sympathetic to the South (the &quot;Copperheads&quot;), and increasing the likelihood of political recognition by England and France. His hungry, poorly shod army could raid supplies from the North, reducing the burden on the Confederate economy. And he intended to encroach upon the Northern capital, forcing the recall of Federal troops from the Western Theater and easing some of the pressure on Vicksburg.

Keeping the Blue Ridge Mountains between him and the Federal army, Lee advanced up the Shenandoah Valley into West Virginia and Maryland before finally marching into South-Central Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the Union forces moved north on roads to Lee's east, without the latter's knowledge. His cavalry commander and chief scout, Jeb Stuart, had launched a raid eastward to &quot;ride around&quot; the Union army. On July first, 1863, Confederate Division Leader Henry Heth's soldiers ran into John Buford's Federal cavalry unit west of the city of '''Gettysburg'''. Buford's two brigades held their ground for several hours, until the arrival of the Union 1st Corps, and then withdrew through the town. The Confederates occupied Gettysburg, but by then the Union forces had formed a strong defensive line on the hills south of the town. 

For the next three days, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia faced the Union Army of the Potomac, now under the command of General George G. Meade, a Pennsylvanian who replaced Hooker, who had resigned as commander. (Hooker was given a corps command in the Army of the Cumberland, then in eastern Tennessee, where he performed satisfactorily for the remainder of the war.)

South of Gettysburg are high hills shaped like an inverted letter &quot;J&quot;.  At the end of the first day, the Union held this important high ground, partially because the Confederate left wing had dawdled moving into position. One July 2, Lee planned to attack up Emmitsburg Road from the south and west, hoping to force the Union troops to abandon the important hills and ridges. The attack went awry, and some Confederate forces, including Law's Alabama Brigade, attempted to force a gap in the Federal line between the two Round Tops, dominant heights at the extreme southern end of the Union's fish hook-shaped defensive line.  Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commander of the 20th Maine Regiment, anchored this gap.  He and the rest of his brigade, commanded by Colonel Strong Vincent, held the hill despite several hard-pressed attacks, including launching a bayonet charge when the regiment was low on ammunition. 

Meanwhile, north of the Round Tops, a small ridge immediately to the west of the Federal line drew the attention of Union General Daniel Sickles, a former New York congressman, who commanded the Third Corps.  He ordered his corps to advance to the peach-orchard crested ridge, which led to hard fighting around the &quot;Devil's Den,&quot; Wheatfield, and Peach Orchard. Sickles lost a leg in the fight.

On the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee decided to try a direct attack on the Union and &quot;virtually destroy their army.&quot; Putting Lieutenant General James Longstreet in charge of the three-division main assault, he wanted his men, including the division of Major General George Pickett, to march across a mile and a half up a gradual slope to the center of the Union line.  Lee promised artillery support, but any trained soldier who looked across those fields knew that they would be an open target for the Union soldiers--much the reverse of the situation six months before in Fredericksburg. However, the choice was either to attack or withdraw, and Lee was a naturally aggressive soldier.

By the end of the attack, half of Longstreet's force was dead, wounded or captured and the position was not taken. George Pickett never forgave Lee for &quot;slaughtering&quot; his men. Pickett's Charge, called the &quot;High Water Mark of the Confederacy,&quot; was practically the last hope of the Southern cause at Gettysburg. 

Lee withdrew across the Potomac River.  Meade did not pursue quickly, and Lee was able to reestablish himself in Virginia.  He offered to Confederate President Jefferson Davis to resign as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, saying, &quot;''Everything, therefore, points to the advantages to be derived from a new commander, and I the more anxiously urge the matter upon Your Excellency from my belief that a younger and abler man than myself can readily be attained.''&quot;  Davis did not relieve Lee; neither did Lincoln relieve Meade, though he wrote a letter of censure, saying &quot;''Again, my dear general, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within your easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely.''&quot;

The battle of Gettysburg lasted three days. Both sides lost nearly twenty-five thousand men each. After Gettysburg, the South remained on the defensive.'''''

On November 19, 1863 Lincoln delivered his most famous speech in the wake of this battle. '''The Gettysburg Address''' is often cited for its brevity (it followed a two-hour speech by Edward Everett) and its masterful rhetoric. As with other early Republican documents, it placed its justification in the Founding Fathers. Unlike them, it did not place the justification of emancipation in the Constitution, but in the Declaration of Independence: &quot;All men are created equal.&quot; 
{{wikisource|The Gettysburg Address}}

== Black Americans and the Civil War ==

The view of the Union towards blacks had changed during the previous two years.  At the beginning of hostilities, the war was seen as an effort to save the Union, not free slaves.  Several black slaves who reached Federal lines were returned to their owners. This stopped when Major General Benjamin F. Butler, a New Jersey lawyer and prominent member of the Democratic party, announced that slaves, being the property of persons in rebellion against the United States, would be seized as &quot;contraband of war&quot; and the Fugitive Slave Act could not apply.  &quot;Contrabands&quot; were, if not always welcome by white soldiers, not turned away.

However, as the struggle grew more intense, abolition became a more popular option.  Frederick Douglas, a former slave, urged that the war aim of the Union include the emancipation of slaves and the enlistment of black soldiers in the Union Army. This was done on a nationwide basis in 1863, though the state of Massachusetts had raised two regiments (the 54th and 55th Massachusetts) before this.

The 54th Massachusetts Regiment was the first black regiment recruited in the North. Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the 25 year old son of very wealthy abolitionist parents, was chosen to command. On May 28, the well equipped and drilled 54th paraded through the streets of Boston and then boarded ships bound for the coast of South Carolina. Their first conflict with Confederate soldiers came on July 16, when the regiment repelled an attack on James Island. But on July 18 came the supreme test of the courage and valor of the black soldiers; they were chosen to lead the assault on Battery Wagner, a Confederate fort on Morris Island at Charleston. In addressing his soldiers before leading them in charge across the beach, Colonel Shaw said, &quot;I want you to prove yourselves. The eyes of thousands will look on what you do tonight.&quot;

While some blacks choose to join the military fight others fought by other means.  An American teacher named Mary S. Peake worked to educate the freedmen and &quot;contraband&quot;. She spent her days under a large oak tree teaching others near Fort Monroe in Virginia. (This giant tree is now over 140 years old and called Emancipation Oak). Since Fort Monroe remained under Union control this area was some what of a safe location for refugees and runaways to come to.  Soon Mary began teaching in the Brown Cottage. This endeavor, sponsored by the American Missionary Association, became the basis from which Hampton University would spawn.  Mary's school would house around 50 children during the day and 20 adults at night.  This remarkable American died from tuberculosis on Washington's birthday in 1862.

Confederate President Jefferson Davis reacted to the raising of black regiments by passing General Order No. 111, which stated that captured black Federal soldiers would be returned into slavery (whether born free or not) and that white officers who led black soldiers would be tried for abetting servile rebellion.  The Confederate Congress codified this into law on May 1, 1863.  President Lincoln's order of July 30, 1863 responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is therefore ordered that for every soldier of the United States killed in violation of the laws of war, a rebel soldier shall be executed; and for every one enslaved by the enemy or sold into slavery, a rebel soldier shall be placed at hard labor on the public works and continued at such labor until the other shall be released and receive the treatment due to a prisoner of war. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eventually the Federal forces had several divisions' worth of black soldiers. Their treatment was not equal to white soldiers: at first, for example, black privates were paid $10 a month, the same as laborers, while white privates earned $13 a month. In addition, blacks could not be commissioned officers. The pay difference was settled retroactively in 1864.

The issue of black prisoners of war was a continual contention between the two sides.  In the early stages of the war, prisoners of war would be exchanged rank for rank.  However, the Confederates refused to exchange any black prisoner.  The Union response was to stop exchanging any prisoner of war.  The Confederate position changed to allowing blacks who were born free to be exchanged, and finally to exchange all soldiers, regardless of race.  By then, the Federal leadership understood that the scarcity of white Confederates capable of serving as soldiers was an advantage, and there were no mass exchanges of prisoners, black or white, until the Confederate collapse.

== Chickamauga and Chattanooga ==

In September 1863, Union Major General William Rosecrans decided to attempt the takeover of Chattanooga, a Confederate rail center in the eastern part of Tennessee.  Controlling Chattanooga would provide a base to attack Georgia.  The Confederates originally gave up Chattanooga, thinking that they could launch a devastating attack as the Union Army attempted to take control of it. Rosecrans did not, in the end, fall into such a trap.  However, on November 23, 1863, the Union and Confederate Armies met at Chickamauga Creek, south of Chattanooga, upon which a rail line passed into Georgia.

The battle of Chickamauga was a Confederate victory.  The Army of the Cumberland was forced to withdraw to Chattanooga, but Union General George Thomas, &quot;the Rock of Chickamauga,&quot; and his troops prevented total defeat by standing their ground.

After Rosecrans withdrew to Chattanooga, the Confederates under General Braxton Bragg decided to besiege the city. Rosecrans was relieved of command; Lincoln's comment was that he appeared &quot;stunned and confused, like a duck hit on the head.&quot;  Meanwhile, by great effort, the Federal forces kept a &quot;cracker line&quot; open to supply Chattanooga with food and forage.  Ulysses Grant replaced Rosecrans. 

Grant's forces began to attack on November 23, 1863.  On November 24 came the Battle of Lookout Mountain, an improbable victory in which Union soldiers, without the initiative of higher command, advanced up this mountain, which overlooks Chattanooga, and captured it.  One of the authors of this text had an ancestor in the Confederate forces there; his comment was when the battle started, he was on top of the hill throwing rocks at the Yankees, and when it was over, the Yankees were throwing rocks at him.

By the end of November, Grant and his troops had pushed the Confederates out of East Tennessee and begun operations in Georgia.

== Ulysses Grant As General-in-Chief ==

Lincoln recognized the great victories won by Ulysses Grant. In March, 1864, the President made Grant the general-in-chief of Union Forces, with the rank of Lieutenant General (a rank only previously held by George Washington). Grant decided on a campaign of continual pressure on all fronts, which would prevent Confederate forces from reinforcing each other.  

He went east and made his headquarters with General Meade's Army of the Potomac (although Grant never took direct command of this Army).  The Army of the Potomac's chief mission would be to whittle down the manpower of the Army of Northern Virginia, Lee's army. In May 1864, the two sides met in Virginia near site of the previous year's Battle of Chancellorsville.  The terrain was heavily wooded and movement to attack or reinforce was particularly difficult.  

During the Battle of the Wilderness, the Union lost eighteen thousand soldiers, while the Confederates lost eleven thousand. Nevertheless, the Union pushed on. The two Armies fought each other again at Spotsylvania Court House and at Cold Harbor.  In each case, the Union again lost large numbers of soldiers. Grant then hatched a plan to go ''around'' rather than through the Confederate Army in order to capture Richmond. At the last second, due to a hesitation by Major General &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith, the Army of Northern Virginia blocked the Union troops at Petersburg. Grant then decided to siege the city (and Lee's forces) and force it to surrender; if Lee could not move, he could not help other Confederate armies.  

The siege took almost one year.

== The Georgia Campaign and Total War ==

=== Battles for Atlanta ===
This victory had a significant effect on the election of 1864. Without it, there might have been more support for his Copperhead opponent General McClellan.

=== The March to the Sea ===

The ultimate Union strategy emerged with six parts: blockade the Confederate coastlines, preventing trade; free the slaves, destroying the domestic economy; disconnect the Upper South from the Deep South by controlling the Mississippi River; further split the Confederacy by attacking the Southeast coast (Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina), denying access to foreign supply; capture the capital of Richmond, which would severely incapacitate the Confederacy; and engage the enemy everywhere, weakening the army through attrition.

If Richmond had indeed been captured quickly and the war had ended within a few months, the Plantation system and slavery would probably not have changed significantly. Because the South was fighting predominately in its own territory, primarily rural farmland, its soldiers could take or force food and support from the people around them. After the unsuccessful Union attacks in Virginia, Lincoln began to think about the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Union changed its strategy from a quick capture of Richmond to the destruction of the South through ''total war''. In total war, an invading army destroys both military and non-combatant resources important to war. It can involve attacks on civilians or the destruction of civilian property. General William Sherman used total war in his '''March  to the Sea''' in November and December in 1864.  

Once Atlanta was taken, General Sherman and four army corps disconnected themselves from any railroad or telegraphic communications with the Union and headed through the state of Georgia. Their objective was Savannah, Georgia, a major seaport. Sherman's strategy was to inflict as much damage on the civilian population of Georgia as possible, short of killing people. To accomplish this, he issued orders to &quot;forage liberally on the country.&quot; Many of his soldiers saw this as a license to loot any food or valuable property they could. Sherman officially disapproved of this. 

Sherman's army carved a path of destruction 300 miles long and over 60 miles wide from Atlanta to the coastal city of Savannah. It destroyed public buildings and railroad tracks wherever it went. Troops heated railroad rails to white heat and twisted them around the trees, creating &quot;Sherman's neckties.&quot; Sherman's strategy separated his forces from the main body of the Union army, yet maintained the men with food and weapons. It not only aided his regiments without supply lines -- Southern destruction of supply lines had previously halted Northern advances -- but destroyed supply caches for Confederate forces in the area as well. But this destruction combined with Southern army raids to throw non-combatants into starvation.

The Confederate forces were unable to take on Sherman's forces. He reached the city of Savannah on December 24, 1864, and telegraphed President Lincoln &quot;I present to you the city of Savannah as a Christmas present.&quot;

=== Moving through the Carolinas ===

Sherman's forces then moved north into South Carolina, while faking an approach on Augusta, Georgia; the general's eventual goal was to coordinate his forces with those of General Grant in Virginia and entrap and destroy Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. The pattern of destruction by the Union soldiers continued, often with a more personal feeling of vengeance. A Federal soldier said to his comrades, &quot;Here is where treason began and, by God, here is where it will end!&quot;

On February 17, 1865, Sherman's forces reached Columbia, the capital of South Carolina. After a brief bombardment, the city surrendered. However, a large stock of whiskey was left behind as the Confederates retreated. Drunken soldiers broke discipline; convicts were let loose from the city jail, and somehow fires broke out, destroying much of the city.

== Hood's Invasion of Tennessee and the Battle of Nashville ==

=== Spring Hill ===
The battle of Spring Hill was fought on November 29, 1864, at Spring Hill, Tennessee.  The Confederates attacked the Union as it retreated from Columbia.  The Confederates were not able to inflict significant damage to the retreating Union force. So the Union Army was still able to make it safely north to Franklin during the night.  The following day the Confederates decided to follow the Union and attack a much more fortified group at the Battle of Franklin.  This did not prove to be a wise decision, as the Confederates suffered many casualties.

=== Franklin ===
The Battle of Franklin was fought on November 30, 1864 at Franklin, Tennessee.  This battle was a devastating loss for the Confederate Army.  It detrimentally shut down their leadership.  Fourteen Confederate Generals were extinguished with 6 killed, 7 wounded and 1 captured. 55 Regimental Commanders were casualties as well.  After this battle the Confederate Army in this area was effectively handicapped.

=== Nashville ===

In one of the decisive battles of the war, two brigades of black troops helped crush one of the Confederacy's finest armies at the Battle of Nashville on December 15-16, 1864.  Black troops opened the battle on the first day and successfully engaged the right of the rebel line.  On the second day Col. Charles R. Thompson's black brigade made a brilliant charge up Overton Hill.  The 13th US Colored Troops sustained more casualties than any other regiment involved in the battle.

=== Fort Pillow ===

The Battle of Fort Pillow was fought on was fought on April 12, 1864, at Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River at Henning, Tennessee.  The battle ended with a massacre of surrendered Union African-American troops under the direction of Confederate Brigadier General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

== The End of the Confederacy ==

=== The Siege of Petersburg ===
The Siege of Petersburg, also known as The Richmond Petersburg Campaign, began on June 15, 1864 with the intent by the Union Army to take control of Petersburg which was Virginia's second largest city and the supply center for the Confederate capital at Richmond. The campaign lasted 292 days and concluded with the occupation of Union forces on April 3, 1865. Thirty-two black infantry and cavalry regiments took part in the siege.

=== First Battle of Deep Bottom===
The First Battle of Deep Bottom is also known as Darbytown, Strawberry Plains, New Market Road, and Gravel Hill. It was part of The Siege of Petersburg, and was fought July 27-29, 1864, at Deep Bottom in Henrico County, Virginia.

=== The Crater ===
The Battle of the Crater was part of the Siege of Petersburg and took place on July 30, 1864. The battle took place between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the Union Army of Potomac. The battle was an unusual attempt by the Union to penetrate the Confederate defenses south of Petersburg, VA. The battle showed to be a Union disaster. The Union Army went into battle with 16,500 troops, under the direct command of Ulysses S. Grant; the Confederate Army was commanded by Robert E. Lee and entered battle with 9,500 troops. Pennsylvania miners in the Union general Ambrose E. Burnside's Ninth Corps, worked for several weeks digging a long tunnel, and packing it with explosives. The explosives were then detonated at 3:15 on the morning of July 30, 1864. Burnside originally wanted to send a fresh division of black troops against the breach, but his superiors, Ulysses S. Grant, ruled against it. The job, chosen by short straw, went to James H. Ledlie. Ledlie watched from behind the lines as his white soldiers, rather than go around, pile into the deep crater, which was 170 feet long, 60 feet across, and 30 feet deep. They were not able to escape making the Union soldiers easy targets for the Confederates. The battle was marked by the cruel treatment of black soldiers who took part in the fight, most of them were captured and murdered. The battle ended with a confederate victory. The Confederacy took out 3,798 Union soldiers, while the Union were only able to defeat 1,491 Confederate soldiers. The United States Colored Troops suffered the most with their casualties being 1,327 which would include 450 men being captured.

===Second Deep Bottom===
The Second Battle of Deep Bottom was fought August 14-20, 1864, at Deep Bottom in Henrico County, Virginia; it was part of the Siege of Petersburg. The battle is also known as Fussell's Mill, Kingsland Creek, White's Tavern, Bailey's Creeks, and Charles City Road. General Winfield Scott Hancock came across the James River at Deep Bottom where he would threaten Richmond, Virginia. This would also cause the Confederates to leave Peterburgs, Virginia and the trenches and Shenandoah Valley.

=== Retreat from Richmond ===

== Appomattox ==

Sherman did not stop in Georgia. As he marched North, he burnt several towns in South Carolina, including Columbia, the capital. (Sherman's troops felt more anger towards South Carolina, the first state to secede and in their eyes responsible for the war.) In March 1865, Lincoln, Sherman, and Grant all met outside Petersburg. Lincoln called for a quick end to the Civil War. Union General Sheridan said to Lincoln, &quot;If the thing be pressed I think Lee will surrender.&quot; Lincoln responded, &quot;Let the thing be pressed.&quot;

On April 2, 1865, the Confederate lines of Petersburg, Richmond's defense, which had been extended steadily to the west for 9 months, broke.  General Lee informed President Davis he could no longer hold the lines; the Confederate government then evacuated Richmond.  Lee pulled his forces out of the lines and moved west; Federal forces chased Lee's forces, annihilated a Confederate rear guard defense, and finally trapped the Army of Northern Virginia.  General Lee requested terms.  The two senior Army officers met each other near Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia on April 9th,1865. The men met at the home of Wilmer McLean. The gathering lasted about two and half hours. Grant offered extremely generous terms, requiring only that Lee's troops surrender and swear not to bear arms till the end of the War. This meeting helped to nearly end the bloodiest war in American history.

General Sherman met with Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston to discuss the surrender of Confederate troops in the South. Sherman initially allowed even more generous terms than Grant. However, the Secretary of War refused to accept the terms because of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by the Confederate John Wilkes Booth. By killing Lincoln at Ford's Theater, Booth made things worse for the Confederacy. Sherman was forced to offer harsher terms of surrender than he originally proposed, and General Johnston surrendered on April 26 under the Appomattox terms. All Confederate armies had surrendered by the end of May, ending the Civil War.

==Besides the Fighting==

Not all the important events of the Civil War took place on the battlefield.

As far back as the 1850s Whig interests had introduced three bills to Congress: a homestead act, a Pacific railroad act, and grants to establish agricultural and technical colleges.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, James M. ''Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era.'' The Oxford History of the United States, Vol VI. C. Vann Woodward, General Editor. New York: Oxford University Press, 1988. p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; These measures were seen as remedies for the depression of 1857. Southern interests had vetoed all of them. Now Republicans took advantage of a legislature free of slave interests. 

On May 20, 1862, the United States Congress passed the Homestead Act. Now any adult American citizen, or a person intending to become an American citizen, who was the head of a household, could qualify for a grant of 160 acres (67 hectares) of land by paying a small fee and living on the land continuously for 5 years.  If a person was willing to pay $1.25 an acre, the time of occupation dwindled to six months.

The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 enabled the United States Government to make a direct grant of land to railway companies for a transcontinental railroad, as well as a payment of $48,000 for every mile of track completed and lower-than-prime rate loans for any railway company who would build such a railway. The Central Pacific and the Union Pacific began to construct lines.  The two railways finally met 4 years after the war, in Promontory Point, Utah, in 1869.

The third major bill of these three, which established a land-grant university, is discussed below.

The federal government started a draft lottery in July, 1863. Men could avoid the draft by paying $300, or hiring another man to take their place. This caused resentment amongst the lower classes as they could not afford to dodge the draft.  On Monday, July 13, 1863, between 6 and 7 A.M., the Civil War Draft Riots began in New York City. Rioters attacked the Draft offices, the Bull's Head Hotel on 44th Street, and more upscale residences near 5th Avenue.  They lynched black men, burned down the Colored Orphan Asylum on 5th Avenue between 43rd and 44th Streets, and forced hundreds of blacks out of the city. Members of the 7th New York Infantry and 71st New York Infantry subdued the riot.

While Lincoln proved to be instrumental in the emancipation of blacks, the Native Americans were not so lucky. Lincoln was responsible for the largest mass hanging in United States history. Thirty-eight Native Americans from the Santee Sioux tribe were hung on December 26, 1862. The US government failed to honor its treaties with the Indian Nations. They were suppose to supply the Indians with money and food for signing a treaty to turn over more than one million acres of land. Instead the agents kept the money and sold the food that was suppose to go the Indians to the white settlers. The food that was given to the Indians was spoiled and unfit for human consumption. Subsequently, the Indians went off the reservation in hunting parties to try to find suitable food. One of the Indian hunting groups took some eggs from a white settlers land and that caused this extreme government action. Authorities in Minnesota asked President Lincoln to order the execution of all 303 Indian males. However, Lincoln was afraid of how Europe would react so he tried to compromise. They would only execute those who were in the group. Lincoln also agreed to kill or remove every Indian from the state and provide Minnesota with 2 million dollars in federal funds. Ironically, he owed the Sioux only 1.4 million dollars for the land.  

On April 22, 1864 the U.S. Congress passes the Coinage Act of 1864 which mandates that the inscription &quot;In God We Trust&quot; be placed on all coins minted as United States currency.

Dr. Rebecca Lee Crumpler becomes the first black woman to receive a medical degree.

==Education==
In the Morrill Act of 1862, the government granted land to Union states to sell for funding educational institutions. This excluded the states which had seceded from the Union. The schools would teach military tactics, agriculture, and engineering. This answered the Republican campaign promise of 1860. These &quot;Land Grant Universities&quot; were proposed to spread small farm prosperity, as opposed to the large, inherited plantations, and to increase industrial innovations across a wider area.

In the 1860s, most schools were small, multiple grades were taught in one classroom at one time. Paper was expensive, and the more prosperous schools had students write their problems on individual student slates. Memorization was a common means of learning, and student knowledge was measured by oral recitation. Teachers often punished &quot;bad children&quot; with the dunce cap, a rap on a palm with a ruler, hitting or spanking, or even striking a child with a rod or a whip. Corporal punishment was seen as simply one way of enforcing obedience. Teacher and parent both generally agreed that obedience was the trait of good children.  

Farming was still a major form of employment in America. It had been so since the first ''semester'', the time when students were allowed to be in school because the crops had been sown. Students worked in the fields during harvest time, and most left school for good to work on a farm. Abraham Lincoln himself, as a youth on the frontier, had had little schooling. Yet despite these brief periods of education, the reading levels were actually quite high. By the fifth grade students were sometimes reading books that we would consider college level, and Latin was still a part of many curricula. 

Academies during this time provided education for children between the ages of thirteen and twenty. These academies offered an array of classes. Most of the academies kept the boys and girls separate. There were also ''seminaries'', or private schools, which might cater to boys or girls. Girl's schools varied widely. Emily Dickinson's school, Amherst Academy, taught  Mental Philosophy, Geology, Latin, and Botany.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org/amherst_academy&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools left girls idle, with not even what we would call physical education. Others taught non-intellectual, &quot;feminine&quot; skills such as deportment, needle craft, and perhaps arts and crafts. The Home Economics movement, inaugurated by Catherine Beecher, advocated teaching homemaking skills in school. It also promoted female physical education. In contrast, feminists such as Susan B. Anthony and Emma Willard, and reformers such as Jane Addams and Mary McLeod Bethune, wanted to expand women's education into the plane of men. These women helped establish the higher education institutions where women were able to take classes not otherwise offered to them. The first co-educational college was Oberlin College, established in 1833. The first all-women's college was Vassar College in 1861.

==Questions For Review==

1. What are the four principal causes of the Civil War?

2. Why did Sherman feel compelled to adopt the total war strategy in his March to the Sea? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this strategy?

3. The Morrill Act of 1862, the Homestead Act of 1862, and the Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 and 1864: why did slave-holding Southern interests oppose their predecessors? What effect did they have?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Congress passed the first Reconstruction Act on 2nd March, 1867. The South was now divided into five military districts, each under a major general. New elections were to be held in each state with freed male slaves being allowed to vote. The act also included an amendment that offered readmission to the Southern states after they had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and guaranteed adult male suffrage. President Andrew Johnson immediately vetoed the bill but Congress re-passed the bill the same day. 

Andrew Johnson consulted General Ulysses S. Grant before selecting the generals to administer the military districts. Eventually he appointed John Schofield (Virginia), Daniel Sickles (the Carolinas), John Pope (Georgia, Alabama and Florida), Edward Ord (Arkansas and Mississippi) and Philip Sheridan (Louisiana and Texas). 

During the American Civil War, in which the nation decided how to handle the return of the seceded states and the status of the Freedmen (the newly freed slaves). Most scholars have accepted 1865-1877 as the boundaries for Reconstruction. 

The era itself was controversial and pitted various segments of American society against one another. Differing conceptions on how to restore the former Confederate States into the Union collided with diverse opinions concerning the status of African-Americans. 

The meaning of freedom itself was at stake in this crucial time period. The nascent Republican Party was divided between the mainstream which wanted a modicum of protection for blacks, and the Radicals, who wanted a thorough reorganization of Southern society. Conservative elements of this time period (in particular the Democrats) believed that the old order that governed relations between the states and between blacks and whites should remain intact. 

The bulk of African-Americans desired equal civil and political rights, protection of their person, and in many cases a redistribution of land and the break-up of the plantation system. These diverse perspectives enabled the period from 1865 to 1877 to be, in many ways, a grand experiment in interracial democracy, but the period was also dominated by tense political relations and a preponderant violence across the South.

==Definition==
Reconstruction, in United States history, refers both to the period after the Civil War when 
the states of the breakaway Confederate States of America were reintegrated into the United States of America, and to the process by which this was accomplished.

For victory in the American Civil War to be achieved, Northern moderate Republicans and Radical Republicans concurred that the Confederacy and its system of slavery had to be destroyed, and the possibility of either being revived had to be eliminated. Controversy focused on how to achieve those goals, and who would decide when they were achieved. The Radical Republicans held that reaching those goals was essential to the destruction of the Slave Power, and necessary to guaranteeing perpetual unity of the states, as well as a solution to the many problems of Freedmen.

United States Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, a Radical Republican, held that Congress should abolish slavery along with the Confederacy, extend civil and political rights to blacks, and educate black and white students together.

The &quot;moderates&quot; claimed early success in achieving the goals by assurances that the former Confederates had renounced secession and abolished slavery. Most moderates, like Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, wanted suffrage for black army veterans but not other African Americans. Southern political leaders renounced secession and gave up slavery, but were angered in 1867 when their state governments were ousted by federal military forces, and replaced by Radical Republican governments made up of Freedmen, Carpetbaggers and Scalawags.

Their primary instrument was the Black Codes (1865). These restricted the rights of Blacks and limited economic and educational opportunities. For example, there was very little, if any, employment available in the south. The Yankees may have won the war to end slavery, however the reconstruction did not benefit the African Americans who searched for employment.

== The Problem of Reconstruction ==

Reconstruction was the effort of rebuilding the South based on free labor instead of slave labor.  The issue to Northern politicians was how it would be done.  At the end of the Civil War, Congress proposed the Thirteenth Amendment, which sought to prohibit slavery. A state was not to gain re-admittance into the Union until it ratified the Amendment, but some states such as Mississippi were admitted despite failing to ratify. The Amendment became a part of the Constitution in December 6,1865.

During this time many Northerners moved to the South to start new lives. Sometimes carrying their belongings in briefcases made of carpet, they were known by Confederate Southerners as &quot;carpetbaggers.&quot; Confederate Southerners also had a derogatory name for southern whites who sided with the Republicans. They called them scalawags. The period just after the war also saw the rise of black codes, which restricted the basic human rights of freed slaves.Some of the more common codes seen were: race was dependent on blood, which meant if you had any amount of black blood in your body, you were considered black, freedmen could not get together unless accompanied by a white person, public restrooms and other facilities were segregated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h411.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

This time in history was really volatile.  Many racially motivated riots broke out all over the country.  The hostilities the south held toward the north and the African Americans grew stronger and stronger.
===Ku Klux Klan===
[[Image:Mississippi_ku_klux.jpg|thumb|KKK in Mississippi]]
Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is the name of several past and present organizations in the United States that have advocated white supremacy, anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, racism, homophobia, anti-Communism and nativism. These organizations have often used terrorism, violence, and acts of intimidation, such as cross burning and lynching, to oppress African Americans and other social or ethnic groups.

The first branch of the Ku Klux Klan was established in Pulaski, Tennessee, in May, 1866. A year later, a general organization of local Klans was established in Nashville in April, 1867. Most of the leaders were former members of the Confederate Army and the first Grand Wizard was Nathan Forrest, an outstanding general during the American Civil War. During the next two years Klansmen wearing masks, white cardboard hats and draped in white sheets, tortured and killed black Americans and sympathetic whites. Immigrants, who they blamed for the election of Radical Republicans, were also targets of their hatred. Between 1868 and 1870, the Ku Klux Klan played an important role in restoring white rule in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. 

The Klan's first incarnation was in 1866. Founded by veterans of the Confederate Army, its main purpose was to resist Reconstruction. It focused as much on intimidating &quot;carpetbaggers&quot; and &quot;scalawags&quot; as on putting down the freed slaves. The KKK quickly adopted violent methods. A rapid reaction set in. The Klan's leadership disowned violence as Southern elites saw the Klan as an excuse for federal troops to continue their activities in the South. The organization declined from 1868 to 1870 and was destroyed in the early 1870s by President Ulysses S. Grant's vigorous action under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 (also known as the Ku Klux Klan Act).

At the end of the American Civil War, members of Congress attempted to destroy the white power structure of the Rebel states. The Freeman’s Bureau was established by Congress on March 3rd, 1865. The bureau was designed to protect the interests of former slaves. This included helping them to find new employment and to improve educational and health facilities. In the year that followed, the bureau spent $17,000,000 establishing 4,000 schools, 100 hospitals and providing homes and food for former slaves.

Violence against African Americans started on the first days of Reconstruction and became more organized significant after 1867. Members of The Klan looked to frustrate Reconstruction. They also, tried to keep freedom in subjection. Terrorism dominated some counties and regions so, nighttime harassment, whippings, beatings, rapes, and murders became more common. The Klan's main purpose was political, even though, they tormented blacks who stood up for their rights. Active Republicans were the target of lawless night riders. When freedmen that worked for a South Carolina scalawag started to vote, terrorists went to the plantation and, in the words of a victim, &quot;whipped every ... [black] man they could lay their hands on.&quot;

== Lincoln and Reconstruction ==
Lincoln firmly believed that the southern states had never actually seceded, because, constitutionally, they cannot. He hoped that the 11 states that seceded could be &quot;readmitted&quot; by meeting some tests of political loyalty. Lincoln began thinking about re-admittance early on. In his Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which was issued in 1863, Lincoln established a simple process, hoping that Unionists would rise to political power rather than secessionalists. This plan would have granted presidential pardons to all southerners (save the political leaders at the time) who took an oath of future allegiance to the Union. Under Lincoln's plan, a state could be established as legitimate as soon as 10 percent of the voting population in the 1860 general election took this oath and a government was set up accepting the emancipation of the slaves.

Rejecting Lincoln's Presidential reconstruction plan, radical Republicans in congress arguing that it was too lenient, passed the Wade-Davis bill in 1864, which proposed far more demanding terms. It required 50 percent of the voters to take the loyalty oath and allowed only those who could swear that they had never supported the confederacy to run for office or hold federal employment. Lincoln rejected this plan and pocket-vetoed the bill. In March 1865, Congress created a new agency, the Freedman's Bureau. This agency provided food, shelter, medical aid, help to find employment, education, and other needs for blacks and poor whites.  The Freedman's Bureau was the largest scale federal aid relief plan at this time.  It was the first large scale governmental welfare program.

In 1864, his Vice Presidential running mate was the only Southern Senator to remain loyal to the Union - Andrew Johnson from Tennessee. After Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, and Johnson became President, the latter proved to be an obstacle to the Radical Republicans in Congress, who attempted to completely overhaul the Southern government and economy, which would have caused further tensions.

In May, 1865, Johnson made his own proclamation, one that was very similar to Lincoln's.  Offering amnesty to almost all Confederates who took an oath of allegiance to the Union, Johnson also reversed General Sherman's decision to set aside land for the express use of freed slaves. Not long after Johnson took office, all of the ex-Confederate states were able to be readmitted under President Johnson's plan.  In 1866, Johnson vetoed two important bills, one that bolstered the protection that the Freedmen's Bureau gave to blacks and a civil rights bill that gave full citizenship to blacks.

After realizing that if all of the Republicans, moderate and radical alike, united, they could overcome Johnson's vetoes, they soon passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Fourteenth Amendment.  This amendment declared citizenship for all persons born in the United States and required the states to respect the rights of all US citizens. The Civil Rights Act outlawed the black codes that had been prevalent throughout the South.

Over Johnson's vetoes, Congress passed three Reconstruction acts in 1867. They divided the southern states into five military districts under the control of the Union army.  The military commander in charge of each district was to ensure that the state fulfilled the requirements of Reconstruction by ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment and by providing voting rights without a race qualification. Tennessee was not included in the districts because it had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866 and was quickly readmitted to the Union.

In 1868, the House of Representatives impeached Andrew Johnson. Earlier, Congress had passed the Tenure of Office Act (over Johnson's veto), which required the President to dismiss officers only with the advice and consent of the Senate if he appointed them with the same advice and consent. Johnson believed that the Act was unconstitutional (and the Supreme Court, years after his Presidency, agreed in 1926), and intentionally violated it, to &quot;test the waters.&quot; Radical Republicans used this violation as an excuse to impeach Johnson, who was acquitted by one vote in the Senate.

In the election of 1868, Ulysses Grant was nominated for the Republican ticket and won on an incredibly small margin. Republicans noticed that if they did not act swiftly to protect the voting rights of blacks, they might soon lose a majority.  Thus, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment in 1869, which enforced that the suffrage of male citizens shall not be denied on account of race. This was a major blow to the women's movement, as it was the first time gender was deliberately placed into the Constitution. Republicans claimed that if the amendment had included both race and gender discrimination clauses, it would have never had a chance to pass in Congress.

=== African-Americans in Congress ===
A number of African-Americans were elected for the first time in American history during this period.  With the Reconstruction Acts sending federal troops in the southern states where African-Americans held majorities in South Carolina and Mississippi, and nearly equal numbers with whites in Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, Blacks were elected to Congress from these states.

John Willis Menard was elected in the 2nd District of Louisiana in 1868.  His challenger, 
Caleb Hunt, filed an objection with the election result and the House of Representatives, upon hearing arguments from both candidates, decided to seat neither of them.

Hiram Revels was elected by the Mississippi Senate by an 81-15 margin to finish the term of Mississippi Senator Albert G. Brown, who vacated the seat during the Civil War.  Revels served from February 23, 1870 to March 3, 1871.

Joseph Rainey was elected to the US House of Representatives from South Carolina's 1st District in the elections of 1870.  He was the longest serving African-American member of congress prior to William L. Dawson in the 1950's.

Blanche Bruce was elected to serve a full term in the US Senate by the Mississippi state senate in 1871.  Bruce was the only former slave to ever serve in the US Senate.

== The Panic of 1873 ==

The Panic of 1873 was the first depression experienced by America and Europe following the Civil War.  The depression was a result of the fall for an international demand for silver.  Germany stopped using the silver standard after the Franco-Prussia war.  The United States enacted the Coinage Act of 1873 which shifted the backing of our monetary system with gold and silver to just gold.  The act immediately depreciated the value of silver and hurt western mining operations.  Another factor that influenced the Panic of 1873 was the risky over investment into railroad companies that would not bring quick returns.  The Jay Cook and Company was a United States bank that declared bankruptcy on September 18, 1873.  The bank went under as a result of over investment in the railroad business.  As a result, the New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days starting September 20, 1873.  89 of 364 railroad companies failed during the depression.  Real estate values, wages, and profits by corporations decreased over the course of the panic.  Thousands of businesses fell during the depression as well. The depression was a major highlight in President Grant's second term.

== The Great Railroad Strike of 1877 ==
The strike started on July 14, 1877 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  The strike was caused by wage cuts from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.  The workers refused to let the railroad operate.  State militia was sent in to quell the strike but would not fire upon the strikers.  Governor Henry Mathews called upon federal troops to put down the strike and resume operations of the railroad.  The strike spread to Cumberland, Maryland.  Troops in Maryland fired upon the mob of strikers and killed ten rioters.  The strike occurred in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and even spread to St. Louis.  The strikes resulted in millions of dollars of property damage the casualties of many.  The great strike lasted 45 days, after finally being put down by federal troops from city to city.

== Republicans fall from power ==

Grant's presidency would bring about the decline of the Republican Party. He appointed a great number of corrupt officials to federal positions and to his cabinet. Many split with the party over that issue. Others grew tired of Reconstruction and proposed reconciliation with the South in a peaceful manner. These people called themselves Liberal Republicans, and nominated Horace Greeley to run against Grant in 1872. The Democrats also endorsed Greeley. Despite wide support, Grant won the election of 1872 decisively.

During the election season, Liberal Republicans were busy pushing the Amnesty Act through Congress, and in May 1872, it passed. The Amnesty Act pardoned most former Confederate citizens, and allowed them to run for office. The act restored the rights to the Democratic majorities in the South. Soon, Democrats had control of the Virginia and North Carolina governments. In states with black Republican majorities, the Ku Klux Klan (formed after the civil war as a white supremacist group) terrorized Republicans and forced them to vote Democratic or not at all. By 1876, Republicans controlled only three states in the South: Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina-- all of which were still occupied by Union troops.

Republicans continued to decline during Grant's second term, after many high level political scandals came to light. Most shocking to the public was that a scandal involved the Vice President, and another involved the Secretary of War. The Northern population's confidence in the party was shaken even more when the nation slipped into a Depression that same year.

In the congressional elections of 1874, Republicans would suffer huge losses in both houses, and for the first time since before the start of the Civil War, Democrats were able to gain control of a part of Congress (the House). Congress no longer was able to be committed strongly to Reconstruction.

In the election of 1876, Democrats nominated New York governor S.J. Tilden to run, and the Republicans nominated Ohio governor Rutherford B. Hayes. On election day, it seemed that Tilden would win by more than 250,000 votes. But the seven, four, and eight electoral votes from South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, respectively, were disputed (Northern troops still occupied these states). Also, one of Oregon's three electoral votes was disputed. If Hayes won all 20 votes, he would win the election. Congress created a special commission of seven Democrats, seven Republicans, and one independent to review the election and decide a winner. But the independent resigned, and a Republican was appointed to take his place. The commission voted along party lines to award Hayes the election, but Democrats warned that they would fight the decision. 
[[Image:A certificate for the electoral vote for Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler for the State of Louisiana dated 1876 part 6.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The certificate for the electoral vote for Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler for the State of Louisiana]]
Republican and Democratic leaders secretly met up to draw up a compromise, and the result of the meeting was the Compromise of 1877. Proclaiming that Hayes would win the election, troops left the South and more aid was given to the South; it marked the end of Reconstruction. Ultimately, Reconstruction and the Compromise itself would be failures, as Democrats refused to hold up their end of the compromise, which was to protect the rights of African Americans in the South.

The period after Reconstruction saw the rise of the Democratic &quot;Redeemers&quot; in the South. The Redeemers vowed to take back the South from Republican rule, which had been ousted after the 1876 election. They passed Jim Crow laws, which segregated blacks and whites, and put voting restrictions on blacks that wouldn't be outlawed until the next century. Jim Crow laws were challenged in ''Plessy v. Ferguson'', when the Supreme Court voted to uphold the laws if and only if segregated facilities remained &quot;separate but equal.&quot;
==Sinmiyangyo==
The United States expedition to Korea in 1871, also known as '''Sinmiyangyo''' (Western Disturbance of the Year Sinmi year) was the first American military action in Korea. It took place predominantly on and around the Korean island of Ganghwa. America sent a military expeditionary force to Korea to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea, to ascertain the fate of the General Sherman merchant ship, and to establish a treaty assuring aid for shipwrecked sailors. The isolationist Joseon Dynasty government and the assertive Americans led to a misunderstanding between the two parties that changed a diplomatic expedition into an armed conflict. The United States won a minor military victory, but the Koreans refused to open up the country to them. As the U.S. forces in Korea did not have the authority or strength to press the issue, the United States failed to secure their diplomatic objectives.

== Religion During the 19th Century ==

=== The New Wave of Jewish Immigration ===

Between the years of 1820 and 1880, about 250,000 Jews came to the U.S. The immigration was not only based in a troubled European economy but also in the 1848 failure of liberal revolutions in the German states.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Amy. ''Jewish Americans''. Milwaukee, Wisconsin: World Almanac Library, 2007. Pp. 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Railways and the great steamer ships opened up immigration to America in the later 1800s and early 1900s. Yet the trip was dirty, uncomfortable, and dangerous. While prosperous families in upper-class compartments had private cabins, most of the immigrants went across in steerage class: three hundred tightly-packed men, women and children, sleeping on double- or even triple-bunk beds. The beds were about six feet long and two feet wide, with only two-and-a-half feet separating each bunk. Their goods, such as they were, rested on the bunk. The people had little or no running water, the stench was incredible, and there was little recourse against vermin. One witness, a Sophia Kreitzberg, said, &quot;When you scratched your head [. . .] you got lice on your hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stone, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; This close environment joined with the background of privation and the strain of long travel to cause break-outs of diseases. The Jews were served unkosher meat and soup, which many refused to eat. Instead they nibbled on what they had brought with them, mostly dried fruit, hard bread, or stale cheese.&lt;ref&gt;Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the other end of the passage was often a few ports of entry to the United States. From 1855 to 1890 this was predominantly Castle Garden (also called Castle Clinton), a point at the tip of Manhattan Island in what would later be called New York City. From 1890 onward a vast number of immigrants came through the new reception area at Ellis Island.&lt;ref&gt;http://genealogy.about.com/od/ports/p/castle_garden.htm Retrieved on March 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In these places human beings were duly categorized by ship, country of origin, past employment, and other relevant information. (This next footnote shows one such document from Castle Garden.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.castlegarden.org/manifests.php Retrieved on March 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catholic America ===

A massive influx of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Russian Empire (most notably Poland) caused a dramatic increase in the U.S. Catholic population during the latter half of the 19th century. From 1840 to 1851 Ireland suffered famine and oppression. The other immigration was caused by nationalization and national upheavals. By 1850 Catholicism had become the United States' largest religious denomination: between 1860 and 1890 the Catholic population tripled, mostly because of  immigration. This massive influx of Catholics to the United States eventually led to a significant increase of power for the Catholic church. The so-called American Protestant movement was a fear of this increased power. In pre-Civil War America anti-Catholic prejudice was shown through the &quot;Know Nothings&quot; and the American branch of the Orange Institution. After the war the American Protective Association, and the Ku Klux Klan regularly persecuted and discriminated against Catholics with such acts as The Philadelphia Nativist Riot, &quot;Bloody Monday&quot;, and the Orange Riots of New York City in 1871 and 1872&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gordon, The Orange riots: Irish political violence in New York City, 1870 and 1871 (1993&lt;/ref&gt;. The severe anti-Catholic activities revealed the sentiments of Nativism, which encouraged all &quot;native-born American men&quot; to rise up against foreigners. (This appeal went out to European-descended Protestants, of course, rather than the actual Native Americans who lived there before the had settled here.) The first Nativist publication was called ''The Protestant''; its first edition sold on January 2nd, 1830. Its editor was George Bourne, and as he wrote, &quot;the goal of the paper is centered around the denunciation of the Catholic faith&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sean. ''The American Religious Experience, American Nativism, 1830-1845.''&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-Catholic rhetoric was occasionally met with violence; yet the Nativists produced one of the greatest violent acts of the 1830's. On August 10, 1834, forty to fifty  people gathered outside the Ursuline Convent school and burned it to the ground. &lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sean&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1834 F. B. Morse, a nativist leader who was a professor of sculpture and painting at New York University, wrote &quot;The Foreign Conspiracies Against the Liberties of the United States&quot;, in which his basic message is centered around protecting the American birth right of liberty.  The concern, and fear of the foreign and Catholic communities grew out of the Protestant fear of the monarchial tendencies of Catholicism, during this time urban areas were also starting to grow rapidly with the massive influx of immigrants who all congregated and lived in the same areas.  Nativists saw this as an act of &quot;clannishness&quot;, and an attempt to avoid or resist &quot;Americanization.&quot;  With the success of Morse, and his contemporary Lyman Beecher, the nativist movement reached a point where the public did not care whether the stories they heard were true or false, but began to accept works of fiction as truth as well. In 1836 Maria Monk authored a worked called &quot;Awful Disclosures of the Hotel Dieu Nunnery of Montreal.&quot; In her book she tells of her experiences with Catholicism, which involved forced sexual intercourse with priests and the murdering of nuns and children, the book concludes with her [Maria] escaping to save her unborn child. Monk's mother denies her work, and said that Maria was never in a nunnery, and that a brain injury Maria received as a child may have been the cause of her stories. In the Midwest and northern sections of the country Catholics were seen as incapable of free thought and were said to be &quot;anti-American Papists&quot; because it was thought that they took every direction from the Pope in Rome.  During the Mexican-American war Mexican Catholics were displayed in the media as silly or stupid due to their &quot;Papist superstition&quot;. It was because of the general attitude in America about Catholics that about 100 American Catholics, mostly recently immigrated Irish, fought against the United States in the Mexican-American war. These men fought for the Mexicans and were known as &quot;Saint Patrick's Battalion (&lt;ref&gt;Amy S. Greenberg: Manifest Manhood and the Antebellum American Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1850, Franklin Pierce presented several resolutions that would remove the restrictions on Catholics from holding public office in New Hampshire, these resolutions that were, at the time, considered &quot;pro-Catholic' were defeated (Battle of Religious Tolerance,&quot; The World Almanac, 1950, 53). However as the 19th century passed, hostilities between Catholics and Protestants eased due to the fact that many Irish Catholics fought alongside Protestants during the Civil War, for both the North and the South.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Sean.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
Ex-slaves everywhere across the nation reached out for education. Blacks of all ages really wanted to know what was in the books that had been only permitted to whites. With freedom they started their own schools and the classes were packed days and nights. They sat on log seats or the dirt floors. They would study their letters in old almanacs and in discarded dictionaries. Because the desire to escape slavery's ignorance was so great, ignoring their poverty, many blacks would pay tuition, sometimes $1 or $1.50 a month.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
Blacks and their white allies also saw a need for colleges and universities, in this case to train teachers, ministers, and professionals for leadership. There were seven colleges founded by the American Missionary Association, Fisk and Atlanta Universities, between 1866 and 1869. The Freedoms Bureau helped to establish Howard University in Washington D.C. As well as Northern religious groups, such as the Methodists, Baptists, and Congregationalists, supported dozens of seminaries and teachers’ colleges.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation, Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest forms of education that blacks received was from the missionaries to convert them to Christianity. The education of blacks was very low during the civil war, until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. The Department of Education was developed in 1867 to help start more effective schools systems. Howard University was developed in Washington D.C. for black youth “in the liberal arts and sciences.” The first public school day was in Boston in 1869.

== Technology ==

Just before the Civil War a vast source of petroleum was discovered in and around Titusville, Pennsylvania, and after the War this began to be exploited. At first oil was used for medicinal purposes alone. However, as the supply increased, it also began to be used for industrial purposes, and instead of whale oil. The dangerous and expensive whaling industry collapsed. While some cities used coal gas for night illumination, others began to use oil lamps, and major cities were lit at night. Petroleum, lamp oil (for the great engine lamp), and machine oil increased the usefulness of railways.  

Information could be transmitted across great distances via the telegraph. In the 1870s and 1880s inventors vied to transmit a human voice. The two major competitors were the Scots-born Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray. In the year 1875, Alexander Graham Bell used an electromagnetic machine to transmit the sound of a steel reed. On February 14, 1876, a partner of Bell presented his patent to the patent office in Washington, D.C., on the same day as his rival Elisha Gray. Three weeks later, on March Seventh, Bell’s patent won out and was granted.

== Native Americans After The War ==

The injustices that Native Americans dealt with during the Civil War did not go away at War's end. The U. S. National government made it clear that though these people were indigenous to the continent, they were not going to be citizens of the country. The Native Americans were forced to live out in the west on reservations. Their travel was restricted and scrutinized by government agents who monitored them. Traveling off the reservations to hunt, fish or even visit the neighboring reservations was frowned upon by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Subsequently, the Bureau instituted a pass system in order keep them under control. This system required the Natives to get a pass from the agents before they were allowed off the reservation.

White settlers also took issue with Indians traveling on trains. However, the Central Pacific Railroad in Nevada granted the Native Americans permission to ride on top of the trains in exchange for their railroads being allowed to cross through the reservations. Many Indian agents were unhappy with this free travel arrangement. They began writing letters to the Bureau to stop it. One of the agents commented that &quot;The injurious effects of this freedom from restraint, and continual change of place, on the Indian, can not be overestimated.&quot;

With the 14th amendment the civil rights acts were contrived. For the Indians however, their positioning was made clear. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 states “That all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States.&quot; 

=== Battle at Little Bighorn ===

In 1876, after a few uneventful confrontations, Col. George A. Custer and his small cavalry came across the Sioux and some of their allies at the Little Bighorn River. To force the large Indian army back to the reservations, the Army dispatched three columns to attack. One of these groups contained Lt. Custer and the Seventh Cavalry. They spotted the Sioux village about fifteen miles away just along the Rosebud River, Custer also found a nearby group of about forty men. He ignored orders to wait,and decided to attack before they could alert the main party. He was unaware of how much he was outnumbered.  The Sioux and their allies had three times as much force. Custer divided his forces in three, He sent troops under control of Captain Frederick Benteen to try to stop them from escaping through the upper valley of the Little Bighorn River. Major Marcus Reno job was to pursue the group, then cross the river, and attack the Indian village in a conjunction with the remaining troops under his command. He Intended to strike the Indian camp from the north and south, but he had no idea that he would have to cross a rough terrain in order to achieve this. As the Indians descended Custer ordered his men to shoot their horses and stack the carcasses in front of them in order to form a wall. But this did not protect them against bullets. In less than an hour, Custer and all his men were killed in one of the worst American military disasters of all time. After one more day of fighting, Reno and Benteen's now unified forces fled when the Indians stopped fighting. They [who?] knew two more columns of soldiers were coming towards them, so they escaped toward them.

The massacre of Custer's final battle eclipsed any success he had had in the Civil War. Custer was defeated and killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876,while fighting Native American tribes in a battle that has come to be known as &quot;Custer's Last Stand&quot;.

== Women's History of the Period ==
=== Victoria Woodhull ===
In 1872 Victoria Woodhull became the first woman to run for President of the United States. She was nominated by the Equal Rights Party on May 10. Though it is undisputed that she was the first female to run for president, the legality of her petition is questioned; her name didn't actually appear on the ballot and she was under the age of 35 which is the required age for a presidential candidate according to the constitution. Woodhull did not receive any electoral votes, but evidence supports that she received popular votes that were never counted.
=== Woman's Christian Temperance Union ===
The Woman's Christian Temperance Union was formed on December 22, 1873.  Fredonia, New York is credited as being the birthplace of the group.  The temperance movement was a social movement that pushed for the reduction of alcohol consumption.  The movement spread all over the country, and women would go to bars and drug stores to sing and pray.  The National Woman's Christian Temperance Union was established in 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio.  The women demonstrated use of non violent protestation of the consumption of alcohol by praying in saloons.  Often, they were denied entrance and yelled at by patrons.  The movement ultimately contributed to prohibition in America's future.

A student decided to silver plate his/her mother's forks. S/he set up the apparatus above.  S/he set the power pack and variable resistor so that the ammeter read 0.1 A. S/he allowed the fork to remain in the electrolysis apparatus for 10 min.  Once s/he removed the fork s/he tested it by trying to scratch the silver off. S/he found that the layer of silver was too thin and decided that s/he would have to take steps to make the layer a lot thicker.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the correct answer. Well done!

Increasing the resistance would ''decrease'' the current and so decrease the thickness of the silver.

Increasing the voltage would increase the current making the layer of silver thicker. But the question asked which one of the four possible measures would ''not'' increase the thickness of the layer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm sorry but this is the wrong answer. Increasing the concentration of silver nitrate will mean there are more ions to carry the current. The current will therefore be larger and so the silver layer will be ''thicker''. 

The question asked which method '''would not'' produce a thicker layer.

      <comment>Trying not to be so US-biased. Other countries also developed academic internetworks (although ARPANET was generally the one they would link up to and later become a part of in the Internet)</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The [[Wikipedia:Internet|Internet]] is a worldwide collection of computer networks that began as a single network that was originally created in 1969 by ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), a U.S. government agency that was far more interested in creating projects that would survive a nuclear war than in creating anything useful for the civilian population.

In its original form, ARPANET, the U.S. government hoped to create a network of computers that would allow communication between government agencies and certain educational centers that would be able to survive a nuclear explosion.
It is doubtful that the original founders of ARPANET foresaw what we now know as &quot;the Internet.&quot; From its humble beginnings as a military project, the ARPANET grew slowly throughout the 70's and 80's as a community of academics accomplished the truly monumental task of hammering out the building blocks of this new, open, modular conglomeration of networks.

In addition to the U.S. ARPANET, other countries also developed their own computer networks which quickly linked up to ARPANET, such as the UK's [[wikipedia:JANET|JANET]] (1983 onwards), and Australia's [[wikipedia:ACSnet|ACSnet]] (mid-1970s until replaced). Connecting these together would help develop a global internetwork.

The various protocols, including IP, TCP, DNS, POP, and SMTP, took shape over the years, and by the time the World Wide Web ([[Wikipedia:HTML|HTML]] and HTTP) was created in the early 90's, this &quot;Internet&quot; had become a fully functional, fairly robust system of network communication, able to support this new pair of protocols which eventually turned the Internet into a household word.

While a large portion of users today confuse the Web with the Internet itself, it must be emphasized that the Web is only one type of Internet application, and one set of protocols among a great many which were in use for over a decade before the Web entered into the public awareness. 

The Web is a subset of the Net. Email is not a part of the Web, and neither are newsgroups, although Web designers have developed web sites through which users, the world over, commonly access both of these much older forms of Internet media.

While the Net is a largely abstract phenomenon, it cannot (at least, not yet) be accurately equated with the concept of &quot;cyberspace&quot; as depicted in science fiction. If &quot;judgement day&quot; were to occur as depicted in the latest &quot;Terminator&quot; film, much of the Internet would survive it, but most of the electrical and data infrastructure by which we access the net would not. The line which currently demarcates the &quot;digital divide&quot; would shift dramatically to a point where it would leave only a small segment of humanity in virtual touch. This limitation, however, will slowly be overcome as wireless technologies continue to proliferate and wired technologies become increasingly cheaper.

In March 1972 ARPA became known as DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, and then went back to ARPA in February 1993 and back to DARPA in March 1996 and has been ever since.  It was originally created as ARPA in 1958 in response to the launching of Sputnik.  The launch of Sputnik made America realize that the Soviet Union could exploit military technology.  DARPA has contributed to the creation of ARPANET as well as the Packet Radio Network, the Packet Satellite Network and the Internet.  As well as research into the Artificial Intelligence field commonly referred to as AI.  By the late 1970's the Department of Defense had adopted BSD UNIX as the primary operating system for DARPA.

I think that the section &quot;statistical puzzles&quot; should rather read &quot;probability puzzles&quot; since this describes the nature of the contributed riddles more precisely (and there are really few statistical puzzles out there going beyond probability theory).
However, it seems a bit tedious to make the change because of the references already in place

It's really nice to see so much interest! I'll try to put up some more cool puzzles (and of course I'd love to have some more puzzles put up by other people so that I can also try to solve a few :) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Suggestion: I think once we have more than 20 or so problems we should split them up into subcategories. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Suggestion: I think it will be easier to create for each puzzle an own solution page and put a link at the bottom of each puzzle. [[User:doopdoop|doopdoop]]

:I agree, maybe we should have (at least) two levels of hierarchy in our book: 1. subcategories which contain a list of puzzles for each type 2. a page for each puzzle + an 'official solution' page for this puzzle (the talk page of a puzzle could be used to discuss clarifications, alternate solutions, ...) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]
:Suggested structure (partially inspired by the rec.puzzles archive -&gt; '''''now implemented''''')

:What about the classical n-queens or traveling salesman problems?

'''Note:''' even if a problem is solved, you should try and solve it without looking at the solution on the talk page. That way we increase the chance of getting alternative solutions!

----

I've implemented the structure suggested by [[User:doopdoop|doopdoop]]. Every problem now has it's own problem page and solution page. Also, I think we can use a problem's talk page to vote on the difficulty (say from 1-10, where 1=very easy to 10=(almost) impossible). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

==Self-created puzzles==

I presume that we're allowed to put puzzles that we created ourselves onto the page, right? Or not? [[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 21:49, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Absolutely! I think that's at least as interesting as gathering the 'standard' puzzles that are out there.[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:: Only ''as'' interesting?  Surely it's ''more'' interesting.  If we were only going to copy other sites/books, what would be the point? -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 15:13, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

----

== Naming Conventions ==
I would like to suggest that we start adding a &quot;- Puzzle&quot; to the title of Puzzle pages. This would
avoid naimng conflicts with other Wikibooks and furthermore make it more easy to detect new and open
puzzles in the Recent changes. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]
: Hi, I am new here (in fact I just created my account), but I'd suggest to put &quot;Puzzle:&quot; to the front, like in the pages of [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]]. It should help to keep books together, and I wonder why this is not a standardized policy on Wikibooks yet... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 14:59, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::A little late for that? --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 17:27, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: Not at all.  Better late than never.  I hereby propose a hierarchy, so that the names'll look like this:
:::* [[Puzzles]] - contents page
:::* [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Puzzles:Logic puzzles]] - section page
:::* [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies|Puzzles:Logic puzzles:Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies]] - puzzle page
:::* [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies/Solution|Puzzles:Logic puzzles:Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies:Solution]] - solution page
::: And get the navigation header on every page while we're at it.  Moreover, there are even some pages that have pathologically meaningless titles - just look at [[Puzzles:Lateral puzzles]] for instance.  Let's get cleaning at once!  (I've already done puzzles 5 and 7 there, so you can see what I mean.  But still, shouldn't they all have more descriptive titles?) -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 15:26, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
::::So to implement these ideas, you move the pages and redo all the links? [[User:Borbrav|Borbrav]] 18:01, July 14, 2005 (UTC)

::::: Yes.  I've started on it.  We can all work on it.  And while we're at it, we should make sure all pages have the navigation header, and that the navigation header has a line below it. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 10:32, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

Some pages are acquiring poorly laid out navigation headers, like this

: [[Puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Puzzles:Logic puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies|Puzzles:Logic puzzles:Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies]] | Solution

That's something else to fix in the process.  It should look like this:

: [[Puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles|Logic puzzles]] | [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies|Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies]] | Solution
-- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:02, 22 September 2005 (UTC)

I've just created some navigation header templates, which we could use to make life easier.  So now we can do

:'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:hc-navhead2|hc-navhead2]]&lt;nowiki&gt;|Puzzles|Logic puzzles}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
:'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Template:hc-navhead3|hc-navhead3]]&lt;nowiki&gt;|Puzzles|Logic puzzles|Knights, Knaves &amp; Spies}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
:etc. up to {{tl|hc-navhead6}}.

A little less cumbersome than doing it manually, don't you think?

I've used it on [[Puzzles/Logic puzzles/Gold Coins]].  But I suppose we don't need to go through the ones we've already fixed changing them to use this template quite yet.  Note that they automatically include the horizontal line - hopefully this'll see the end of people omitting it. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

=== Bot spec ===

I've written the following specification, which should enable [[User:Tsca.bot]] to get to work.  I suggest that this stays here for a few days, giving people time to suggest changes to the spec, before the bot starts work. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 17:52, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

==== Pass 1: Fix the page titles ====

Starting from the main Puzzles page, follow the links.  Move each page to its correct title if it isn't already, using the displayed text of the link by which the page was reached.

For example, the page linked as '''Two-player games''' from the main '''Puzzles''' page shall become '''Puzzles:Two-player games'''.  The page linked as '''Picking Game''' under that page shall become '''Puzzles:Two-player games:Picking Game'''.

Special cases to observe:

# Ignore navigation header links (see below) during this stage of the process.
# If a colon appears in the text of a link, ignore all text preceding the colon when generating the new page name.
# If the link text begins with a lowercase letter, change the first letter to uppercase when generating the title.  For example, '''Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:Three Daughters:Solution''' not '''Puzzles:Arithmetical puzzles:Three Daughters:solution'''.
# If the text of a link contains the word '''solution''', then use '''Solution''' by itself as the name at that level rather than the whole text of the link.
# If two or more pages link to the same page (either directly or via redirects), then go by the link on the first page that was encountered.  For example, some puzzles have hint pages as well as the solution page, and have both hint and solution links from the main puzzle page.  The hint page may also have a solution link.  Invariably, you will reach the main puzzle page before the hint page.  Consequently, the solution page will be a child page of the main puzzle page, not of the hint page.
# Two pages, namely '''Number sequences''' and '''Riddles''', display several puzzles at once, each with its own solution page.  I'm not sure how the solution pages should be named at the moment.  Meanwhile, I suggest that we skip processing these pages, and then maybe we can deal with them later.

==== Pass 2: Tidying up the pages ====

Once the pages are at their correct titles, the bot can then work at tidying up the pages themselves.  On the main Puzzles page, I believe the only thing that needs doing is to update the links.  On the pages within the book, there is the following work to do:

# Make sure every page has a navigation header.  Use the {{tl|hc-navhead2}}, {{tl|hc-navhead3}}, etc. templates, replacing any manually typed header that may be present on the page.  It is sufficient to check whether the page begins with a link back to [[Puzzles]], and if so, delete the whole line.  Any horizontal line immediately below the nav header should also be removed, since the hc-navhead templates automatically include one.
# Apart from that which is in the navigation header, there should be no repetition of the puzzle title at the beginning of the page content as is present on some of the '''How do you ... ?''' pages.
# Adjust all links to point to the pages by their new, hierarchical names, and make the display text exactly match the final part of the title.
# Link text should be non-bold.

==== Changes ====

If you wish to propose or discuss any changes or additions, please do so here.

=== Recent attempts ===

[[User:Withinfocus|Withinfocus]], who added {{tl|cleanup-NC}}, obviously didn't practise what the notice preaches by looking at this talk page.  As it happens, at least two users - [[User:Think Fast|Think Fast]] and [[User:SB Johnny|SBJohnny]] - have undertaken to implement the slashes convention, while at the same time failing to agree on other common-sense conventions (&quot;Logic '''p'''uzzles&quot; vs. &quot;Analytical '''P'''uzzles&quot;).  There are also plenty of other cleanups that could be done to the page titles as well as making them use slashes. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 12:20, 26 November 2006 (UTC)
:Hah, I just saw this little dig even though I added that template many months ago. The addition of the template was perfectly valid. Should the naming convention need to be discussed it would be done here as it was in some form above. Flagging a poorly-organized book was my goal and that's what happened, therefore there was nothing I &quot;didn't practice&quot; and my actions are correct. My addition of the template does not require discussion, only the implementation of the naming change does. I'm writing this so that if others notice it they won't be afraid to mark books that need cleanup. This is an implementation of policy and all books should be well-formed here at Wikibooks. The naming suggestions above need improvement in many ways so that colon convention can be avoided, but that will be tackled when a user who knows categories and the slash convention well feels like taking the effort to reorganize here. I unfortunately do not have the time currently. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 17:00, 17 April 2007 (UTC)

Just to clarify, the system that has been mostly followed is that section titles (&quot;Logic puzzles&quot;, etc.) are in sentence case, but individual puzzle titles are in title case.  This makes a little sense, ISFA one might think of puzzle titles as like titles of a book, song, film, etc. whereas section titles are just descriptive phrases used to group the puzzles.  But is it ideal?

It gets even more tricky when you consider that puzzles within [[Puzzles/Chess problems|Puzzles:Chess problems]], and possibly a few others, have more or less descriptive titles rather than titles in the style of the others, and generally have puzzle titles in sentence case.

What are we going to do then?  Before we do any more page moving, we should all agree on a convention for capitalising titles.  We should also decide what to do with [[Puzzles:Number sequences]], which currently has the puzzles all on one page and each solution on a page of its own. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 18:06, 27 November 2006 (UTC)

== Non-scientific puzzles ==
There are some logical puzzles that are too simple to be called logical, or non-solveable, or too contradictory, but interesting nonetheless. I added a new section, [[Puzzles:Non-Scientific Puzzles|Non-Scientific Puzzles]]. --[[User:Divinity|Divinity]] 18:24, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)


== New Link Under Puzzle Resources ==
I added this link to a lot of riddles however the answeres aren't necessarily given to you so for a lot of them you might need to figure them out or check the Wu Forum however these are a lot of great riddles.* [http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~wwu/riddles/intro.shtml Riddles]&amp;ndash;Wu:Riddles I also added this link which has a wide variety of puzzles *[http://www.jimloy.com/puzz/puzz.htm Jim Loy's Puzzle Pages]--[[User:71.234.101.173|71.234.101.173]] 19:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

== Some pages don't seem to belong ==

Is this supposed to be a book ''of'' puzzles, a book ''about'' puzzles or a book of ''links to'' puzzles?  I'd think the former.  In this case, some of the pages seem out of place:

* [[Puzzles/Bongard problems]] and [[Puzzles/Sudoku]] are web links to puzzles.  The former has a bit of information on what Bongard problems are, but that's an aside.  Of course, if somebody wants to create some puzzles of these kinds to publish in this book, that's fine.

* [[Puzzles:Rubik's cubes]] and the other bullet points under [[Puzzles#Permutation puzzles]] don't seem to make sense to have here.  Of course a web page can present an applet for the user to play Rubik's cube or any mechanical puzzle, but Wikibooks isn't really the place for this.  You could argue that the right thing to have here is puzzles on how to construct specific Rubik's Cube patterns or perform specific manoeuvres, but that's still probably not the right title for such a section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The peoples of Europe have had a tremendous effect on the development of the United States throughout the course of U.S. history. Europeans &quot;discovered&quot; and colonized the North American continent and, even after they lost political control over its territory, their influence has predominated due to a common language, social ideals, and culture.  Therefore, when endeavoring to understand the history of the United States, it is helpful to briefly describe their European origin. 

== Greece and Rome ==
:''See also: [[Ancient History/Greece]] and [[Ancient History/Rome]]''
[[Image:Romia Imperio.png|thumb|right|350px|The Roman Empire]]
The first significant civilizations of Europe formed in the second millennium BCE. By 800 BCE, various '''Greek''' city-states, sharing a language and a culture based on slavery, pioneered novel political cultures. In the Greek city of Athens, by about 500 BCE, the male citizens who owned land began to elect their leaders. These elections by the minority of a minority represent the first democracy in the world. Other states in Greece experimented with other forms of rule, as in the totalitarian state of Sparta. These polities existed side by side, sometimes warring with each other, at one time combining against an invading army from Persia. Ancient Athens is known for its literary achievements in drama, history, and personal narrative. The individual city-states did not usually see themselves as a single entity. (The conqueror ''Alexander the Great'', who called himself a Greek, actually was a native of the non-Greek state of Macedon.) The city-states of Greece became provinces of the Roman Empire in 27 BCE.

The city of '''Rome''' was founded (traditionally in the year 753 BCE). Slowly, Rome grew from a kingdom to a republic to a vast empire, which, at various points, included most of present-day Britain (a large part of Scotland never belonged to the empire), France (then known as Gaul), Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Palestine (including the territory claimed today by the modern state of Israel), Northern Arabia, Egypt, the Balkans, and the entire north coast of Africa. This empire was maintained through free-born or adoptive citizenship, citizen education and indoctrination, a large and well-drilled army, and taxes directed by a large bureaucracy directed by the emperor. As each province produced more Roman citizens, the state became hard to maintain. Whole kingdoms in the north and east, and the invading peoples we know as the Germanic tribes (the Ostrogoths and Visigoths and the Franks) sat apart from the system.

After the death of one emperor in 180 CE, power struggles between the army and a succession of rulers of contested origins produced anarchy. Diocletian (243 - 316) reinstated the Empire by 284. Rome regained territory until 395, when the Empire was so large that it had to be divided into two parts, each with a separate ruler. The two halves sat uneasily together. The East, which considered itself the heir of Alexander the Great, spoke Greek or a dialect, while the West spoke Latin. The Eastern Empire survived until 1453, but the system to maintain the Western Empire broke apart. Plagues and crop failures troubled the world. In 476, Germanic tribes deposed the boy who was then the Emperor. Roman roads fell into disrepair, and travel became difficult. Some memories remained in the lands which had once known Roman rule. The supreme rulers of various tribes called themselves ''king,'' a distortion of the Roman word Caesar.

== The Roman Empire to the Holy Roman Empire ==
[[Image:Adhémar de Monteil à Antioche.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|A mitred Adhémar de Monteil carrying the Holy Lance in one of the battles of the First Crusade]]
After Rome's fall, monks from Ireland (which had never known Rome) spread Catholic Christianity and the culture and language of the Western Roman Empire across Europe. Catholicism eventually spread through England (where the Germanic tribes of the Angles and the Saxons now lived)and to the lands of the post-Roman Germanic tribes. Among those tribes, the Franks rose to prominence.

''Charlemagne'' (742 - 814), the King of the Franks, conquered great portions of Europe. He eventually took control of Rome. The senate and the political organs of Rome had disappeared, and Charlemagne did not pretend to become the head of the Church. Charlemagne's domain, a confederation of what had been Roman Gaul with Germanic states, was much smaller than  Diocletian had known. But prestige came with identity with the past, and so this trunk of lands became '''The Holy Roman Empire'''. Charlemagne's descendants, as well as local rulers, took their sanction from the Church, while the Church's pope influenced both religious and political matters. 

The result of political stability was technological advance. After the year 1000, Western Europe caught some of the East's discoveries, and invented others. In addition to vellum, Europeans now started making paper of rags or wood pulp. They also adopted the wind and water mill, the horse collar (for plows and for heavy weights), the moldboard plow, and other agricultural and technological advances. Towns came into being, and then walled cities. More people survived, and the knights and kings over them grew restive.

== Viking Exploration of North America ==
[[Image:Wikinger.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Danish seamen, painted mid-12th century.]]
In the eighth century, pushed from their homes in Scandinavia by war and population expansion, Norsemen, or '''Vikings''', began settling parts of the Faeroe, Shetland, and Orkney Islands in the North Atlantic. They went where ever treasure was, trading as far as Byzantium and Kiev in the East. In the West they raided from Ireland and England down to the Italian peninsula, sailing into a port, seizing its gold, and murdering or enslaving its people before fleeing. They began settling Iceland in approximately 874 CE. A Viking called ''Erik the Red'' was accused of murder and banished from his native Iceland in about 982. Eric explored and later founded a settlement in a snowy western island. Knowing that this bleak land would need many people to prosper, Eric returned to Iceland after his exile had passed and coined the word &quot;Greenland&quot; to appeal to the overpopulated and treeless settlement of Iceland. Eric returned to Greenland in 985 and established two colonies with a population of nearly 5000.

''Leif Erikson'', son of Erik the Red, and other members of his family began exploration of the North American coast in 986.  He landed in three places, in the third establishing a small settlement called Vinland. The location of Vinland is uncertain, but an archeological site on the northern tip of Newfoundland, Canada (L'anse aux Meadows) has been identified as the site of a modest Viking settlement and is the oldest confirmed presence of Europeans in North America. The site contains the remains of eight Norse buildings, as well as a modern reproduction of a Norse longhouse. But the settlement in Vinland was abandoned in struggles between the Vikings and the native inhabitants, whom the settlers called ''Skraelingar''. Bickering also broke out among the Norseman themselves. The settlement lasted less than two years. The Vikings would make brief excursions to North America for the next 200 years, though another attempt at colonization was soon thwarted.

By the thirteenth century, Iceland and Greenland had also entered a period of decline during the &quot;Little Ice Age.&quot; Knowledge of their exploration, in the days before the printing press, was ignored in most of Europe. Yet the Vikings are now considered the true European discoverers of North America. The influence of their people outlasted even the terrible raids, and their grandchildren became kings and queens. For example, a branch of Viking descendants living in France, the Normans, conquered England from the Anglo-Saxons in 1066.

== The Great Famine and Black Death ==
The Little Ice Age led to European famines in the years 1315-1317 and in 1321. In the year 1318 sheep and cattle began to die of a contagious disease. Farmers could not support the growing population. And then, in 1347, some Genoese trading ships inadvertently brought a new, invasive species of rat to Europe. These rats carried '''bubonic plague'''.

Plague was also called '''the Black Death''', from the darkened skin left after death and from its deadly reach. It had three strands: ''bubonic'', ''pneumonic'', and ''septicemic''.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Medical Society, New England Surgical Society. Boston medical and surgical journal, Volume 149, Issue 2. 1903&lt;/ref&gt; In bubonic plague fleas carried by the rats would leave their hosts and bite people. The masses of bacteria would flow through the human system, killing cells and leaving their refuse in lymph nodes in the armpit, groin, and neck. These nodes would swell and turn black, creating bubos. Infection could also spread into the lungs, so that a person might cough or sneeze the germ into the air. This created pneumonic plague, spreading disease into spaces where people gathered and where rats dared not go. It also spread through contamination of food. The last form of disease, and its most deadly, was septicemic. This attacked the blood, leaving stretches of pale skin looking black, and killing the person within hours. 

Surviving laws of cities and guilds regulate public cleanliness and penalize adulteration of food. They cannot show how strictly these laws were applied. And they show no knowledge, of course, of germ theory and the need for sterilization. Older systems such as the few public baths which remained from the days of colonial Rome were seen as sinful and dangerous, invitations to the plague. The dwelling places of survivors of pre-Christian Rome, the Jews who were forced to live apart, were attacked by mobs who attributed the Black Death to their poisoning Christians' wells.  

The responses to plague can be seen in the records left by survivors -- one third of the population of Europe died in repeated waves of disease -- and in the subsequent changes in society. Airplanes and satellites show the foundations of plague-era towns which were emptied by the disease. In just one square mile of pre-plague Europe there are reports of there being 50,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried, Robert S. The Black Death: Natural and Human Disaster in Medieval Europe. Simon and Schuster, 1985. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In large cities, families would flee or lock themselves away, trying to keep themselves from death. Other families were locked in by city authorities. This is the beginning of the modern system of quarantine.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Susan S. Black death: AIDS in Africa. Palgrave Macmillan, 2003. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Some branches of the family would not be among those so helped. The Black Death seemed erratic, sometimes taking people deemed good and pious, sometimes not. One priest or church prelate might die, and another survive. And a living priest might give no aid to other survivors. Some critiques of the Church which had become spread through most of Europe date from this era.  

Although some lands became waste through lack of tilling, those people who survived grasped the property of those who had not. Europe then had a land-based economic system. Rich people became richer. There began a labor shortage: the farmers who survived needed hands to take in their crops. The wages of farm hands began to rise. In the surviving towns they needed people to guard the gates: in the courts they began to look for rising young men. Cities became more powerful in the depleted lands, and authority grew more centralized.

== Education ==
During the Middle Ages Western society and education were heavily shaped by Christianity as expressed through the Roman Catholic Church. Towns, courts, and feudal manors had their priests, monasteries and nunneries had their ''scriptora'' or libraries, and after the 11th century CE, a few cities had Universities, schools to educate men to be high-ranking clerics, lawyers, or doctors. Where children had schools, their parents paid a fee so that they might learn Latin, the language St. Jerome had used for his translation of the Bible. Latin was the language of the Church. It was also learned, along with military tactics and the rules of chivalry, by men who trained to be knights. A smattering of Latin was necessary, along with Math, even for the elementary schools which sprang up in some cities. There both boys and girls were taught literacy and math, prerequisite for acceptance as an apprentice in many Guilds.  Latin across Europe created a European-wide culture: a doctor from Padua could talk to his fellow from Oxford in Latin. 

As in the Greek and Roman eras, only a minority of people went to school. There were not enough books, little travel, and no means of spreading standardized education. Schools were attended first by persons planning to enter religious life. Occasionally a cleric would reach out to educate a very bright peasant boy. This was one of the few ways peasants could rise in the world. But the vast majority of people were serfs who served as agricultural workers on the estates of feudal lords. They were, in effect, tied to the fate of the land. From the serf up to some high princes, the vast majority of people did not attend school, and were generally illiterate.

In the rise of the Universities in the 11th century, the Church translated several manuscripts of the ancient Greek writer Aristotle into Latin. From Aristotle's emphasis upon human reason, philosophy and science, and the Church's emphasis upon revelation and the teachings of Christ, medieval scholars developed ''Scholasticism''. This was an philosophical and educational movement  which attempted to integrate into an ordered system both the natural wisdom of Greece and Rome and the religious wisdom of Christianity. It was dominant in the medieval Christian schools and universities of Europe from about the middle of the 11th century to about the middle of the 15th century, though its influence continued in successive centuries. The idea of Man in the middle of ordered nature, and yet dominant over nature, bore fruit in the observation of natural phenomena, the beginnings of what the Western World knows as science. It also led to the exultation of system over observation, and the persistence of the Ptolemaic theories such as geocentrism among formally educated people. 

Noble girls were sometimes sent to live in nunneries in order to receive basic schooling. Nuns would teach them to read and write and the chores necessary to run their establishments, including spinning and weaving. (Cloth-making was a major national industry in the Middle Ages.) They taught them their manners and their prayers. Some of these girls later became nuns themselves.

== Christianity, Islam, Judaism ==

During the centuries after the fall of Rome, various flavors of Christian churches spread from Northern Africa and Armenia westward. This changed after ''Mohammed'' established Islam in 610 CE. Like Christianity, it spread through conversion and conflict. At its height it was also a faith of Europe, from Spain to Albania and Bosnia and their sister states. Both Prince and Caliph held that their state must have one faith, and no other belief was encouraged. When Jerusalem was reconquered by the Seljuq Turks, Christians were no longer able to go on religious pilgrimages to the Holy City.

At the end of the eleventh century, ''Pope Urban II'' inaugurated the Crusades, urging Western European kings and great nobles to begin what would be a century and a half of warfare. Christian armies fought first to reconquer and then to hold part of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Crusaders ultimately failed in the face of resurgent Muslim forces. Western Europeans within Church and State argued for and against the Crusades.

Despite the failure of the Crusades, militant Western Christianity persisted in Spain in an effort known as ''the Reconquista'' (the &quot;reconquest&quot;), which purged the land of the Muslims who had arrived there in 711.  By the fifteenth century, the Muslims were confined to the kingdom of Granada, which bordered the Mediterranean Sea in the southern side of the Iberian Peninsula.  Granada finally fell in 1492 to the Spanish Christians, ending the reconquista. 

Rome had destroyed Israel in 70 CE, but allowed a remnant of her people to survive. Fortified by rabbinic culture and centered on the Torah, they became a resilient group. They survived as the known world became Christian. They spread, as traders, through East and West. However, Christian relationships with Jews were punctuated by hatred. They were held to be guilty of Jesus' death, and they were supposed to be evil because they had not converted to Christianity. They were forced into the notorious ghettos, usually built on waste or undesirable land. They were forced to wear strange clothing which marked them off, and to pay heavy taxes.&lt;ref&gt;(Charing pg. 18-23). Charing, Douglas. Judaism. New York, NY: DK Pub., 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Christians spread rumors that Jewish officials sometimes kidnapped and killed young boys for their sacrifices. Sometimes a mob might break into the ghetto, killing some people. Individuals were sometimes forced to convert. One of the effects of European nationalism was the expulsion of a country's Jewish population. England was the first, in the 13th century; later, a reviving France; later still, Spain and Portugal. Some men crewing the ships in the Age of Exploration were Jews, often practicing their faith in hiding.  

For a period in the late Twelfth century there two sets of Popes, a line in Rome and another in the French city of Avignon under the sway of that Court. In reaction against this, the Church centralized its powers in parallel to what nations were doing. There had been dissension before, in medieval England's Lollards and later with the Czech priest John Hus. However, it was only in an age after the printing press, when people began printing the Bible in their own languages, when ''Martin Luther'' founded the Protestant church. England's ''King Henry VIII'', who had won the title &quot;Protector of the Faith&quot; for a work defending the Pope, later left it to become the head of the Church of England. This division of Western Christianity created religious minorities, who were persecuted throughout Europe. Among these were the Pilgrims, who helped settle America.

== The Renaissance ==
:''See also: [[European History]]''
Another, more humble result of the plague was the accumulation of rags left over from clothing. These were quickly used to make paper. Books were very rare during the Middle Ages, and the monks who made them chained them to their shelves. It took one year for a man to make one book. In that climate Bibles took priority: we have only one copy of Democritus's most famous work surviving from this period. As rag paper replaced velum, books began to become more plentiful. The supply was augmented by Europe's adoption of ''Johannes Gutenberg'' 's fixed-type printing press in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Eisenstein, The printing press as an agent of change: communications and cultural transformations in early modern Europe (2 vols. ed.). Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press. 1979. ISBN 0-521-22044-0&lt;/ref&gt;

There had been earlier leaps in culture, including the wave of population and technological adaptation in the 12th century. This left its mark in increased population and the Roman Catholic Church's adoption of Aristotle. Yet the press made it possible for knowledge to have a foothold in society. Inventions in one place could be explained and adopted across a continent. The Greeks fleeing the fall of Byzantium brought their knowledge of ancient Greek culture to the West. The Bible, the basic book of Christendom, could be pored over by laypeople, and reading it could be learned by more people than ever before. Learning was no longer solely the province of the Church.

If the Bible was first off of the presses, pseudo-science and science followed soon after. The European witch trials were one result of the new medium. The questioning of scientific consensus was another. ''Andreas Vesalius'' published his observations about the circulatory system. Books discussing the theories of ''Nicolaus Copernicus'' and ''Galileo Galilei'' demolished the old geocentric theory of the cosmos. The arts were not neglected. Giorgio Vasari's biographical Lives introduced such new artists as ''Leonardo Da Vinci'' and ''Michelangelo Buonarroti'' to the larger world.

A later time called this growth of knowledge '''the Renaissance'''. They said it began in the Italian city-states, spreading throughout most of Europe. The Italian city of Florence was called the birthplace of this intellectual movement.

Books spread the Crusader's newly found experience and knowledge of the Mediterranean, a region whose technology was at that time superior to that of western Europe. Books written about traders, adventurers, and scholars spread knowledge of Chinese technology such as gunpowder and silk. They spread writings of the ancient world which had been lost to Europe, and nurtured a taste for new foods and flavors. They spread pictures of ancient Greek statues, Moorish carpets, and strange practices. 

In the fifteenth century, the Mediterranean was a vigorous trading area.  European ships brought in grains and salts for preserving fish, Chinese silks, Indian cotton, precious stones, and above all, spices. White cane sugar could be used to preserve fruit and to flavor medicine. Cinnamon was medicine against bad humors as well as preservative and flavoring, part of the mysterious ''poudre douce'', and now available even to some European common people.

== Toward Nation-States ==

The great age of exploration was undertaken by nation-states, cohesive entities with big treasuries who tended to use colonization as a national necessity. When such nations as Portugal, England, Spain, and France became stronger, they began building ships. 

=== The Rise of Portugal ===

The Italian peninsula dominated the world because of its position in the Mediterranean Sea. Universities in Padua, Rome, and elsewhere taught men from East and West. Above all, principalities such as the Republic of Venice and Florence controlled trade. Genoa and Venice in particular ballooned into massive trading cities. Yet there was at yet no nation of Italy, so each city's riches belonged only to that city. Individual cities used their monopoly to raise the price of goods, which would have been expensive in any case, because they were often brought overland from Asia to ports on the eastern Mediterranean. The mad prices, in turn, increased the desire of purchasers to find other suppliers, and of potential suppliers to find a better and cheaper route to Asia.

Portugal was just one of many potential suppliers, with a location which extended its influence into the Atlantic and down, south and east, to Africa.  Prince Henry, son of King John I, promoted the exploration of new routes to the East. He planned Portugal's 1415 capture of Ceuta in Muslim North Africa. He also sponsored voyages that pushed even farther down the West African coast. By the time of his death in 1460, these voyages had reached south to Sierra Leone.

Under King John II, who ruled from 1481 to 1495, Bartolomeu Dias finally sailed around the southernmost point of Africa to the Cape of Good Hope (1487-1488).  In 1497-1499 Vasco da Gama of Portugal sailed up the east coast of Africa to India.

The Portuguese colonized and settled such islands in the Atlantic as Madeira, Cape Verde, the Azores, and Sao Tome. These islands supplied them with sugar and gave them territorial control of the Atlantic. West Africa was more promising, not only unearthing a valuable trade route to India, but also providing the Portuguese with ivory, fur, oils, black pepper, gold dust, and a supply of dark skinned slaves who were used as domestic servants, artisans, and market or transportation workers in Lisbon. They were later used as laborers on sugar plantations on the Atlantic.

=== France, England, And The Hundred Years' War ===

King Harold of England faced William the Norman usurper after defeating the last Viking forces holding the North of England. And when William the Norman became William the Conqueror, he held England by consolidating the nation. His army was ruled from newly built castles, and had the best technology of the time. His sons and their sons fought the original inhabitants of their country in Scotland and Wales, pushing their boarders. They also claimed the right to their ancestral Normandy, in what is now France. (There had long been rivalry between England and France over the wool trade.) By a English king's marriage to an former queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the king subsequently claimed Aquitaine. During the years of 1337 to 1453, the kings of England claimed the whole of France and beyond, fighting '''The Hundred Years' War''' there and in the Low Countries. For some years the English threatened Paris, and there was a question whether the small area of France proper would be entirely conquered. The early stages of the war marked by English victory against a demoralized French people and their Prince. But around 1428, a young peasant girl from Lorriene, France named Joan of Arc approached a garrison of the French army. She told them that  Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret had told her to lead the army to victory. She said that God had come to her in a dream, and told her how to defeat the English. She claimed that God said Prince Charles of France needed to be crowned in order for France to claim victory over the English.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Marina. Joan of Arc: The Image of Female Heroism.  University of California Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining the new French king, support of the populace, and several key victories, Joan was sold to the English for treason and as an appeasement. Yet France had been renewed. It pushed back against the invaders, and took back most of the land. In the next few centuries it was to remove England from Continental Europe.

The Hundred Years' War devastated both countries. But it ultimately turned both of them into stronger, colonial powers. The Hundred Years' War created opportunities for wealth and advancement for the knights of both countries. The Chivalric code showed great influence during this period. France absorbed Aquitaine, Castile, and Normandy itself, prosperous areas. The twin strokes of the plague and the Inquisition weakened opposition to the French king's rule. And English centralization continued as its own royalty sought service of serf and Baron. A group of new dialects, Middle English, came out of the tug between Norman lord and Anglo-Saxon peasant. If the nation could not get new land in Europe, it could use its ships to sail elsewhere.

== Review Questions ==
1. Explain how one of these late medieval devices affected prosperity: the wind mill; the horse collar; the printing press.

2. How did the plague infect individuals? How did mass death affect society?

3. What was the importance of these four men to the Renaissance? Galileo Galilei, Nicolaus Copernicus, Andreas Vesalius, Leonardo Da Vinci.

Chemical equations are a convenient, standardized system for describing [[../Chemical reactions|chemical reactions]]. They contain the following information.

*The type of '''reactants''' consumed and '''products''' formed
*The relative amounts of reactants and products
*The electrical charges on [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonding|ions]]
*The physical state of each species (e.g. solid, liquid)
*The reaction conditions (e.g. temperature, catalysts)

The final two points are optional and sometimes omitted.

== Anatomy of an Equation ==

Hydrogen gas and chlorine gas will react vigorously to produce hydrogen chloride gas. The equation above illustrates this reaction. The reactants, hydrogen and chlorine, are written on the left and the products (hydrogen chloride) on the right. The large number 2 in front of HCl indicates that two molecules of HCl are produced for each 1 molecule of hydrogen and chlorine gas consumed. The 2 in subscript below H indicates that there are two hydrogen atoms in each molecule of hydrogen gas. Finally, the (g) symbols subscript to each species indicates that they are gases.

=== Reacting Species ===
'''Species''' in a chemical reaction is a general term used to mean atoms, molecules or ions. A species can contain more than one chemical element (HCl, for example, contains hydrogen and chlorine). Each species in a chemical equation is written:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{E}_{x(s)}^y&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''E''' is the chemical symbol for the element, '''x''' is the number of atoms of that element in the species, '''y''' is the charge (if it is an ion) and '''(s)''' is the physical state.

{{TextBox|1=
The symbols in parentheses (in subscript below each species) indicate the physical state of each reactant or product. For ACS Style&lt;ref&gt;Conventions in Chemistry. In &lt;i&gt;The ACS Style Guide,&lt;/i&gt; 3rd ed.; Coghill, A. M.; Garson, L.R., Eds.; Oxford University Press: New York, 2006; p 294.&lt;/ref&gt; the state is typeset at the baseline without size change.

*'''(s)''' means solid
*'''(l)''' means liquid
*'''(g)''' means gas
*'''(aq)''' means aqueous solution (i.e. dissolved in water)
}}

For example, ethyl alcohol would be written &lt;math&gt;\hbox{C}_2\hbox{H}_6\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; because each molecule contains 2 carbon, 6 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atom. A magnesium ion would be written &lt;math&gt;\hbox{Mg}^{2+}&lt;/math&gt; because it has a double positive (&quot;two plus&quot;) charge. Finally, an ammonium ion would be written &lt;math&gt;\hbox{NH}_4^+&lt;/math&gt; because each molecule contains 1 nitrogen and 4 hydrogen atoms and has a charge of 1+.

=== Coefficients ===
The numbers in front of each species have a very important meaning—they indicate the relative amounts of the atoms that react. The number in front of each species is called a '''coefficient'''. In the above equation, for example, one H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule reacts with one Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule to produce two molecules of HCl. This can also be interpreted as ''moles'' (i.e. 1 mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 1 mol Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces 2 mol HCl).

It is important that the ''Law of Conservation of Mass'' is not violated.  There must be the same number of each type of atoms on either side of the equation.  Coefficients are useful for keeping the same number of atoms on both sides:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_2 + \hbox{O}_2 \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If you count the atoms, there are four hydrogens and two oxygens on each side.  The coefficients allow us to '''balance the equation'''; without them the equation would have the wrong number of atoms.  Balancing equations is the topic of the next chapter.

=== Other Information ===
Occasionally, other information about a chemical reaction will be supplied in an equation (such as temperature or other reaction conditions). This information is often written to the right of the equation or above the reaction arrow.  A simple example would be the melting of ice.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)} + heat \to \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, which could be written as &lt;math&gt;\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)} \xrightarrow{heat} \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Reactions commonly involve '''catalysts''', which are substances that speed up a reaction without being consumed.  Catalysts are often written over the arrow.  A perfect example of a catalyzed reaction is photosynthesis.  Inside plant cells, a substance called ''chlorophyll'' converts sunlight into food.  The reaction is written:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;6\hbox{CO}_2 + 6\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O} + sunlight \xrightarrow{chlorophyll} \hbox{C}_6\hbox{H}_{12}\hbox{O}_6  +  6\hbox{O}_2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Examples ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot; cellspacing=&quot;15px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{CH}_{4(g)} + 2\hbox{O}_{2(g)} \to \hbox{CO}_{2(g)} + 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the equation for burning methane gas (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) in the presence of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form carbon dioxide and water: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O respectively.  Notice the use of coefficients to obey the Law of Conservation of Matter.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Pb}_{(aq)}^{2+} + 2\hbox{I}_{(aq)}^- \to \hbox{PbI}_{2(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is a ''precipitation'' reaction in which dissolved lead cations and iodide anions combine to form a solid yellow precipitate of lead iodide (an [[General Chemistry/Ionic bonding|ionic]] solid).
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{SO}_{2(g)} + 2\hbox{V}_2\hbox{O}_{5(s)} \to 2\hbox{SO}_{3(g)} + 4\hbox{V}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4\hbox{V}_2\hbox{O}_{(s)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)} \to 2\hbox{V}_2\hbox{O}_{5(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
|These two equations involve a catalyst.  They occur one after another, using divanadium pentoxide to convert sulfur dioxide into sulfur trioxide.  If you look closely, you can see that the vanadium catalyst is involved in the reaction, but it does not get consumed.  It is both a reactant and a product, but it is necessary for the reaction to occur, making it a catalyst.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{SO}_{2(g)} + \hbox{O}_{2(g)} \xrightarrow{V_2O_5} 2\hbox{SO}_{3(g)}&lt;/math&gt;
| If we add both equations together, we can cancel out terms that appear on both sides.  The resulting equation is much simpler and self-explanatory (although the original pair of equations is more accurate in describing how the reaction proceeds).
|}

{{Info|The last example demonstrates another important principle of chemical equations:  they can be added together.  Simply list ''all'' reactants from the equations you are adding, then list ''all'' products.  If the same term appears on both sides, it is either a catalyst, an ''intermediate product'', or it is not involved in the reaction.  Either way, it can be canceled out from both sides (if the coefficients are equal).  Try adding the first two vanadium equations together and see if you can cancel out terms to get the final equation.}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Gender of nouns|Genre des noms}} ==

In French, all nouns have a '''grammatical gender'''; that is, they are either masculine ('''m''') or feminine ('''f''').

Most nouns that express people or animals have both a masculine and a feminine form.  For example, the two words for ''the actor'' in French are {{French/Word|l'acteur|gender='''m'''}} and {{French/Word|l'actrice|gender='''f'''}}.

However, there are some nouns that talk about people or animals whose gender is fixed, regardless of the actual gender of the person or animal.  For example, {{French/Word|la personne|gender='''f'''|en=the person}} is always feminine, even when it's talking about your uncle; {{French/Word|le professeur|gender='''m'''|en=the professor}} is always masculine, even when it's talking about your female professor or teacher.

The nouns that express things without an obvious gender (e.g., objects and abstract concepts) have only one form. This form can be masculine or feminine. For example, {{French/Word|la voiture|en=the car}} can only be feminine; {{French/Word|le stylo|en=the pen}} can only be masculine.

=== Exceptions ===

There are many exceptions to gender rules in French which can only be learned. There are even words that are spelled the same, but have a different meaning when masculine or feminine; for example, {{French/Word|le livre|gender='''m'''}} means ''the book'', but {{French/Word|la livre|gender='''f'''}} means ''the pound''. Some words that appear to be masculine (such as ''la photo'', which should be masculine but is not because it is actually short for ''la photographie'') are in fact feminine, and vice versa. Then there are some that just don't make sense; ''la foi'' is feminine and means ''faith'' or ''belief'', whereas ''le foie'' is masculine and means ''liver''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Articles}} ==

=== {{French/Section||The definite article|L'article défini}} ===

In English, the definite article is always ''the''.

In French, the definite article is changed depending on the noun's:
# gender
# plurality
# first letter
There are three definite articles and an abbreviation. ''Le'' is used for masculine nouns, ''La'' is used for feminine nouns, ''Les'' is used for plural nouns (both masculine or feminine), and ''L''' is used when the noun is singular and begins with a vowel or silent ''h'' (both masculine or feminine). It is similar to English, where ''a'' changes to ''an'' before a vowel.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French Grammar - The Definite Article.ogg|columns=7}}
| rowspan=2 | singular
| feminine
! la

| le fils || {{fr/IPA||approx=luh fees}} || the son
|-
| colspan=2 | singular, starting with a vowel sound
! l’
| {{fr/IPA|/l/}}
| l’enfant || {{fr/IPA||approx=lah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;-fah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;}} || the child
|-
| rowspan=3 colspan=&quot;2&quot; | plural
! rowspan=3 | les

|-
| les enfants || {{fr/IPA||approx=lay-zah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;-fah&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;}} || the children
|}

Unlike English, the definite article is used to talk about something in a general sense, a general statement or feeling about an idea or thing.

=== Elision ===
''Elision'' refers to the suppression of a final unstressed vowel immediately before another word beginning with a vowel. The definite articles ''le'' and ''la'' are shortened to ''l’'' when they come before a noun that begins with a vowel or silent ''h''. When pronounced, the vowel sound is dropped.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Elision.ogg|columns=5}}
| (le) ami || {{French/Section|→}} || '''l''''ami || {{French/Section|{{fr/IPA|approx=lah-mee}}}} || the (male) friend
|-
| (la) amie || {{French/Section|→}} || '''l''''amie || {{French/Section|{{fr/IPA|approx=lah-mee}}}} || the (female) friend
|-
| (le) élève || {{French/Section|→}} || '''l''''élève || {{French/Section|{{fr/IPA|approx=lay-lehv}}}} || the pupil
|-
| (la) heure || {{French/Section|→}} || '''l''''heure || {{French/Section|{{fr/IPA|approx=lewr}}}} || the hour, the time
|}

Elision does not occur on an aspired ''h'':
: (le) héros: {{French/Word|le héros|en=the hero}}

In addition to the definite article, elision will also occur with other words, such as ''que'', ''je'', ''le'', ''ce'', ''ne'', and ''de''.  The details on these words will be covered in later sections of the book.

=== {{French/Section||The indefinite article|L'article indéfini}} ===

In English, the indefinite articles are ''a'' and ''an''. ''Some'' is used as a plural article in English.

Again, indefinite articles in French take different forms depending on gender and plurality. The articles ''un'' and ''une'' literally mean ''one'' in French.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French Grammar - The Indefinite Article.ogg|columns=6}}
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | singular
| feminine
! une
| {{fr/IPA|/yn/|approx=ewn}} || une fille{{ref|une}} || a daughter
|-
| masculine
! un
| {{fr/IPA|/œ̃/|approx=uh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;}} || un fils || a son
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; | plural
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | des
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{fr/IPA|/dɛ/|approx=deh}}
| des filles || some daughters
|-
| des fils{{ref|desfils}} || some sons
|}

{{note|une}} ''une'' is often (more often than not) pronounced (''ewnuh'') in poetry and lyric.&lt;br /&gt;
{{note|desfils}} ''Des fils'' does mean ''some sons'', but is a homograph: it can also mean ''some threads'' (when pronounced like {{audio|/fil/|approx=feel}}).

=== ''Some'' ===
Note that ''des'', like ''les'', is used in French before plural nouns when no article is used in English. For example, you are looking at photographs in an album. The English statement ''I am looking at photographs.'' cannot be translated to French as ''Je regarde photographies.'' because an article is required to tell which photographs are being looked at. If it is a set of ''specific'' pictures, the French statement should be {{French/Word|Je regarde '''les''' photographies.|en=I am looking at '''the''' photographs.}} On the other hand, if the person is just browsing the album, the French translation is {{French/Word|Je regarde '''des''' photographies.|en=I am looking at ''some'' photographs.}}

=== Plurality, pronunciation, and exceptions ===
The plural of most nouns is formed by adding an ''-s''. However, the ''-s'' ending is not pronounced. It is the article that tells the listener whether the noun is singular or plural. &lt;!-- add examples --&gt;

Most singular nouns do not end in ''-s''. The ''-s'' is added for the plural form of the noun. ''Fils'' is one exception. Whenever the singular form of a noun ends in ''-s'', there is no change in the plural form.

{| {{French/Table|columns=4}}
|le fils&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|the son}}||les fils&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|the sons}}||un fils&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|a son}}||des fils&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|(some) sons}}
|-
|le cours&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|the course}}||les cours&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|the courses}}||un cours&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|a course}}||des cours&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|(some) courses}}
|}

The final consonant is almost always not pronounced unless followed by an ''-e'' (or another vowel). {{French/Word|Fils|IPA=/fis/|audio=Fr-fils.ogg|approx=fees}} is also an exception to this rule.

=== Liaison ===
Remember that the last consonant of a word is typically not pronounced unless followed by a vowel. When a word ending in a consonant is followed by a word beginning with a vowel sound (or silent ''h''), the consonant often becomes pronounced. This is a process called ''liaison''.  When a vowel goes directly after ''un'', the normally unpronounced ''n'' sound becomes pronounced.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Liaison with un.ogg|columns=4}}
| (un) ami
! un&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ami
| {{French/Section|{{audio|Fr-ami.ogg|approx=uh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;-nah-mee|/ɶ̃‿na.mi/}}}}
| {{French/Section|a (male) friend}}
|-
|(un) élève
! un&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;élève
| {{French/Section|{{audio|/ɶ̃‿ne.lɛv/|approx=uh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;-nay-lehv}}}} || {{French/Section|a pupil}}
|}

Compare the pronunciation to words without liaison:
: {{French/Word|un garçon|IPA=/ɶ̃ gaʁsɔ̃/|approx=uh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; gahr-soh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;|audio=Fr-garçon.ogg}}

''Une'' is unaffected by liaison.

Liaison also occurs with ''les'' and ''des''.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Liaison with les and des.ogg|columns=4}}
| (les) amis
! les&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;amis
| {{French/Section|{{audio|/le‿za.mi/|approx=lay-zhah-mee}}}} || {{French/Section|(some) (male) friends}}
|-
| (des) amis

| {{French/Section|{{audio|/dɛ‿za.mi/|approx=deh-zhah-mee}}}} || {{French/Section|(some) (female) friends}}
|}

As with elision, an aspired ''h'' isn't liaised:
: ''(les) hangars'': {{French/Word|les hangars|IPA=le æŋgəʁ}}

== {{French/Section|Vocabulary|Expressions}} ==

=== ''Qu’est-ce que c’est ?'' ===
To say ''What is it?'' or ''What is that?'' in French, {{French/Word|Qu’est-ce que c’est ?|IPA=/kɛs kə sɛ/|approx=kehs kuh seh}} is used. 

: {{French/Word|Qu'est-ce que…?|en=What is it that ?}} is used often to say ''What…?'' at the beginning  of sentences.

To respond to this question, you say ''C’est un(e) [''nom''].'', meaning ''It is a [''noun'']:
: {{French/Word|C'est un livre.|en=It's a book.}}

Remember that the indefinite article (''un'' or ''une'') must agree with the noun it modifies:
: {{French/Word|C'est un'''e''' chemise.|en=It's a shirt.}}

=== ''Il y a'' ===
{{French/Word|Il y a|IPA=/il.ja/|audio=Fr-il y a.ogg|approx=eel-y&lt;sup&gt;uh&lt;/sup&gt;ah when spoken or eel-ee-ah in lyric or poetry}} is used to say ''there is'' or ''there are''. ''Il y a'' expresses the existence of the noun it introduces.

: {{French/Word|Il y a une pomme.|en=There is an apple.}}

The phrase is used for both singular and plural nouns. Unlike in English (''is'' → ''are''), ''il y a'' does not change form. 

: {{French/Word|Il y a des pommes.|en=There are (some) apples.}}

The ''-s'' at the end of the most pluralised nouns tells you that the phrase is ''there are'' instead of ''there is''. In spoken French, when both the singular and plural forms almost always sound the same, the article (and perhaps other adjectives modifying the noun) is used to distinguish between singular and plural versions. 

''A'' is the present third person singular form of the verb ''to have'', and ''y'' is a pronoun meaning ''there''. The phrase ''il y a'', then, literally translates to ''he has there''. This phrase is used in all French tenses. It is important to remember that verb stays as a form of ''have'' and not ''be''.

=== ''Voici'' and ''voilà'' ===

Like in English, ''il y a…'' is not often used to point out an object. To point out an object to the listener, use {{French/Word|voici|IPA=/vwa.si/|audio=Fr-voici.ogg|approx=vwah-see}}, meaning ''over here is/are'' or ''right here is/are'', and {{French/Word|voilà|IPA=/vwa.la/|approx=vwah-lah}}, meaning ''over there is/are'', or ''there you have it''.

: {{French/Word|Voici les deux garçons !|en=Here are the two boys!}}

=== Examples ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">To Etothex, Greetings.

In re the [[US History]] textbook: After Chapter 20 (&quot;Eisenhower, Civil Rights, and the Fifties,&quot;) I consider that further chapters need to be added. But the question is- where should the line be drawn? I think that we can have one Chapter on the Vietnam War and the Seventies, and another on Reagan, but that we should end there. Everything after that seems to be too recent to be included. What is your personal opinion, if I may ask? Thanking you, [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 22:23, 4 Oct 2003 (UTC).

:Sure. I know lots of history books stop at Pres. Carter/Reagan because of several reasons, but maybe we could even get into the Clinton administration a bit. Definitely stop there, though. Current events haven't quite 'aged' enough yet. I just stopped at Eisenhower because I wasn't quite sure what to title them. I mean, I could say &quot;Chapter 21: The Vietnam War and the Sixties&quot;, but that suggests everything happened in the sixties and that's just not true. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 07:47, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Hey :) Great start on [[Vectors]]! I'd just ask one thing, don't use &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; for multiplication, since that could conceivably be confused with the dot product later. Writing a product without the dot is still pretty clear :) Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:51, 9 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Oh, sure. I'd written it when I was pretty sleepy and too lazy to look up the correct tex syntax for vectors, so I just wrote it out and didn't even think about dot product. :) I might add on trig later, if I feel like drawing some more diagrams. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 02:09, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Just another point, you don't need to &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; variables to get ''x''; you can just go &lt;nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;/nowiki&gt; - if you didn't know already :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:13, 14 Oct 2003 (UTC)
:Hmm, yeah. :) I did it because of the option in prefs for how to display tex syntax, as PNG or text. I've got a small monitor and even on 800x600(versus 1024x768) the text is small...So I kinda like it when I can turn on PNG when I need it. I don't know if anyone else uses this, but I find it convenient. I can switch back if it doesn't work, but otherwise, I'll just keep on doing it. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 23:36, 14 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:: Oh cool! I never really realized that you could do that; it's just easier when I type to just hit ' four times, I'm a lazy typist - I don't see any other real problem with it :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:21, 15 Oct 2003 (UTC)

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''Passé composé'' with ''être''}} ==

Most verbs form the ''passé composé'' with ''avoir'', however there are a small number of verbs that are always conjugated with ''être''.  In a general case, these verbs indicate a change in state or position.  

=== List of verbs ===

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Perfect oast with être verbs.ogg}}
| aller ||  ||  ||  || Je suis allé au cinéma. || I went to the cinema.
|-
| venir ||  ||  ||  || Je suis venu en France. || I came to France.
|-
| arriver ||  ||  ||  || Le train est arrivé. || The train has arrived.
|-
| partir ||  ||  ||  || Elle est partie travailler. || She left to go to work.
|-
| rester ||  ||  ||  || Je suis resté à la maison. || I stayed (at) home.
|-
| retourner ||  ||  ||  || Il est retourné au restaurant. || He returned to the restaurant.
|-
| tomber ||  ||  ||  || Je suis tombé dans la piscine. || I fell into the pool.
|-
| naître ||  ||  ||  || Je suis né en octobre. || I was born in October.
|-
| mourir ||  ||  ||  || Il est mort en 1917. || He died in 1917.
|-
| passer ||  ||  ||  || Il est passé devant la maison. || He went past in front of the house.
|-
| monter ||  ||  ||  || Je suis monté au sommet. || I climbed to the top.
|-
| descendre ||  ||  ||  || Il est descendu du train. || He got out of the train.
|-
| sortir ||  ||  ||  || Je suis sorti avec mes amies. || I went out with my friends.
|-
| entrer ||  ||  ||  || Je suis entré dans ma chambre. || I entered my room.
|-
| rentrer ||  ||  ||  || Il est rentré tôt de l'école. || He came back early from school.
|}

The verbs that take être can be easily remembered by the acronym ''MRS. DR VANDERTRAMP'':

{| {{French/Table|columns=11}}
! M||R||S||  ||D||R|| || || || || 
|-
| monté||resté||sorti||  ||devenu||revenu|| || || || || 
|-
! V||A||N||D||E||R||T||R||A||M||P
|-
| venu||arrivé||né||descendu||entré||rentré||tombé||retourné||allé||mort||parti
|}

=== Direct objects ===

These verbs take their conjugated ''avoir'' when they are immediately followed by a direct object

For Example,
: ''Je '''suis''' descendu.''
with the direct object ''mes bagages'' becomes
: ''J''''ai''' descendu mes bagages.''

As another example,
: ''Je '''suis''' monté.''
with the direct object ''mes bagages'' becomes
: ''J''''ai''' monté mes bagages.''

As another example, but with ''ils'' instead of ''je'',
: ''Ils '''sont''' sortis.''
with direct object ''leur passeport'' becomes
: ''Ils '''ont''' sorti leur passeport.''

=== Subject-past participle agreement===
When conjugating with ''être'', the past participles of the above verbs must agree with the subject of a sentence in gender and plurality. Note that there is no agreement if these verbs are conjugated with ''avoir''.

* If the subject is masculine singular, there is no change in the past participle.
* If the subject is feminine singular, an ''-e'' is added to the past participle.
* If the subject is masculine plural, an ''-s'' is added to the past participle.
* If the subject is feminine plural, an ''-es'' is added to the past participle.

{| {{French/Table|columns=2}}
| J suis allé'''(e)'''. || Nous sommes allé'''(e)s'''.
|-
| Tu es allé'''(e)'''. || Vous êtes allé'''(e)(s)'''.
|-
| Il est allé. || Ils sont allé'''s'''.
|-
| Elle est allé'''e'''. || Elles sont allé'''es'''.
|}

{{sectstub}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|The pronoun ''y''}} ==

=== Indirect object pronoun - ''to it, to them'' ===
The French pronoun ''y'' is used to replace an object of a prepositional phrase introduced by à.
*Je réponds aux (à les) questions. - J'y réponds.
*I respond to the questions. - I respond to them.
Note that ''lui'' and ''leur'', and not ''y'', are used when the object refers to a person or persons.

=== Replacement of places - ''there'' ===
The French pronoun ''y'' replaces a prepositional phrase referring to a place that begins with any preposition except ''de'' (for which ''en'' is used).
*Les hommes vont en France. - Les hommes y vont.
*The men go to France - The men go there.
Note that ''en'', and not ''y'' is used when the preposition of the object is ''de''.

=== Idioms ===
* ''Ça y est!'' - ''There we go!'', ''There you have it.''
* ''J'y suis!'' - ''I get it!''

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''-rir'' verbs|supplementary-id=french--rir-verbs}} ==
&lt;div id='french--rir-verbs'&gt;
These verbs are conjugated irregularly, and normally follow the ''-er'' conjugation scheme. In past participle form, ''-ir'' is replaced with ''-ert'' for these verbs.

=== Formation ===
A common ''-rir'' verb is ''ouvrir'':

{| class=wikitable
!'''ouvrir {{fr/IPA|/u.vʁiʁ/|audio=Fr-ouvrir.ogg}} !! to open'''
|-
|j'ouvre {{fr/IPA|/uvʁ/}} || I open
|-
|tu ouvres {{fr/IPA|/uvʁ/}} || you open
|-
|il ouvre {{fr/IPA|/uvʁ/}} || he opens
|-
|nous ouvrons {{fr/IPA|/u.vʁɔ̃/}} || we open
|-
|vous ouvrez {{fr/IPA|/u.vʁe/}} || you open
|-
|ils ouvrent {{fr/IPA|/uvʁ/}} || they open
|-
|ouvert {{fr/IPA|/u.vɛʁ/|audio=Fr-ouvert.ogg}} || opened
|}

The adjective {{French/Word|ouverture|en=opening|IPA=/u.vɛʁ.tyʁ/|audio=Fr-ouverture.ogg}} is derived from ''ouvrir'', and the adjective {{French/Word|ouvert|en=open|IPA=/u.vɛʁ/|audio=Fr-ouvert.ogg}} is derived from its past participle.

=== Other standard ''-rir'' verbs===

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/-rir verbs.ogg}}
| couvrir || {{audio|Fr-couvrir.ogg|/kuvʁiʁ/}} || to cover, to cover up
|-
| découvrir || {{audio|Fr-découvrir.ogg|/de.ku.vʁiʁ/}} || to discover 
|-
| offrir || {{audio|Fr-offrir.ogg|/ɔ.fʁiʁ/}} || to offer
|-
| recouvrir || {{audio|Fr-recouvrir.ogg}} || to cover again
|-
| rouvrir || {{audio|Fr-rouvrir.ogg}} || to reopen, to open again
|-
| souffrir || {{audio|Fr-souffrir.ogg|/sufʀiʀ/}} || to suffer, to endure
|}

=== ''-rir'' verb exceptions===

==== {{French/Section||To run|Courir}} ====

{| class=wikitable
!'''courir {{fr/IPA|/ku.ʁiʁ/|audio=Fr-courir.ogg}} !! to run'''
|-
|je cours {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-cours.ogg}} || I run
|-
|tu cours {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-cours.ogg}} || you run
|-
|il court {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-court.ogg}} || he runs
|-

|-

|-
|ils courent {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-courent.ogg}} || they run
|-
|couru {{fr/IPA|/ku.ʁy/|audio=Fr-couru.ogg}} || run
|}

==== {{French/Section||To die|Mourir}} ====
{| class=wikitable
!'''mourir {{fr/IPA|/mu.ʁiʁ/|audio=Fr-mourir.ogg}} !! to die'''
|-
|je meurs {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-meurs.ogg}} || I die
|-
|tu meurs {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-meurs.ogg}} || you die
|-
|il meurt {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-meurt.ogg}} || he dies
|-
|nous mourons {{fr/IPA|/ku.ʁɔ̃/|audio=Fr-mourons.ogg}} || we die
|-
|vous mourez {{fr/IPA|/ku.ʁe/|audio=Fr-mourez.ogg}} || you die
|-
|ils meurent {{fr/IPA|/kuʁ/|audio=Fr-meurent.ogg}} || they die
|-
|mort {{fr/IPA|/mɔʁ/|audio=Fr-mort.ogg}} || died
|}

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''Mourir'' is the only ''-ir'' verb that takes ''être'' as its helping verb in perfect tenses (and therefore agrees with the subject as a past participle in a perfect tense).

The word {{French/Word|mort|IPA=/mɔʁ/|audio=Fr-mort.ogg}} is also used as a noun, meaning ''death'' or ''dead person'', or as an adjective, meaning ''dead'':
: ''Le roi est mort.'' - ''The king is dead.''

The derived word {{French/Word|mourant|IPA=/mu.ʁɑ̃/}} means ''dying'' or ''person who is dying''.

==== {{French/Section||To acquire|Acquérir}} ====
{| class=wikitable
!'''acquérir {{fr/IPA|/a.ke.ʁiʁ/|audio=Fr-acquérir.ogg}} !! to acquire'''
|-
|j'acquiers {{fr/IPA|/a.kjɛʁ/|audio=Fr-meurs.ogg}} || I acquire
|-
|tu acquiers {{fr/IPA|/a.kjɛʁ/|audio=Fr-meurs.ogg}} || you acquire
|-
|il acquiert {{fr/IPA|/a.kjɛʁ/|audio=Fr-meurt.ogg}} || he acquires
|-
|nous acquérons {{fr/IPA|/a.ke.ʁɔ̃/|audio=Fr-mourons.ogg}} || we acquire
|-
|vous acquérez {{fr/IPA|/a.ke.ʁe/|audio=Fr-mourez.ogg}} || you acquire
|-
|ils acquièrent {{fr/IPA|/a.kjɛʁ/|audio=Fr-meurent.ogg}} || they acquire
|-
|acquis {{fr/IPA|/a.ki/|audio=Fr-mort.ogg}} || acquired
|}

''Acquis'' is also a noun, meaning ''asset''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Europe ==

In 1815, Europe had united to defeat French Emperor Napoleon. For a century since that time, there had been no major war in Europe. Countries had organized themselves in a complex system of alliances.

After Napoleon's defeat, the United Kingdom, France, Prussia, Russia, and Austria met in Vienna. These nations decided that if power in Europe was balanced, then no nation would become so powerful as to pose a threat to the others. The most important of these was the German Confederation. In 1871, after defeating France and Prussia, several small German nations merged into the German Empire. This upset the traditional balance of power. 

German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck began to construct a web of alliances to protect German dominance. Germany and the United Kingdom were on good terms, as Germany had not built a navy to rival British sea power. In 1873, Russia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Germany formed the Three Emperors' League. Nine years later, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Germany formed the Triple Alliance. In 1887, the Reinsurance Treaty ensured that Russia would not interfere in a war between France and Germany. 

During this time the British Queen Victoria built alliances in her own way. During years of relative peace, she had her children marry into many of the royal families of Europe, believing that this would solidify relations among the nations. In the first decade of the Twentieth century the Kaiser and the King of England were cousins through Victoria, as were the Tzar and Tzarina of Russia.

In 1890, Bismarck was fired by Kaiser Wilhelm II, who then began to undo many of Bismarck's policies. He decided to build up a German navy, antagonizing the United Kingdom. He did not renew German agreements with Russia. In 1894, this led Russia to form a new alliance with Germany's rival France.

In 1904, France and the United Kingdom decided to end centuries of bitter enmity by signing the Entente Cordiale. Three years later, those two nations and Russia entered the Triple Entente. Imperial Russia began to build its army, as did Germany and Austria-Hungary.

== War Breaks Out ==

Austria-Hungary was a patchwork of several nations ruled by the Habsburg family. Several ethnic groups resented rule by the Habsburgs. In June, 1914, the heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, traveled to Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip, who hated Habsburg rule, assassinated the Archduke and his wife. This assassination triggered the First World War.
[[Image:Vierbund05h.jpg|thumb|250px|The Central Powers.]]
The Austro-Hungarian government decided to retaliate by crushing Serbian nationalism. They threatened the Serbian government with war. Russia came to the aid of the Serbs. To oppose this alliance, Austria-Hungary called on Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm II said his country would give Austria-Hungary whatever it needed to win the war; in effect, a &quot;blank check.&quot; In addition to these open agreements, any of these countries might have had secret agreements with other states. The result was almost all of Europe at war, with the largest battlefield ever seen before.   

In July, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Germany began to mobilize their troops. The conflict in Austria-Hungary quickly spread over Europe. In August, Germany declared war on France. The Germans demanded that Belgium allow German troops to pass through the neutral nation. When King Albert of Belgium refused, Germany violated Belgian neutrality and invaded. Belgium appealed to the United Kingdom for aid. The British House of Commons threatened that Great Britain would wage war against Germany unless it withdrew from Belgium. The Germans refused, and the United Kingdom joined the battle. The Central Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary, were pitted against the Allies, the United Kingdom, Russia, and France.

== The Early Stages ==

German troops entered Belgium on August 4. By August 16, they had begun to enter France. The French Army met the Germans near the French border with Belgium. France lost tens of thousands of men in less than a week, causing the French Army to retreat to Paris. The Germans penetrated deep into France, attempting to win a quick victory.

On August 5, the United States formally declared their neutrality in the war. They also offered to mediate the growing conflict. In the United States, the opinions were divided. Some felt we should aid England, France, and Belgium because they were depicted as victims of barbarous German aggression and atrocities. Others felt we should avoid taking sides.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Don't Know Much About History&quot; by Kenneth C. Davis&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies won a key battle at Marne, repelling the German offensive. The Germans lost especially due to a disorganized supply line and a weak communications network. The French Army, however, had not completely defeated the Germans. Both sides continually fought each other, to no avail. On the Western Front, Germany and France would continue to fight for more than three years without any decisive victories for either side.

Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, Germany faced Russia. In the third week of August, Russian troops entered the eastern part of Germany. Germany was at a severe disadvantage because it had to fight on two different fronts, splitting its troops. However, despite Germany's disadvantage, no decisive action occurred for three years.

The United Kingdom used its powerful Royal Navy in the war against Germany. British ships set up naval blockades. The Germans, however, countered with submarines called U-boats. U-boats sank several ships, but could not, during the early stages of the war, seriously challenge the mighty Royal Navy.

The war spread to Asia when Japan declared war on Germany in August, 1914. The Japanese sought control of German colonies in the Pacific. Germany already faced a two-front war, and could not afford to defend its Pacific possessions. 

In October, 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered, allying itself with the Central Powers. The entry of the Ottoman Empire was disastrous to the Allies. The Ottoman Empire controlled the Dardanelles strait, which provided a route between Russia and the Mediterranean. The Ottoman sultan declared holy war- ''jihad''- against the Allies. Muslims in the British Empire and French Empire were thus encouraged to rebel against their Christian rulers.  However, the Allies' concerns were premature. Few Muslims accepted the sultan's proclamation. In fact, some Muslims in the Ottoman Empire supported the Allies so that the Ottoman Empire could be broken up, and the nations they ruled could gain independence.
 
== The Middle Stages ==

Between 1914 and 1917, the war was characterized by millions of deaths leading nowhere. Neither side could gain a decisive advantage on either front. 

In 1915, the Germans began to realize the full potential of Submarines. German Submarines engaged in official unrestricted warfare, engaging and sinking any ship found within the war zone regardless of the flag flown. Germany's justification for this use of force was that there was no certain method to ascertain the ultimate destination of the passengers and cargo carried by the ships in the war zone, and thus they were all taken as attempts at maintaining the anti-German blockade.

In May, 1915, Italy broke the Triple Alliance by becoming an Allied Power. In October, Bulgaria joined the Central Powers. Each side had induced their new partners to join by offering territorial concessions. Italy prevented Austria-Hungary from concentrating its efforts on Russia, while Bulgaria prevented Russia from having connections with other Allied Powers.

In May, 1916, one of the most significant naval battles in World War I occurred. The Royal Navy faced a German fleet during '''the Battle of Jutland'''. The Battle proved that the Allied naval force was still superior to that possessed by the Central Powers. The Germans grew even more dependent on U-boats in naval battle.

In August, 1916, Romania joined the Allies. Romania invaded Transylvania, a province of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But when the Central Powers struck back, they took control of important Romanian wheat fields.

In 1917, the liberal-democratic government of Russia that was lead by Aleksander Kerensky was over thrown by V.I. Lenin. When Lenin took over in Russia one of the things he promised was to change world politics. The terms by which Lenin wanted to changed world politics challenged Woodrow Wilson's and Lenin's Bolshevik-style revolutions spreading world wide was something that western leaders did not want. &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United States Declares War ==

Through all of this, America was neutral. It adopted the policy of '''isolationism''' because it felt that the increasing colonialism in Europe did not affect North America. There was a strong pacifist strain in American society, as evidenced by such popular songs as &quot;I Didn't Raise my Boy to be a Soldier&quot; and &quot;Don't Take My Darling Boy Away,&quot; though at the same time many ethnic groups agitated for involvement. Economic links with the Allies also made neutrality difficult. The British were flooding America with new orders, many of them for arms. The sales were helping America get out of its recession. Although this was good for the economic health of the United States, Germany saw America becoming the Allied arsenal and bank.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A People and A Nation&quot; the eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt; 

On May 7, 1915, the German navy sunk the Cunard Line passenger ship R.M.S. Lusitania, operating under the flag of Great Britain. Of the 1,959 passengers 1200 died, including one hundred twenty Americans. The ship's quick explosion was due to a hidden cargo of weaponry, a fact the American government denied. Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, a pacifist, resigned over Wilson's responsibility for the placement of arms and the consequent inevitability of war. Various American citizens from different ethnic groups put pressure on their government to join the war. However, the US government was calmed by the Germans, who agreed to limit submarine warfare. In 1917, the Germans reinstated unrestricted submarine warfare in order to cripple the British economy by destroying merchant ships, and break the sea blockade of Britain.  

On February 24, 1917, the American ambassador received a telegram in London from the British. It enclosed a British-decoded message, originally sent as a cyphered telegram from the German foreign Secretary, Arthur Zimmerman, to the ambassador in Mexico. Zimmerman proposed that the event of the war with the United States, Germany and Mexico would join in alliance. Germany would fund Mexico's conflict with the US: victory achieved.  Mexico would then be able to gain their lost territories with Arizona. The message was published in American newspapers on March 1st.&lt;ref&gt;''Teaching With Documents: The Zimmermann Telegram.''
http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/zimmermann/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of April 4, 1917 at 8:30 P.M., President Wilson appeared before a joint session of Congress, asking for the declaration of war to make the world &quot;safe for democracy.&quot; He was hoping for a quick resolution of the conflict. Congress complied on April 6, 1917. The United States was at last at war with Germany.  

The last American war had been the minor Spanish-American War a generation before. A draft of men above the age of eighteen ensued, but many more volunteered. Men wanted to escape their lives and join the military for a job and an adventure. American business and industry became involved as men created more military supplies, and jobs opened for building and designing new materials to be used in battle.

The US had to mobilize its military before it could aid the Allies by sending troops. The cadre of the U.S. Army had experience in mobilizing and moving troops from its Mexican expedition, but the Army needed to expand to over one million men, most of which were untrained. In the same way, the Navy could send a battleship division to assist the British Grand Fleet, but needed to expand. To supply the American forces, new supply lines in France would be needed south of the British and French lines, which meant the U.S. would take over the southern part of the Western Front battle line. The US could and did help the Allies with monetary assistance. Increased taxes and the sale of war bonds allowed the US to raise enormous sums of money. Politicians and celebrities, as well as such movie stars as Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, headed huge patriotic &quot;Bond Rallies,&quot; where people were encouraged to buy bonds.

A government committee to influence the public on the war was formed, the Committee on Public Information or CPI. Among its organs of publicity were the &quot;Four Minute Men,&quot; speakers who talked on pertinent subjects on Vaudeville stages, in movie theaters, and in public assemblies. There was also an organization of private citizens formed to root out German sympathizers, the American Protective League. A hit movie, &quot;The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin,&quot; was one hit of 1918. To strengthen the United States in this time of stress, families were encouraged to grow Victory gardens, and American women and African Americans were encouraged to go into jobs the servicemen had left. This is the beginning of the Great Migration, when Southern African Americans began moving to Northern cities for jobs.

== Trench Warfare ==

The U.S. commander, General John J. &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, faced immense pressure from the British and French governments to use American forces in small units to reinforce depleted British and French units. This was impossible politically. Pershing insisted to General Foch, the Generalissimo of the Allied armies, that the U.S. Army would fight as a single Army.  Pershing did not want to give his men to other Allied commanders, many of whose strategies he disagreed with. 

The European method of fighting, as it had been since the Boer War, was '''trench warfare'''. An army on the French battleground protected itself from the enemy with zigzag trenches, mines, barbed wire, and a line of rifles and machine guns. Between the enemy lines was a contested area, &quot;no man's land.&quot; An attempt to advance toward the enemy was met with gunfire. These trenches stalemated military advances, as any man who raised his head from the trenches would be shot. At the Battle of the Somme in 1916, for example, Allied troops suffered 600,000 dead and wounded to earn only 125 square miles; the Germans lost 400,000 men. Rain fell in the trenches. As one song put it, a soldier was &quot;Up to your waist in water, up to your eyes in slush.&quot; The damp produced a foot disease known as &quot;trench foot&quot;: if untreated, it could rot flesh from the bone. The close, unsanitary conditions of the front lines encouraged fleas and lice, and typhoid, typhus, and dysentery caused deaths unrelated to gunfire. Worst of all, perhaps, was that sometimes the enemy would gas your trench. There was no way to escape, and sometimes no masks to protect you.

First used by the Germans in April 1915, chlorine gas stimulated overproduction of fluid in the lungs, leading to death by drowning. One British officer tended to troops who had been gassed reported that, “quite 200 men passed through my hands . . . Some died with me, others on the way down . . . I had to argue with many of them as to whether they were dead or not.” Chlorine, mustard, and phosgene gas would continue in use throughout the war, sometimes blistering, sometimes incapacitating, and often killing.

== The End of the War ==

Despite the fact that the Germans could concentrate their efforts in one area, the Central Powers faced grim prospects in 1918. Encouraged by the United States joining the war, several nations joined the Allied Powers. The four Central Powers of Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria faced the combined might of the Allied Powers of the United Kingdom and the British Empire, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, France, Belgium, Japan, Serbia, Montenegro, San Marino, Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Cuba, Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, Costa Rica, Brazil, Liberia, Siam (Thailand) and China (some of the above nations did not support the war with troops, but did contribute monetarily.) The Germans launched a final, desperate attack on France, but it failed miserably. Due to Allied counterattacks, the Central Powers slowly began to capitulate.

Bulgaria was the first to collapse. A combined force of Italians, Serbs, Greeks, Britons, and Frenchmen attacked Bulgaria through Albania in September, 1918. By the end of September, Bulgaria surrendered, withdrawing its troops from Serbia and Greece, and even allowing the Allies to use Bulgaria in military operations.

British forces, led by T. E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia), together with nationalist Arabs, were successful in the Ottoman Empire. About a month after Bulgaria's surrender, the Ottoman Empire surrendered, permitting Allies to use the Ottoman territory, including the Dardanelles Strait, in military operations.

The Austro-Hungarian Empire also decided to surrender in October. The royal family, the Habsburgs, and the Austro-Hungarian government desperately sought to keep the Empire of diverse nationalities united. Though Austria-Hungary surrendered, it failed to unite its peoples. The once-powerful Austro-Hungarian Empire was destroyed by the end of October, splitting into Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. 

Germany, remaining all alone, also decided to surrender. President Wilson required that Germany accede to the terms of the Fourteen Points, which, among other things, required Germany to return territory acquired by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to Russia and the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to France. Germany found the terms too harsh, while the Allies found them too lenient. But when German Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated the throne, the new German government quickly agreed to Wilson's demands. On November 11, 1918, World War I had come to an end.

The war had been marked by millions and millions of casualties. The deaths were so wide-spread and so vast that people in England talked of &quot;The Lost Generation.&quot; Many died in battle, others died from disease and some even died after when hit with an influenza that spread throughout the whole world in 1918. Destruction of factories and farms, not to mention houses, created economic damage, and was one of the factors creating widespread European starvation during the winter of 1918-1919.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, damage was low in America. Although America had also suffered from the flu, the war had not touched U.S. shores. For years afterward, in Germany, France, and even British Commonwealth countries such as Canada, you could see men wearing artificial tin faces to hide battle wounds, men who wheezed because of damage from poison gas, and &quot;war cripples&quot; begging with bowls on the street corner. But American men were by-and-large intact. U.S. factories had been fully supplied, and the nation was on a sounder financial footing because of profit from the War.

At the end of the war, as American soldiers returned from Europe, employment rose. Some of the veterans returned to find themselves without homes or jobs. Overseas, some Black men were organized into a top fighting unit. However, Homeland outrage at the success helped to fuel riots in the notorious &quot;Red Summer&quot; of 1919. Each veteran returned with a certificate promising certain monies for their service; however, the certificate could not be cashed in until 1945.

== American After-Effects Of The War ==

===Suffrage For American Women===

An after-effect of the employment of women during the war was the Nineteenth Amendment, giving them the right to vote. There had been a '''Suffrage''' movement since the nineteenth century. President Wilson and his contemporaries were reluctant, but conceded it as a ''quid pro quo''. After the servicemen had returned, there were still two million more women in the workforce. However, instead of being in factory jobs, they were largely only permitted in &quot;women's work&quot;: the &quot;caring professions&quot; such as nurses or teachers, secretaries or &quot;stenographers,&quot; and waitresses, cooks, or washerwomen. These jobs paid little, and women were often expected to quit the job when they got married.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically active women still remained excluded from local and national power structures. Their voluntary organizations used tactics that advanced modern pressure-group politics. Issues ranged from birth control, peace, education, Indian Affairs, or opposition to lynching. Women in these associations lobbied legislators to support their causes. At the state level women achieved rights such as the ability to serve on juries. &lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The New Era; 1920-1929,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing Racial Tension===

Racism was already part of the American landscape, as shown by Jim Crow and lynchings. In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson segregated the Civil Service. However, the war and the Great Migration sparked more oppression and more violence. When White Americans were drawn into the army or defense industries, their jobs were sometimes given to Black workers, for lower wages. The owners considered this a double good, keeping production going while destroying the workingman unions which agitated for higher pay. But while bosses were dependent, for the moment, on Black workers, they did not think they owed anything to these employees. 

An influx of unskilled Black strikebreakers into East St Louis, Illinois, heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that Blacks were arming themselves for an attack on Whites resulted in numerous attacks by White mobs on Black neighborhoods. On July 1, Blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scale riot erupted which ended only after nine Whites and 39 Blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed. The anxieties of war helped fuel violence: Southern and Midwestern war vigilance committees formed the matrix for a revival of the Ku Klux Klan.

===The Great Experiment===

On August 1, 1917, the Senate voted to send the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution to the states for ratification. The vote was bi-partisan, 65 to 20. Section One read, in part, ''After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors [. . . ] is hereby prohibited.'' By 1919, the requisite number of states had ratified the Amendment. The Amendment actually came into effect, under its own terms, one year after ratification.

The Temperance movement had been in effect for more than a hundred years, since the Second Great Revival. The late 19th and early 20th century Anti-Saloon League had been successful in turning the discussion from social discouragement of alcohol to legal prohibition of the substance. It was not simply a creature of Protestant or Catholic Churches, but was &quot;united with Democrats and Republicans, Progressives, Populists, and suffragists, the Ku Klux Klan and the NAACP, the International Workers of the World, and many of America's most powerful industrialists including Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Andrew Carnegie – all of whom lent support to the ASL's increasingly effective campaign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roots of Prohibition. Web page in association of the Ken Burns documentary ''Prohibition.'' http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/roots-of-prohibition/ Retrieved on August 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

But if '''Prohibition''' was not a simple reaction to World War I, it drew strength from the conflict. The War was funded by an income tax, thus unlocking saloon profits from the interests of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Roots of Prohibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lever Act of 1917, with the aim of feeding soldiers, prohibited grain from being used for alcoholic beverages. There were nationalist concerns, too: the most famous brewers of beer had German last names.

== Treaty of Versailles ==
The Treaty of Versailles was the peace settlement signed after World War One had ended in 1918 and in the shadow of the Russian Revolution and other events in Russia. The treaty was signed at the vast Versailles Palace near Paris - hence its title - between Germany and the Allies. The three most important politicians there were David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau, and Woodrow Wilson. The Versailles Palace was considered the most appropriate venue simply because of its size - many hundreds of people were involved in the process and the final signing ceremony in the Hall of Mirrors could accommodate hundreds of dignitaries. Many wanted Germany, now led by Friedrich Ebert, smashed.  Others, like Lloyd George, were privately more cautious.
On June 28th 1919, the chief Allied and Associated Powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan met with the Central Powers in France to discuss a peace settlement.  British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, American President Woodrow Wilson, and French President Clemenceau were known as &quot;The Big Three.&quot;  Each of the Allied and Associated Powers had distinct national interests.  The UK wanted to keep the Royal Navy supreme by dismantling the German Navy.  The British also wished to end Germany's colonial empire, which might have become a threat to the vast British Empire.  Lloyd George wanted to be hard on the Germans to bolster his popular support at home in Great Britain.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/treaty_of_versailles.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  Italy wanted the Allies to fulfill their promise of territory given to Rome at the beginning of the war.  Clemenceau wanted Germany to be brought to its knees so it could never start another war against France.  The French also wanted Germany to compensate Paris for damage inflicted on France during the War.  Japan had already largely served its interests by taking over German colonies in the Pacific.  President Wilson's main goal for the conference was the creation of a &quot;League of Nations.&quot;  He believed that such an organization was essential to preventing future wars.  Many historians believe that Wilson's concentration on the League, forcing him to sacrifice possible compassion toward Germany, helped contribute to the conditions leading to World War II.

The Treaty of Versailles forced Germany to cede Alsace and Lorraine to France, dismantle its Army and Navy, give up its colonial Empire, pay massive reparations to the Allies, and take full responsibility for causing the war.  The conference also led to the creation of the League of Nations.  The US Senate, however, did not consent to the Treaty, and the European powers were left to enforce its provisions themselves.  This eventually led to violations of the treaty by Germany, which then led to the Second World War.  The treaty crippled the Weimar Government in Berlin and led to great bitterness in Germany, which helped to strengthen Adolf Hitler's National Socialist, or Nazi Party.

==Questions For Review==

1. What extended a conflict between Serbians and the Austro-Hungarian Empire into the globe-straddling World War I?

2. How did the advances of technology lead to trench warfare?

3. What in 1914-1915 led to an economic advantage for America from the War? What were the nation's post-war advantages?

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we look at the '''polynomial''' in some commutative ring with identity. What is interesting is that studying polynomials over some commutative ring with identity acts very much like numbers; the same rules often are obeyed by both.

== Definitions ==
A ''polynomial'' over some commutative ring with identity R is an expression in the form
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n a_jx^j; \forall a_j \in R, a_n \not = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and n &amp;isin; '''N''', and ''x'' is some indeterminate (''not'' a variable).

== Terminology ==
Given the first nonzero term in the polynomial, i.e. the term ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; above:
* ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is called the ''leading coefficient''
**Given 7''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+5 , 7 is the leading coefficient
* the polynomial has ''degree'' ''n''
**7''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+5 , 3 is the degree
* if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=1 the polynomial is termed ''monic''
**7''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+5 is ''not monic'', whereas ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-3''x''+2 are ''monic''.

In the above, if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=0 for all i, the polynomial is the ''zero polynomial''.

== Properties ==
Let R[x] be the set of all polynomials of all degrees. Clearly R is closed under addition and multiplication (although in a non-straightforward way), and thus we have that R[x] is itself a commutative ring with identity.

Assume now R is a field F; we do this so we can define some useful actions on polynomials

=== Division algorithm ===
Firstly recall the [[Famous Theorems of Mathematics/Number Theory/Basic Results (Divisibility)|division algorithm for numbers]], that each number can be decomposed into the form
: n = ''qk''+''r''
where ''q'' is the quotient and ''r'' the remainder and r&amp;lt;n.

Now, since we have that F is a field, we can do something similar with the polynomials over F, F[x]. 

If f(''x''), g(''x'') &amp;isin; F[x], with g(''x'') nonzero:
: f(''x'') = q(''x'')g(''x'')+r(''x'')

Again, q(''x'') is known as the quotient polynomial and r(''x'') the remainder polynomial.  Furthermore, we have the degree of r(x) &amp;le; degree of f(x)

We perform divisions by polynomial long division. For brevity we omit the ''x''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; terms. Here's an example. We divide ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2 by ''x''-1. First write:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
  &amp;    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note we place a 0 in any polynomial not present. Now ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/''x'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so we place a 1 in the second column to get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
  &amp;    &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Multiply ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; throughout the divisor ''x''-1 to get ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is (1 -1), so write this below like the following:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
  &amp;    &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp;-1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Now subtract (1 0) and (1 -1), drop the third 1 to get:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
  &amp;    &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp;   &amp; 1&amp; 1 &amp;   &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Now repeat, but divide by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; now (since we have subtracted and gotten (1 1) - ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''), and continue in the same fashion, to get:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
  &amp;    &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
1 &amp; -1 &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; -1&amp;   &amp;   &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; -1 &amp;  &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 2 &amp; 2 &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 2 &amp; -2 &amp; \\
  &amp;    &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 4 &amp; \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
So the quotient is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2, and the remainder is 4.

=== Euclidean algorithm ===
Now we have a working division algorithm for polynomials, the Euclidean algorithm, and hence the gcd of two polynomials can readily be found. 

==== Examples ====
Let's use a similar example above: what is gcd(''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2, ''x''-1)?
We've shown already above that
''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2=(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2)(''x''-1) + 4

Proceeding in the normal fashion in the Euclidean algorithm
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2=(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2)(''x''-1) + 4
:gcd(''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2, ''x''-1) = gcd(''x''-1,4)

and the greatest common divisor of any monomial and an integer is clearly 1, so ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2 and ''x''-1 are coprime.

For a second example, consider gcd(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-1,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+1)

:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+1=&lt;u&gt;(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-1)&lt;/u&gt;*1+&lt;u&gt;2''x''+2&lt;/u&gt;
:''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-1=&lt;u&gt;(2''x''+2)&lt;/u&gt;*''x''/2+ &lt;u&gt;-(x+1)&lt;/u&gt;
:2''x''+2=&lt;u&gt;-(x+1)&lt;/u&gt;*(-2)+&lt;u&gt;0&lt;/u&gt;

Since factors of -1 make no difference, gcd(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-1,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+1) is -(''x''+1)

=== Irreducibles===
We've seen that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2 and ''x''-1 are coprime; they have no factors in common. So, are we able to determine &quot;prime&quot; polynomials? Indeed we can - depending on the field that the polynomial lies in. We call these ''irreducibles'' instead of primes.

==== Example ====
Take p(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 over '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Now we can factor this polynomial if it has a root - from the factor theorem (which also holds for polynomials over any commutative ring with identity) p(k)=0 means k is a root. So, let's look at the following:
Since we're in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, we luckily only need to check three values
p(0)=2
p(1)=1
p(2)=2
So we have p(''x'') having no roots - it is irreducible (&quot;prime&quot;).

Now observe an interesting fact. Take the exact same polynomial but instead over '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The polynomial then is equivalent to 
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+0
and thus has root p(0)=0 and thus ''is reducible'' but ''over'' '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

So the reducibility of the polynomial depends on the field it is in.

=== Showing irreducibility===
The general procedure to show a polynomial is irreducible is:
* observe its degree
* identify possible factorizations
* eliminate these factorizations
effectively a proof by cases.

For example, consider the polynomial q(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2 in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. To prove it is irreducible, observe that q(''x'') could be factorized in the  following ways:
# linear, irreducible cubic
# linear, linear, irreducible quadratic
# linear, linear, linear, linear
# irreducible quadratic, irreducible quadratic

So we can prove 1, 2, 3 by showing it has no linear factors. 4 is a little more difficult. Let us proceed to show it has no linear factors:
Observe
: q(0)=2
: q(1)=1
: q(2)=2
So q has no linear factors. Now, we need to show that q is not the product of two irreducible quadratics. 

In '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, we have the quadratics 
:{''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x'',''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+1,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x'',''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+1,''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+2}
We can identify the irreducible quadratics easily by inspection. We then obtain
:{''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+2}

If we can show that neither of these polynomials divide q(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+''x''+2, we have shown q(''x'') is irreducible. 

Let us try ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1 first.
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; | &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   \\
  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\
  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 \\
  &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
We have a remainder, so ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1 doesn't divide q. 
On dividing the other polynomials, we all get a remainder. (''Verify this for yourself as practice'').

So q(''x'') is irreducible in '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Modular arithmetic and polynomials==
Since we have a working polynomial division and factor theorem, and that polynomials appear to mimic the behaviour of the integers - can we reasonably define some sort of modular arithmetic with polynomials?

We can indeed. If we have a field '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;[''x''] and we wish to find all the remainders (remember, these remainders are polynomials) on dividing by some polynomial m(''x''), we can do so by polynomial long division. 

If m(''x'') is irreducible, then the set of remainders as above forms a field.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Category theory''' is the study of ''categories'', which are collections of objects and ''morphisms'' (or arrows), from one object to another. It generalizes many common notions in Algebra, such as different kinds of products, the notion of kernel, etc. See [[Category Theory]] for additional information.

== Definitions &amp; Notations ==

'''Definition 1:''' A ''(locally small) category'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; consists of

:A collection &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Obj}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; of ''objects''.

:A collection &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Arr}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; of ''morphisms''.

:For any &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in\mathrm{Obj}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is the subcollection of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Arr}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; of morphisms from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, where each &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is required to be a set (hence the term ''locally small'').

These obey the following axioms:

:There is a notion of ''composition''. If &lt;math&gt;X,Y,Z\in\mathrm{Obj}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathrm{Hom}(Y,Z)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are called a composable pair. Their composition is a morphism &lt;math&gt;g\circ f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt;.

:Composition is associative. &lt;math&gt;f\circ(g\circ h)=(f\circ g)\circ h&lt;/math&gt; whenever the composition is defined.

:For any object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an identity morphism &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_X\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,X)&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;Y,Z&lt;/math&gt; are objects, &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathrm{Hom}(Z,X)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_X\circ f=f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\circ\mathrm{id}_X=g&lt;/math&gt;.


Note that we demand neither &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Obj}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Arr}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt; to be sets; if they are both in fact sets, then we call our category ''small''.


'''Definition 2:''' A morphism &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has associated with it two functions &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dom}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cod}&lt;/math&gt; called ''domain'' and ''codomain'' respectively, such that &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{dom}\,f=X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cod}\,f=Y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f,g&lt;/math&gt; are composable if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{cod}\,f=\mathrm{dom}\,g&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 3:''' Unless confusion is possible, we will usually not specify which Hom-set a given morphism belongs to. Also, unless several categories are in play, we will usually not write &lt;math&gt;X\in\mathrm{Obj}(\mathcal{C})&lt;/math&gt;, but just &quot;&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an object&quot;. We may write &lt;math&gt;X\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}Y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; to implicitly indicate the Hom-set &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; belongs to. We may also omit the composition symbol, writing simply &lt;math&gt;gf&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;g\circ f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Basic Properties ==

'''Lemma 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be an object of a category. The the identity morphism for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is unique.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; are identity morphisms for &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;i=i\circ j=j&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 5:''' We present some of the simplest categories:

:i) &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the ''empty category'', with no objects and no morphisms.

:ii) &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; is the category containging only a single object and its identity morphism. This is the ''trivial category''.

:iii) &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; is the category with two objects, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, their identity morphisms, and a single morphism &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;.

:iv) We can also have a category like &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, but where we have two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f,g\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f\neq g&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are called ''parallel morphisms''.

:v) &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; is the category with three objects &lt;math&gt;X,Y,Z&lt;/math&gt;. We have &lt;math&gt;f\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g\in\mathrm{Hom}(Y,Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h=gf\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,Z)&lt;/math&gt;.


=== Initial and Final Objects ===
'''Definition''' An object &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in a category is called initial or cofinal, if for any object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;f:I\to X&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''' If &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; are initial objects, then they are isomorphic. 

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;i:I\to J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j:J\to I&lt;/math&gt; be the unique morphisms between &lt;math&gt; I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;. Given that both &lt;math&gt; I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; have a unique endomorphism because of their initiality, this morphism must be the identity. Therefore &lt;math&gt;i\circ j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j\circ i&lt;/math&gt; are the respective identity morphisms, making &lt;math&gt; I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; isomorphic.


'''Definition''' An object &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in a category is called final or coinitial, if for any object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique morphism &lt;math&gt;f:X\to F&lt;/math&gt;

'''Lemma''' If &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are final objects, then they are isomorphic.

''Proof'' Pass to isomorphicness of initial objects in the cocategory.

== Some examples of categories ==

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;: the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are maps between sets.

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{FinSet}&lt;/math&gt;: the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are maps between finite sets.

*The category whose objects are open subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{\R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and whose morphisms are continuous (differentiable, smooth) maps between them.

*The category whose objects are smooth (differentiable, topological) manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth (differentiable, continuous) maps.

*Let &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; be a field.  Then we can define &lt;math&gt;k-\mathbf{Vect}&lt;/math&gt;: the category whose objects are vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and whose morphisms are linear maps between vector spaces over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.

*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Group}&lt;/math&gt;: the category whose objects are groups and whose morphisms are homomorphisms between groups.

In all the examples given thus far, the objects have been sets with the morphisms given by set maps between them.  This is not always the case.  There are some categories where this is not possible, and others where the category doesn't naturally appear in this way.  For example:

*Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; be any category.  Then its opposite category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}^{op}&lt;/math&gt; is a category with the same objects, and all the arrows reversed.  More formally, a morphism in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}^{op}&lt;/math&gt; from an object &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;.

*Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be any monoid.  Then we can define a category with a single object, with morphisms from that object to itself given by elements of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with composition given by multiplication in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

*Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be any group.  Then we can define a category with a single object, with morphisms from that object to itself given by elements of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with composition given by multiplication in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

*Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be any small category, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be any category.  Then we can define a category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}^\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; whose objects are functors from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and whose morphisms are natural transformations between the functors from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Cat}&lt;/math&gt;: the category whose objects are small categories and whose morphisms are functors between small categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Racism==
Racism was a major blight of the 1890s', largely unacknowledged by the government in Washington. The freedoms which had been given to the former slaves by Emancipation were taken away in Southern states. Every one of them passed laws which disenfranchised African Americans, including poll taxes and literacy tests. The notorious Jim Crow laws, named for an old minstrel show song, started to take effect even in some states which had not seceded. Blacks were barred from public drinking fountains, bathrooms, and train cars, and directed by sign to &quot;Negro only&quot; facilities which were often dirty and defective. A new set of photographic post cards started going through the mail. These showed the results of public lynchings, largely of African American men. Many of these postcards show large crowds, some including White children, and the hung, mutilated, or burnt body of the victim. These proud shows seldom resulted in any prosecution of the attackers, who sometimes included local public officials.

In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans’ involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury’s wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting.

== Industrialization ==

In the 1870's, as the Civil War receded into memory, the United States became a leading Industrial power. Advances in technology and new access to the immense resources of the North American continent drove American Industrialization. This industrialization brought the growth of new American cities such as Chicago, and the arrival of a flood of immigrants from all over Europe to man the factories. During the Gilded Age, businessmen reaped enormous profits from this new economy. Powerful tycoons formed giant trusts to monopolize the production of goods that were in high demand. Andrew Carnegie built a giant steel empire using vertical integration, a business tactic that increased profits by eliminating middlemen from the production line. Jay Gould grabbed the railroads, and then the resources brought by those railroads. Though industrialization caused many long-term positives, it did cause problems in the short-term.&lt;ref&gt;“The Gilded Age &amp; the Progressive Era (1877–1917),” founded on January 15, 2011,  http://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/gildedage/summary.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rich farmers who could afford new machinery grew even richer, while poorer farmers were forced to move to urban areas, unable to compete in the agricultural sector. 

In 1878 the U.S. had entered an era of success after a long downfall of the mid 1870's. The number of manufacturing plants and number of people doubled. By the 1900s the South had more than 400 mills. Women and children worked in bad conditions for up to 12 to 16 hours per day. They only made about a half a dollar per day, equivalent to fifteen 2015 dollars.

In 1868 the typewriter was perfected by an editor named Christopher Sholes. This invention brought about a wave of new employment opportunities for women. The machine was made popular by several authors, most notably Mark Twain: the first to make a typewritten manuscript, and the first to send it to a printer. Not even the best and most accurate copperplate printer could fit as many words on a page as the standard typewriter. (For many years, a &quot;typewriter&quot; was the name for the person operating the machine.) It was cheaper to employ women than men as typists and telephone and telegraph operators. Along with this new machine also came other inventions such as the telephone and the telegraph. In the 1890s the number of telephone and telegraph operators went up 167 percent, and the number of women stenographers and typists went up 305 percent. 

The Woman's Movement, the group of women advocating women's suffrage and equality, continued after the Civil War. Even many women who were not interested in the Vote were creating clubs and crusades, advocating for public issues both before and after marriage. The argument of &quot;separate spheres&quot; for men and women, the rough public world for the former and the gentle domestic world for the latter, was being contested. Jane Addams argued that “If women have in any sense been responsible for the gentler side of life which softens and blurs some of its harsher conditions, may not they have a duty to perform in our American cities?”  

Among the early innovations in technology was development of the internal-combustion engine. In 1885 a German engineer, Gottlieb Daimler, built a lightweight engine driven by vaporized gasoline. This development inspired American Henry Ford. In the 1880's, while he was still an electrical engineer in Detroit's Edison Company, Ford experimented in his spare time using Daimler's engine to power a vehicle. George Selden, a Rochester, New York, lawyer, had already been tinkering with such technology, but it was Ford who created a massive industry.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Machine Age: 1877-1920,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009), 512.&lt;/ref&gt;

As industrialization increased, more job opportunities opened. Factory jobs were perfect for women and children, with their smaller hands and their lower pay rates. Despite terrible work conditions, increasing numbers of women moved from the home to factories. But while women became part of the factory floor, virtually none were trusted with management, or even with handling money. The factories also took in immigrants and used them as cheap labor. Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Germany and Jews from Eastern Europe were second-class citizens in the workplace, with very low wages and no benefits. Without safety precautions, workers often suffered serious injury and lost their jobs. 

Workers adjusted to mechanization as best they could. Some people submitted to the demands of the factory, machine, and time clock. Some tried to blend old ways of working into the new system. Others turned to resistance. Individuals challenged the system by ignoring management's orders, skipping work, or quitting. But also, anxiety over the loss of independence and a desire for better wages, hours, and working conditions drew disgruntled workers into unions. &lt;ref&gt; Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Machine Age: 1877-1920,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009), 522.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cities, laborers and employers often clashed over wages, sanitary conditions, working hours, benefits, and several other issues. Laborers organized themselves into unions to negotiate with companies. The companies, however, attempted to shut down labor unions. Some imposed ''yellow dog contracts'', under which an employer could dismiss a worker who participated in union activity. 

In 1886, the American Federation of Labor was formed to fight for laborers in general. The AFL and other union groups employed as many tactics as possible to force employers to accede to their demands. One tactic was the strike. Some strikes escalated into riots, as with the Knights of Labor's strike in 1886 becoming the Haymarket Riots. The Haymarket Riots of 1886 occurred when an unknown person threw a dynamite bomb into a group of police officers. Eight officers were killed in the explosion and gunfight that ensued. As a result, eight anarchists were tried for murder -- four were sentenced to death and one committed suicide. 

The Pullman Strike occurred in 1894, in response to Pullman Company workers' wages being cut following the Panic of 1893, an economic depression which was caused in part by excessive railroad speculation.  Approximately 3,000 workers began the strike on May 11.  Many of the workers were members of the American Railway Union, and although the strike began without authorization from union officials (known as a &quot;wildcat strike&quot;), the ARU eventually supported the strike by launching a nationwide boycott of Pullman cars on June 26.  Within four days, approximately 125,000 ARU members had quit their jobs rather than switch Pullman cars.  On July 6, President Cleveland sent Army troops to break up the strike, ostensibly because it prevented delivery of mail and was considered a threat to public safety.

The companies sometimes retaliated against strikes by suing the unions. Congress had passed the Sherman Antitrust Act to prevent trusts, or corporations that held stock in several different companies, from obstructing the activities of competitors. Though the Sherman Act was intended to target trusts, the companies sued the union under it, claiming that unions obstructed interstate commerce.

During the machine age, there were a number of strikes that took place due to the demands from factories and time clocks. It was hard for individuals to adjust to that system, and as a result, they challenged the system by ignoring management's orders, skipping work, or quitting. The desire and longing for better wages let to anxiety and frustration. Like farming and mining, industry was massive in size and changed not only the nature of the work but the person doing it. Soon, all of these disgruntled individuals formed specialized groups into unions. The different jobs varied in not only skill, but other things as well that were non-related to worker conflict; race, sex, etc. These jobs were such as working on/in railroads, steel factories, and automobiles.  The outcome for many working in labor during the Gilded Age led to horrific labor violence. Industrialists and workers literally fought over control of the workplace. Many suffered due to the strikes and riots and it inevitably led to deaths, loss of jobs, and often continuous violence. For most American workers, the Machine age had varying results. At times there was no job stability and when costs of living would increase drastically there were even more problems.
&lt;ref&gt; Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The Machine Age: 1877-1920,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009), &lt;/ref&gt;

Prices, and consequently wages, fell sharply in about the 1870s and stayed that way all the way through the 1970s. The prices of necessities in the late 1800s were: 4 pounds butter for $1.60, 1 bag of flour $1.80, a quart of milk for $0.56, vegetables $0.50, 2 bushels of coal $1.36, soap, starch, pepper, salt, vinegar, etc. $1.00, rent for $4.00 a week, and more. The average total of a person's wages was $16.00. By the time that person bought the necessities such as food and soap and rent, most, if not all, of the money would be gone.

== Urbanization ==
With industrialization came urbanization.  The increasing factory businesses created many more job opportunities in the cities.  Soon people began to flock from rural, farm areas, to large cities.  Minorities and immigrants added to these numbers.  Factory jobs were the only jobs some immigrants could get, and as more came to the cities to work, the larger the urbanization process became. In 1870 there were only two American cities with a population of more than 500,000, but by 1900 there were six, and three of these, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia had over one million inhabitants. Roughly 40 percent of Americans lived in cities and the number was climbing. These large populations in the cities caused the crime rates to go up, and disease was rapidly spreading. Not only did urbanization cause cities to grow in population, it also caused cities to grow in building size. Skyscrapers were being built in the cities and the idea of mass transit had started.
With these mass transits being built it allowed people to commute to work from further distances. Suburbs were beginning to form and higher class families began to move to them to get out of the over crowded city but still gave them the ability to go into the city to work each day.
City living was for the lower class the upper class had enough money to get away from all of the pollution and the city stench. This still holds true today in larger cities a lot of the nicer homes are located further out from the center of the city. For example, in the city of Chicago, you will find a lot of the nicer homes away from the city, and more towards the suburbs. In this case, this is because there are a lot of violence in the inner city. Therefore, people try to live more further out from the city in order to stay away from the violence.

== Agriculture ==
In the late 1880s and early 1900s, a typical farm would be about 100 acres. Farmers could only plow with the aid of a horse or a mule. Later on the internal combustion engine was used to create tractors. Unlike Southern cotton plantations, most farms raised a variety of foodstuffs, breeding cows, pigs and chickens, and growing turnips, potatoes, carrots, wheat, and corn. They were often self-sufficient. Farmers made their bread from their own wheat, and killed the runt pig for their own table. 

While industry generally increased in importance, farmers struggled due to debt and falling prices. In the 1880s there were crop failures. Steamships and railways brought in wheat from abroad, lowering American farm prices still more. Economic transformation created industrial prosperity and new lifestyles, but in states still dominated by farming these changes also had a widespread negative effect. Crop diversification and a greater focus on cotton as a cash crop did not give many farmers any potential to get ahead.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia of Arkansas History and Culture; “Post-Reconstruction through the Gilded Age, 1875 through 1900,” last modified on 12/17/2010, http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=402&lt;/ref&gt;

American farmers helped to create regulation of the railroads. When domestic farmers needed to transport their crops, they also had to rely on the railroad system. But railroads often charged outrageous prices. Farmers, small merchants, and reform politicians started to demand rate regulation. In 1877, in Munn v. Illinois, the Supreme Court upheld the principle of state regulation, declaring that grain warehouses owned by railroads acted in the public interest and therefore must submit to regulation for the common good. By 1880 fourteen states had established commissions to limit freight and storage charges of state-chartered lines. 

Between 1860 and 1905 the number of farms tripled from two million to six million. In 1905 the number of people living on farms grew to thirty-one million. The value of farms went from eight billion in 1860 to thirty billion in 1906. Then as now, wheat was a major crop, creating such common food as bread, a major source of both starch and protein for poorer people.

Farmers had to rise early, often at four or five in the morning. Cows and goats had to be milked twice a day, at morning and at evening. Chickens' eggs were gathered every morning, cleaned, and packed in cases. Because they laid eggs, female chickens or pullets were more important than the male chickens or roosters. Because of this, and to keep roosters from attacking each other, poultry farmers would have only one rooster with several hens. 

After the Civil War, more prosperous farmers gained more machinery to plant and harvest their crops. In 1879 the centrifugal cream separator was patented. In 1885, chicken raising became a lot more profitable due to the invention of the mechanized incubator. Complicated horse-drawn mechanical combines and threshers were used about this time. With the aid of machines a farmer could harvest about 135 acres of wheat; without them, he or she could only harvest about 7.5 acres of wheat in the same amount of time. The Montgomery Ward &amp; Company mail order catalogue of 1895 listed various grist mills, seeders and planters, a hay pitcher, a hay tedder, and nearly a full page of mechanical churns.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Catalogue and Buyers' Guide No. 57, Spring And Summer 1895. Unabridged reprint. Dover: NY, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imperialism ==

As time progressed, Industrialization caused American businessmen to seek new international markets in which to sell their goods. In addition, the increasing influence of Social Darwinism led to the belief that the United States had the inherent responsibility to bring concepts like industry, democracy and Christianity to less scientifically developed, &quot;savage&quot; societies. The combination of these attitudes, along with other factors, led the United States toward Imperialism, the practice of of a nation increasing its sphere of influence. 

=== The Orient ===

In the Orient, Russia, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany all exercised influence.{{Citation needed}} US Secretary of State John Hay endorsed the ''Open Door Policy'', under which all foreign powers would exercise equal economic power in the Orient. The US thus protected its interests in China and maintained a balance of power there.

Chinese nationalists known as the &quot;Righteous Fists of Harmony&quot;, or &quot;Boxers&quot; in English, who resented foreign influence, promoted hatred of non-Chinese as well as Chinese Christians. In June 1900 in Beijing, Boxer fighters threatened foreigners and forced them to seek refuge in the Legation Quarter. In response, the initially hesitant Empress Dowager Cixi, urged by the conservatives of the Imperial Court, supported the Boxers and declared war on foreign powers. Diplomats, foreign civilians, soldiers, and Chinese Christians in the Legation Quarter were under siege by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers for 55 days. The siege was raised when the Eight-Nation Alliance brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army, and captured Beijing. The Boxer Protocol of 7 September 1901 specified an indemnity of 67 million pounds (450 million taels of silver), more than the government's annual tax revenue, to be paid over a course of thirty-nine years to the eight nations involved.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, ''In Search of Modern China'', pp. 230-235; Keith Schoppa, ''Revolution and Its Past'', pp. 118-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spanish Territories ===

By 1825 Spain had acknowledged the independence of its possessions in the present-day United States. The only remnants of the Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere were Cuba, Puerto Rico, across the Pacific in the Philippines Islands, as well as the Carolina, Marshall, and Mariana Islands (including Guam) in Micronesia.

In 1898, the American battleship USS ''Maine'' was destroyed by an explosion in the Cuban Harbor of Havana. Although later investigations proved that an internal problem was to blame, at the time it was thought that Spanish forces had sunk it. On the advice of Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, President William McKinley asked Congress to declare war on April 11, 1898. Senator Henry M. Teller of Colorado added an amendment to the proposed U.S. declaration of war against Spain on April 19, which proclaimed that the United States would not establish permanent control over Cuba. The amendment stated that the United States &quot;hereby disclaims any disposition of intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said island except for pacification thereof, and asserts its determination, when that is accomplished, to leave the government and control of the island to its people.&quot; 

At that time Spanish troops stationed on the island included 150,000 regulars and 40,000 irregulars and volunteers while rebels inside Cuba numbered as many as 50,000. Total U.S. army strength at the time totalled 26,000, requiring the passage of the Mobilization Act of April 22 that allowed for an army of at first 125,000 volunteers (later increased to 200,000) and a regular army of 65,000. 

On April 25, 1898 Congress declared war on Japan. The United States Navy won two decisive naval battles, destroying the Spanish Pacific Fleet at Manila in the Philippines and the Atlantic fleet at Santiago, Cuba. The U.S. then landed forces in Cuba, which fought the tropical climate and associated diseases as well as the Spanish forces. In the Battle of San Juan Hill (actually Kettle Hill), Lt. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt earned a reputation as a military hero by leading the attack on entrenched Spanish positions. The regiment to which Roosevelt belonged, the First U.S. Volunteers, was recruited throughout the United States and known as the ''Rough Riders'' because of the large number of cowboys to volunteer. The 10th Cavalry, a regiment of black soldiers, supported the Rough Riders in the attack.  Joseph Wheeler, a Confederate general of the Civil War, commanded U.S. forces in Cuba. Two of Robert E. Lee's nephews were also U.S. generals. The war ended eight months later with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. As a result Spain lost its control over the remains of its overseas empire. The treaty allowed the United States to purchase the Philippines Islands from Spain for $20 million. The war had cost the United States $250 million and 3,000 lives, of whom 90% had perished from infectious diseases. True to the letter of the Teller Amendment, American forces left Cuba in 1902.

The Spanish-American War was seen domestically as a sign of increasing national unity.

=== Hawaii ===

The Kingdom of Hawaii was established in 1795 with the subjugation of the smaller independent chiefdoms of Oʻahu, Maui, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kauaʻi and Niʻihau by the chiefdom of Hawaiʻi (or the &quot;Big Island&quot;), ruled by the dynasty of King Kamehameha the Great. In 1887 the Honolulu Rifle Company, a paramilitary force also known as the Honolulu Rifles, deposed the Hawaiian monarchy and forced King David Kalākaua to sign a new constitution at gunpoint. The bayonets fixed to their guns led to the term Bayonet Constitution. No voting rights were extended to Asiatics and the requirements for voting rights included land ownership. The Bayonet Constitution has become one of the most controversial documents in history.

Native-born, European-descended Hawaiian Sanford B. Dole, serving as a friend of both Hawaiian royalty and the elite immigrant community, advocated the westernization of Hawaiian government and culture. Dole was a lawyer and jurist in the Hawaiian Islands as a kingdom, protectorate, republic and territory. King Kalākaua appointed Dole a justice of the Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii on December 28, 1887, and to a commission to revise judiciary laws on January 24, 1888. After Kalākaua's death, his sister Queen Liliʻuokalani appointed him to her Privy Council on August 31, 1891. 

On January 17, 1893, the Queen, the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, was deposed in a coup d'état led largely by American citizens opposed to her attempt to establish a new Constitution. Dole was named president of the Provisional Government of Hawaii formed after the coup, and was recognized within forty-eight hours by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, with the exception of the United Kingdom.

The Americans in Hawaii asked the US to annex the islands, but President Benjamin Harrison's annexation treaty was stalled in the Senate by Democrats until a Democratic President, Stephen Grover Cleveland, took office. With Grover Cleveland's election as President of the United States, the Provisional Government's hopes of annexation were derailed. In fact, Cleveland tried to directly help reinstate the monarchy, after an investigation led by James Henderson Blount. The Blount Report of July 17, 1893, commissioned by President Cleveland, concluded that the Committee of Safety conspired with U.S. ambassador John L. Stevens to land the United States Marine Corps, to forcibly remove Queen Liliʻuokalani from power, and declare a Provisional Government of Hawaii consisting of members from the Committee of Safety. Although unable to restore Lili'uokalani to her former position, Cleveland withdrew the treaty. 

The Territory of Hawaii or Hawaii Territory existed as a United States organized incorporated territory from July 7, 1898, until August 21, 1959, when its territory, with the exception of Johnston Atoll, was admitted to the Union as the fiftieth U.S. state.

== President Grover Cleveland ==
In 1884, as the presidential campaign season approached, the Republican party chose former Speaker of the House James G. Blane as its candidate, with John Logan as the vice presidential candidate. Against them the Democrats ran New York governor Stephen Grover Cleveland for a presidential candidate and vice presidential candidate Thomas A. Hendricks. Cleveland and Hendricks won&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Super Review; United States History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; with the combined support of Democrats and reform Republicans, the &quot;Mugwumps.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Biography of Cleveland at http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/grovercleveland24, noted on August 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Grover Cleveland was the only Democrat elected to the presidency during the era of Republican political domination that lasted from 1860 to 1912. In fact, he won the popular vote for president three times, in 1884, 1888, and 1892. His last election in 1892 defeated Republican president Benjamin Harrison. He was thus the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms, and is the only individual to be counted twice in the numbering of the presidents. (In that last election, Cleveland's vice president was Adlai E. Stevenson; Harrison's Vice President was Whitelaw Reid.) Cleveland's conservative economic stand in favor of the gold standard brought him the support of various business interests. The democrats then won control of both houses of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Super Review; United States History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Progressivism ==

Industrialization led to the rise of big businesses at the expense of the worker. Factory laborers faced long hours, low wages, and unsanitary conditions. The large corporations protected themselves by allying with political parties. The parties, in turn, were controlled by party leaders, rather than by the voters. The Progressive movement was an effort to cure America: not so much an organized movement, but a general spirit of reform embraced by Americans with diverse goals and backgrounds during the early twentieth century &lt;ref&gt;http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1061.html&lt;/ref&gt;. These problems included the aftermath of slavery, Reconstruction from the American Civil War, and female subjugation. The goal was to remove corrupt political machines and get more common people into the political process. Progressivism believed individuals could make the world better through regulation and reform. It worked on the Federal, state, local and public and private spheres, moving toward local public safety and efficiency, elimination of corruption, social justice, and the social control of knowledge.   

== Local Reform ==

At the urban level, Progressivism mainly affected municipal government. The system whereby the city is governed by a powerful mayor and a council was replaced by the ''council-manager'' or the ''commission'' system. Under the council-manager system, the council would pass laws, while the manager would do no more than ensure their execution. The manager was essentially a weak mayor. Under the commission system, the executive would be composed of people who each controlled one area of government. The commission was essentially a multi-member, rather than single-member, executive.

At the state level, several electoral reforms were made. Firstly, the secret ballot was introduced. Prior to the secret ballot, the ballots were colored papers printed by the political parties. Due to the lack of secrecy, bribing or blackmailing voters became common. It was to prevent businessmen or politicians from thus coercing voters that the secret ballot was introduced.  Also, reforms were made to give voters more say in government.  The initiative allowed voters to propose new laws.  The referendum allowed certain laws (for example tax increases) to be approved by the voters first. Finally, the recall, allowed the voters to remove public officials for wrongdoing while in office.

In addition, Progressives sought to combat the power of party leaders over which candidates would be nominated.  The ''direct primary'' was instituted, under which the voters cast ballots to nominate candidates. Before the primary was introduced, the party leaders or party faithful were the only ones allowed to nominate candidates. The South pioneered some political reforms; &quot;the direct primarily originated in North Carolina; the city commission plan arose in Galveston  Texas; and the city manager plan began in Stanton-Virgina. Progressive governors introduced business regulation, educational expansion,and other reforms that duplicated actions taken by northern counterparts.

== Labor Reforms ==

Progressive movement also attempted to give more power over legislation to the general populace. Three practices - the ''referendum'', the ''initiative'', and the ''recall'' - were created. The referendum allowed the voters to vote on a bill at an election before it took force as law. The initiative permitted the voters to petition and force the legislature to vote on a certain bill. Finally, the recall permitted voters to remove elected officials from office in the middle of the term. State laws were formed to improve labor conditions. Many states enacted factory inspection laws, and by 1916 nearly two-thirds of  the states required compensation for the victims in industrial accidents.

In 1901, Jane Addams founded the Juvenile Protective Association, a non-profit agency dedicated to protecting children from abuse. In 1903, Mary Harris Jones organized the Children's Crusade, a march of child workers from Kensington, Pennsylvania to the home of President Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay, New York, bringing national attention to the issue of child labor.  In 1909, President Roosevelt hosted the first White House Conference on Children, which continued to be held every decade through the 1970s.  In 1912, the United States Children's Bureau was created in order to investigate &quot;all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life among all classes of our people.&quot;  At the instigation of middle class coalitions, many states enacted factory inspection laws, and by 1916 two-thirds of the states required compensation for victims of industrial accidents. An alliance of labor and humanitarian groups induced some legislatures to grant aid to mothers with dependent children. Under pressure from the National Child Labor to Committee, nearly every state set a minimum age for employment and limited hours that employers could make children work.Families that needed extra income evaded child labor restrictions by falsifying their children's ages to employers.

States also regulated female labor by setting maximum work hours, especially when an accident at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory resulted in the deaths of more than 100 women. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of regulated work hours for women in &quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot;. Finally, some minimum wage provisions were introduced (for men and women).

The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was founded in Chicago in 1905 at a convention of anarchist and socialist union members who were opposed to the policies of the American Federation of Labor (AFL).  Unlike the AFL, which was a group composed of separate unions for each different trade (craft unionism), the IWW supported the concept of industrial unionism, in which all workers in a given industry are organized in one union, regardless of each worker's particular trade.  They promoted the idea of &quot;One Big Union&quot; in the hopes that one large, centralized body would be better equipped to deal with similarly-large capitalist enterprises.

1881 The Great influx of Russian and Polish Jews. They formed an objectionable part of the population, because they couldn't speak English, lived closely crowded, and dirty.  Penniless and unfamiliar with industrial conditions.  They were apart of industrial, intellectual, and civil life.  Their willingness to work 18 hours obnoxiously was crazy compared to Americans who worked (part-time).  &quot;It's not the condition that the immigrant comes from that determines he's usefulness;But the power one shows to rise above the condition.&quot;

== President Theodore Roosevelt ==

At the national level, Progressivism centered on defeating the power of large businesses. President Theodore Roosevelt, who succeeded to the Presidency when President McKinley was assassinated in 1901, helped the Progressive movement greatly.

In early 1902, anthracite coal miners struck.  Their salaries had not been raised in over two decades.  Furthermore, they were paid with ''scrips''. Scrips were essentially coupons for goods from pricey company stores.

The president of the Reading Railroad, George F. Baer, said that the miners had erred by distrusting the owners. He declared that the mine owners were &quot;Christian men of property to whom God has given control of the property rights of the country,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populist.com/03.03.castagnera.html Workers Don't Suffer by James O. Castagnera]&lt;/ref&gt; who could be trusted more than union leaders.

The owners and the miners refused to negotiate with each other. As autumn approached, many feared that the coal strike would cripple the economy. President Roosevelt intervened by asking the owners and miners to submit to arbitration. The miners accepted, but the owners refused Roosevelt's suggestion. Roosevelt then threatened to use the Army to take over the mines. The owners finally acquiesced; the strike was settled in 1903. Roosevelt's policy triumphed in 1904 when the Supreme Court, convinced by the government's arguments, created by J.P Morgan and his business allies. Roosevelt choose however , not to attack others trust, such as u.s steel another of Morgan's creations. Prosecution of northern securities began reportedly collared Roosevelt and offered &quot;if we have done anything wrong, send your man to my man and we can fix it up&quot;.  Roosevelt continued his Progressive actions when he revived the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Act sought to prevent companies from combining into trusts and gaining monopolies. A ''trust'' is formed when many companies loosely join together under a common board of directors to gain total control of an entire market so that prices can be raised without the threat of competitors. This total control of a market and subsequent price raising is a ''monopoly''. However, until Roosevelt's administration, the Act was rarely enforced. Roosevelt also enforced the Hepburn Act, which allowed the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroads. The railroads had allied themselves with large businesses, charging higher rates to those business' competitors. Thus, the large businesses would gain even more power. The Hepburn Act prevented railroads from granting reduced rates to businesses. Roosevelt also championed the cause of conservation. He set aside large amounts of land as part of the national park system.

== Conflicts with other Imperialist Nations ==

Imperialism was yet a common theme in the relations between nations in this era. It should be noted that although the US annexed Hawaii, Japan also had interests in the island and an aggressive foreign policy; Japan had already seized Taiwan from China in 1885 and would annex Korea in 1905. Imperial Germany was another aggressive power. The U.S. and Germany had conflicts over who would control Samoa, in the Pacific, as well as nearly faced a naval war with Germany in 1902 over German plans to seize the customs revenues of Venezuela. 

However, under the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt, the United States became more open in asserting international power. In 1905, Russia and Japan went to war over control of Korea and China. The Japanese won naval victories over two Russian fleets, in the Battles of the Yellow Sea and Tsushima. President Roosevelt offered to negotiate peace between the two nations, and in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a peace treaty was signed.

To demonstrate the ability of the United States to project power around the world (unlike Russia), Roosevelt ordered a fleet of U.S. men-o'war to sail around the world. The fleet left the east coast of the U.S. in 1908 and returned in 1909, visiting ports in Europe, Australia, and Japan.

== President William Howard Taft == 

When Theodore Roosevelt decided not to run for the presidency again in the election of 1908, that opened the doors for another Republican candidate. Into the gap stepped William H. Taft, former Ohio Supreme Court Justice, former Solicitor General of the United States, and former judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. James S. Sherman was chosen as his vice president. They ran against the Democratic slate of William Jennings Bryan and John Kern, and Socialist nominee Eugene V. Debs. Taft won the election by over a million votes and the Republicans retained control of both houses of Congress. During Taft's presidency, his primary goals were to continue Roosevelt's trust-busting and to reconcile old guard conservatives and young progressive reformers in the Republican Party. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Super Review; United States History&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Taft was somewhat more cautious and quiet than Roosevelt, despite his own credentials, and therefore had less public attention.

Taft tried to win over the Filipino people by reforming education, transportation, and health care. New railroads, bridges, and telegraph lines strengthened the economy. A public school system was founded, and new health care policies virtually eliminated such diseases as cholera and smallpox. These reforms slowly reduced Filipino hostility.

Although Taft was less of an attention-grabber than Roosevelt, he went far beyond what Roosevelt ever did. Taft used the Sherman Antitrust Act, a law passed in 1890 that made trusts and monopolies illegal, and they had to sue many large and economically damaging corporations. Taft won more antitrust lawsuits in four years than Roosevelt had won in seven.

Taft also pushed for the Sixteenth Amendment, which gave the federal government the right to tax citizens' income. The amendment was meant to supply the government with cash to replace the revenue generated from tariffs, which Progressives had hoped that Taft would lower. Taft failed to lower the tariff. In addition, he failed to fight for conservation and environmentalism, actually weakening some conservation policies to favor business. When Roosevelt came back from an expedition to Africa in 1910, he was disappointed in Taft, and vigorously campaigned for progressive republicans in the congressional elections of 1910.

Roosevelt tried to capitalize on his still enormous popularity by again running for reelection in 1912, but he failed to win the nomination because of Taft's connections to influential people in the Republican Party. Roosevelt and his supporters then broke off from the Republicans, forming the Progressive Party. (This later was known as the Bull Moose party after Roosevelt declared that he felt &quot;as strong as a bull moose!&quot;) The Republican split hurt the two candidates, and Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson gathered a 42 percent plurality of the popular votes and 435 out of 531 electoral votes.

== On the Supreme Court ==
Taft would later become a member of the Supreme Court, making him the only former President to do so. In 1921, when Chief Justice Edward Douglass White died, President Warren G. Harding nominated Taft to take his place, thereby fulfilling Taft's lifelong ambition to become Chief Justice of the United States. Very little opposition existed to the nomination, and the Senate approved him 60-4 in a secret session, but the roll call of the vote has never been made public. He readily took up the position, serving until 1930. As such, he became the only President to serve as Chief Justice, and thus is also the only former President to swear in subsequent Presidents, giving the oath of office to both Calvin Coolidge (in 1925) and Herbert Hoover (in 1929). He remains the only person to have led both the Executive and Judicial branches of the United States government. He considered his time as Chief Justice to be the highest point of his career: he allegedly once remarked, &quot;I don't remember that I ever was President.&quot;

== President Woodrow Wilson ==

Although Woodrow Wilson was a Democrat, he still pushed for progressive reforms. One of the first successes of his administration was the lowering of tariffs, which he accomplished in 1913. Wilson believed that increased foreign competition would spur U.S. based manufacturers to lower prices and improve their goods. That same year, Wilson passed the Federal Reserve Act, which created twelve regional banks that would be run by a central board in the capitol. This system gave the government more control over banking activities.   A few years later he wrote: 
&quot;I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men. -Woodrow  Wilson&quot;  

Wilson also pushed for governmental control over business. In 1914, a Democratic-controlled Congress established the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate companies that participated in suspected unfair and illegal trade practices. Wilson also supported the Clayton Antitrust Act, which joined the Sherman Antitrust Act as one the government's tools to fight trusts the same year.

By the end of Wilson's First term, progressives had won many victories. The entire movement lost steam, though, as Americans became much more interested in international affairs, especially the war that had broken out in Europe in 1914.

==The Supreme Court and Labor==

Upset workers had succeeded in lobbying Congress to pass legislation that improved work conditions.  However, the Supreme Court of the United States somewhat limited the range of these acts.  In Holden v. Hardy (1896), the Supreme Court ruled that miners' hours must be short because long hours made the job too dangerous.  However, in Lochner v. New York, laws ruled that bakery workers did not have a job dangerous enough to put restrictions on the free sale of labor.  Putting aside this decision, in 1908, the decision in Muller v. Oregon said that women's'' health must be protected &quot;to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.&quot;  This did,'' clearly, protect women's health, but it also locked them into menial jobs.

==Controlling Prostitution==

Moral outrage erupted when muckraking journalists charged that international gangs were kidnapping young women and forcing them into prostitution, a practice called white slavery. Accusations were exaggerated, but they alarmed some moralists who falsely perceived a link between immigration and prostitution. Although some women voluntarily entered &quot;the profession&quot; because it offered income and independence from their male counterparts, some women had very little option to a life where they had little if any amenities and many were forced into this profession and lifestyle. Reformers nonetheless believed they could attack prostitution by punishing both those who promoted it and those who practiced it. In 1910 Congress passed the White Slave Traffic Act (Mann Act), prohibiting interstate and international transportation of a woman for immoral purposes. By 1915 nearly all states outlawed brothels and solicitation of sex. Such laws ostensibly protected young women from exploitation, but in reality they failed to address the more serious problem of sexual violence that women suffered at the hands of family members, presumed friends, and employers.

==Football and the Formation of the NCAA==
By the turn of the century American football was already in the process of becoming a large national sport.  Originally formed and played at universities as an intercollegiate sport, it was seen as only for the upper class.  The size of the field depended on what the players agreed with, but it was almost always over 100 yards.  Once a player started a game, the player could not leave unless he/she became injured.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.1890sweekend.com/19th-century-football.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Very soon the sport began to gain spectators, and with spectators came controversy.  With over 15 deaths in 1905 alone, many saw a need for change in the sport.  However, others liked the violence and would watch because of this.  President Roosevelt formed a group to reconstruct the rules of football and make it less violent.  Standard rules would not be made and used until 1894.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1890sweekend.com/19th-century-football.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was originally named the Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and in 1910 it was renamed to the National College Athletic Association.

== Politics and Government ==

A new sympathy toward business was shown in the election of Republican Warren G. Harding as President in 1920. His administration helped streamline federal spending with the Budgeting and Accounting Act of 1921, supported anti-lynching legislation (which was, however, rejected by Congress), and approved bills assisting farm cooperatives and liberalizing farm credit. The Harding administration was also known for its scandals. He had had an affair with the wife of an Ohio merchant: the resulting daughter was never officially acknowledged. He also appointed some cronies, who saw office as an invitation to personal gain. One of those men was Charles Forbes, head of the Veterans Bureau. He was convicted of fraud and bribery in connection with government contracts, and was sent to prison. Another crony, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, was involved with an illegal liquor scheme. He only escaped prosecution by refusing to testify against himself. The most notorious of these scandals was the revelation that the Secretary of the Interior, Albert Fall, accepted bribes to lease government property to private oil companies in the Teapot Dome Scandal. The popular conservation legislation created by Harding's predecessors, presidents Teddy Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson, had set aside naval petroleum reserves in Wyoming and California. Three naval oil fields, Elk Hills and Buena Vista Hills in California and Teapot Dome in Wyoming, were tracts of public land meant as emergency underground supplies to be used by the navy only when regular oil supplies diminished. Teapot Dome received its name because of a rock resembling a teapot above the oil-bearing land. Politicians and private oil interests had opposed the restrictions placed on the oil fields, claiming that the reserves were unnecessary, and that the American oil companies could provide for the U.S. Navy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/jzeck.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The New Era:1920-1929,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil and criminal suits concerning Teapot Dome lasted through the 1920s. In 1927 the Supreme Court finally ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained and invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February of that year and the Teapot lease in October of the same year. The navy regained control of  Teapot Dome and Elk Hills reserves. Albert Fall was found guilty of bribery in 1929, fined $100,000, and sentenced to one year in prison. Harry Sinclair refused to cooperate with the government investigators, was charged with contempt, and received a short sentence for jury tampering. Edward Doheny was acquitted in 1930 of attempts to bribe Fall.

The Teapot Dome scandal was a victory for neither political party. It became a major issue in the presidential election of 1924, but neither party could claim full credit for divulging the wrongdoing. It became the first true evidence of government corruption in America. The scandal revealed the problem of natural resource scarcity and the need to protect for the future against emergency depletion of resources. Vice President Calvin Coolidge, who assumed the presidency after Harding's death, handled the problem very systematically, and his administration avoided any damage to its reputation.

==Technology==

Although there were innumerable technical innovations, the vast changes in American life about this time had two major technical bases, mass production (the assembly line), and mass testing.

In the vast steel factories and in cloth mills individuals had to move together with the machines. Any mistake could lead to an accident, perhaps a fatal one. Henry Ford's assembly line worked on the same principle, but went much further. A car went from station to station, from worker to worker. Each worker had one function -- tightening nuts, adding a component -- and only that function, as if he were himself a machine. His main interest was in doing those motions which would do his job and do it most efficiently. (In this respect the system drew upon work efficiency experts such as Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Gilbreths.) 

The advantages to this extreme systemization were fundamental. As with the cloth factories, the product was produced extremely quickly at all hours of the day or night. Very little training was needed for those jobs. The results of this system were extremely long-lasting. The Model T was seen as a durable car, and &quot;the tin Lizzie&quot; retained public affection even when it was superseded by cars with self-starters. The cars were also affordable, with results as seen below. Henry Ford raised his wages regularly, urging that the men who made the cars also buy them. 

A small demerit was that these new cars were extremely ugly. The Stanley Steamer had been sleek, with lines like what would later be called &quot;streamlining.&quot; Dusenbergs and Pierce-Arrows had a variety of hues and such extras as bud vases. Ford famously said that his purchasers could have any color they wanted, &quot;so long as it is black.&quot; As people became more prosperous, they could shop for colored paint jobs and detailing for their luxury cars. However, creating affordable and beautiful goods was a movement away from Ford's version of the market.

More importantly, working on the assembly line wore on the workers. Standing in one place and squinting, working with a few muscles for hours a day (or night) could be very fatiguing. Human beings weren't made to live like that. When there were a limited set of priorities for working, workers could be easily replaced, just like machines. Not every boss of the assembly line paid as well as Ford. 

Mass testing was a requirement for the assembly line -- a bad part made a bad product. But it had actually begun as a human policy, in the requirements for the late 19th Century census. It was accelerated in the desire to find sound men for the First World War. Psychologists were employed to create intelligence tests to weed out unfit soldiers. Their weapons had to be carefully inspected, for when shoddy goods reached the front lines, the result could be a disaster.

In the post-war world, Big Business began developing research and development departments. Before a change was implemented, there had to be a prototype, and the effects on the public had to be carefully measured. Economics became a matter, not merely of becoming prosperous, but of selling to the largest number possible. (The term ''mass market'' originated in the 1920s.)

== The Automobile ==

In the 1920s, the United States automobile industry began an extraordinary period of growth by means of the assembly line in manufacturing. Cars began to alter the American lifestyle. In 1929, one out of every five Americans had a car. They began using their own automobiles instead of the street cars. Cars also replaced horses. This made the streets cleaner, because there wasn't as much horse manure. (However, this was replaced by other, more subtle forms of pollution. In the 1920s gasoline companies started adding lead to their fuel to increase engine efficiency.) 

The idea of &quot;homes on wheels&quot; was also created around this time. Americans were packing up food and camping equipment in order to get away from home. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;A People and A Nation&quot; the eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1920s most automobiles gained cloth or steel roofs, offering a private space for courtship and sex. Women gained from the automobile revolution. Women who learned to drive achieved new-found independence, taking touring trips with female friends, conquering muddy roads, and making repairs when their vehicles broke down. Prosperous African Americans for the first time obtained a limited freedom from local discrimination. A family could drive around and past &quot;closed&quot; White communities, and to beaches, camps, and other holiday destinations. (However, the family car would have to carry its own food, drink and gas, and not stop before it reached its destination. The largest-scale pamphlet for &quot;safe&quot; businesses African Americans could use, the Negro Motorist Green Book, was only published beginning in 1936.) The car was the ultimate social equalizer.  

There were 108 automobile manufacturers in 1923 and colors allowed owners to express personal tastes. An abundance of fuel fed these cars. In 1920, the United States produced sixty-five percent of the World's oil. Road construction was extensive. The first timed stop-and-go traffic light was in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Norton et al., “A People and A Nation: A History of the United States; The New Era; 1920-1929,” ed. Mary Beth Norton et al. (Boston: Cenage Learning 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Industries related to the manufacturing and use of automobiles also grew; petroleum, steel, and glass were in high demand, leading to growth and profitability in related sectors. State governments began to build roads and highways in rural areas. Gasoline stations were installed across the country, evidence of the sudden and continued growth of the petroleum industry. Automobile dealers introduced the installment plan, a financing concept that was adopted in many other parts of business. Thus, the automobile industry's growth had repercussions throughout the nation. With a perfected design of Henry Ford's assembly line automobiles began to be more affordable for the common US citizens all over the country. A lot of men were hired to work in car factories.

==Health and Life Expectancy==
The relation between food and health had long been known. For example, since the 18th century it has been known how to fight scurvy, and mariners have taken fruit on long voyages. Yet the fact that scurvy is caused by lack of vitamin c was only discovered in 1932.  

From 1915 to the end of the 1920s most vitamins were discovered. Food regulation began to ensure a safer food supply. People began to have access to and the possibility of choosing more and better food, due to faster transport and refrigeration. Technical information was also more easily transmitted, and by 1930 nutritionists began to emphasize to the public the need for consumption of certain foods, and their constituent vitamins and minerals, on a daily basis. Food companies began marketing their products, on how their products contain certain amounts of your daily vitamins and therefore healthy. However, the advertisements sometimes contained unusual ideas about nutrition. For example, some candy bars were advertised by their &quot;food value.&quot; And Welch's Grape Juice marketed their product as containing nutrients and vitamins, but failed to inform the reader of the large amount of sugar also included.  

But the emphasis on nutrition and good hygiene made many Americans healthier. This was the decade when penicillin and insulin were discovered. During this time the life expectancy at birth in the United States also increased from fifty-four to sixty percent, and infant mortality rate decreased by one-third. However this was not the case for nonwhites: the mortality rate for nonWhite children was about fifty to one hundred times that of Whites during this era. (Rickets among the poor and among rural African Americans was seen as the result of poor genetics, &quot;bad blood.&quot; The American fad for Eugenics and the sterilization movement also grew in this era.) Accident fatalities also increased by roughly 150 percent, for the car was becoming faster and more common.

==Elderly Americans and Retirement==

As more adults survived into old age, an interest in pensions and other forms of old age assistance grew. In the third decade of the 20th century, one third of Americans sixty-five and older depended financially on someone else. Over the past fifty years many European countries had established state-supported pension systems. In 1923 the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce called old-age assistance “un-American &amp; socialistic.” But during the 1920s state resistance to pension plans eroded. Isaac Max Rubinow and Abraham Epstein attempted to persuade legislators and associations such as labor unions to endorse old-age assistance. By 1933 almost every state gave some minimal support to needy elderly.

==Social Values==

During this time period, new social values emerged. It became difficult to determine what was socially acceptable, as youth frequently took up smoking, drinking, and a new openness about sex. They were being influenced less by their parents and more by their peers and schoolmates. Schools in the cities geared up for mass education, segregating children with others of their same age. The rite of passage, dating without adult supervision, became more commonplace among these youth.

The Flapper was the female symbol of this change, as the raccoon-coated Sheik was the symbol among young men. The dresses then in fashion de-emphasized the bodice, with a flat abdomen, the so-called &quot;boyish figure.&quot; Flappers did not have the long hair of their mothers and grandmothers, but short, &quot;bobbed&quot; styles. They drank and smoked like men, knew all the latest dances and songs, and openly swore and talked of sex. It is unknown how frequent the Flapper really was. Bobbed hair was fashionable among women and girls, but there was never a standard measurement of this or any related trend. Movie actresses such as Louise Brooks and Clara Bow were shown drinking on the big screen, and F. Scott Fitzgerald's writings showed a literary interest in the Flapper. 

During the War, servicemen became used to lectures on preventing venereal disease, and thus became more comfortable with the idea of contraception. Condoms started to be made with latex instead of animal tissues, and became a product which could be mass-produced on an assembly line. Birth control became more available, and more respectable. With a greater chance for babies to survive infancy, and with the ability to time when they came into the world, the number of children in a middle-class family began to go from four or five to two or three. Unfortunately, this overlapped with the eugenics movement.

As the middle class became more mobile, it was much less able to rely on the advice of grandparents and family, and &quot;expert&quot; child care advice became popular. This advice was different from that commonly used nowadays. John B. Watson, who published his book in 1928, advised against picking up infants, holding them when they cried, or cossetting them or showing them too much affection.

== Radio ==

Radio had been used for ship-to-shore communication since the Titanic sent out a Morse code S-O-S. It was used by both sides during the First World War. Wilson considered nationalizing the medium, as Great Britain was later to nationalize the British Broadcasting Corporation, but corporate outcry overruled him.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. ''Honey, I'm Home! Sitcoms: Selling the American Dream.'' First edition. New York: Grove Weidenfeld (Grove Press), 1992. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, thousands of curious machines produced screeches for the hobbyist, with an occasional, distant snatch of voices or music. In 1920 the assembly line did its work, producing an RCA &quot;Cat's Whisker&quot; receiver for under four dollars. In October of that year Westinghouse created the first radio station, KDKA. In November it provided running coverage of the Presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the mid-'20s programming ran from morning till night. In 1924, the first radio network, the National Broadcasting Company, began operations between New York and Boston. In 1927, the Columbia Broadcasting System began. The Federal Radio Commission was set up in 1926, and organized in the Radio Act of 1927. Advertisers sponsored programs: one popular music program was The A &amp; P Gypsies, giving coast-to-coast coverage to the A &amp; P grocery stores. The news and entertainment provided was vetted by the sponsor, and anything which would offend sponsors was forbidden. But within those lines much was permitted. One could occasionally find high culture (though the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts only began at the end of 1931), but the aim was to air songs in the middle range of culture; &quot;The Lost Chord,&quot; or &quot;Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes.&quot; They played popular music, but not much jazz: Paul Whiteman, the so-called &quot;King of Jazz,&quot; was not. (There were exceptions to this rule; some high-powered radio stations in Mexico poured out jazz, &quot;Black music,&quot; and ads for toxic patent medicines.) Much of the country's culture was not covered, though the Grand Ole Opry began its broadcasts in 1925. But as electrification expanded, the market for radio grew, and some stations experimented. A pair of White comedians, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, created a comic, sentimental serial drama, ''Amos 'n' Andy''. At a time when lynchings of African Americans occurred as far North as Ohio, this was a comedy about two stupid African Americans who mispronounced their words. But it also created sympathy for them. &quot;One episode ended with Amos and Andy in desperate need of a typewriter; nearly two thousand typewriters were immediately sent in by listeners.&quot; Yet &quot; ''Amos 'n' Andy'' 's popularity was no doubt due to excitement over this new national experience. For the first time Americans could all enjoy the same event at the same moment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movies ==

In the 1920s movies also grew into a popular recreation. By 1922, about 40 million people were going to the movies each week; that number jumped to about 100 million people by the end of the decade. Movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Charlie Chaplin became known around the world.  

Eight studios dominated the industry, consolidating and integrating all aspects of a film's development. By 1929, the film-making firms that were to rule and monopolize Hollywood for the next half-century were the giants or the majors, sometimes dubbed The Big Five. The Big Five studios were Warner Bros., RKO, Paramount, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Fox Film Corporation. They produced more than 90 percent of the fiction films in America and distributed their films both nationally and internationally. Each studio somewhat differentiated its products from other studios.

A movie house was only allowed to play the products of one studio. Thus, for example, the New York Paramount only played cartoons, newsreels, and fiction films created by Paramount Studios. (In the 1920s Paramount distributed the work of Max Fleischer Studios, creator of the Koko the Clown Cartoons.) Each division of the studio was contracted to make so many films each year. If a movie house wanted to get the films of a Gloria Swanson or a Rudolf Valentino, it had to accept a given number of films by a less-liked star. This &quot;block booking&quot; ensured that certain actors got publicity and kept the screens under the thumb of the studio. However, in return each theater was ensured of a weekly change of movies, with the full backing of the studio. In addition to the projectionist, ushers and candy and cigarette sellers, the Paramount Theater employed a grand musician to accompany the silent film on one of the largest theater organs ever created. Its halls were ornamented by hand-painted murals. The top-line theaters were called &quot;movie palaces.&quot;

The most popular studio movies often used sweepingly romantic stories set in exotic lands: Argentina in 1921's ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'', Persia in 1924's ''The Thief of Bagdad''. The 1925 movie ''Ben Hur'' was shot partially in Italy and partially on huge purpose-built sets in California. It had 42 cameras shooting the still-famous chariot race. Among the famous or yet-to-be-famous figures swelling the scenes as extras were the Barrymore brothers, Lillian and Dorothy Gish, comedian Harold Lloyd, William Randolph Hearst's love Marion Davies, and studio head Samuel Goldwyn. The religious sequences used two-tone technicolor. It was the most expensive film yet made.&lt;ref&gt;IMDB trivia page for ''Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ'' (1925), http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016641/trivia?ref_=tt_ql_2 Retrieved on August 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prohibition ==

Although total alcohol consumption halved, some people blatantly disregarded Prohibition. There were loopholes in the Volstead Act, the twenty-two page law which defined Prohibition. Churches could use wine in their ceremonies, and alcohol drunk as a medicine (this was still part of the medical profession) was still allowed. The amount of &quot;religious&quot; and &quot;medicinal&quot; wine suddenly increased. 

Some illegal alcohol was imported from Canada, Cuba, and Mexico, which never made alcohol illegal. Some was home-made American. ''Bootleggers'' were found in many places throughout the country, from backwoods stills (illegal alcohol production had continued after the Whiskey Rebellion) to urban &quot;bathtub gin.&quot; The Volstead Act had said that personal consumption of alcohol in one's own home was legal, though it had prohibited public gatherings to drink. The occasional secret saloons called ''speakeasies'' which sprang up in cities were therefore illegal. These required money, and a new criminal underworld rose to fund them and profit from them. Some of this money funded pay-offs to police to stop enforcement of Prohibition. Gangs prospered in this hidden economy. Many jobs came out of Prohibition, both from alcohol and from the &quot;front&quot; legitimate businesses set up to launder speakeasy money. However, these jobs came with great risks, from blackmail and graft to outright violence. Some commentators felt that Prohibition was too harsh and that it made a criminal out of the average American man or woman, who would have bought alcohol legally if it were available.

==Gangs and Violence==

There was obviously a huge market for what in the 1920's was an illegal commodity. Gangsters provided this commodity. Major gangsters in this period included Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Mayer Lansky, and &quot;Dutch&quot; Schultz. Perhaps the most notorious was Chicago's Al Capone. Capone smuggled alcohol all over the Midwest. He was also responsible for drug smuggling and murder, and bribed both police and important politicians.  

Despite the deference given Capone by &quot;bought&quot; figures, he had enemies from other Chicago gangs. He rode in an armor-plated limousine, always accompanied by armed bodyguards. Violence was a daily occurrence in Chicago. 227 gangsters were killed in the space of four years. On St Valentine's Day, 1929, seven members of the O'Banion gang were shot dead by gangsters dressed as police officers.

In 1931, the government got around the corrupted regular police by arresting Capone for tax evasion, rather than for his many violent offenses. He got eleven years in jail, and left prison with his health broken.

==Bonnie and Clyde==
Bonnie and Clyde were also a famous pair of murderers and thieves in the 1920's during the prohibition era with their gang.  Clyde Champion Barrow and his companion, Bonnie Parker, were shot to death by officers in an ambush near Sailes, Bienville Parish, Louisiana on May 23, 1934, after one of the most colorful and spectacular manhunts the nation had seen up to that time. Barrow was suspected of numerous killings and was wanted for murder, robbery, and state charges of kidnapping.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), then called the Bureau of Investigation, became interested in Barrow and his paramour late in December 1932 through a singular bit of evidence. A Ford automobile, which had been stolen in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, was found abandoned near Jackson, Michigan in September of that year. At Pawhuska, it was learned another Ford car had been abandoned there which had been stolen in Illinois. A search of this car revealed it had been occupied by a man and a woman, indicated by abandoned articles therein. In this car was found a prescription bottle, which led special agents to a drug store in Nacogdoches, Texas, where investigation disclosed the woman for whom the prescription had been filled was Clyde Barrow's aunt.

Further investigation revealed that the woman who obtained the prescription had been visited recently by Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and Clyde's brother, L. C. Barrow. It also was learned that these three were driving a Ford car, identified as the one stolen in Illinois. It was further shown that L. C. Barrow had secured the empty prescription bottle from a son of the woman who had originally obtained it.

On May 20, 1933, the United States Commissioner at Dallas, Texas, issued a warrant against Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, charging them with the interstate transportation, from Dallas, to Oklahoma, of the automobile stolen in Illinois. The FBI then started its hunt for this elusive pair.

==Religions and Revivalism==

Just as the Religious section of the newspaper had long been popular, the new medium of radio became a way to increase religious visibility. Churches bought broadcasting slots from stations eager to seem like good neighbors. City stations might broadcast programs of interest to Catholics and Jews, as well as from minority faiths or cults. This impinged on listeners, coming into their homes, as printed media did not.

The religious revival had been a feature of both mainline denominations and smaller sects since the turn of the century. Both mainline and independent preachers called upon listeners to give up frivolity and turn to a purer faith. Many of these sermons condemned movies and theatre, novels and card gambling, drinking and modern fashion, including women's short dresses and makeup. Many of them had supported the imposition of Prohibition. The Twenties provided electric lighting, amplification, and radio coverage for revivals. Some popular preachers traveled by train or motor car to cities and towns across the country. Aimee Semple McPherson and Billy Sunday were among the most notable of these, and aroused contraversy.

== Jazz == 
[[File:Louis Armstrong restored.jpg|thumb|right|Louis Armstrong]]
Jazz is an American musical art form which originated around the beginning of the 20th century in Black communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of African and European music traditions. The “hometown” of jazz is considered to be in New Orleans. Early jazz musicians would called New Orleans their home even if they have never been there. Jazz employed a number of Black men and women. Jazz spread through America very quickly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/tbacig/studproj/is3099/jazzcult/20sjazz/upriver.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, call-and-response, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note of ragtime. Beginning in 1922, Gennett Records began recording jazz groups performing in Chicago. The first group they recorded was the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, followed in 1923 by King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band with Louis Armstrong. Another indie company in Chicago, Paramount Records, was competing with Gennett and Okeh for jazz talent. &lt;ref&gt;Some famous early jazz musicians include King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Kid Ory, and Duke Ellington.&lt;/ref&gt; The Black community took notice: authors such as Langston Hughes often mentioned the music in his poems, both positively and negatively.

==Business Overseas==
After the war, many manufacturing companies faced hard times as they attempted to convert from wartime production of weapons and planes to what they had traditionally produced before the war. However, the pro-business policies put in place first by Harding, then Coolidge, allowed business to flourish. While business did well at home -- the raising of tariff rates from 27% (under the Underwood-Simmons Tariff) to 41% certainly helped in this regard -- many major companies did quite well overseas. Just as these companies had started to do before the war, they set up shop in a variety of countries based around the resources located there. Meat packers like Gustavus Swift went to Argentina; fruit growers went to Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala; sugar plantation owners went to Cuba; rubber plantation owners to the Philippines, Sumatra, and Malaya; copper corporations to Chile; and oil companies to Mexico and Venezuela (which remains today a great source for oil). Steamships and telegraphs made for easy transport and communication.

==Organized Labor==
The Organized labor force during the 1920's suffered a great deal. During this time the country was fearful of the spread of communism in America, because of this widespread fear public opinion was against any worker who attempted to disrupt the order of the working class. The public was so anti-labor union that in 1922 the Harding administration was able to get a court injunction to destroy a railroad workers strike that was about 400,000 strong. Also in 1922 the government took part in putting to an end a nationwide miners strike that consisted of about 650,000 miners. The federal and state level of government had no toleration for strikes, and allowed for businesses to sue the unions for any damages done during a strike.  

== Major Cases ==
The Sacco-Vanzetti Trial, Leopold and Loeb, the Scopes Trial, and the Black Sox Trial were all significant court cases during the 1920's. Each of these court cases were unique and monumental in their own right, and set a precedent for the years to come.

===The Scopes Trial===
In 1925, John Thomas Scopes, a biology teacher, was tried and convicted in Tennessee for teaching about evolution in his public school classroom as an explanation of the origin of humans, as opposed to the Biblical story of Adam and Eve, which was supported by state law at the time. This was a major dispute and caught the attention of many popular government officials such as William Jennings Bryan, who spoke on behalf of the prosecution. Bryan saw evolution as not only pernicious in its own right, but as a platform for eugenics: the textbook that Scopes used, ''Civic Biology'', advocated &quot;racial hygiene.&quot; Although the modernists lost the case, they still were happy to have highlighted the illogical reasoning behind the law that schools could not teach alternative theories for the origin of man. They were also happy that this trial and conviction didn’t affect the expansion of fundamentalist ideals. The Southern Baptist Convention, a Protestant group, became one of the fastest growing denominations after the trial showing that it may have even given popularity to the religious denomination. The beliefs of these groups resulted in an independent subculture with their own schools, radio programs, and missionary societies.

==Minority Women==
During the 1920's there were almost double the amount of minority women than White in the workforce. Women, especially minorities, who held factory jobs held the least desirable and lowest paying jobs in factories. Black women mostly held domestic jobs such as cooking, cleaning, and laundry. There were many openings for educated minority women in the social work, teaching, and nursing fields during this time, however they faced much discrimination. The economic needs of the family brought thousands of minority women into having to work. Mexican women, mainly in the Southwest worked as domestic servants, operatives in garment factories, and as agricultural laborers. This was looked down upon because the Mexican culture traditionally was against women labor. Next to African women, Japanese women were the most likely to hold low paying jobs in the work force, they worked in the lowest paying jobs; they faced very strong racial biases and discrimination on a regular basis as well.

== African-Americans and the Ku Klux Klan ==
Southern states segregated public facilities (like buses). In half the South fewer than 10% of the Blacks were allowed to vote. 

The Ku Klux Klan flourished 1921-26 with a membership of millions of Protestants. Not only was the Ku Klux Klan big in the south, but in such northern states as Ohio, Oregon, and Indiana. Indiana's governor and an Oregon mayor were both members of the KKK. Many KKK members were women, nearly a half million in  women's auxiliary associations. Klansmen organized marches and violence against African-Americans, Catholics, and Jews, as well as bootleggers and adulterers. They gained new support from nativists who had detested the mass immigration to the Northeast in the early 1900s.

The return of the Klan caused a split in the Democratic Party which allowed Calvin Coolidge, a conservative Republican, to take office in 1924.

In most cities, the only way Blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously White neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacked by White residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that Black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover the increased presence of Blacks in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with Whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. The Tulsa Race Riots of 1921 and the Rosewood Massacre of 1923 (where a town was wiped off the map by racist violence) were examples of this extreme of hatred. 

Blacks were widely persecuted by the Ku Klux Klan, but they were not the only group of people that the KKK targeted because they believed in “Native, White, Protestant supremacy.” They also targeted groups like Mexicans, Jews and Catholics. A Klu Klux Klan newspaper ran a doggerel poem of a dialogue between the Pope and the Devil, with the latter saying the KKK &quot;will make it hotter than I can for you in hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Pope's Last Call,&quot; &quot;Elsie Thornton.&quot; Originally printed in Alabama KKK Newsletter, June 1926. p. 4. Box 16, Folder 11: Association Records, Ku Klux Klan, Alabama Department of Archives and History, Montgomery. Recalled on October 18, 2014: http://www1.assumption.edu/users/McClymer/his261/Pope'sLastCall.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Ku Klux Klan would also try and bring justice into their own hands when it came to dealing with bootleggers, wife beaters and adulterers, and even the Knights of Columbus. &lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation Eighth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Great Migration ignited hatred toward Blacks in Northern big cities. Blacks migrated to cities such as New York, Chicago, and Detroit, and in Western cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego. Although most of the migrants were poor and lived in cheap urban housing, some were able to afford better houses in White neighborhoods. However, even prosperous people were unable to live where they wanted. Discrimination could be as open as the notice in Wanted ads -- &quot;No Negroes allowed&quot; -- or as quiet as the refusal of a real estate agent. The brave Black family who actually bought in those neighborhoods would face snubs from the neighbors, refusal of services from local businesses, and sometimes covert or open violence. (An example of this last is seen in Detroit's Ossian Sweet case of 1925.)

To fight this discrimination many Black movement groups formed. The Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) was formed by Marcus Garvey, an immigrant from Jamaica living in Harlem. Garvey preached a message of equality that many, including other Black leaders, considered radical. Garvey helped start companies and news papers directed towards the Black community. He gained many followers around the US, especially in cities. Amritjit Singh[https://books.google.com/books?id=F8oVNhl4sKwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=who+estimates+that+Garvey+and+the+UNIA+had+over+half+a+million+followers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EAgFq5DvGL&amp;sig=kM6A1bs0u89Mpw4x-0BduZni5MQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwA2oVChMI7_OI-tH5yAIVWNNjCh3z2QX2#v=onepage&amp;q=who%20estimates%20that%20Garvey%20and%20the%20UNIA%20had%20over%20half%20a%20million%20followers&amp;f=false] estimates that Garvey and the UNIA had over half a million followers. Garvey created more racial cohesion and inspired the Black community to stand up. Yet others, including the prominent Black author W.E.B. Du Bois, considered Garvey’s approach extreme and believed that it would backfire. Du Bois believed in a &quot;gradualist&quot; strategy, working through education and the legal system. He and some other Black leaders petitioned the U.S. Attorney General and had Garvey deported back to Jamaica. Yet Garvey's message lived on long after he was deported, and he was one of the early inspirations of 1960 civil rights leader Malcolm X.     

In New York City's Harlem and in half a dozen other Northern cities, a Black culture began to form as a result of the relative economic and educational advantages given through the Great Migration. Black businesses, legal and political systems, and arts societies flourished. Here &quot;the talented tenth&quot; had its own business and fraternal institutions. Poets Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, and Jean Toomer, and musicians such as Chick Webb and Duke Ellington were published in mainstream magazines and heard in White-frequented (though sometimes segregated) clubs. '''The Harlem Renaissance''' talked of the contemporary Black community's hopes and fears.

==The End of Prosperity and the Stock Market Crash of 1929==

In the 1920s, farmers did not do so well. A lot of farms did not have running water or electricity, and pay was low due to surplus. World War I had disrupted farming in Europe and the warring European nations greatly depended on American farming for food.&lt;ref&gt;Shmoop Editorial Team. &quot;Economy in The 1920s&quot; Shmoop University, Inc..11 November 2008. http://www.shmoop.com/1920s/economy.html (accessed November 22, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  When peace came, demand for crops like cotton and grain suddenly fell but farmers kept planting at wartime rates&lt;ref&gt;Katers, Nicholas. &quot;The Roaring Twenties and the Struggles of Immigrants, Farmers, and Other Interest Groups.&quot; ''Yahoo! Voices''. Yahoo!, 30 Mar. 2006. Web. 22 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, so they were left without money to pay off their loans or new devices like tractors. 

A lot of farmers were dependent growing cotton. However, in the twenties the price of cotton plummeted because of new man-made materials that entered the market. Matters were made worse by the invasion of the boll weevil, an insect which planted its eggs in the boll (cotton blossom), and ate the cotton. The Southern economy was partially saved through following the urging of inventor George Washington Carver and planting peanuts instead of cotton. In 1925-1927 George Washington Carver patented two uses for peanuts, and hundreds of more inventions from soybeans, pecans, and even sweet potatoes. Some inventions he made from peanuts and soybeans are paper, instant coffee, shaving cream, mayonnaise, soap, and talcum powder. None of these procedures were ever recorded by him in a notebook. He urged increased participation of Blacks in agricultural education.  

On October 24, 1929, today known as Black Thursday, the stock market began its downhill drop. After the first hour, the prices had gone down at an amazing speed. Some people thought that after that day, the prices would rise again just as it had done before. But prices kept dropping. On October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday, more than 16 million shares were sold, but by the end of the day, most stocks ended below their previous value, and some stocks became totally worthless. By November 13, the prices had hit rock bottom. The stock AT&amp;T had gone from 304 dollars to 197. Much of America had celebrated unheard of prosperity for eight years, but the Stock Market Crash put an end to that within a few weeks. 

== Questions For Review ==

[[Image:Mussolini&amp;Hitler1.gif|thumb|Mussolini and Hitler greet the people]]
In 1933, German president Paul von Hindenberg named Adolf Hitler chancellor. Hitler then disbanded the Weimar Republic and began the &quot;Third Reich&quot; (in German, ''Großdeutsches Reich''). Hitler had outlined his aims years earlier, in his book ''Mein Kampf''(My Struggle). He noted Germany's problems after its defeat in World War I. The nation had been damaged economically and morally, cut off from the raw materials, land, and resources needed to help it develop as a nation. Hitler blamed &quot;sub-human&quot; peoples such as the Jews for his country's defeat. The superior German people needed &quot;living room,&quot; and had a right to claim it. The book called for the elimination of the Jews, and the elimination of homosexuals, the mentally ill, and other &quot;undesirable&quot; elements of German society. Hitler also used this supposed German superiority, as well as German mistreatment by its victors after World War I, to justify the termination of the Treaty of Versailles.

Hitler began a buildup of the German military. In 1936, he tested German might by supporting the Spanish Civil War. Then Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the Fascist Dictator of Italy, created a coalition with the dictatorship which had come to power in Japan. The coalition of these three nations later came to be called the Axis.

Many of the borders drawn up in the wake of Versailles were fragile. There were German nationalists in many other countries, including the post-war nation of Czechs and Slavs known as Czechoslovakia. In 1938, Hitler used alleged mistreatment of a German minority in another German-speaking nation to ''annex'' or take over Austria. Other nations were reluctant to interfere because of Hitler's claim that the relation between Germany and Austria was an internal German concern which had nothing to do with the rest of Europe. Then Hitler took control of a section of Czechoslovakia partially populated by Germans. This time, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain did interfere. In the wee hours of September 30, 1938, Chamberlain and Hitler signed an agreement ensuring that Germany would keep the territory it called ''the Sudetenland'', but would go no further in the country, nor take any German-populated areas in other European nations. The policy which sought to prevent another World War at almost any cost, including the cost of allowing a tyrant to gain more power, became known as ''appeasement''.

Chamberlain called ''the Munich Agreement'' &quot;Peace in our time.&quot; Hitler had no intention of keeping his word. In 1939, he took over the remainder of Czechoslovakia and demanded Poland. Great Britain and France agreed to come to Poland's aid. Then Germany signed another agreement with the Soviet Union, the confederation of Russia and its supporters under a Communist government. ''The Nazi-Soviet Pact'' was an agreement that the two nations would not fight each other. Both countries agreed to take parts of Poland, the Soviet Union securing the Baltic Sea port cities. (It had been a long-term interest of the Soviets to gain ice-free ports for winter trade.) Yet in private, Hitler was already planning to take the Soviet Union over in its turn.

== The Beginning of the War ==

On the first day of September, 1939, Germany declared war on Poland. The British and French responded by declaring war on Germany two days later. 

The Germans used the tactic of ''Blitzkrieg'' (&quot;lightning war&quot;) in Poland to defeat the Polish Army in as little as sixteen days as the British and French sat back in fear of a new World War. With little warning and no provocation, the German Air Force strafed Poland with top-speed planes and sent in tanks and racing artillery on the ground. The Polish had had no time to build the deep trenches seen in the First World War; the Germans had no need to use mustard gas. By the end of the first week of October, the Germans had gained control of half of Poland. The Soviets invaded from the East. With no time to defend themselves, the last Polish troops surrendered in early October.

In the spring of 1940, Hitler attacked the nations of Denmark and Norway. Denmark surrendered, but British and French troops came to Norway's aid. 

Germany entered Belgium and the Netherlands on May Tenth, 1940. The Netherlands surrendered on May 15, though the province of Zeeland held out until the 18th. Belgium was overcome on May 28. On the same day, France recalled its troops from Norway, leaving Norway's fate to Germany.

On June Fifth the Germans began their attack on France. To make matters worse, Mussolini declared war on France and Britain on June 10. The French government, meanwhile was taken over by a new Premier, who signed an armistice with Germany on June 17. Germany gained control of the northern part of France, and the Vichy French Government (so called because of the new French capital at Vichy) retained the south. The Italians had a small zone of occupation near the Franco-Italian border.

Hitler's Germany was the supreme power on Continental Europe. Only the United Kingdom offered resistance. The Germans intended to invade the United Kingdom, but they first had to contend with the British Royal Air Force. The German Luftwaffe (Air Force) commenced the Battle of Britain in 1940. However, the British used the new technology of radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) to combat the Germans. In September, 1940, the Germans ended the Battle of Britain by indefinitely delaying all plans for invasion. Nonetheless, German airplanes continued to bomb several British cities until the middle of the next year.

Hitler expanded the Axis in the winter of 1940-1941 with the additions of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In April, 1941, Germany and Italy then attacked Yugoslavia, which surrendered within one week of invasion. Then Hitler and Mussolini turned to Greece, which collapsed by the end of April. By the end of 1942, most of Europe was under control of the Nazis or the Italians. 

In early 1941, the United States abandoned its neutrality and began to aid the British. ''The Lend-Lease Act'' allowed the President to lend or lease weapons worth over seven billion dollars to other nations.  The first two years of the war overseas saw the American public broadly divided on the issue of potential involvement. Though the danger posed by Germany and Japan was generally recognized, millions of Americans felt that a strong, armed neutrality and oceanic defense without entering the war was the safest course. In contrast, President Roosevelt made it quite clear to those around him that he felt the United States would have to intervene on the Allied side, and planned and acted accordingly, initiating a war industrial buildup and proposing that the US become the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy,&quot; supplying ammunition to Great Britain and its Allies. 

==Conflict in the Pacific==

On June 22, 1941, the Germans invaded the Soviet Union. The Pact between the two nations was dissolved, and the latter joined the Western Allies. Americans were very reluctant to start any conflict with Germany. Even in the fall of 1941, when shooting took place in the Atlantic between German U-boats and US ships, Roosevelt avoided escalation. After this, however, momentous events in the Pacific plunged the Americans into the war.

The Great Depression had affected Japan as much as it had the Western powers. In 1931 a group of Japanese nationalists had assassinated the current Prime Minister of Japan, leading to a military dictatorship. In the same year Japan invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria. Although the government talked of nurturing international friendship, this was a take-over of Chinese national resources. In  1940 the Japanese marched into Indochina (present-day Southeast Asia), which had formerly belonged to the Dutch and to Vichy France. They now commanded the plantations responsible for the world's supply of rubber. The United States retaliated by attempting to prevent Japanese purchases of oil and steel. Tensions between Japan and the United States grew. 

To secure resources and sea lanes for the Japanese islands, the Empire of Japan desired to neutralize the American Pacific Fleet, which was stationed at '''Pearl Harbor''' in Hawaii. On December Seven, 1941, the Japanese Air Force bombed the large American naval base, destroying or severely damaging over nineteen ships and 292 aircraft. The US Naval aircraft carriers, huge ships serving as mobile bases for airplanes, were then at sea and survived the attack. Yet its results were still dire: 2,403 American soldiers, sailors, and civilians were killed in the unprovoked strike. Japan made simultaneous strikes on Guam, Midway, and British bases. The next day, the United States Congress declared war on Japan, prompting Germany and Italy to in turn declare war on the United States. 

Japan continued with its Pacific operations by taking the American colonies of the Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island; the British colonies of Burma, Singapore, Malaya, and Borneo; and the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. An emboldened Japanese navy blundered in June of 1942, attacking ''Midway Island'' in the Pacific. After several days of aerial attacks on naval ships, American carrier-based planes defeated the Japanese ships so badly that their navy never recovered. Starving and weakened by disease, they held on for another month before surrendering.  

==The Home Front==

With the mass media of motion pictures and the radio, the American government was able to motivate and move individuals and groups more efficiently than ever before. The government had begun to draft eligible young men in 1940, and the draft was ramped up after Pearl Harbor. There was scattered opposition to this overwhelmingly popular measure among religious pacifists and the Nation of Islam, and among the American Communists until Germany attacked the Soviet Union. Under the streamlined system put in process during 1942, males eighteen years of age and older registered with the government. If the individual's name was drawn during an intermittent lottery, he received a postcard telling him to report to his local draft board, organized by the national Subscription Service.&lt;ref&gt;The Draft and World War II, webpage of the National World War II Museum. Retrieved 11/23/2014 from http://www.nationalww2museum.org/learn/education/for-students/ww2-history/take-a-closer-look/draft-registration-documents.html&lt;/ref&gt; (In addition, many men, and some women, signed up without receiving a notice.) At the draft board men walked through the rooms of various doctors, psychiatrists, and military and civil authorities. An applicant could be refused if he was ill, even with such minor ailments as nearsightedness or flat feet. He might also apply for an exemption if he was the head of a family or in a steel or arms factory. There were also exemptions for pacifism, though the man had to have a letter from his priest or minister saying that he had a religious basis for his pacifism. Quakers and Seventh Day Adventists were both denominations known for non-violence. Conscientious objectors could become medics or work in some other peaceful operation in support of the war. Men who had no letter, and who were unwilling to support the War in peaceful ways, were often put in prison and derided by the public. From the draft board men went straight into Basic Training, from there to become soldiers, sailors or Marines, or airplane pilots. Women could become nurses or join various auxiliary forces such as the Woman's Army Corps (WACs). These were not permitted to fight, but in their capacity as communication and supervisory aides were often on the battlefield.

With many men being shipped overseas to fight in the war, many employment opportunities opened up for women. Thousands of women began to support the war efforts by getting employed in many different factories producing tanks and planes and other sorts of weaponry. Some factories which had been devoted to peacetime production of cars and bicycles were converted to armament factories, and the nascent television stations were shut down. Sales of these items were halted &quot;for the duration.&quot; The start of World War II brought the end of the Great Depression due to the supplies and men it takes to win a war.

Part of the war effort was the incorporation of American civilians into efforts showing that they could also make a difference. Victory Gardens were even more abundant than in World War I. These supplemented food and gasoline rations, initiated with the aim of getting supplies to the troops. Public work sites, and even some schools and Boy and Girl Scouts, vied to round up paper, scrap metal, and other supplies. These scrap drives brought in a limited amount of useful material, but helped involve some people who would have felt useless in the big war drive. Some public citizens who had not been permitted to join the military were delegated as air raid wardens, making sure that homes were darkened at night. (Especially during the first few years of the war, there was a real fear that some enemy Axis plane might bomb the American mainland.) Hollywood, still reeling from the Depression, brought itself back with instructional films for the troops and propaganda for moviegoers at home. 

In February 1942, the War Relocation Authority began to establish centers where Japanese-Americans, including those born in the United States, were interned. Though this racial discrimination violated constitutional due process requirements, the Supreme Court ruled that such internment was lawful in 1944, when it decided ''Korematsu v. United States''.

==Turning back the European Axis==
During the summer and fall of 1941, the Germans kept up their amazing pace into the heart of Russia. By December they had reached Moscow, and Leningrad was under siege. The Soviets sent in reserve troops from Siberia, and launched a counter attack. It succeeded, and Moscow was saved.

In the spring of 1942, Hitler ordered an attack into the Caucus Mountains, and Stalingrad. As they had done before, the Germans quickly advanced, breaking through the Russian lines. In Stalingrad, there was street to street, and house to house fighting. The Germans controlled over 90% of the city, but the Russians refused to surrender. A Russian reserve division encircled the Germans into the city, and 250,000 German soldiers were captured. It was one of the bloodiest battles in history.

In 1943, the President of the United States for an unprecedented third term, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill held a Conference at Casablanca. The two nations then set up a plan of action for the next stages of the war. Meanwhile, the Russians continued to hold back the Germans, inflicting a crucial and massive defeat on Hitler's armies at the battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942-43. After a further major Russian victory at Kursk the following summer, the Germans were forced into retreat back towards Europe. 

In Africa, Axis troops led by Erwin Rommel had pushed into Egypt, just 70 miles west of Alexandria. However, British troops led by General Montgomery decisively defeated the Italian and German troops at the Battle of El Alamein. They were pushed out of Egypt, all the way across Libya, and into Tunisia. In November 1942, the Americans launched operation Torch and drove the French troops out of Algeria and Morrocco. After a long battle with Axis troops in Tunisia, they were driven out of Africa in May 1943.

The Allies then decided to invade Sicily, in hope of knocking Italy out of the war. In early July the invasion began. For the next month, the British and Americans led a bloody campaign in which Sicily was finally taken in early August. During the invasion Mussolini was overthrown and arrested. Hitler had him rescued and put him in charge of the new Italian Social Republic. Following the Invasion of mainland Italy in early September, the Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies. The fall of Italy signaled the beginning of the end of World War II. However, Mussolini was rescued by the Germans and had established an Italian Social Republic.
Near the end of the War, Germany tries to fight for a last stand with the Allies. It became to be Germany's only hope for turning the war around. The battle took place in a 60 mile deep 40 mile wide &quot;Bulge&quot;. Therefore giving the name of the battle, battle of the Bulge. After weeks of fighting in the cold winters the Allied forces came out victorious. Months after this battle the Allied forces had the Germans pushed all the way back into Berlin.

==Antisemitism and The Holocaust==
The prejudice of racism in America -- though the term ''racist'' is a misnomer: we are all members of the human race -- was evident from the days of Christopher Columbus onward. Antisemitism was a powerful motivating force in American history. The limits on immigration set in the early 1920s was in part a reaction against [Jewish] immigrants from Eastern Europe. The prosecutors of &quot;Red Summer&quot; had a dread of Blacks, Jews, and atheists, and sometimes of a nightmare conglomeration of all three. 

But some antisemitism was an alien import. The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Russian: &quot;Протоколы сионских мудрецов&quot;, or &quot;Сионские протоколы&quot;, see also other titles) is an antisemitic and anti-Zionist plagiarism and literary hoax first published in 1903 in Russian, in Znamya; it alleges a Jewish and Masonic plot to achieve world domination. A translation, taken as the literal truth, was published and popularized by the American industrialist Henry Ford. In the 1930s, the American Bund attempted to increase Nazi German influence, and to amplify the antisemetic messages coming from Berlin. 

President Roosevelt treated the topic with care. Ethnographers and other scientific experts were drafted into the War effort, emphasizing that Americans came from every ethnic background. Jews were in every branch of the service, and rabbis were among the chaplains brought to aid them. But what came to be known as ''The Final Solution'' -- Hitler's plan to eliminate what ''Mein Kampf'' had called &quot;the Jewish Question&quot; -- was unknown to the American public. American newspapers had printed accounts of German oppression of its Jewish citizens, from Kristallnacht in 1938 onward. They had occasionally mentioned persecution of its Gypsies, Slavs, and other &quot;non-Aryans,&quot; and the dreadful punishments meted out to those who opposed the Nazi regime. 

In January, 1945, Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz, the largest of the Nazi Concentration Camps. On April Eleventh, 1945, Allies liberated the Death Camp at Buchenwald, near Weimar, Germany. On the 12th, several journalists arrived, including Edward R. Murrow, one of the most lauded journalists of the time. He sent out a broadcast for American audiences on the Fifteenth describing what he had seen and heard. &quot;There surged around me an evil-smelling stink, men and boys reached out to touch me. They were in rags and the remnants of uniforms. Death already had marked many of them, but they were smiling with their eyes. I looked out over the mass of men to the green fields beyond, where well-fed Germans were ploughing...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murrow, Edward R. Partial transcript of April 16, 1945. The Jewish Virtual Library. Retrieved on 11/16/2014 http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/murrow.html&lt;/ref&gt; On May third, Americans first saw newsreels of the camp. (Newsreels, film of weekly news reports shown in movie theaters, were major sources of information in the days before TV became popularized.) There they heard that the recent death rate had been about two hundred a day. They saw people in the last stages of malnutrition, disease, and &quot;constant hard work, beatings, and torture.&quot; The camera also showed corpses of men stacked like cords of wood, and the crematoria where the dead had been burnt.&lt;ref&gt;Buchenwald Nazi Concentration Camp Liberation footage -- stock footage -- www.PublicDomainFootage.com. Retrieved from YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBITJiR75tg , 11/16/2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now for the first time the majority of Americans could guess at the extent of '''The Holocaust''', one of the most ghastly episodes in the modern history of mankind. In April of 1933, three months after Hitler took power, the Nazis issued a decree ordering the compulsory retirement of &quot;non-Aryans&quot; from the civil service. This is known as the spark of the Holocaust. Before Germany was defeated, there were some eleven million people that had been slaughtered in the name of Nazi racial purity. Although the Jews were the favored targets and are the victims we most hear about when talking about the Holocaust, they were not the only victims. There were also millions of Russians, Poles, gypsies and others that were also murdered. Although the deprivation of the Jews started in the years following 1933, the mass killings didn't begin until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WWII&quot; by Eric Sevareid&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of this knowledge was augmented by the Nuremburg trials of 1945-1946. There many German officials, and some Concentration Camp governors, were put to trial for committing these murders, called crimes against humanity. American antisemitism has continued since that time, but it is at least officially frowned upon. The American eugenics movement also suffered a setback from which it has not yet recovered.

== Operation Overlord ==

In November, 1943, Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt held another Conference at Tehran. Joseph Stalin, who held the title of General Secretary of the Communist Party of the USSR, but was actually a Dictator of the Soviet Union, joined them there. The three leaders agreed to a plan codenamed Operation Overlord, under which an attack would be launched on the northern coast of France from the English Channel. In preparation for an invasion of France, Hitler cut off all support for the German armies remaining in the Soviet Union. Thus disabled, the German Army was forced to withdraw from Russia in the winter of 1943-1944.

On June 6, 1944 (&quot;D-Day,&quot;) in the early morning hours, American and British paratroopers were dropped into Normandy. Hours later, American, British, French and Canadian soldiers landed at Normandy on the north coast of France. The troops landed near Caen, but Hitler wrongly felt that they would attack at a location to the north of that city. The Allies took advantage of Hitler's miscalculation; by the end of the month, the Allies had over eight hundred thousand soldiers in Normandy.

Meanwhile, Russian troops, which had been on the defensive, began their offensive on German-controlled territories. In the middle of July, the Soviets won their first major victory by taking the territory of Belorussia.  At this time, concern began to grow in the West about Soviet domination replacing German in eastern Europe, especially in Poland.  Despite these worries, Roosevelt felt that he had little influence in that area over Stalin, whose armies were bearing a huge brunt of the fight.  

By the end of July, the Allies expanded their base at Normandy by breaking out into the rest of France. Pushing through the nation, the Allies had gone far enough to liberate the city of Paris on August 25. On September 11, some Allied troops entered Germany, taking Antwerp, Belgium on the way.  German resistance then hardened, however. British Field Marshall Montgomery attempt to &quot;end the war by '44&quot; with Operation Market Garden, a plan to liberate Holland and bypass the German border defenses, failed. The British and American armies would make little more progress for the rest of 1944. 

Meanwhile, Russian troops pushed toward Germany, defeating Germany's Axis partners on the way. In August, Romania surrendered, followed by Bulgaria and Finland in September.

== Yalta and German Surrender ==

Allied air bombing of German industries and cities had been ongoing and savage since 1943, but did not have the intended effect of crushing the German will to fight. Indeed, Hitler was able to field new advanced weapons in 1943-45, such as the world's first jet fighter aircraft, the V-1 flying bomb, the V-2 ballistic missile, and new types of tanks and submarines.  The new weapons, however, proved of little use against Allied numbers and economic superiority, with American industrial production for the war effort massive and untouched by Axis attack.  Germany forced millions of prisoners into slave labor, under the most brutal conditions, to keep its own war effort going.  

In December 1944, Germany launched a massive counter-attack on the light defended American positions in Belgium. The Germans hoped to cut off the Allied supply lines, however, after reinforcements arrived, the &quot;Bulge&quot;(today it is know as the Battle of the Bulge) was flattened out. Meanwhile, the Soviets were on the verge of entering Germany from the east en masse, having taken control of Poland.  Hitler's troops were exhausted, millions dead or captured, and with the fall of the Romanian oil fields, German armies were running out of gasoline.  A final call-up began of old men and boys for a last-ditch defense of Germany. Many German civilians fled, fearing the revenge the Russians would put on them after what the Germans had done in Russia. Thousands of German noncombatants were raped, and many of these were then killed. 

In early February 1945, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Josef Stalin, the three leaders of the anti-Nazi alliance, met at Yalta in the U.S.S.R.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, Katherine A. S. The Cold War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the Allied powers, &quot;The Big Three,&quot; were planning for the end of the war. This was a follow-up to the meeting of the three powers in November 1943 in the Tehran Conference.

At Yalta the countries contended on what to do with Germany. Churchill and Britain wanted to protect their colonial possessions and to keep the Soviet Union from having too much power. Stalin and the Soviet Union wanted Germany to pay them to help start the rebuilding of their country. Stalingrad, a byword for Soviet military resistance of Hitler, was now in ruins. Two wars of German aggression had been too much, and the country needed to be permanently restrained. The United States wanted to influence Germany toward democracy and to keep the peace.&lt;ref&gt;A People and A Nation&lt;/ref&gt; The Yalta conference decided the division of defeated Germany into zones for reconstruction. The leaders agreed to punish Nazis for war crimes, including the Holocaust. Other topics included Soviet Russia's entry into the war against Japan, composition of the post-war government of Germany,voting arrangements in the new United Nations organizations, and the future of the liberated governments of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, Katherine A. S. The Cold War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Yalta Declaration on Liberated Europe, which called for free elections and constitutional liberties in Eastern Europe, was the most controversial topic of the Yalta Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, Katherine A. S. The Cold War. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1998. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allies first attempted to reach the Rhine River in their quest to take over Germany.  In March, this goal accomplished, the Americans and British opposed the Soviets in the ''Race for Berlin''. The Race determined who would control Berlin, a city that would prove important in the reconstruction of Germany. 
The Americans allowed the Soviets to win the Race for Berlin.  Fierce fighting erupted in and around the city as motley German units made their last stand against the powerful army groups of Russian marshals Zhukov and Koniev. His capital surrounded and his loyal minions deserting him, Adolf Hitler killed himself in his Berlin command bunker on April 30, 1945. Benito Mussolini was executed by Italian Partisans on April 28. The new leader of Germany, Karl Doenitz, agreed to surrender. On May 8, Germany formally signed an unconditional surrender, dissolving the Axis and leaving only Japan to be defeated.

== The End of the FDR Era ==

The public was never informed of the extent of President Roosevelt's paralysis. Though he admitted that he had suffered polio, no newsreels showed him pulling himself along with his crutches. At press conferences the photographers were led in when he was already in a chair or in his car seat. Compensation for the leg disability, and the physical activity the Roosevelts were known for, had made his upper arms strong and muscular. However, his physical strain combined with the burden of the Presidency to weary him. Speaking to Congress in the wake of Yalta, he made a rare admission of how much this affected him: &quot;I hope that you will pardon me for this unusual posture of sitting down during the presentation of what I want to say, but . . . it makes it a lot easier for me not to have to carry about ten pounds of steel around on the bottom of my legs; and also . . . I have just completed a fourteen-thousand-mile trip.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Address to Congress on the Yalta Conference''. March 1, 1945. The American Presidency Project, John Woolley and Gerhard Peters, eds. Retrieved 12/27/2014, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=16591&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt was ill, and had been frail even before his re-election in 1944. The Republican party had objected to the President even running for a fourth term. The Republican Candidate, Thomas E. Dewey, accused him of running a corrupt autocracy and of feigning good health. In response to accusations of corruption, Roosevelt dropped former Vice President Henry A. Wallace and picked up newcomer Harry S. Truman, who had risen in a War anti-fraud committee in the Senate. He also campaigned vigorously in the cities, which may have hastened his death. 

Roosevelt died of a stroke on April 12th, 1945. After FDR's death Harry Truman became president. The day after Roosevelt's death Truman sought out old friends to ask for their help in this &quot;terrible job.&quot;

== The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II ==
{{Wikipedia|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
After the Battle of Midway the United States surely retook the Asian Pacific nations, fighting the Japanese empire island by island, by gun, by shell, and by flame thrower. Though the Japanese continued to fight, its armed forces were in a hopeless situation. Its armaments became fewer. Kamikaze (the Japanese word for &quot;Sacred Wind&quot;), pilots who hoped to destroy American ships by intentionally crashing their own planes into them, became more dominant in Japanese opposition. 

The United States had become involved in a competition with Nazi Germany to find technologies which would win the war. Among these technologies was nuclear fission, the splitting of a highly electronegative atom into smaller ones, which gives off ten times as much power. With cooperative or captive scientists and slave labor, the Nazis were attempting to use uranium to create an '''atomic bomb'''. During the same time, America had become the home for dissident German and Jewish scientists. Native-born and newly-emigrated American physicists were also talking about the possibilities of fission. One of the latter, Albert Einstein, sent a letter to President Roosevelt in 1939 explaining the developments in the nuclear chain reactions which would result in an atomic explosion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WWII&quot; by Eric Severeid&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, a number of the top minds in physics were relocated to a secret location in New Mexico. These men volunteered to work at what was code-named the Manhattan Project, a secret attempt to bring to fruition what Einstein had posited in 1939. At its height the Manhattan Project employed more than 600,000 workers, the majority of them not realizing what they were really working for. After spending more than two billion dollars, the Project created the first atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WWII&quot; by Eric Sevareid&lt;/ref&gt; On July 16, 1945, this bomb was successfully tested in New Mexico.

In the interim, Germany had been defeated. President Roosevelt had died, and had been replaced in office by his Vice President, Harry S. Truman. President Truman listened to experts who forecast two more years of war against Japan, and the prospect of a bloody American invasion. Truman chose to use the atomic bomb instead of an invasion.  

On August sixth, an A-bomb with the name Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, by a B-29 aircraft piloted by Col. Paul Tibbets. The explosion formed a mushroom cloud. Dust and debris shot into the sky and was seen miles away. Many people died instantly, but others fell sick a few days later from effects on the radiation on living tissue. The American press was told about the detonation of the bomb on a population of civilians, but not about its full effects. The Japanese government did not give in. On August ninth a bomb called Fat Man was dropped on the weapon-producing city of Nagasaki, again upon civilians. Together, the bombs killed over one hundred thousand people. Between the two bombings, meanwhile, the Soviet Union had joined in the war on Japan. The Americans threatened a third bombing on Tokyo, though they had not yet had time to create a new bomb. Now Japan unconditionally surrendered, officially ending World War II. Officials signed a treaty for surrender on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri.

The death toll of the Second World War was greater than that of the First. At least sixty-one million people died from the Allied nations of the Soviet Union; the United States and its colonies; Great Britain, its colonies and Canada; France and its colonies; the Netherlands and its colonies; Belgium and its colonies; and Poland, Norway, and Greece. In contrast, the main Axis powers of Germany, Italy and Japan only suffered twelve million casualties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Civil Rights Movement under Eisenhower and Desegregation ==

The first events that would spark off the entire Civil Rights movement happened during the Eisenhower administration. In the south, there were many statewide laws that segregated many public facilities ranging from buses to water fountains. Southern African Americans now felt that their time had come to enjoy American democracy and they fought hard to end southern segregation policies.

===''Brown v. Board of Education''===

In 1952, seven year old Linda Brown, of Topeka, Kansas, wasn't permitted to attend a white-only elementary school that was only a few blocks from her house. In order to attend her coloreds-only school, Brown had to cross dangerous railroad tracks and take a bus for many miles. Her family sued the Topeka school board and lost, but appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court. ''Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'' came to the Supreme Court in December 1952. In his arguments, head lawyer for the NAACP, Thurgood Marshall, challenged the &quot;Separate But Equal&quot; doctrine established in ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' in 1896. He argued that schools could be separate, but never equal. On May 17, 1954, the Court gave its opinion. It ruled that it was unconstitutional to segregate schools, and ordered that schools integrate &quot;with all deliberate speed.&quot;

====Central High Confrontation====

Integration would not be easy. Many school districts accepted the order without argument, but some, like the district of Little Rock, Arkansas, did not. On September 2, 1957, the day before the start of the school term the Arkansas Governor, Orval Faubus, instructed the National Guard to stop any black students entering the school. He claimed this was to protect the property against violence planned by integration protesters. 

The federal authorities intervened and an injunction was granted preventing the National Guard from blocking the school and they were withdrawn on September 20. School restarted on 23 September, with the building surrounded by local police officers and nearly one thousand protesters. The police escorted nine black students, later known as the Little Rock Nine, into the school via a side door. When the crowd discovered the students had entered the building, they tried to storm the school and the black students were hurried out around lunch time.

Congressman Brooks Hays and the Little Rock mayor, Woodrow Mann, asked the federal government for more help. On September 24, Mann sent a message to President Eisenhower requesting troops. Eisenhower responded immediately and the 101st Airborne Division was sent to Arkansas. In addition, the President brought the Arkansas National Guard under federal control to prevent its further use by the Governor. 

On September 25, 1957, the nine black students finally began their education properly, protected by 1,000 paratroopers.

===Montgomery Bus Boycott===

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress and secretary of the Montgomery, Alabama, chapter of the NAACP, boarded a city bus with the intention of going home. She sat in the first row of seats in the &quot;colored&quot; section of the segregated bus. At the next stop, whites were among the passengers waiting to board but all seats in the &quot;white&quot; front section of the bus were filled. Drivers had the authority, under local custom and the segregated-seating ordinance, to shift the line dividing the black and white sections to accommodate the racial makeup of the passengers at any given moment. So he ordered the four blacks sitting in the first row of seats in the &quot;colored&quot; section to stand and move to the rear of the bus so the waiting whites could have those seats. Three of the passengers complied; Mrs. Parks did not. Warned again by the driver, she still refused to move, at which point the driver exited the bus and located a policeman, who came onto the bus, arrested Mrs. Parks, and took her to the city jail. She was booked for violating the segregation ordinance, and was shortly released on bail posted by E. D. Nixon, the leading local civil rights activist. She was scheduled to appear in municipal court on December 5, 1955.

Mistreatment of African Americans on Montgomery's segregated buses was not uncommon, and several other women had been arrested in similar situations in the months preceding Parks's. However, Mrs. Parks was especially well-known and well-respected within the black community, and her arrest particularly angered the African Americans of Montgomery. In protest, community leaders quickly organized a one-day boycott of the buses to coincide with her December 5 court date. An organization, the Montgomery Improvement Association, was also created, and the new minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, the 26-year-old Martin Luther King, Jr., was selected as the MIA's president. Word of the boycott spread effectively through the city over the weekend of December 3–4, aided by mimeographed fliers prepared the Women's Political Council, by announcements in black churches that Sunday morning, and by an article in the local newspaper about the pending boycott, which had been &quot;leaked&quot; to a reporter by E. D. Nixon.

On the morning of Mrs. Parks's trial, King, Nixon, and other leaders were pleasantly surprised to see that the boycott was almost 100 percent effective among blacks. And since African Americans made up 75% of Montgomery's bus riders, the impact was significant. In city court, Mrs. Parks was convicted and was fined $10. Her attorney, the 24-year-old Fred D. Gray, announced an appeal. That night, more than 5,000 blacks crowded into and around the Holt Street Baptist Church for a &quot;mass meeting&quot; to discuss the situation. For most in the church (and listening outside over loudspeakers), it was their first time to hear the oratory of Martin Luther King, Jr. He asked the crowd if they wanted to continue the boycott indefinitely, and the answer was a resounding yes. For the next 381 days, African Americans boycotted the buses, while the loss of their fares drove the Chicago-owned bus company into deeper and deeper losses. However, segregationist city officials prohibited the bus company from altering its seating policies, and negotiations between black leaders and city officials went nowhere.

With bikes, carpools, and hitchhiking, African Americans were able to minimize the impact of the boycott on their daily lives. Meanwhile, whites in Montgomery responded with continued intransigence and rising anger. Several black churches and the homes of local leaders and ministers, including those of Nixon and King, were bombed, and there were numerous assaults by white thugs on African Americans. Some 88 local black leaders were also arrested for violating an old anti-boycott law.

Faced with the lack of success of negotiations, attorney Gray soon filed a separate lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the segregated seating laws. The case was assigned to and testimony was heard by a three-judge panel, and the young Frank M. Johnson, Jr., newly appointed to the federal bench by Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower, was given the responsibility for writing the opinion in the case. Johnson essentially ruled that in light of the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, there was no way to justify legally the segregation policies, and the district court ruling overturned the local segregation ordinance under which Mrs. Parks and others had been arrested. The city appealed, but the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling, and in December 1956, city officials had no choice but to comply. The year-long boycott thus came to an end.

The Montgomery Bus Boycott made Mrs. Parks famous and it launched the civil rights careers of King and his friend and fellow local minister, Ralph Abernathy. The successful boycott is regarded by many historians as the effective beginning of the twentieth century civil rights movement in the U.S.

==Vietnam==

In the early 50's, Vietnam was rebelling against French rule. America saw Vietnam as a potential source of trouble, as rebels (known as the Vietnamese) led by Communist leader Ho Chi Minh were gaining strength. America loaned France billions of dollars to aid in the war against the Vietnamese rebels, but despite the aid, France found itself on the verge of defeat, and appealed to America for troops, but America refused, fearing entanglement in another costly Korean War, or even a war with all of communist Asia.

France surrendered, and the VietMinh and France met in Geneva, Switzerland to negotiate a treaty. Vietnam was divided into two countries: the Vietminh in control of the North and the French-friendly Vietnamese in control of the South. In 1956, the two countries would be reunited with free elections.

Eisenhower worried about South Vietnam. He believed that if it also fell to the Communists, many other Southeast Asian countries would follow, in what he called the ''domino theory''. He aided the Southern government and set up the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in 1954. The nations included in the alliance were America, Great Britain, France, Australia, Pakistan, the Philippines, New Zealand and Thailand, and they all pledged to fight against &quot;Communist aggressors&quot;.

==The Warsaw Pact and NATO==

1955 saw the division of Europe into two rival camps. The westernized countries of the free world had signed NATO 1949 and the eastern European countries signed the Warsaw pact.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created as a response to the crisis in Berlin. The United States, Britain, Canada, France, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and the Netherlands founded NATO in April 1949, and Greece, Turkey and West Germany had joined by 1955. The countries agreed that &quot;an armed attack against one or more of [the member states] in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all,&quot; and was created so that if the Soviet Union eventually did invade Europe, the invaded countries would have the most powerful army in the world (the United States' Army) come to their defense.  When the Korean War broke out, NATO drastically raised its threat level because of the idea that all the communist countries were working together.  As the number of communist countries grew and grew, so did the NATO forces.  Greece and Turkey eventually joined NATO in 1952.  The USSR eventually decided to join NATO so that there would be peace, but NATO declined them because they thought that the USSR would try to weaken them from the inside.

===The Warsaw Pact===

The Soviet Union responded in to the addition of West Germany to NATO 1955 with its own set of treaties, which were collectively known as the Warsaw Pact.  Warsaw Pact was also known as “The Treaty of Friendship”.  The Warsaw Pact allowed East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Albania, Romania, and Bulgaria to function in the same way as the NATO countries did.  The Soviet Union used this Warsaw Pact to combine the military forces unified under it.  The Pact was supposed to make all the countries in it, equal.  However, the Soviet Union took a little advantage of this by using the allied countries military wherever they wanted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.warsaw-life.com/poland/warsaw-pact&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike NATO, Warsaw forces were used occasionally.

==Suez Canal==

Back in 1948, Israel was created as a sanctuary of sorts for the displaced Jews of the Holocaust. At the same time, many Arabs living in the area were displaced. Tensions had been high in the Middle East ever since Israel had been attacked just after its founding. The stage was set for superpower involvement in 1956; the United States backed Israel, the Soviet Union backed the Arabs, and the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had nationalized, or brought under Egypt's control, the Suez Canal, which had previously belonged to Britain. 

France and Britain worried that Egypt would decide cut off oil shipments between the oil-rich Middle East and western Europe, so that October they invaded Egypt, hoping to overthrow Nasser and seize the canal. Israel, upset by earlier attacks by Arab states, agreed to help in the invasion.

U.S. and Soviet reactions to the invasions were almost immediate. The Soviets threatened to launch rocket attacks on British and French cities, and the United States sponsored a United Nations resolution for British and French withdrawal. Facing pressures from the two powers, the three invaders pulled out of Egypt. To ensure stability in the area, United Nations troops were sent to patrol the Egypt-Israel border.

==Rock and Roll==

The term “rock and roll” was originally a nautical phrase referring to the motion of a ship at sea.  In the early 20th century, it gained a religious connotation (referring to the sense of rapture felt by worshippers) and was used in spirituals.  After this, “rocking and rolling” increasingly became used as a metaphor for sex in blues and jazz songs.  

The origins of rock and roll lie primarily in electric blues from Chicago in the late 1940s, which was distinguished by amplification of the guitar, bass, and drums.  Electric blues was played by artists like Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Buddy Guy, who were recorded by Leonard and Phil Chess at Chess Records in Chicago.  They inspired electric blues artists in Memphis like Howlin’ Wolf and B.B. King, who were recorded by a Memphis-based record producer named Sam Phillips, also the owner of Sun Records. He later discovered Elvis Presley in 1954, and he also recorded early songs by Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Carl Perkins.

Rhythm and blues artists such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Ray Charles incorporated electric blues as well as gospel music.  In the early 50s, R&amp;B was more commonly known by the blanket term “race music”, which was also used to describe other African-American music of the era such as jazz and blues.  Billboard didn’t replace the “race records” category with “rhythm and blues” until 1958.  Doo-wop was a mainstream style of R&amp;B, with arrangements favoring vocal harmonies.  Other types of music that contributed to early rock and roll include African-American spirituals, also known as gospel music, and country/folk, which was primarily made by poor whites in the South.

Arguably, the first rock and roll song ever made is “Rocket 88”, recorded at Sam Phillip’s studio in Memphis in March 1951.  It was credited to “Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats,” a band that didn’t actually exist—the song was put together by Ike Turner and his band, the Kings of Rhythm.  Jackie Brenston was the vocalist on the song, who also played saxophone in the band.  What really sets “Rocket 88” apart is the distorted guitar sound: it was one of the first examples of fuzz guitar ever recorded.  The amplifier they used to record the song was damaged on the way from Mississippi to Memphis.  They tried to hold the cone in place by stuffing the amplifier with newspaper, which created the distortion. Sam Phillips liked the sound and decided to keep it in the song.  Although “Rocket 88” was recorded by Sam Phillips, it wasn’t released by Sun Records, which didn’t exist until 1952.  From 1950-1952, Phillips ran the Memphis Recording Service, where he would let amateurs perform and then sell the recordings to large record labels.  He sold “Rocket 88” to Chess Records, which released predominately blues, gospel, and R&amp;B.  The Chess brothers started Checker Records in 1952, because radio stations would only play a certain number of tracks from each label.

Alan Freed (also known as “Moondog”) was a radio DJ who started playing R&amp;B records on WJW in Cleveland in 1951.  He is credited with introducing rock and roll to a wide audience for the first time, as well as being the first to use the phrase “rock and roll” as the name of the genre.  He also promoted and helped organize the first major rock and roll concert, The Moondog Coronation Ball, which occurred on March 21, 1952.  The concert was so successful that it became massively overcrowded – there was a near-riot and it had to be shut down early.   Freed’s popularity soared, and he was immediately given more airtime by the radio station.  His promotion of rock ‘n’ roll is one of the main reasons it became successful, and in recognition of his contributions to the genre, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was built in Cleveland.

“Payola” refers to the practice of record company promoters paying radio DJs to play their recordings in order to boost their sales.  Payola had been commonplace since the Vaudeville era in the 1920s, but it became a scandal in the 1950s due to a conflict between the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) and radio stations.  Prior to 1940, ASCAP had made huge amounts of money from the sales of sheet music, but when radio started gaining popularity, recorded music became more profitable than sheet music.  ASCAP demanded large royalty payments from radio stations that played their recordings.  Instead, stations boycotted ASCAP recordings and created their own publishing company called Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI).  ASCAP tended to ignore music composed by black musicians or “hillbillies”, which gave BMI control of these areas.  When rock ‘n’ roll became more and more popular, BMI became more and more successful.  ASCAP (in addition to many others) believed that rock ‘n’ roll was the music of the devil, that it was brainwashing teenagers, and that it would never have been successful without payola.  This was just after the quiz show scandal (when it was found that certain shows were rigged), and ASCAP urged the House Legislative Committee which had investigated that scandal to look into payola.  The hearings that followed destroyed Alan Freed’s career, although it didn’t eliminate rock ‘n’ roll altogether as ASCAP had hoped.

Several factors contributed to the decline of early rock and roll.  Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis were both prosecuted in scandals involving young women.  Elvis Presley was inducted into the U.S. Army in 1958, and after training at Fort Hood, he joined the 3rd Armored Division in Germany, where he would remain until 1960.  Three rock and roll musicians –- Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and “The Big Bopper” –- died in a plane crash on February 3, 1959 (“The Day the Music Died”).  Little Richard retired from secular music after a religious experience.  He ran a ministry in Los Angeles, preached across the country, and recorded gospel music exclusively until 1962.

Rock and roll music is associated with the emergence of a teen subculture among baby boomers.  Teenagers bought records and were exposed to rock and roll via radio, jukeboxes, and television shows like American Bandstand, which featured teenagers dancing to popular music.  It also affected movies, fashion trends, and language.  The combination of white and black music in rock and roll –- at a time when racial tensions were high and the civil rights movement was in full-swing –- provoked strong reactions among the older generation, many of whom worried that rock and roll would contribute to social delinquency among teenagers.  However, it actually encouraged racial cooperation and understanding to some extent—rock and roll was a combination of diverse styles of music made by different races, and it was enjoyed by both African-American and Caucasian teens.

==Space Race==

'''The Space Race''' has its origins in an arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.  After the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in September 1949, the fear of nuclear war began to spread.  The ensuing arms race led to the creation of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range rockets designed to deliver nuclear warheads from land- or submarine-based launch sites.  The first successful ICBM test flight was on August 21, 1957, when the USSR launched an ICBM with a dummy payload over 4,000 miles to an isolated peninsula on Russia’s east coast that had been declared a military zone (Kamchatka Peninsula, which remained closed to civilians from 1945–1989).  

On October 4, 1957, the Soviets successfully put the first man-made satellite, ''Sputnik'', into orbit. Americans were horrified. They feared that the Soviets were using the satellite to spy on Americans, or even worse, that the Soviet Union might attack America with nuclear weapons from space. America responded with the launch of its own satellite, ''Vanguard''. Hundreds of spectators gathered, only to watch the satellite rise only a few feet off the launch pad, and then explode.

The failure spurred the government to create a space agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA succeeded in launching the ''Explorer'' in 1958, and thus, the Space Race was initiated. With the creation of Project Mercury, a program to put an astronaut in space, America was pulling ahead. Nonetheless, the USSR was the first to put a man in space, when Yuri Gagarin was launched into orbit in 1961. For the next 14 years, the U.S and the Soviet Union would continue to compete in space.

Many Americans were frightened during the start of the space race because this gave the Soviet Union a better ability to launch a surprise attack on the states. The United States of course immediately jumped on the bandwagon and did its best to become the first country to land on the moon.

==Cuban Revolution==

In 1958 and 1959, anti-American feeling became a part of the growing Cuban revolution. In January 1959, the dictator of Cuba, Fulgenicio Batista, was overthrown by the rebel leader Fidel Castro, who promptly became the leader of Cuba.

At first, America supported Castro because of his promises of democratic and economic reforms. But relations between the two countries became strained when Cuba began seizing foreign-owned land (which was mostly U.S. owned) as a part of its reforms. Soon, Castro's government was a dictatorship, and was being backed by the Soviet Union. In 1961, Eisenhower cut diplomatic ties with Cuba, and relations with the island nation have been difficult ever since.

===Rise of the Middle Class===
In the late 1940s and 1950’s led to a rise of the middle class in the United States.  With troops coming home from the war soldiers were quick to start families.  The GI bill allowed for upward mobility for veterans.  With free college and over four billion dollars given to trips the economy continued to succeed.  With war savings and a host of new consumer goods on the market, America quickly turned into a consumer market.  The best example of this would be automobiles and the television.  In 1955, $65 billion was spent on automobiles.  This represented 20% of the Gross National Product.  In 1950 50% of American homes had a television.  By 1960 this number was raised to 90%.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vectors''' are commonly used in physics and other fields to express quantities that cannot be accurately described by a scalar. '''Scalars''' are simply the value of something in a single dimension - a real number. For example, one might say that they have driven 5 kilometers, that an hour has elapsed, or that something's mass is 20 kilograms. In every one of these cases, there has been exactly one value stated. 

However, we might have more information we wish to give. Take the example of driving 5 kilometers. In this case, it may be useful to know how far you drove, but it might also be equally important which ''direction'' you drove, such as 5 kilometers due east. Now, given your starting point, exactly where you drove can be determined.

== Definitions ==

Vectors can be described mathematically by using [[Algebra/Trigonometry|trigonometry]]. 
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[image:Vector_example.PNG|Sample Vector]]&lt;/div&gt;
We can define a vector to be an ordered pair consisting of a '''magnitude''' and a '''direction'''. In this diagram, ''r'' is the magnitude of this vector and &amp;theta; is the direction. Notice, now, that we have moved horizontally ''r'' cos(&amp;theta;) and vertically ''r'' sin(&amp;theta;). These are called the ''x-component'' and the ''y-component'', respectively. 

We can also write a vector conveniently in terms of the x and y component. We write &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; for vectors. In some texts, you may see the vector written sideways, like (''x'', ''y''), but when you write it will help ''greatly'' to write them downwards in columns. In print we commonly use bold vectors, but since you probably don't have a pen that writes in bold print, underline your vectors, i.e. write &lt;u&gt;v&lt;/u&gt;, or put a tilde underneath your vectors. Occasionally in Physics, you may see vectors written with an arrow pointing right.

Notice that vectors need not have two components. We can have 2 or 3 or ''n'' or an infinite number of components.

We write the set of all vectors with 2 real number components as '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; likewise for 3, ''n'', or infinite number of components. For components with complex numbers, we write '''C'''. Polynomials are &quot;vectors&quot; too - we'll look at notation for the set of polynomials later. For a reason why we do this, see [[Discrete mathematics/Set theory|Set theory]] for an explanation.

== Stretching and shrinking ==
We can define some actions on vectors. What will happen if we extend the vector? Or what will happen if we shrink the vector? The vector's ''direction'' doesn't change, only its length -- its magnitude. The action we perform to stretch or shrink a vector is that we multiply its magnitude by some amount. We refer to doing this as ''scalar multiplication'': we multiply the ''vector'' by a ''scalar'' real number.

=== Scalar multiplication ===
For scalar multiplication, we simply multiply each component by the scalar. We commonly use Greek letters for scalars, and English letters for vectors.


So for a scalar value of &amp;lambda; and a vector '''v''' defined by ''r'' and &amp;theta;, the new vector is now &amp;lambda;''r'' and &amp;theta;. Notice how the direction does not change.

==== Example ====
Say we have &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and we wish to double the magnitude. So, &lt;math&gt;2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Addition of vectors ==

Simply, to add two vectors, you must add the respective x-components together to obtain the new x-component, and likewise add the two y-components together to obtain the new y-component.

=== Example ===
Say we have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{v_2}=\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and we wish to add these. So, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2}=\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 9 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Subtraction of vectors ==

The operation of subtraction on two vectors, '''a''' and '''b''', '''a'''-'''b''', can also be written as '''a'''+(-1)'''b'''. Therefore, we can use scalar multiplication to find the value of (-1)'''b''', then use vector addition to find our solution.

== Complex numbers as vectors ==
^
[[../Complex numbers/]] can be represented in the form &lt;math&gt;r(cos(\theta) + isin(\theta))&lt;/math&gt; or equivalently &lt;math&gt;re^{i\theta}&lt;/math&gt; , or in other words, a vector with magnitude &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and direction &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;. On the complex plane, this vector has a ''real'' x-component and an ''imaginary'' y-component. See [[../Complex numbers/]] for more information.

== Lines and planes ==
We can form the equations of lines and planes using vectors. Let's see how we can do this.

=== Vector equation of the line ===
Consider a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Let's consider the following:
: &lt;math&gt;2\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;3\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If we have the equation &amp;lambda;'''v''', it is clear that for each choice of &amp;lambda; we choose, we get a different point on the line ''y''=2''x''. 

We can now generalize this idea into the ''vector equation of the line'' (and it is not restricted to 2 dimensions either).

The vector equation of a line is given by
: '''x'''=&amp;lambda;'''v''' (for a scalar &amp;lambda;)
where '''v''' is a vector parallel (which then, could lie) on the line. &amp;lambda; then, is the unknown in the equation. '''x''' is then the dependant vector variable.

=== Vector equation of the plane ===
Now consider a plane. If we have two nonparallel vectors lying on the plane and we add them, we can add a linear combination (that is, add the two vectors, which are multiplied only by scalars) to choose some other vector. The set of all vectors under linear combinations of these two vectors form a plane.
&lt;!-- a picture speaks a thousand words --&gt;

More simply, if we have two nonparallel vectors '''a''' and '''b''' we can form any other vector parallel to '''a''' and '''b''' by:
: &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''a'''+&amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''b'''='''x'''
where &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;lambda;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are both scalars.

== Further algebra and geometry of vectors ==
There are other operations on vectors which we can perform. These operations we will consider have very real and significant geometric meanings.

=== Magnitude ===
The ''magnitude'' of a vector is its length in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

=== The dot product===
The ''dot product'' of two vectors is defined as the sum of the products of the components. Symbolically we write
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\b_n \end{pmatrix} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + \ldots + a_nb_n&lt;/math&gt;

For example,
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}=3-10=-7&lt;/math&gt;

==== Properties of the dot product ====
If we have '''a''' and '''b''' as vectors,
: '''a''' &amp;middot; '''b''' = '''b''' &amp;middot; '''a'''
: ''c''('''a''' &amp;middot; '''b''') = '''ca'''&amp;middot;'''b''' = '''a'''&amp;middot;'''cb'''
where ''c'' is a scalar.

==== Geometry of the dot product ====
&lt;!-- Need a nice pictorial proof of the equivalence of the forms --&gt;
The dot product of two vectors has an alternate form:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\cos{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
If we pick a vector '''c'''='''a'''-'''b''' to form a triangle, we can show that these two forms are indeed equivalent by trigonometry.

The angle &amp;theta; then is important, as it shows that the dot product of two vectors is related to the angle between them. More specifically, we can calculate the dot product of two vectors - if the dot product is zero we can then say that the two vectors are perpendicular.

For example, consider simply
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}=1-1=0&lt;/math&gt;
Plot these vectors on the plane and verify for yourself that these vectors are perpendicular.

=== Cross product ===
The ''cross product'' is a more complicated product to define, but has a nice geometric property. We will only look at the cross product in three dimensions, since it is the most commonly used in three dimensions and it is difficult to define in greater dimensions.

For a vector with three components, the cross product is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\times\begin{pmatrix}b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{vmatrix} 
\mathbf{i} &amp; \mathbf{j} &amp; \mathbf{k} \\
a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3 \\
b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 \\ \end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{i}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{j}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \mathbf{k}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If you have not done Matricies before, here is a formula to work out from above...

=  '''i''' &lt;math&gt;(a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2)&lt;/math&gt;  - '''j'''&lt;math&gt; (a_1 b_3 - a_3 b_1)&lt;/math&gt;+ '''k''' &lt;math&gt;(a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Properties of the cross product ====
The cross product has some properties
: '''a'''&amp;times;'''b''' = -'''b'''&amp;times;'''a'''
which is easily verified from the above definition, and
: '''c'''&amp;times;('''a'''+'''b''') = '''c'''&amp;times;'''a'''+'''c'''&amp;times;'''b'''
 

==== Geometric properties of the cross product ====
The cross product has some interesting geometric properties. 

If '''a''' and '''b''' are two vectors, '''a'''&amp;times;'''b''' is the vector perpendicular to both. Now if we have two vectors, we have ''two'' choices of vector perpendicular to '''a''' and '''b''' - if we switch the order of the cross product we obtain the other vector.

The magnitude of the cross product of two vectors is the area of the parallelogram formed by these two vectors.

The ''scalar triple product'', '''a'''&amp;middot;('''b'''&amp;times;'''c''') is the volume of the paralleliped formed by these three vectors. &lt;!-- needs a pic --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alcohols''' are the family of compounds that contain one or more '''hydroxyl (-OH)''' groups attached to a single bonded alkane. Alcohols are represented by the general formula -OH. Alcohols are important in organic chemistry because they can be converted to and from many other types of compounds. Reactions with alcohols fall into two different categories. Reactions can cleave the R-O bond or they can cleave the O-H bond.

Ethanol (ethyl alcohol, or grain alcohol) is found in alcoholic beverages, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH.

=Preparation=

In the [[Organic_Chemistry/Alkenes|Alkenes]] section, we already covered a few methods for synthesizing alcohols. One is the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes and the other is the oxymercuration-reduction of alkenes. But there are a great many other ways of creating alcohols as well.

A common source for producing alcohols is from carbonyl compounds. The choice of carbonyl type (ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and the type of reaction (Grignard addition or Reduction), will determine the product(s) you will get. Fortunately, there are a number of variations of carbonyls, leading to a number of choices in product.

There are primarily two types of reactions used to create alcohols from carbonyls: Grignard Addition reactions and Reduction reactions. We'll look at each type of reaction for each type of carbonyl.

===Grignard Addition Reactions===

As we learned previously, [[Organic_Chemistry/Haloalkanes#Grignard_reagents|Grignard reagents]] are created by reacting magnesium metal with an alkyl halide (aka [[Organic Chemistry/Haloalkanes|haloalkanes]]). The magnesium atom then gets between the alkyl group and the halogen atom with the general reaction:

R-X + Mg &amp;rarr; R-Mg-X

In our examples, we'll be using bromine in our Grignard reagents because it's a common Grignard halogen and it will keep our examples a little clearer without the need for X.

[[Image:Grignard-Reaction_Mechanism.png|thumb|600px|center|Mechanism of Grignard reagent reacting with a carbonyl]]

The general mechanism of a Grignard reagent reacting with a carbonyl (except esters) involves the creation of a 6-membered ring transition state. The pi bond of the oxygen attacks a neighboring magnesium bromide which in turn, releases from its R group leaving a carbocation. At the same time, the magnesium bromide ion from another Grignard molecule is attacked by the carbocation and has its magnesium bromide ion stolen (restoring it to its original state as a Grignard reagent). The second molecule's carbocation is then free to attack the carbanion resulting from the vacating pi bond, attaching the R group to the carbonyl.

At this point, there is a magnesium bromide on the oxygen of what was a carbonyl. The proton from the acidic solvent easily displaces this magnesium bromide ion and protonates the oxygen, creating a primary alcohol with formaldehyde, a secondary alcohol with an aldehyde and a tertiary alcohol with a ketone.

With esters, the mechanism is slightly different. Two moles of Grignard are required for each mole of the ester. Initially, the pi bond on the carbonyl oxygen attacks the magnesium bromide ion. This opens up the carbon for attack from the R group of the Grignard. This part of the reaction is slow because of the dual oxygens off of the carbon providing some resonance stabilization. The oxygen's pi bond then re-forms, expelling the O-R group of the ester which then joins with the magnesium bromide, leaving R-O-MgBr and a ketone. The R-O-MgBr is quickly protonated from the acidic solution and the ketone is then attacked by Grignard reagent via the mechanism described earlier.

====Synthesis from Formaldehyde====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_formaldehyde_via_grignard.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from formaldehyde and Grignard reagent]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from formaldehyde reacted with a Grignard reagent. When a formaldehyde is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a primary alcohol.

====Synthesis from an Aldehyde====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_aldehyde_via_grignard.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an aldehyde and Grignard reagent]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an aldehyde reacted with a Grignard reagent. When an aldehyde is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a secondary alcohol.

====Synthesis from a Ketone====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_ketone_via_grignard.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an ketone and Grignard reagent]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from a ketone reacted with a Grignard reagent.
When a ketone is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a tertiary alcohol.

====Synthesis from an Ester====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_ester_via_grignard.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an ester and Grignard reagent]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an ester reacted with a Grignard reagent.
When an ester is the target of the Grignard's attack, the result is a tertiary alcohol and a primary alcohol. The primary alcohol is always from the -O-R portion of the ester and the tertiary alcohol is the other R groups of the ester combined with the R group from the Grignard reagent.

====Synthesis from an Epoxide====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_epoxides_via_grignard.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an epoxide and Grignard reagent]]

We will discuss reactions with Epoxides later when we cover epoxides, but for now, we'll briefly discuss the synthesis of an alcohol from an epoxide. The nature of the reaction is different than with the carbonyls, as might be expected. The reaction of Grignard reagents with epoxides is regioselective. The Grignard reagent attacks at the least substituted side of the carbon-oxygen bonds, if there is one. In this case, one carbon has 2 hydrogens and the other has 1, so the R group attacks the carbon with 2 hydrogens, breaking the bond with oxygen which is then protonated by the acidic solution. leaving a secondary alcohol and a concatenated carbon chain. The R group can be alkyl or aryl.


====Organolithium Alternative====

As an alternative to Grignard reagents, organolithium reagents can be used as well. Organolithium reagents are slightly more reactive, but produce the same general results as Grignard reagents, including the synthesis from epoxides.

===Reduction===

====Synthesis from an Aldehyde====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_aldehyde_via_reduction.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an aldehyde by reduction.]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an aldehyde  by reduction.

====Synthesis from a Ketone====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_ketone_via_reduction.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an aldehyde by reduction]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from a ketone  by reduction.


====Synthesis from an Ester====

[[Image:Alcohols_from_ester_via_reduction.png|thumb|600px|center|Synthesis of alcohol from an ester by reduction]]

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from an ester  by reduction.  Esters can be hydrolysed to form an alcohol and a carboxylic acid.

====Synthesis from a Carboxylic Acid====

The image above shows the synthesis of an alcohol from a carboxylic acid reacted  by reduction.

==Naming alcohols==
Follow these rules to name alcohols the IUPAC way:

#find the longest carbon chain containing at least one OH group, this is the parent
##if there are multiple OH groups, look for the chain with the most of them, and the way to count as many carbons in that chain
##name as an alcohol, alkane diol, triol, etc.
#number the OH groups, giving each group the lowest number possible when different numbering possibilities exist
#treat all other groups as lower priority substituents (alcohol / hydroxy groups are the highest priority group for naming)

==Acidity==
&lt;!-- Review general topics of acidity and basicity [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Acids and bases|here]]. --&gt;

In an O-H bond, the O steals the H's electron due to its electronegativity, and O can carry a negative charge (R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;). This leads to '''deprotonation''' in which the nucleus of the H, a proton, leaves completely. This makes the -OH group (and alcohols) Bronsted acids.  Alcohols are weak acids, even weaker than water. Ethanol has a pKa of 15.9 compared to water's pKa of 15.7. The larger the alcohol molecule, the weaker an acid it is.

On the other hand, alcohols are also weakly basic.  This may seem to be contradictory--how can a substance be both an acid and a base?  However, substances exist that can be an acid or a base depending on the circumstances.  Such a compound is said to be amphoteric or amphiprotic.  As a Bronsted base, the oxygen atom in the -OH group can accept a proton (hydrogen ion.) This results in a positively-charged species known as an oxonium ion.  Oxonium ions have the general formula ROH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where R is any alkyl group.

==Alkoxides==

When O becomes deprotonated, the result is an '''alkoxide'''. Alkoxides are anions. The names of alkoxides are based on the original molecule. (Ethanol=ethoxide, butanol=butoxide, etc.)
Alkoxides are good nucleophiles due to the negative charge on the oxygen atom.

===Producing an alkoxide===

R-OH -&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

In this equation, R-O&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is the alkoxide produced and is the conjugate base of R-OH
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Alcohols can be converted into alkoxides by reaction with a strong base (must be stronger than OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) or reaction with metallic sodium or potassium. Alkoxides themselves are basic. The larger an alkoxide molecule is, the more basic it is.

=Reactions=

==Conversion of alcohols to haloalkanes==

Recall that haloalkanes can be converted to alcohols through nucleophilic substitution.

&lt;H2&gt;Conversion of a haloalkane to an alcohol&lt;/H2&gt;
R-X + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;rarr; R-OH + X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

This reaction proceeds because X (a halogen) is a good leaving group and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is a good nucleophile. OH, however, is a poor leaving group. To make the reverse reaction proceed, OH must become a good leaving group. This is done by protonating the OH, turning it into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a good leaving group. H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; must be present to do this. Therefore, the compounds that can react with alcohols to form haloalkanes are HBr, HCl, and HI. Just like the reverse reaction, this process can occur through S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 (backside attack) or S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 (carbocation intermediate) mechanisms.

|}

|}

As stated in the haloalkane chapter, the two mechanisms look similar but the mechanism affects the rate of reaction and the stereochemistry of the product.

==Oxidation of alcohols==

Oxidation in organic chemistry always involves either the addition of oxygen atoms (or other highly electronegative elements like sulfur or nitrogen) or the removal of hydrogen atoms. Whenever a molecule is oxidized, another molecule must be reduced. Therefore, these reactions require a compound that can be reduced. These compounds are usually inorganic. They are referred to as ''oxidizing reagents''.

With regards to alcohol, oxidizing reagents can be strong or weak. Weak reagants are able to oxidize a primary alcohol group into a aldehyde group and a secondary alcohol into a ketone.  Thus, the R-OH (alcohol) functional group becomes R=O (carbonyl) after a hydrogen atom is removed.  Strong reagents will further oxidize the aldehyde into a carboxylic acid (COOH). Tertiary alcohols cannot be oxidized.

An example of a strong oxidizing reagent is chromic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). An example of a weak oxidizing reagent is pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC) (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;NCrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl).

==Free-radical halogenation==
Free-radical halogenation is &quot;a way to do a substitution other than by nucleophilic substitution.&quot;

|}

H's come off as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; not H&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, making nucleophilic substitution impossible.

We must first remove a H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to perform the reaction.

Free radicals as a rule violate the octet rule and are highly reactive, reacting even with strong bonds.

(and radical produced continues reacting with surrounding molecules)
|}

The reaction continues happening in a chain mechanism called a '''free radical chain reaction.'''

==Free radical chain reaction==
This has three steps:

#'''Initiation step:''' this generates radicals
#'''Propagation step:''' this is where the bulk of the action lies. Chain carriers generate reaction products.
#'''Termination step:''' anything that consumes the free radicals.

Br + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br -&gt; BrCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Br

&lt;H2&gt;Note&lt;/H2&gt;

Fluorine gas is too reactive and does not undergo this sort of reaction as it explodes. Iodine doesn't work very well either as it is too unreactive. So the reaction works only for Cl and Br, the reaction with Cl running a bit faster than with Br.
|}

Running free radical chain reactions with Chlorine and Bromine yield their respective end products in different proportions, a quality that can be useful in the laboratory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Alkenes==

[[w:Alkenes|Alkenes]] are organic molecules that contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, which is referred to as '''unsaturation'''. Saturation is when all of the carbons have all single bonds. If the double bonds are just next to each other, they are called cummulated dienes. If there is only one C-C bond between two double bonds, it is called a conjugated diene. If more than one single bond intervenes it is an isolated diene.

[[Image:Pi-bonding.png]]

The double bonds in alkenes are higher in energy than single bonds and are more reactive. Molecules will favor single bonds over double or triple ones when given a chance. 

'''Bond dissociation energy''' is the energy needed to break a bond.

[[w:Ethene|Ethene]] is the smallest, simplest alkene. It is planar and the angle between its bonds is approximately 120&amp;deg;.

[[Image:Ethene-2D-flat.png|150px]]

The C-H bonds are stronger in ethene than in ethane because the &amp;pi; bond draws electron density away from from the carbon, which draws electron density away from the hydrogens. This makes ethene unreactive and gives the carbons sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; character, which is more s-like and lower in energy.

==IUPAC alkene nomenclature==

#find the longest chain of carbons containing both carbons of the double bond
#number this chain left to right and right to left and choose the method that gives the double bond the lowest numbers
#using the smallest of the two numbers identifying the double bond as prefix, followed by a hyphen without spaces, name the chain as for an alkane changing the -ane to -ene

Then follow the rest of the rules for naming halogenoalkanes

==Alkenols==
'''Alkenols''' are compounds containing both a '''double bond''' and an '''OH group.'''

To name, find the longest carbon chain that contains both the C=C and the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. The OH group gets the higher priority (lower number). Oxygen takes precedence over carbon.

The &quot;2&quot; refers to the double bond and can go at the beginning of the name or right before the &quot;en&quot;.

&lt;H2&gt;What is &quot;&amp;Delta;&quot;?&lt;/H2&gt;

'''&amp;Delta;''' is the capital Greek letter &quot;Delta&quot; and is used in science to indicate a change in something. It is used as a shorthand in organic chemistry and in this book to indicate a change in heating conditions, that is, the addition of heat.

1&amp;deg;, 2&amp;deg;, 3&amp;deg; all work for E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactions (remember that the methyl group doesnt have a second carbon for an elimination to function).

==E1 reactions==
Elimination reactions are one way to produce alkenes. Learn more about them [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes#Elimination_Reactions|here]].

==Elimination vs Substitution ?==
There are ways to predict if a reaction will follow an elimination or a substitution mechanism or pathway.


{| BORDER
|-
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elimination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Substitution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| High temperature (the biggest factor)
| Low temperature
|-
| Strong base
| Good nucleophile (bulkiness interferes with nucleophilicity)
|}

&lt;p&gt;Tertiary halides favor E1, S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1.


==Reactions of alkenes==
===Bromine===
Electrophilic addition reaction between Bromine and Ethene gas:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

|}

===Complete Combustion===
Like other hyrdrocarbons alkenes will combust in excess air or oxygen provided that there is sufficient activation energy for the combustion reaction. The following reaction is the complete combustion of ethene with oxygen:
{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
|}

===Hydrogen Bromide===
Electrophilic addition reaction between concentrated Hydrogen Bromide and Ethene gas:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br
|}

The general formula for the reaction of any alkene with HBr is:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
RCH=CHR' + HBr &amp;rarr; RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHR'Br
|}

For asymmetrical alkenes such as But-1-ene the following reaction is also feasible:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
RCH=CHR' + HBr &amp;rarr; RCHBr-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R'
|}

Where R and R' are alkyl groups e.g. CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Sulphuric Acid===
Electrophilic addition reaction between cold concentrated Sulphuric Acid and Ethene gas:
{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H
|}

Ethyl Hydrogensulphate is hydrolysed if warmed with water:

| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

|}

Overall reaction for the two steps:


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #F3F3FF; border: solid 1px #E7E7FF; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

&lt;H2&gt;Its reverse, an elimination&lt;/H2&gt;

CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;X  + base, &amp;Delta; &amp;rarr; CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Electrophilic additions are essentially the reverse of an E1 [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes#Elimination_Reactions|elimination reaction]], sometimes exactly the '''microscopic reverse'''.


{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;H2&gt;Microscopic reverse&lt;/H2&gt;

This means that the mechanism of the reaction follows each and every step of the related reaction in reverse order, without deviation.
Sometimes, a reaction can be reversed but using a different series of tiny steps. When that happens, it is NOT called a microscopic reverse.
|}

Addition reactions involve [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Carbocations|carbocations]]. This intermediate carbocation can rearrange.

Addition reactions follow [[Organic_Chemistry/Alkenes#Markovnikov's_Rule|Markovnikov's rule]]. (The higher priority substituent adds to the more highly substituted carbon of the carbon-carbon double bond).

* {{stage short|50%|Sep 15, 2007}} [[Spanish/Tenses]] is a grammar appendix which outlines all possible verb conjugations for regular Spanish verbs. Verbs are first divided by mood (indicative, subjunctive, imperative), then by aspect (simple, perfect, continuous, perfect continuous), and finally by tense (present, preterite, imperfect, conditional, future). This appendix can be used as a reference for any and all regular verb conjugations.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Regular ''-er'' verbs|Les verbes en -er}} ==

=== Formation ===
Most French verbs fall into the category of ''-er'' verbs. To conjugate, drop the ''-er'' to find the stem or root. Add endings to the root based on the subject and tense.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French Grammar - -er Verb Formation.ogg|columns=4|style=text-align: center;}}
|+ {{French/Word|jouer|IPA=/ʒwe/|audio=Fr-jouer.ogg|en=to play}}
|-
! Pronoun || Ending || Verb || Pronunciation
|-
| je || -e || jou'''e''' || {{audio|Fr-joue.ogg|/ʒu/}}
|-
| tu || -es || jou'''es''' || {{audio|Fr-joue.ogg|/ʒu/}}
|-
| il/elle || -e || jou'''e''' || {{audio|Fr-joue.ogg|/ʒu/}}
|-
| nous || -ons || jou'''ons''' || {{audio|/ʒwɔ̃/}}
|-
| vous || -ez || jou'''ez''' || {{audio|/ʒu.e/}}
|-
| ils/elles || -ent || jou'''ent''' || {{audio|Fr-joue.ogg|/ʒu/}}
|}

=== Pronunciation, elision and liaison ===
The ''-e'', ''-es'', and ''-ent'' endings all have the same silent pronunciation. The ''-er'' and ''-ez'' endings are pronounced {{audio|/e/|approx=ay}}, and the ''-ons'' ending is pronounced {{audio|/ɔ̃/|approx=oh}}.

In all conjugations, ''je'' changes to ''j'' ' when followed by a vowel or silent ''h'':
: {{French/Word|J'aime…|en=I like…}}
: {{French/Word|J'habite…|en=I live…}}

In all plural forms, the ''s'' at the end of each subject pronoun, normally unpronounced, becomes a ''z'' sound and the ''n'' of ''on'' becomes pronounced when followed by a vowel.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Direct object pronouns ''le'', ''la'', and ''les''}} ==

The direct object pronoun {{fr|le|IPA=/lə/|audio=Fr-le.ogg}}, meaning ''it'' or ''him'', replaces masculine singular direct objects:

: {{fr|Je donne le livre au prof.|en=I'm giving the book to the teacher.}}
: {{fr|Je le donne au prof.|en=I'm giving it to the teacher.}}

{{fr|La|IPA=/la/|audio=Fr-la.ogg}}, meaning ''it'' or ''her'', replaces feminine singular direct objects:
: {{fr|Je donne la calculatrice au prof.|en=I'm giving the calculator to the teacher.}}
: {{fr|Je la donne au prof.|en=I'm giving it to the teacher.}}

{{fr|Les|IPA=/le/|audio=Fr-les.ogg}}, meaning ''them'', replaces plural direct objects:
: {{fr|Je donne les livres au prof.|en=I'm giving the books to the teacher.}}
: {{fr|Je les donne au prof.|en=I'm giving them to the teacher.}}

''Le'' and ''la'' become ''l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' before a vowel:
: {{fr|Aimez-vous le concert ? Oui, je l'aime.|en=Do you like the concert? Yes, I like it.}}

''Le'', ''la'', and ''les'' can replace either people or things:
: {{fr|Aimez-vous le film ? Oui, je l'aime.|en=Do you like the film? Yes, I like it.}}
: {{fr|Aimez-vous l'acteur ? Oui, je l'aime.|en=Do you like the actor? Yes, I like him.}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Indirect object pronouns ''lui'' and ''leur''|supplementary-id=french-lui-and-leur}} ==
&lt;div id='french-lui-and-leur'&gt;
The indirect object  pronoun {{French/Word|lui|IPA=/lɥi/|audio=Fr-lui.ogg}} means ''to him'' or ''to her'':
: {{French/Word|Je lui donne le livre.|en=I'm giving the book to him/her.}}
: {{French/Word|Je lui donne un coup de main.|en=I'm giving a hand to him/her.}}

Likewise, the indirect object pronoun {{French/Word|leur|IPA=/lœʁ/|audio=Fr-leur.ogg}} means ''to them'':
: {{French/Word|Je leur donne le livre.|en=I'm giving the book to them.}}
: {{French/Word|Je leur donne un coup de main.|en=I'm giving a hand to them.}}

''Lui'' replaces ''à [''person'']'':
: {{French/Word|Je parle à Jean.|en=I'm speaking to Jean.}}
: {{French/Word|Je lui parle.|en=I'm speaking to him.}}

Likewise, ''leur'' replaces ''à [''people'']'':
: {{French/Word|Je parle à Jean et Marie.|en=I'm speaking to Jean and Marie.}}
: {{French/Word|Je leur parle.|en=I'm speaking to them.}}

''Lui'' and ''leur'' usually only refer to people; they will sometimes also be used in reference to things.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Conjugated verb + infinitive|supplementary-id=french-conjugated-verb-and-infinitive}} ==
&lt;div id='french-conjugated-verb-and-infinitive'&gt;
Like in English, some verbs can be followed by infinitives. Three ''-er'' verbs used in this manner are ''aimer'', ''adorer'', and ''détester'':

: {{French/Word|Nous aimons jouer aux cartes.|en=We like to play cards}}
: {{French/Word|Je déteste jouer au golf.|en=I hate playing golf.}}
: {{French/Word|Il adore jouer aux jeux vidéo.|en=He loves to play video games.}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To have fun|S'amuser|supplementary-id=french-s-amuser}} ==
&lt;div id='french-s-amuser'&gt;
The verb ''s'amuser'' means ''to have fun'' in English. It is a type of pronominal verb (a verb that includes a pronoun as part of it) called a reflexive verb, which means that the action of the verb is reflected back onto the subject. Literally translated, the verb means ''To amuse oneself.''

On the fabled Island of Knights and Knaves, we meet three people, A, B, and C, one of whom is a knight, one a knave, and one a spy.  The knight always tells the truth, the knave always lies, and the spy can
either lie or tell the truth.

A says: &quot;C is a knave.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
B says: &quot;A is a knight.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
C says: &quot;I am the spy.&quot;

''Who is the knight, who the knave, and who the spy?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">For Knights Knaves and spies we can split the problem into two. C is the spy or C is not the spy

'''Senario 1 C is the spy'''.
:C is a spy and is telling the truth.
:therefore A is lying so must be the Knave
:So B must be the knight. 

However B says that A is the knight, which is a lie. This is a contradiction since the knight neber lies so the spy cannot be telling the truth. 

'''Senario 2 C is not the spy'''

:C is not the spy
:Therfore C must be the Knave because they are telling lies
:This leaves two further possibilities A knight B spy or A spy B knight
The first possiblity is consistant. The second would isn't because B would be a knight who was lying.

:So A = knight
:B = spy
:C =knave

is the only consistant solution [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:08, 6 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Excellent, Theresa! Couldn't have said it better... [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Hope this is the place for question : in the consistant solution, the spy (B) is not lying anymore !</text>

We have three people one of whom is a knight, one a knave, and one a spy. 
The knight always tells the truth, the knave always lies, and the spy can 
either lie or tell the truth. The three persons are brought before a
judge who wants to identify the spy.

A says: &quot;I am not a spy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
B says: &quot;I am a spy.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Now C is in fact the spy. The judge asks him: &quot;Is B really a spy?&quot;

''Can C give an answer so that he doesn't convict himself as a spy?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">If C answers, &quot;No&quot;, then there is no contradiction in saying that A is the spy, B is the knave, and C is the knight. Therefore, it will not be possible to prove C is the spy.

If, however, C answers, &quot;Yes,&quot; C can be proved the spy:

If C is telling the truth, then B is the spy. Then A and C would have to both be the knight, since they both tell the truth. But only one can be the knight. So C must then be lying.

B cannot in any case be the knight, since he would be lying. Since C is lying, too, B is not the spy, and so B is the knave. Thus C herself cannot be the knave, but neither can she be the knight, since she is lying. Therefore, if C answers, &quot;Yes&quot;, C is the spy.

Am I right?

[[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 22:33, 7 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Perfect, Eric! Great explantation. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Almost.
Unfortunately, those are not the only two possible answers.
C knows that he/she is the spy.  The knight and knave do not necessarily know which of the others is.  Therefore, C may answer &quot;I don't know,&quot; and the judge will be unsure whether A or C is the spy.

Another possibility would be A: Knight, B: Spy, C: Knave. [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 13:59, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)

This is incorrect, as is the given answer to this logic problem.

The statement above says &quot;Then A and C would have to both be the knight, since they both tell the truth.&quot; You forgot that the spy can tell the truth or lie. Look at it this way:


A: I am not the spy.

B: I am the spy.

C: I am not the spy.


We know that B is the knave, because the knave will always say he is the spy (he must lie). We cannot distinguish A from C, since a truth-telling knight, in this instance, looks exactly like a lying spy.


Now, let's try the other:

A: I am not the spy.

B: I am the spy.

C: I am the spy.


In this instance, we know that A is the knight, since the knight must always say he is not the spy (he must tell the truth), We cannot distinguish B from C, since a lying knave, in this instance, looks exactly like a truth-telling spy.

Eric B.

: I think the puzzle intends C to answer either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, not &quot;I am the spy&quot; or &quot;I am not the spy&quot;.  In this case, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is a statement of whether or not B is the spy, not C, and the given solution remains correct.  If C can say whatever he wants, he could say something like &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;Go jump in the lake&quot; or just remain silent and whether or not he was the spy would be trivially undecidable...  Perhaps the puzzle could be revised to reflect this?

----

Annie, Betty, Carrie, Darla, and Eve recently found out that all of their 
birthdays were on the same day, though they are different ages. On their 
mutual birthday, they were jabbering away, flapping their gums about their 
recent discovery. And, lucky me, I was there. Some of the things that I 
overheard were... 

* Darla said to Betty: &quot;I'm nine years older than Eve.&quot;
* Eve said to Betty: &quot;I'm seven years older than Annie.&quot;
* Annie said to Betty: &quot;Your age is exactly 70% greater than mine.&quot; 
* Betty said to Carrie: &quot;Eve is younger than you.&quot;
* Carrie said to Darla: &quot;The difference between our ages is six years.&quot;
* Carrie said to Annie: &quot;I'm ten years older than you.&quot;
* Carrie said to Annie: &quot;Betty is younger than Darla.&quot;
* Betty said to Carrie: &quot;The difference between your age and Darla's is the same as the difference between Darla's and Eve's.&quot;

Since I knew these people -- and how old they were, I knew that they were not 
telling the whole truth. After thinking about it, I realized that when one of 
them spoke to somebody older than herself, everything she said was true, 
but when speaking to somebody younger, everything she said was false. 

''How old is each person?''

''Carrie said to Annie: &quot;I'm ten years older than you.&quot;''

''I realized that when one of them spoke to somebody older than themselves, everything they said was true, but when speaking to somebody younger, everything they said was false. ''

Two possibilities: Carrie is older (speaking to younger) OR Carrie is younger (speaking to older).

If Carrie is older and speaking to someone younger, then ''everything'' she said is false. Therefore, Carrrie cannot be older.
If Carrie is younger and speaking to someone older, then everything she said is true. Therefore, she is older. But we originally assumed that she was younger. 
Reductio ad absurdum. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 00:54, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:The second argument is nice: If Carrie would be younger then she would be telling the truth (i.e. implying that she is 10 years older which leads to a contradiction). This is the kind of reasoning you'll need! The first argument is not valid, I think: If Carrie is older, then the sentence &quot;I'm ten years older than you.&quot; must be false. This does NOT mean that Carrie is younger, it could be that Carrie is 5 years or 20 years older! (I'm not sure if I said this in the problem, but you can assume that all persons have a different age). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:: Ah... The sentence &quot;when speaking to somebody younger, '''everything''' they said was false&quot; might have been misleading.

:::I see. I don't know though how to formulate it in a better way. If you have an idea, please feel free to edit it [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

::::Of course, it is fine now that it has been clarified. --[[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 00:49, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)

I think it needs to be clarified that ONLY one person lies, and ONLY when they are talking to someone younger. --[[User:Hitsthings|Hitsthings]] ([[User talk:Hitsthings|talk]]) 06:25, 9 April 2008 (UTC)</text>

----

You are in a prison and your execution is planned for today. However,
you are given one last chance to get out of this situation. You are
brought into a room that has two exits and in front of each of them stands
a guard. One exit leads out of the prison into freedom, while the other
one brings you into the room where the execution takes place. Furthermore,
one of the guards is always lying, while the other one is always telling
the truth (but, of course, you don't know who of the guards is in front
of which door). You are allowed to ask only one question.

''What question can you ask in order to find out the way to your freedom?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The question you ask is &quot;Which door would the other guard say leads to freedom?&quot;

Whatever he says, take the other door.

* If the guard you asks lies, he will lie about what the other guard would say (which would be the truth).
** So he will tell you the wrong door.
* If the guard you asks tells the truth, he will repeat exactly what the other guard will say (which would be a lie).
** So he will also tell you the wrong door.

:Excellent, Nanobug. Your question does makes sure that we definitely will get a lie, because it involves both guards.[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

== Alternate question ==

Assuming that the guards are restricted to answering 'left' or 'right', the following would alos be a solution:

&quot;If I asked you which door leads to freedom, how would you answer?&quot;

The Truth telling guard would answer truthfully and you know the correct door.
The Lie telling Guard would normally have told a lie, but he must lie about his lie, therefore also revealing the correct door.

This works due to the simple principle that a double positive yeilds a positive, while a double negative yeilds a positive.</text>

----

3 men are buried in the sand all facing the same way with only their heads above ground. Each man has a hat placed on his head which is either red or blue, but they can't see it. The men know that their hats were selected from a bag containing 3 red hats, and 2 blue hats. The man at the back (who can see the hats of the two men in front of him) is asked what hat he is wearing. He answers: &quot;I don't know&quot;. The middle (who can see the hat of the man in front of him) man is asked what hat he is wearing. He also replies: &quot;I don't know&quot;. Finally, the man at the front is asked what hat he is wearing. He answers: &quot;I am wearing a red hat&quot;. 

''How did he know?''

----

Imagine a rubber band which is infinitely thin and fixed on one end onto a plane with a nail. In its relaxed state it measures exactly 6cm and can be stretched to exactly 8cm.

''Your task is to construct a right-angled triangle in the plane using only the rubber band, your absolutely precise hands and a sharp pencil.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">One point (A) of the triangle will be the point where the band is fixed to the plane.
Get the next point (B) by folding the relaxed band in half (so that it's 3cm long) and
marking the endpoint with the pencil. The third point is more tricky. First, stretch out
the band completely, hold it down with your finger at B and then draw a half circle (which
will have radius 5) to the right. Also, mark the point E on this half circle: E is the point
where the second half of the band goes over A (see below). Now repeat the process on the 
other side: First we measure out the distance 3cm by folding the relaxed band. We get the 
point D (which lies on the straight line that's going through AE!). Again, we draw the half 
circle around D with the stretched (8cm) band; but now to the left. The point above A where 
the two half circles cross is our third triangle point (C). The construction with the two 
5cm-radius half circles around B and D guarantees that AC will be in a right angle to AB, 
thus making ABC into a right-angled triangle (the side lengths will be AB=3cm, AC=4cm, BC=5cm 
which satisfies Pythagoras' theorem). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

You can use the number 4 twice (but no other numbers) and as many mathematical operators as you wish to write
an expression that is equal to 64.

----

A salesman is at the door of a family house and tries to convince the mother to buy some of his
products. She says: &quot;Well, I don't really need the products, but if you can guess how old my three
daughters are I will do you a favor and buy one of them.&quot; The salesman asks the woman for a
little help and she tells him: &quot;The product of their ages is 36.&quot; As the salesman is
not able to figure out the ages, she gives him another clue: &quot;The sum of their ages is same as the 
number of my house (13).&quot; The salesman calculates for a little while but then says: &quot;I'm sorry, Miss,
but I still can't figure out their ages.&quot; The mother agrees to give him a final hint: &quot;My eldest daughter 
plays piano.&quot; After that hint the salesman was able to tell the mother her daughters ages and sell one
of his items.

''How did he figure that out?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clue 1 - product of ages is 36: Ages must be one of
* 36, 1, 1 (although this is pretty unlikely)
* 18, 2, 1
* 12, 3, 1
* 9,  4, 1
* 9,  2, 2
* 6,  3, 2
* 4,  3, 3

Am I missing any?

Clue 2 - sum of ages is same as number of my house
* 36 + 1 + 1 = 38
* 18 + 2 + 1 = 21
* 12 + 3 + 1 = 16

* 9  + 4 + 1 = 14
* 9  + 2 + 2 = 13
* 6  + 3 + 2 = 11
* 4  + 3 + 3 = 10

Since the salesman knows the number of the house, he should be able to work it out. If two of the sums were the same, and one of them had the largest two ages the same, then the third clue (''My eldest daughter plays piano'') would confirm that it was the other one.

So what is wrong with my math? I have missed something otherwise I would need clue 3. [[User:Nanobug|Nanobug]] 20:54, 10 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:In the paragraph &quot;since the salesman...&quot; you have analyzed the situation perfectly! You are indeed missing one combination (hint: it adds up to 13) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

----

The missing combination is 1, 6, 6. Combining with Nanobug's work above, the complete solution is:

Clue 1: Product is 36.

Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36. Find all combinations with product 36:

:1, 1, 36
:1, 2, 18
:1, 3, 12
:1, 4, 9
:1, 6, 6
:2, 2, 9
:2, 3, 6
:3, 3, 4

Clue 2: Sum is house number.

Sums are:

:1 + 1 + 36 = 38
:1 + 2 + 18 = 21
:1 + 3 + 12 = 16
:1 + 4 + 9 = 14
:1 + 6 + 6 = 13
:2 + 2 + 9 = 13
:2 + 3 + 6 = 11
:3 + 3 + 4 = 10

Clue 3: Eldest plays piano.

Presumably, this means there is no tie for oldest age. (Since the ages are only given to the year, it is possible for two to have the same age but one be elder than the other. Interpeted this way the clue tells us nothing. But the salesman derived pertinant information from it, so we must also.)

Now the salesman knows the housenumber (though we don't). Thus if the house number is other than 13, the salesman would have been able to figure out the answer after clue 2. So the number is 13. (I guess we know it after all :-). By clue three we eliminate 1, 6, 6. So the ages of the daughters are

:2, 2, and 9

----

You are handed 12 metal coins which look alike. However, one of them
is fake and weighs either more or less than each of the other 11 coins (which all have identical weight). To measure or compare weights you have only a pan balance that tips down to the side with the greater weight or stays in balance if both pans hold equal weights.

''With how many weightings can you find the fake coin and also determine if its weight is more or less than the weight of the other coins? How do you do it?''

      <text xml:space="preserve">For the 12 coins I would split them into 3 groups of four \and call them group A, B, and C
Then I would perform 3 weighings. A-B A-C B-C. The two groups that do not contain the fake will balance so the fake is in the other one. Also since I know that the other two groups are genuine i can easilly tell if the fake is lighter or heavier by seeing which way the balancve went when the fake group was weighed against one of the other two.

I now have four coins, and know if the fake is heavier or lighter . So I split in half and weigh then split in half and weigh again. 

This gives 5 weighings in total. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:19, 6 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Good, this is a valid solution! If you want you can try and improve it - the optimum is just 3 weighings.[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]
::OK I'm thinking out loud here so let's see what I xcome up with:

Split into three groups ABC as before. WEIGH A-B they will either balance or not.


'''scenario 1 A and B balance'''

*The fake is therefore in C.
*label the coins s,t,u,v
*weigh s,t, against u,v. and note which side goes down
*Now weight s,u, against t,v. 
*from this you can work out the fake.
*Total 3 weighings
[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]


'''scenario 2 A and B  do not balance'''
*Note which group A or B was heavier.
*Split A into two subgroups w,x each with two coins in Split B into y, z.
*rearrange As wy, xz and reweigh. note which side was heavier.
*From this you can work out wich pair of coins contains the fake and if the fake is heavier or lighter.
*Let's say x comes out as heavier than the other three groups, weigh the two coins of x against one another to find the fake
*Total 3 weighings

(Man I'm proud of myself. That one was tricky)[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:41, 7 Oct 2003 (UTC)

: You're on the right way... However, there are some little issues still there. For scenario 1 you could for example observe that s,t is heavier than u,v and that s,u is heavier than t,v. But there are still two possibilities left: s could be fake and heavier OR v could be fake and lighter. Similarly, in the second weighing of scenario 2 you will for instance not know whether a coin of w is fake and heavier or a coin of z is fake and lighte. Keep working on it, you're really close! [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Lord Emsworth:
Now restaing &quot;A and B do not Balance&quot;

* Note whether A is heavier or B is heavier.
* The Heavy coins will be referred to as Hi while the light coins will be referred to as Lt. The coins themselves will become H1, H2, H3, or H4, and also L1, L2, L3, and L4.
* Obviously, group C has only normal coins: the abnormality is in Hi or Lt. (C is also counted as C1, C2, C3, and C4)
* Take H1 and put it in Lt, and take L1 and put it in C, creating [1 group: three Lt + one Hi] and [1 group: three C + 1 Lt]. 
* NOTE: H1 cannot be lighter than C &amp; L1 cannot be heavier than C
:# IF [three Lt + one Hi] = [three C + 1 Lt] THEN [H2 or H3 or H4] is counterfit and heavier. ''C is assumed normal. If the two sides are equal, then both sides are normal. This only leaves H2, H3, and H4.''
:# IF [three Lt + one Hi] &lt; [three C + 1 Lt] THEN [L2 or L3 or L4] is counterfit and lighter. ''The side with H1 is lighter, so H1 cannot be heavy. Therefore, H1 is normal. The side with L1 is heavier, so L1 cannot be light. Therefore L1 is normal. C is assumed normal. This only leaves L2, L3, or L4 as light and counterfit.
:# IF [three Lt + one Hi] &gt; [three C + 1 Lt] THEN L1 is counterfit and lighter or H1 is counterfit and heavier. ''Since the Cs are defined as normal but are on the lighter side, two possibilities exist: one coin with the C's is light or one coin with the Lt's is heavy. Thus, either H1 is heavy and counterfit or L1 is light and counterfit.''
* Next Step: 
:# [H2 or H3 or H4] is heavier: Compare H3 and H4. If they are equal, then H2 is counterfit and heavy. If H3 is heavier than H4, H3 is counterfit and heavy. If H4 is heavier than H3, H4 is counterfit and heavy.
:# [L2 or L3 or L4] is lighter: Compare L3 and L4. If they are equal, then L2 is counterfit and light. If L3 is lighter than L4, L3 is counterfit and light. If L4 is lighter than L3, L4 is counterfit and light.
:# H1 is counterfit and heavy or L1 is counterfit and light: Compare L1 and C. If L1 is equal to C, then H1 is counterfit and heavy. If L1 is lighter than C, then L1 is counterfit and light.
QED(Is this the right acronym?) [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 00:26, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:very good explanation Lord Elmsworth! This solves the case where A and B are not in balance. For A and B in balance we will need a similar trick to find the fake coin. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

'''using scenario 1 A and B balance'''
*The fake is therefore in C.
*label the coins in pile C {S,T,U,V} and label all the other coins N (for normal weight)
*weigh S vs T
*If they weigh the same then S and T can be marked/changed to N
*If they don't weigh the same then U and V can be marked/changed to N
* This should leave you with two unknowns (either {S,T} or (U,V))
*Then weigh either of the two unknowns against one of the N coin
*If the scale balances the other is the fake if not the one being weighed is the fake
(Note: if the scale balances we know which is the fake but we do not know if it was lighter or heavier, if the scale tips in either direction the weight difference will be known)
 *Total 3 weighings</text>

You want to use a balance to weigh items that have an integral weight between 1 ounce and 40 ounces
(integral means that no fractions such as 1.5 ounces are allowed).

''What is the fewest number of weights you need?''

You can see the weights as a kind of &quot;physical bits&quot;, because it can be either in the collection or not. 

With n bits you can represent no more than &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; different states (including 0), which is proved trivially. Therefore, for a given 40 states, the lower bound for the number of weights is 6.

At first, we select 5 weights to represent the numbers 1 to 31:

:1 2 4 8 16

For the sixth weight, we can choose any weight &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with  &lt;math&gt;9\le a\le 32 &lt;/math&gt;

[[User:doopdoop|doopdoop]]

:The solution is OK, however, it can be done with less weights. (hint: you can also place weights on the side of the object you want to weigh - so one weight can carry more information than just a bit:). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

You have an 8 liter bucket full of milk and two empty buckets, one with a 5 liter volume and the other
with a 3 liter volume.  You have no means of measurement other than the buckets themselves, which are not calibrated.

''How can you evenly distribute the milk into two portions of precisely 4 liters?''

A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. There is a boat that can fit himself plus either the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage. If the wolf and the goat are alone on one shore, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and the cabbage are alone on the shore, the goat will eat the cabbage.

''How can the farmer bring the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river?''

There are six persons on the shore: Three fathers and each of them has a son. The sons are afraid to be nearby a different father (or fathers) if their own father is not there (both at the boat and the either of shores). There is a boat that can hold a maximum of two persons (you can assume that the sons are able to row the boat).

''How can the six people get across the river?''

ASSUME that when someone (&quot;X&quot;) returns to the origin and is about to make another journey to the final destination, X stays in his boat, but if ''two other people'' are to use the boat to reach the final destination, X gets off to make room. 
-- [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 00:43, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:That looks pretty good. I think, In step 4 there is a little problem: you return with F3 to the original shore where there are S2 and S3 which means that S2 will be frightened because F3 is there but not his own father. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]
:: I actually thought about that. Now my statement &quot;ASSUME...&quot; says that if a person X returns to the origin and in the immediate next trip is to go back to the final destination, then X does not get off at the origin. Step 4:F3 returns but stays in the boat. On Step5:F3 and S3 go across. F3 was in the boat and S2 was on shore! The instructions say &quot;The sons are afraid to be either on the shore or in the boat whith one or two of the other fathers if their own father is not there.&quot; There is no requirement that a son on shore will be afraid of someone closeby in the boat.[[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 13:16, 11 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:::I've reformulated the problem a bit. Can you please have a look and check that it now rules out the case you have after step 4. Thanks. There is a solution where you don't have to do the &quot;staying in the boat and therefore technically not on the shore&quot; thing [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

Well...you didn't say the kids on the far side would stay put:

Two kids go across, one rows back.  Two kids go across, one rows back.  He and his pop row across, scare away two kids - but they're already across the river.  Pop rows back.  Two other dads row across, scare away the kid (might as well be fair).  One rows back, last two farmers go across - there, no one left on the far side of the river!

---

Ok, here's my reasoning - I'm not sure this thing has a solution.  I'm stating the problem with Aa, Bb, and Cc being Farmers with sons.

Step 1:  You can't leave anyone on the far side of the river except a kid.  (If you try to leave a farmer on the far side, kids will run off).  So we have:
 A *  a
 Bb   
 Cc    

Step 2:  We can't send across any adults except A - otherwise a runs off.  If we send A with anyone else, a kid runs off.  Sending only A is dumb - that takes us back to the beginning.  So, we can't send anyone except kids, e.g, b and c.
 A   *a
 B    b
 C    c

Which can only have one real way to go forward:
 Aa*   
 B    b
 C    c

Step 3:  We can't send A, because that will scare away kids (either a left on this side, or b or c on the far side).  Sending a only takes us back a step, so we have to send B.  If we send B, we have to send C, otherwise, c runs away.
 Aa   
     *Bb
      Cc

Now, who is coming back?  We can't send the kids - A will scare them away.  We can't send only 1 adult - his kid will run away.  Sending both adults is dumb - that just takes us back a step.  So, we send a pair back:
 Aa
 Bb*
      Cc


Step 4:  Who can we send over now?  We can't send unescorted kids - C will scare them away.  Sending a pair back (Aa) just takes us back a step.  We can't send only one adult - his kid will run.  Send both adults.
 a     *A
 b      B
        Cc

Who can we send back?  One adult will scare away a or b.  Sending back A and B takes us back a step...send c.
 a    A
 b    B
 c*   C

Step 5:  Awww, crap - it's got a solution - you just move kids around now!

----

A man is stranded on an island covered in forest. One day, when the wind is blowing from the west, lightning strikes the west end of the island and sets fire to the forest. The fire is very violent, burns everything in its path, and without intervention the fire will burn the whole island, killing the man in the process. There are cliffs around the island, so he cannot get back on if he jumps into the ocean.

''How can the man survive? (The fire, at least.) There are no buckets or any other means to douse the fire with water or sand to put it out.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Etothex, 

nice puzzle! My first guess would be that he &quot;swims around&quot; the fire (swimming out from the east shore and returning
on the west shore once the forest has already been burnt there) but maybe that solution is too trivial...
[[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Oops, copied the problem wrong. Try again. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 08:33, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Here's another attempt: He sets a fire at about 1/4 from the east end and waits in the center of the island.
When the &quot;eastern&quot; fire (which moves to the east since the wind is coming from west) is burnt out, the &quot;western&quot;
fire caused by the lighting should be only 1/4 from the west end (and not endangering the man). Then the
man can walk to the east end and be safe from the &quot;western&quot; fire which will stop 1/4 from the east coast
because there is nothing left to burn. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Yep, that's it. Now I've got to find more. :) [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 09:11, 5 Oct 2003 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">9376 - [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]] with a little help of the computer ;). I wonder: is there a trick to do this by hand?

Well, you certainly don't have to try all 9000 possibilities.
Hint: 9376 = 9000 + 376. Also (x + y)&amp;sup2; = x(x + 2y) + y&amp;sup2;.  Incidentally numbers of this type fall into a rather regular pattern which will require no guess-and-check at all. But you'd probably have to already have some of them to see the pattern. [[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 04:23, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)

I don't think you can do this rigourously and algebraically, it involves finding a solution to &lt;math&gt;a=(a^2/10^4 - \lfloor a^2/10^4\rfloor )10^4&lt;/math&gt; for a &amp;isin; [1000,9999] [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:27, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Thinking a bit more about the problem, I am now pretty sure that it can be solved analytically
and by hand:

We can start by writing the equation given by Dysposia:

&lt;math&gt;a=a^2 - \lfloor a^2/10^4 \rfloor 10^4&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt;a^2-a=\lfloor a^2/10^4\rfloor 10^4&lt;/math&gt;

this implies:

&lt;math&gt;a(a-1) \equiv 0 (mod 10^4)&lt;/math&gt;

or

&lt;math&gt;a(a-1) = k 10^4 (for k \in Z)&lt;/math&gt;

We can decompose &lt;math&gt;10^4 = 2^4 * 5^4 &lt;/math&gt;. Also, it is relatively easy to see that either
''a'' must provide all the 2's and ''a-1'' all the 5's or vice versa (because it can't be that 
both ''a'' and ''a-1'' are divisible by 2, or that both ''a'' and ''a-1'' are divisible by 5).

Case 1:&lt;br&gt;
If ''a'' contained all the 5's then it must be divisible by 625. We now want that:

&lt;math&gt; a-1 \equiv 0 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt; a \equiv 1 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt;

It turns out that ''a=625'' has &lt;math&gt; a \equiv 1 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt; (625 = 39*16+1). Unfortunately ''a''
is too small. The other possible multiples of 625 (2*625, 3*625,...,15*625) then give (by laws for 
modulo operations) &lt;math&gt; a \equiv 2,3,...,15 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt; none of which satisfies &lt;math&gt; a \equiv 1 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt;.
So this case leads to a dead end

Case 2:&lt;br&gt;
If ''a'' contained all the 2's then ''a-1'' must be divisible by 625. We now want that:

&lt;math&gt; a \equiv 0 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to:

&lt;math&gt; a-1 \equiv 15 (mod 16)&lt;/math&gt;

Now if we run through all the multiples of 625 we find a suitable one (and only this one): ''a-1=15*625=9375''
which means that our desired number is ''a=9376''. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

: Kudos! A nice solution; I would never have seen it :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 08:24, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)

: Wow. I am impressed. Broadening the scope of discussion, I have been thinking about numbers like these for some months now (though sporadically). In base 10, the sequence is infinite:

:1
:5
:6
:25
:76
:376
:625
:9376
:90625
:890625
:109376
:2890625
:7109376
:12890625
:87109376
:212890625
:787109376
:1787109376
:8212890625
:and so on

:Note that there are two sequences, one with numbers ending in 5 and the other with numbers ending in 6. The occurence of 1 is a singularity. (I first proved this so I could justify not putting it into my program to find these :-). The 5, 25, 625, 90635... sequence and the 6, 76, 376, 9376... sequence fall into simple patterns that I did not notice until I had proved what they were. The patterns also generalize to bases 4x+2, x in Z and &gt; 0.

:I post all this at the risk of having you prove everything I've asserted within an hour and a lot faster than I did. :) But, hey, it might be worthwhile to compare different proofs. [[User:Eric119|Eric119]] 20:01, 12 Oct 2003 (UTC)</text>

Does the middle man only see the front man's hat? (I recollect a puzzle where three men, one blindfolded and two with sight, are taken into a room and given hats. In that one, the two with sight can see each other's as well as the blindfolded person's hat. Then again, this is probably a different puzzle.)

----
Let us assume that you are participating on the show &quot;Let´s make a deal&quot;. Monty Hall offers you a choice of three doors. Monty tells you, and you know, that you can trust Monty, that there is one big prize (such as a sports car) behind one of the doors and goats behind the others. He tells you that after you choose a door, he will open a different door than you chose, which contains a goat.

After you have chosen one door, he opens one of the two other doors, which as promised, contains a goat. Now he gives you the chance to switch or stay at your initial choice. You will then get what is behind that door.

You cannot hear the goats from behind the doors, or in any way know which door has the prize.

''Does it matter whether you switch or stay?''

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''-ger'' verbs}} ==

''-ger'' verbs are regular ''-er'' verbs that are also stem changing. The most common ''-ger'' verb is ''manger.''

For ''manger'' and all other regular ''-ger'' verbs, the stem change is the addition of an ''e'' after the ''g''. This only applies in the ''nous'' form. In this case, the change is made to preserve the soft ''g'' pronunciation rather than the hard ''g'' that would be present if the ''e'' were not included.

=== Formation ===
{| class=wikitable

|}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|The partitive article}} ==

The partitive article ''de'' indicates, among other things, the word ''some''. As learned earlier, ''de'' and ''le'' contract (combine) into ''du'', as ''de'' and ''les'' contract into ''des''. Also, instead of ''du'' or ''de la'', ''de l''' is used in front of vowels.

When speaking about food, the partitive article is used at some times while the definite article (''le'', ''la'', ''les'') is used at other times, and the indefinite article (''un'', ''une'') in yet another set of situations. In general ''de'' refers to a ''part'' of food (a ''piece'' of pie) whereas the definite article (''le'') refers to a food in general (''I like pie (in general)''). The indefinite article refers to an ''entire unit'' of a food (''I would like a ('''whole''') pie'').

When speaking about preferences, use the definite article:

{| {{French/Translations table}}
| J'aime ''la'' glace. ||  || I like ice cream.
|-
| Nous préférons le steak. ||  || We prefer steak.
|-
| Vous aimez les frites. ||  || You like French fries.
|}

When speaking about eating or drinking an item, there are specific situations for the use of each article.

{| {{French/Translations table}}
! colspan=6 | Definite article {{French/Section|(specific/whole items)}}
|-
| J'ai mangé ''la'' tarte. ||  || I ate the (whole) pie.
|-
! colspan=6 | Indefinite article {{French/Section|(known quantity)}}
|-
| J'ai mangé ''une'' tarte. ||  || I ate a pie.
|-
! colspan=6 | Partitive article {{French/Section|(unknown quantity)}}
|-
| J'ai mangé ''de la'' tarte. ||  || I ate some pie.
|}

In the negative construction, certain rules apply. ''Un'' or ''une'' changes to ''de'' in a negative construction, meaning, in this context, ''any''. Similarly, ''du'', ''de la'', or ''des'' change to ''de'' in negative constructions.

{| {{French/Translations table}}
| Nous avons mangé ''une'' tarte. ||  || We ate a pie.
|-
| Nous n'avons pas mangé ''de'' tarte. ||  || We did not eat a pie.&lt;br /&gt;We did not eat any pie.
|-
| Nous avons mangé ''de la'' tarte. ||  || We ate some pie.
|-
| Nous n'avons pas mangé de tarte. ||  || We did not eat some pie.&lt;br /&gt;We did not eat any pie.
|}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Some of it|En}} ==

To say ''some of it'' without specifying the exact object, the pronoun ''en'' can be used. Additionally, ''en'' can mean ''of it'' when ''it'' is not specified. For instance, instead of saying ''J'ai besoin d'argent'', if the idea of money has already been raised, it can be stated as ''J'en ai besoin.'' This is because ''en'' replaces ''du'', ''de la'' or ''des'' when the noun is not specifically mentioned in the sentence.

Like with ''me'', ''te'' and other pronouns, ''en'' (meaning ''some'') comes before the verb. 

{| {{French/Translations table}}
| Tu joues du piano? Non, je n'en joue pas. ||  || Do you play piano? No, I don't play it.
|-
| Vous prenez du poisson? Oui, j'en prends. ||  || Are you having fish? Yes, I'm having some.
|-
| Vous avez commandé de l'eau? Oui, nous en avons commandé. ||  || Did you order some water? Yes, we ordered some.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To have|Avoir}} ==

''Avoir'', meaning ''to have'', is conjugated irregularly.

=== Formation ===
{| class=wikitable
!'''avoir {{fr/IPA|/a.vwaʁ/ (''ah-vwahr'')|audio=Fr-avoir.ogg}} !! to have'''
|-
|j'ai {{fr/IPA|/e/ (''ay'')}} || I have
|-
|tu as {{fr/IPA|/a/ (''ah'')}} || you have
|-
|il a {{fr/IPA|/a/ (''ah'')}} || he has
|-
|nous avons {{fr/IPA|/a.vɔ̃/ (''ah-voh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} || we have
|-
|vous avez {{fr/IPA|/a.ve/ (''ah-vay'')}} || you have
|-
|ils ont {{fr/IPA|/ɔ̃/ (''oh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')}} || they have
|-
|eu {{fr/IPA|/y/}} || had
|}

Remember to ''liaison'' between &quot;nous avons&quot;, &quot;vous avez&quot;, and &quot;ils ont/elles ont&quot;.

=== Examples ===

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French Verb - Examples with avoir.ogg}}
| J'ai deux stylos. ||  || I have two pens.
|-
| Tu as trois frères. ||  || You have three brothers.
|-
| Il a une idée. ||  || He has an idea.
|}

=== Expressing age ===
''Avoir'' is used to express age.

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Expressing age.ogg}}
| Tu as quel âge ? ||  || How old are you? || lit: You have what age?
|-
| J'ai trente ans. ||  || I'm thirty (years old) || lit: I have thirty years.
|}

===Interrogatives===
The above uses avoir ''affirmatively''. You can also use it ''interrogatively''. A small complication arises,
in that without some help, the result does not sound very good. The use of an ''euphonic'' (pleasing to the ear) is
used with vowels before the pronoun. Thus, the letter ''-t-'' is placed between the verb and the pronoun:

Ai-je ? (Have I ?)&lt;br /&gt;
As-tu ? (Have you ?) informal (hast thou)&lt;br /&gt;
A-t-il ? (Has he ?)&lt;br /&gt;
A-t-elle ? (Has she ?)&lt;br /&gt;
Avons nous ? (Have we ?)&lt;br /&gt;
Avez vous ? (Have you ?) formal&lt;br /&gt;
Ont ils ? (Have they ?) masculine&lt;br /&gt;
Ont elles ? (Have they ?) feminine&lt;br /&gt;

The use of ''liaison'' fullfils the euphonic for &quot;ont&quot;.

Examples:

A-t-il la farine ? Oui, Monsieur, il a la farine.&lt;br /&gt;
Avons nous la viande ? Oui, Monsieur, nous avons la viande et le pain.&lt;br /&gt;
Avez vous la table ? Oui, Madame, j'ai la table.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Possession and association}} ==
The preposition {{French/Word|de|IPA=/də/ (''duh'')|audio=Fr-de.ogg}} is used to express possession or association:
: {{French/Word|le frère de Michel|en=the brother of Michel}}

''De'' can also be translated as '''s'':
: {{French/Word|le frère de Michel|en=Michel's brother}}
: {{French/Word|les Œuvres de Fermat|en=Fermat’s Works}}

Recall that {{French/Word|du|IPA=/dy/|approx=dew|audio=Fr-du.ogg}} replaces ''de le'', and {{French/Word|des|IPA=/dɛ/|approx=deh|audio=Fr-des.ogg}} replaces ''de les''.

=== Usage ===
Possessive adjective are used to express possession of an object.

: {{French/Word|C'est mon livre.|en=It's my book.}}

In English the possessive adjective agrees with the subject (''his sister'', ''her brother''). But in French, possessive adjectives act like all other adjectives: they must agree with the noun they modify.

{| {{French/Table|audio=French/Grammar/Possesive adjective usage.ogg|columns=4}}
! colspan=2 | Masculine noun&lt;br /&gt;le frère
! colspan=2 | Feminine noun&lt;br /&gt;la sœur
|-
| le frère de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's brother}} || '''son''' frère&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his brother}}
| la sœur de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's sister}} || '''sa''' sœur&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his sister}}
|-
| les frères de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's brothers}} || '''ses''' frères&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his brothers}}
| les sœurs de Marc&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marc's sisters}} || '''ses''' sœurs&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|his sisters}}
|-
| le frère de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's brother}} || '''son''' frère&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her brother}}
| la sœur de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's sister}} || '''sa''' sœur&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her sister}}
|-
| les frères de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's brothers}} || '''ses''' frères&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her brothers}}
| les sœurs de Marie&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|Marie's sisters}} || '''ses''' sœurs&lt;br /&gt;{{French/Section|her sisters}}
|}

Whether ''son'', ''sa'' and ''ses'' translate to ''his'' or ''her'' is indicated by context:
: {{French/Word|Oui, elle a son livre.|en=Yes, she has her book.}}

''Notre'', ''votre'', and ''leur'' modify singular nouns, regardless of gender; ''nos'', ''vos'', and ''leurs'' modify plural nouns:
: ''l'appartement'' {{French/Section|(m)}}: {{French/Word|C'est notre appartement.|en=It's our apartment.}}
: ''la maison'': {{French/Word|C'est notre maison.|en=It's our house.}}

=== Liaison and adjective changes ===

Liaison occurs when ''mon'', ''ton'', and ''son'' are followed by a vowel.

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Liaison with mon, ton, and son.ogg}}
| Il est mon&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ami. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || He is my friend.
|-
| Il est ton&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ami. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || He is your friend.
|-
| Il est son&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;ami. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || He is his/her friend.
|}

Liaison also occurs with all plural forms, since they all end in ''s''.

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Liaison with mes and nos.ogg}}
| Ils sont mes&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;amis. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || They are my friends.
|-
| Ils sont nos&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;amis. || &lt;!-- IPA here --&gt; || They are our friends.
|}

''Mon'', ''ton'', and ''son'' are used before a feminine singular noun that starts with a vowel or silent ''h'':
: {{French/Word|Elle est mon&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;amie.|en=She is my friend.}}

=== Examples ===
{{sectstub}}

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Examples with possessive adjectives.ogg}}
| Ton écriture est jolie. ||  || Your  writing is nice. || ''l'écriture'' is feminine, but begins with a vowel
|-
| J’ai son livre. ||  || I have his/her book. || ''le livre'' is masculine
|-
| | Elle est la femme de mon ami. ||  || She's my friend's wife. || ''l'ami'' is maculine
|}&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-possessive-adjectives --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Questions|supplementary-id=french-questions}} ==
&lt;div id='french-questions'&gt;
Recall that the expression {{French/Word|il y a|IPA=/i.lja/|audio=Fr-il y a.ogg}} means ''there is …'' or ''there are …'':
: {{French/Word|Il y a un problème.|en=There is a problem.}}
: {{French/Word|Il y a des livres.|en=There are books.}}

The interrogative form of ''il y a'' is {{French/Word|y a-t-il|IPA=/i aˈt̪il/|audio=fr-fr-y_a-t-il.ogg}}. That is, ''il y a'' is inverted to ''y a-t-il'', meaning ''is there?'' or ''are there?'', within questions:
: {{French/Word|Y a-t-il un problème ?|en=Is there a problem?}}
: {{French/Word|Y a-t-il des magasins près d'ici ?|en=Are there shops near here?}}

Both ''How much …'' and ''How many …'' are translated as {{French/Word|Combien de …|IPA=&lt;!-- IPA here --&gt;}}.

If the person or thing it refers to is countable, ''combien de'' is always followed by a plural noun:
: {{French/Word|Combien de personnes y a-t-il à votre bureau ?|en=How many people are there in your office ?}}
: {{French/Word|Vous avez combien de frères ?|en=You have how many brothers?}}

However, with uncountable nouns, such as {{French/Word|l'eau|IPA=/o/|audio=Fr-eau.ogg|en=water|gender=m}} and {{French/Word|l'argent|IPA=/aʁ.ʒɑ̃/|audio=Fr-argent.ogg|en=money|gender=m}}, the singular form is used:
: {{French/Word|Vous avez combien d’argent ?|en=You have how much money?}}

As with ''il y a'', other nouns and verbs can be inverted within questions. For example, {{French/Word|vous avez …|en=you have …}} can become {{French/Word|… avez-vous ?|en=… do you have?}}:
: {{French/Word|Combien de frères avez-vous ?|en=How many brothers do you have?}}
: {{French/Word|Combien avez-vous d’argent ?|en=How much money do you have?}}

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Object pronouns}} ==
&lt;div id='french-object-pronouns'&gt;
=== Direct objects ===
While the subject of a sentence initiates an action (the verb), the direct object is the one that is affected by the action. A direct object pronoun is used to refer to the direct object of a previous sentence: 

{| {{French/Translations table}}
| Pierre voit '''le cambrioleur'''. ||  || Pierre sees '''the burglar'''.
|-
| Pierre '''le''' voit. ||  || Pierre sees '''him'''.
|}

The following table shows the various types of direct object pronouns:

{| {{French/Table|columns=8}}
! French
| me, m'||te, t'||le, l'||la, l'||nous||vous||les
|-
! English
| me&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||him, it||her, it||us&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||them
|}

Notes:
* &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are also used as indirect objects to mean ''to me, to you, to us'', and ''to you'' respectively.
* The pronoun form with an apostrophe is used before a vowel. 
* The direct object pronoun for ''nous'' and ''vous'' is the same as the subject.
* When the direct object comes before a verb in a perfect tense, a tense that uses a past participle, the direct object must agree in gender and plurality with the past participle. For example, in the phrase ''Je les ai eus'', or ''I had them'', the past participle would be spelled ''eus'' if the direct object, ''les'', was referring to a masculine object, and ''eues'' if ''les'' is referring to a feminine object.

=== Indirect objects ===
An indirect object is an object that would be asked for with ''To whom...?'' or ''From whom...?''. It is called indirect because it occurs usually together with a direct object which is affected directly by the action: 

{| {{French/Translations table}}
| Il donne du pain '''à Pierre'''. ||  || He gives some bread '''to Pierre'''.
|-
| Il '''lui''' donne du pain. ||  || He gives bread '''to him'''.
|}

The following table shows the various types of indirect object pronouns:

{| {{French/Table|columns=7}}
! French
| me, m'||te, t'||lui||nous||vous||leur
|-
! English
| to me&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to him, to her||to us&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to you&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;||to them
|}

Notes:
*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are also used as direct objects to mean ''me, you, us'', and ''you'' respectively.
* The pronoun form with an apostrophe is used before a vowel. 
* The indirect object pronoun for nous and vous is the same as the subject.
* The indirect object pronouns do '''not''' agree with the past participle like the direct object pronouns do. When ''me, te, nous'', and ''vous'' are used in a perfect tense, the writer must decide whether they are used as direct or indirect object pronouns. This is done by looking at the verb and seeing what type of action is being performed.

The bread ''is given'' by the man (direct). Pierre ''gets the given'' bread (indirect).

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''-e…er'' verbs}} ==
''-e…er'' are regular ''-er'' verbs, but also are stem changing. The stem change applies to all forms except ''nous'' and ''vous''. The stem change involves adding a grave accent ( ` ) over the ''e'' in the stem.

# French butchers do not sell pork, pork products, nor horsemeat. For these products, go to a '''''charcuterie'''''. However, a lot of ''boucheries'' are also ''charcuteries'', and are called ''boucherie-charcuterie''
# In France, bakeries only sell fresh bread; e.g. the bread is baked on site. Places where they sell bread that is not fresh are called '''''dépôt de pain'''''.
# ''''''Charcuteries'''''' sell things besides pork products, including pâté, salami, cold meats, salads, quiches and pizzas.
# An alternative to an ''''''épicerie'''''' is an '''''alimentation générale''''' (a general foodstore).

== {{French/Section|Grammar|''-yer'' verbs}} ==
''-yer'' verbs are irregular ''-er'' verbs. When ''y'' is part of the last syllable, it changes to ''i'' in order to keep the ''ay'' sound. In the present indicative of ''-yer'' verbs, this affects all forms except ''nous'' and ''vous''. Some ''-yer'' verbs, such as ''payer'', may optionally retain the ''y''.

=== Formation ===
In the present indicative, {{French/Word|payer|en=to pay}} is ''conjugated'' as follows:

{| class=wikitable
!'''payer {{fr/IPA|/pe.je/|audio=Fr-payer.ogg}} !! to pay'''
|-
|je paye {{French/Section|(ou paie)}} {{fr/IPA|/pɛj/|audio=Fr-paye.ogg}} || I pay

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Present perfect with regular verbs}} ==

The {{French/Word|passé composé|en=present perfect}} is a compound tense, and is therefore composed of an auxiliary verb and a past participle. With most verbs, that auxiliary verb is ''avoir''. 

=== Meaning ===
In English, verbs conjugated in the ''passé composé'' literally mean ''have/has ____ed''. While there is a simple past tense in French, it is almost always only used in formal writing, so verbs conjugated in the ''passé composé'' can also be used to mean the English simple tense. 

For example, the ''passé composé'' forms of {{French/Word|parler|en=to speak}}, ''[''avoir''] parlé'', literally mean ''has/have spoken'', but also means ''spoke''.

=== Basic formation ===
To conjugate a verb in the ''passé composé'', the helping verb, usually ''avoir'', is conjugated in the present indicative and the past participle is then added.

==== Auxiliary verb - ''avoir'' ====
Conjugate ''avoir'' in the present indicative.

{| {{French/Table|columns=4}}
! j'ai
| I have
! nous avons
| we have
|-
! tu as
| you have
! vous avez
| you have
|-
! il a
| he has
! ils ont
| they have
|-
! elle a
| she has
! elles ont
| they have
|}

==== Past participle ====
* ''-er'' verbs: replace ''-er'' with ''é''
* ''-ir'' verbs: replace ''-ir'' with ''i''
* ''-re'' verbs: replace ''-re'' with ''u''
* irregular verbs: varied; must be memorized

{| {{French/Table||Formation of the past participle|columns=4}}
! Verb Group||Infinitive||Stem||Past Participle
|-
! ''-er'' verbs
| jou'''er'''||jou||jou'''é'''
|-
! ''-ir'' verbs
| fin'''ir'''||fin||fin'''i'''
|-
! ''-re'' verbs
| répond'''re'''||répond||répond'''u'''
|}

==== ''Avoir'' + past participle====
{| {{French/Table|columns=4}}
! J'ai joué
| I have played
! Nous avons joué
| We have played
|-
! Tu as joué
| You have played
! Vous avez joué
| You have played
|-
! Il a joué
| He has played
! Ils ont joué
| They have played
|-
! Elle a joué
| She has played
! Elles ont joué
| They have played
|}

Please also note:

Fem. Subject or Person (Elles, Elle, Nous, On etc.)- Add another e with no aigu or grave to end of word- if a female person is partaking in the group.

Plural Subject (On, Nous, Tu, Vous etc.)- Add another &quot;s&quot; to end of word.

Finally, some verbs  are irregular for the past participle, such as aller (to go), instead of using avoir to form the past participle, they will use être (to be) to form the past participle.

Always check the verb's irregularities before using to form past participle. Some &quot;past participle&quot; irregulars are regular verbs when forming other tenses.

In French, you do not &quot;own&quot; body parts. While in English, you would say ''my hand'' or ''your hand'', the definite article is almost always used in French:
: {{French/Word|la main|en=my hand}}
: {{French/Word|la jambe|en=my leg}}
: {{French/Word|le bras|en=my arm}}

''To'' and ''of'' are part of the verbs ''écouter'' and ''entendre'' respectively. It is not necessary to add a preposition to the verb. Other verbs, such as ''répondre (à)'', meaning ''to respond (to)'', are almost always followed by a preposition.

=== Écrire ===

''Écrire'' is an irregular French verb, meaning ''to write''.  It varies from other ''-re'' verbs in the plural conjugation, by adding a ''v''. Its past particple, ''écrit'', is also irregular.

{| class=wikitable

|écrit {{fr/IPA|/e.kʁi/|audio=Fr-écrit.ogg}} || written
|}

The verb {{French/Word|coécrire|en=to co-write|IPA=/ko.e.kʁiʁ/}} is conjugated the same way. The nouns {{French/Word|écriture|gender=f|IPA=/e.kʁi.tyʁ/|audio=Fr-écriture.ogg}}, meaning ''writing'' or ''handwriting'', and {{French/Word|écrivain|gender=m, f|IPA=/e.kʁi.vɛ̃/|audio=Fr-écrivain.ogg}}, meaning ''writer'', are derived from ''écrire''.

=== Lire ===

''Lire'' is an irregular French verb, meaning to read. It's plural conjugation adds an ''s'', and its past participle is ''lu''.

{| class=wikitable
!'''lire {{fr/IPA|/liʁ/|audio=Fr-lire.ogg}} !! to read'''
|-
|je lis {{fr/IPA|/'li/|audio=Fr-lis.ogg}} || I read
|-

|-
|vous lisez {{fr/IPA|/li.ze/}} || you read
|-

|-
|lu {{fr/IPA|/ly/}} || read
|}

The verbs {{French/Word|élire|IPA=/e.liʁ/|en=to elect}} and {{French/Word|relire|IPA=/ʁǝ.liʁ/|audio=Fr-relire.ogg|en=to reread}} are conjugated the same way. The adjective {{French/Word|lisible|IPA=/lizibl/}}, meaning ''readable'' or ''legible'', is derived from ''lire''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lord Emsworth, did you use AP guidelines for this book ? If so, we could use that to promote it in a tagline, &quot;written for AP history&quot; or something. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:it has been a few years since i took ap us government in high school, but our class definately covered a good number of high profile supreme court cases (brown v. board of education, engel v. vitale, roe v. wade, etc) that aren't mentioned here. we also wrote essays about topics i've now forgotten. i'm not sure if the burden of explaining how to write the essays should fall to the textbook or to the instructor. perhaps if you're going for some kind of AP certification you could check out AP study guides from the public library or request old tests from the college board (my high school teachers did this). --[[User:Thepedestrian|Thepedestrian]] 21:59, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)

This needs to be moved to [[U.S. Constitution and Government]]. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 04:12, 4 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:Or simply [[United States Government]]. (The Constitution is included.) --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 04:03, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

This should be called &quot;U.S. Federal Government.&quot; 
- Maurreen, Oct 2004

It's not abundently clear to me exactly what the intended idea behind this text was.  If it is an exposition on the federal system of government in the U.S., I don't quite understand the approach, which appears to focus on the Constitution and its provisions.  If it is intended as a Constitutional History or Constitutional Law text, then it needs to be approached not on a section by section basis, but through recognized themes, like Executive Powers or Federal v. States Rights. [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 22:07, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

Further on this subject:  Part II should be reworked.  If I understand the structure of the book, Part I is the history of why we have our current Constitution, Part II is an explanation of what the Constitution says, Part III is an analysis of how the federal government is set up under the constitution, and Part IV is intended to be a discussion of what issues have arisen under that structure as time has passed.  But Part II has things in it (the first two sections) that really belong in Part III, etc.  [[User:DSYoungEsq|DSYoungEsq]] 17:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

== Merge Proposal ==

I've proposed that [[American Government]] be merged into this wikibook. I'm certain the chapter on third party history can be integrated. --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 07:55, 22 January 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Usage of the Subjunctive Mood ==

The subjunctive mood is used to express subjectivity, as opposed to objectivity.

|-
|-
|
Wills, wishes, or advice
|
Il faut que nous parlions.
|
It is necessary that we speak.
|-
|
Emotions regarding something
|
Nous sommes tristes que vous ne reussissiez &amp;agrave; l'examen.
|
We are sad that you did not pass the test.
|-
|
Doubts, opinions, or probabilities
|
Il est impossible que je sois incorrect.
|
It is impossible that I am wrong.
|-
|
Commands or wishes in the third person
|
Que Dieu nous b&amp;eacute;nisse.
|
May God bless us.
|}

The subjunctive usually appears with ''que'', which means ''that''.

== Usage of the Future ==

One uses the future tense when referring to an action, certain to occur, in the future. In a time ahead of now.

One may also use ''aller'' in the present tense in conjunction with ''aller'' or another verb in infinitive form, to refer to the future. However it is not the future tense. 

For example, 

''Il va aller à l'école'' 

Or

''Je vais dormir''

Holds generally the same meaning as, 

''Il ira à l'école''

Or

''Je dormirai''

However, the former is not in the future tense.
Also, the usage of &quot;aller&quot; generally signifies an action to occur in the very near future, where as future tense refers to any time in the future.

== Formation of the Future ==

=== Future Stems ===

* For (regular and irregular) -er or -ir verbs, the infinitive is the future stem.
* For (regular and irregular) -re verbs, the infinitive minus the final ''e'' is the future stem.
* Exception: Verbs that are stem-changing in the present are stem-changing in the future also.
* Exception: Certain irregular verbs have irregular future stems. (Not all irregular verbs have irregular future stems).

== Usage of the Conditional (Present) ==
The conditional tense is used when:
*a hypothetical situation is described.  In which case the structure &quot;Si + l'imparfait, le conditionnel&quot; is used.
:e.g. If I saw (or If I were to see) her, I would not recognize her. - Si je la voyais, je ne la '''reconnaîtrais''' pas.
*a polite request needs to be made:
:e.g. I would like a small salad, please. - Je '''voudrais''' (or J''''aimerais''') une petite salade, s'il vous plaît.
*an event that had not happened was described:
:e.g. He said Marie would come. - Il a dit que Marie '''viendrait'''.

== Formation of the Conditional ==

=== Conditional Stems ===

* For (regular and irregular) -er or -ir verbs, the infinitive is the conditional stem.
* For (regular and irregular) -re verbs, the infinitive minus the final ''e'' is the conditional stem.
* Exception: Verbs that are stem-changing in the present are stem-changing in the conditional also.
* Exception: Certain irregular verbs have irregular conditional stems. (Not all irregular verbs have conditional stems).
* '''Note''': In a word, the conditional stem is the same with the future one.

''Imparfait'' in French

== Usage of the Imperfect ==

The imperfect is used in French under several different circumstances. The imperfect is used:
 
* To refer to previously ongoing and repeated events that are now completely finished.

* To express an action that happened often in the past, such as a habit that one has grown out of. For example, &quot;I '''used to eat''' a kiwi while watching the news.&quot; is in French, &quot;Je '''mangeais''' un kiwi en regardant les informations.&quot;

* In describing the past, including things such as: time, location, weather, age, physical appearance, physical and emotional conditions or states, attitudes and desires and other mental experiences.

* Actions that occurred while something else was happening.

* To compare and contrast events in the present with events in the past. 

* To talk about the emotions or abstract qualities of a person/thing in the past or to discuss an irritating quality or subject.

* To suggest or ask certain &quot;forceful&quot; questions such as, &quot;Si on faisait une promenade?&quot;

* When phrases like ''I used to do...'' and ''I would do...'' are used in English.

== Formation of the Imperfect ==

=== Imperfect Stem ===

* For ''all'' verbs except for ''&amp;ecirc;tre'', the imperfect stem is determined by removing the -ons from the nous form of the present indicative of the verb. 
* Certain verbs (-cer and -ger verbs) are stem-changing in the nous form of the present indicative; these are stem-changing the imperfect also. The stem change that applies in the present indicative is retained when conjugating the je, tu, il, and ils forms of the imperfect. That stem change is reversed when conjugating the nous and vous forms of the imperfect. 
* For &amp;ecirc;tre, the imperfect stem is ''&amp;eacute;t-''.

=== Imperfect Ending ===

* To conjugate in the imperfect, add the appropriate ending to the imperfect stem.

== Usage of the Simple Past ==
The simple past is mostly a literary tense, used in fairy tales, and perhaps newspapers. It is one that native French students are expected to recognize but not use.

== Formation of the Simple Past ==

To conjugate in this tense, one finds the stem and appends the following, as according to the table:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFCC&quot;
|-

!

|-
|
Ils / Elles
|
-èrent
|
dansèrent
|}

It should be noted that être, along with a few other verbs are consistent in their irregularities in the passé simple as well.



=== Simple Past Stems ===

* For normal verbs (not irregular);
-er, changes it to é (manger = mangé)
&lt;br&gt;-ir, take off the r (choisir = choisi)
&lt;br&gt;-re, take off the re and add a u
&lt;p&gt;
* Certain verbs (-cer and -ger verbs) are stem-changing in the nous form of the present indicative; these are stem-changing the simple past also. The stem change that applies in the present indicative is retained when conjugating the je, tu, il, nous, and vous forms of the simple past. That stem change is reversed when conjugating the ils form of the simple past.
* For irregular verbs whose past participle end in -u, (but not for regular -re verbs, whose past participle also end in -u), that past participle is also the simple past stem.
* Some verbs have irregular simple past stems.

=== Simple Past Endings ===

* To conjugate in the past tense, add the appropriate ending to the past participle. There is one set of endings for irregular verbs whose past participles end in -u (&quot;irregular endings&quot;), and another set for all other verbs (&quot;regular endings&quot;).

The passé composé is a perfect tense, and is therefore composed of an auxiliary verb and a past participle. With most verbs, that auxililary verb is avoir. 

==Meaning==
Verbs in French conjugated in the passé composé can most simple be translated to English as eg &quot;has / have ____ed&quot;. While there is a simple past tense in French, it is mostly used in formal narrative writing, so verbs conjugated in the passé composé can also be used to mean the English simple tense. 
*For example, the passé composé form of parler (to speak), [''avoir''] parlé, literally means ''has/have spoken'', but also means ''spoke''. In French, the passé composé covers &quot;I ate&quot;, &quot;I did eat&quot; and &quot;I have eaten&quot; - J'ai mangé.

==When to use==
You use the passé composé when you want to express that:
#Something has been completed in the past.
#Something was done a certain amount of times in the past. (if the something was ongoing, the [[French/Grammar/Tenses/Imperfect|imparfait]] should be used)
#A series of somethings was completed in the past.

==Formation==

===Introduction===
To conjugate a verb in the passé composé, the auxiliary (or helping) verb, usually avoir, is conjugated in the present indicative and the past participle is then added. '''It is important to remember that there is only *one* verb in the passé composé'''. While the past participle looks like a verb, it is not - it functions more like an adjective. This is important to remember because when you negate in the passé composé, you negate the ''only'' verb, which is the auxiliary verb (ex. &quot;Je n'ai pas mangé&quot;; &quot;I have not eaten&quot;). This works exactly the same way in English - the only verb is the auxiliary verb, which is also the only thing negated in English (&quot;I ''have not'' eaten&quot;).

===Formation Summary===
The compound past is a compound tense- it consists of two verbs, the [[French/Grammar/Verbs/Auxiliary|auxiliary verb]] (&quot;helper verb&quot;) and the past participle of the verb one seeks to use in this tense.

To form the passé composé, you need to take the auxiliary verb - either avoir or être, then conjugate it according to the subject of the sentence, like in the [[French/Grammar/TensesPresent indicative|present indicative]] tense.  We then take the [[French/Grammar/Verbs/Past participle|past participle]] of the verb, and stick that on the end. 
Every verb has one past participle that does not change (there are some exceptions, as one will learn later). To find the past participle, the stem of the infinitive must be determined or the irregularity must be known.

If we want to make the statement negative, for example if we didn't do something in the past, we must always put the negative structure such as ''ne ... pas'' around the auxiliary verb, immediately before the past participle. For example, ''&quot;Je ne peux pas&quot;,''.  

Also, [[French/Grammar/Verbs/Reflexive|reflexive or pronomial verbs]] must be conjugated with être under most circumstances. For example, the verb &quot;se réflechir&quot; is conjugated in the first person singular by ''&quot;Je me suis réflechi(e),&quot;''.

===Auxiliary Verb Formation===
*The auxiliary verb is always either avoir or être.
**In the passé composé, for example, the auxiliary verb is conjugated in the present indicative.
***J'ai fini. - I have finished.



====Auxiliary Verb - Être====
Conjugate être in the present indicative.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| je suis||nous sommes
|-
| tu es||vous êtes
|-
| il est||ils sont
|}

===Past Participle Formation===
*'''-er''' verbs - replace -er with é
*'''-ir''' verbs - replace -ir with i
*'''-re''' verbs - replace -re with u
*irregular verbs - must be memorized

|-
!-ir verbs
|fin'''ir'''||fin||fin'''i'''
|-
! -re verbs
|répond'''re'''||répond||répond'''u'''
|}

====Avoir + Past Participle====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''J'ai joué.'''||I have played||'''Nous avons joué.'''||We have played.
|-
| '''Tu as joué.'''||You have played.||'''Vous avez joué.'''||You have played.
|-
| '''Il/Elle/On a joué.'''||He has played.||'''Ils/Elles ont joué.'''||They have played.
|}


====Être + Past Participle====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| '''Je suis allé(e).'''||I went.||'''Nous sommes allé(e)s.'''||we went
|-
| '''Tu es allé(e).'''||You went.||'''Vous êtes allé(e)(s).*'''||you (all) went
|-
| '''Il/On est allé.'''||He went.||'''Ils sont allés.'''||they went
|-2
| '''Elle est allée.'''||She went.||'''Elles sont allées.'''||they went
|}

*Note that for the starred ''vous'' form, the S (which is always added for ''nous'' and ''ils/elles'') is not added if the ''vous'' is simply denoting the singular, formal you.

===Past Participle Agreement with Preceding Direct Objects===
The past participle must agree with the direct object of a clause in gender and plurality if the direct object goes before the verb.
*the direct object is ''masculine singular'' - no change
**J'ai fini le jeu. - I have finished the game.
**Je l'ai fini. - I have finished it.
*the direct object is ''feminine singular'' - add an '''e''' to the past participle
**J'ai fini la tâche. - I have finished the task.
**Je l'ai finie. - I have finished it.
*the direct object is ''masculine plural'' - add an '''s''' to the past participle.
**J'ai fini les jeux. - I have finished the games.
**Je les ai finis. - I have finished them.
*the direct object is ''feminine plural'' - add an '''es''' to the past participle.
**J'ai fini les tâches. - I have finished the tasks.
**Je les ai finies. - I have finished them.

===Avoir ou Être?===
In most circumstances, the auxiliary verb is avoir. However, with certain verbs, the auxiliary verb is être. This occurs under two different circumstances:

'''1. Reflexive verbs''' always take être.
:This distinguishes them from verbs with preceding objects pronouns. 

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
! colspan=2| Reflexive Verbs vs. Verbs with Preceding Object Pronouns
|-
|'''Je me ''suis'' parlé.'''||I spoke to myself.
|-
|'''Il m'''a'' parlé.'''||He spoke to me.
|}

'''2. The House of Être:''' Most verbs form the ''passé composé'' with ''avoir'', however there are a small number of verbs that are always conjugated with ''être''. Seventeen special intransitive verbs take ''être'' (four of which can also take ''avoir'', as explained below).

::A useful mnemonic to help you remember these is &quot;DR.MRS.VANDERTRAMPP&quot;. Because all of these verbs except mourir, naître and rester are also verbs of movement (but be careful! not all movement verbs take être!), many also find it useful to draw a house with the verbs being acted out (&quot;The House of Être&quot;).

'''2.a. Exceptions'''
Note that there are four verbs above that are followed by a star (''sortir, descendre, monter, passer''). When a direct object is used with these verbs, the auxiliary verb becomes ''avoir''.

== Grammatik 1-1 ~ Introduction to German grammar ==
Knowing the parts of speech (how words function in a sentence) is important for anyone attempting to learn a second language.  English speakers will find many strong parallels between their language and German. However, as noted in the [[German/Introduction|introduction]], German grammar signals&amp;mdash;how words indicate their function in a sentence&amp;mdash;are more complex than English, and identifying the meaning of words in a German sentence is difficult without understanding these clues or signals to word function that come from the grammatical rules. The basic lessons (Level II) of this textbook are set up to first introduce the parts of speech, and then bring in the rules that govern these. Pay particular attention to both '''word endings''' and sentence '''word order''' as you progress in learning the German language.

Following is a short conversation piece (''Gespräch'').  Play the audio file first, then attempt to repeat what you hear, reading the spoken parts of the conversation. Go back and forth (listening and then speaking) until the German flows easily from your lips. This may take considerable practice. Refer to the vocabulary (''Vokabeln'') below to understand the meaning of the German sentences you are hearing and speaking. 

== Gespräch 1-1 ~ ''Die Freunde'' ==
:&lt;big&gt;Heinrich trifft Karl auf der Straße. Heinrich und Karl sind Freunde.&lt;/big&gt;
:* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Guten Tag, Karl. Wie geht es dir?
:* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Guten Tag. Danke, mir geht es gut. Und dir?
:* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Danke, mir geht es gut. Auf Wiedersehen.
:* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Auf Wiedersehen!
&lt;/big&gt;

In this conversation we learn several simple greetings exchanged between friends meeting very briefly on the street.

== Vokabeln 1-1 ==
This first vocabulary (''Vokabeln'') may seem a bit long considering you have been 
presented with only the brief conversation piece above, but it also contains all of the 
German words you have encountered up to this point in the Level II textbook, including 
words in photo captions and lesson section headers. The layout of the ''Vokabeln'' is 
explained in the [[German/Introduction|Lesson Layout Guide]] in the German~English 
textbook introduction, but the four parts of the ''Vokabeln'' are labeled in this first 
lesson to reenforce the concept. Note that column 3 may contain (in parentheses) 
additional notes about a word in column 1. Also, you can find the greeting phrases that 
appear in the simple conversations above (and many others) in [[German/Appendices/Phrasebook|Appendix
2]], a German-English phrase book.

== Gespräch 1-2 ~ ''Die Studenten'' == 
:&lt;big&gt;Markus ist Student. Er studiert Biologie. Er begegnet Katrin. Sie studiert Mathematik. Markus und Katrin sind Freunde.&lt;/big&gt;
:*''Markus'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hallo, Katrin! Wohin gehst du?&lt;/big&gt;
:*''Katrin'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ich gehe einkaufen. Der Kühlschrank ist fast leer. Ich brauche Wurst und Käse. Und du? Wohin gehst du? 
:*''Markus'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Zur Uni. Ich habe viel zu tun. 
:*''Katrin'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gut! Dann bis bald. Tschüss. 
:*''Markus'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tschüss, Katrin.
&lt;/big&gt;

Here again, two friends (college students) meet casually and discuss briefly what each is doing.

== Grammatik 1-2 ~ Word Order in Questions ==
Basic or '''normal word order''' in simple German sentences is the same as in English&amp;mdash;subject then verb then verb object:
:     ''Ich habe Käse''   ~   I (subject) have (verb) cheese (verb object = what you &quot;have&quot;)                 
Unlike with English sentence structure, a question sentence in German is formed by reversing subject and verb: 
:     ''Hast du Käse?''  ~    Have (verb) you (subject) cheese?                     
This is called '''inverted word order'''. Examples are provided in Gespräch 1-1 and Gespräch 1-2. As another example, consider the statement: ''Er studiert Biologie'' ('He studies biology'). A question statement might be: ''Was studiert er?'' ('What studies he?'; although in English, we would usually say: &quot;What is he studying?&quot;). The normal word order of subject (''er'' or &quot;he&quot;) then verb (''studiert'' or &quot;study&quot;) is reversed and, in this case, an '''interrogative''' (''was'' or &quot;what&quot;) added onto the front replacing the unknown (to the speaker) object (here, &quot;biology&quot;). Additional examples of questions formed from basic statements illustrate inverted word order:
: ''Wie geht es dir?'' from ''Es geht mir gut.'' ('It goes well with me.')
: ''Wohin geht sie?'' from ''Sie geht einkaufen.'' ('She goes shopping.')
: ''Was ist fast leer?'' from ''Der Kühlschrank ist fast leer.'' ('The fridge is almost empty.')
: ''Was brauche ich?'' from ''Ich brauche Wurst und Käse.'' ('I need sausage and cheese.')
: ''Versteht sie mich?'' from ''Sie versteht mich.'' ('She understands me.')

== Grammatik 1-3 ~ Introduction to pronouns ==
A '''[[Wikipedia:en:Pronoun|pronoun]]''' (''Pronomen'') is a short word that takes the place of a noun previously mentioned in the sentence, paragraph, or conversation. A pronoun substitutes for a noun or noun phrase and designates persons or things asked for, previously specified, or understood from context.  A specific pronoun in English as well as German has '''person''', '''number''', and '''case'''. You will be encountering all of the common German pronouns in the next several lessons, so we will track these as they appear. The following '''familiar''' personal pronouns are introduced in this lesson (''Lektion 1''):
  ''ich'' &amp;ndash; I      (1st person, singular, nominative case)
  ''mich'' &amp;ndash; me    (1st person, singular, accusative case)
  ''mir'' &amp;ndash; me     (1st person singular, dative case)

  ''du'' &amp;ndash; you     (2nd person, singular, nominative case)
  ''dich'' &amp;ndash; you   (2nd person, singular, accusative case)
  ''dir'' &amp;ndash; you    (2nd person singular, dative case)

  ''er'' &amp;ndash; he      (3rd person singular, nominative case)
  ''sie'' &amp;ndash; she    (3rd person singular, nominative case) 
  ''es'' &amp;ndash; it      (3rd person singular, nominative case)
Pronoun '''person''' describes the relationship of the word to the speaker (that is, ''1st person'' &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; the speaker; ''2nd person'' is &lt;u&gt;spoken to&lt;/u&gt;; and ''3rd person'' is &lt;u&gt;spoken about&lt;/u&gt;). Pronoun '''number''' refers to whether the word represents one (''singular'') or more than one (''plural'') person or object. Finally, '''case''' indicates how the pronoun is used in a sentence, as will be explained over the next several lessons.  For now, note in the examples you have already encountered, the three cases of 1st person singular pronouns in German: ''ich'', ''mich'', and ''mir''.  In English these are: 'I', 'me', and (''to'' or ''with'') 'me' &amp;mdash; in essence, there are really just two cases in English: subjective ('I') and objective ('me'). You will shortly see that there are similarities, yet distinct differences, in the cases as used by the English and German languages.

By referring back to lesson examples, you should be able to write out the following sentences in German.  On a piece of paper, first number and write each English sentence. Then review the lesson above and produce a German sentence that says the same thing as each English sentence. After all seven lines are translated, follow the ''Antworten'' (answers) link to compare your work with the correct ones. Do not be too concerned at this point if your spelling of the German verbs do not match the answers.  You will learn all about German verb forms in later lessons.

# Good day, Mark! How are you?
# Thanks, I am well. And you?
# Good bye, Henry!
# Catherine needs cheese.
# She understands the lesson well.
# So long, Mark! Until we meet again.
# Where is he going?

Weight to be measured is #.

We prove, that 4 is the minimum size of a weighing set to measure the numbers from 1 to 40.

* First Observation: each weight of your weighing set can be in three states. It can be on the left side, on the right side or not on the scale at all. So, for n weights, there is a maximum of 3&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; combinations possible.

* Second Observation: A valid weighing for a object of weight x must satisfy the equation
 W&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; = W&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; + x
where W&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are the sum of all weights on left resp. right side. x has a unique solution for every pair of W&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;.

* Third observation: if there is a valid weighing for a positive x, there must be a valid weighing for -x. For every weighing set there is a trivial solution for 0. If we want a solution for all numbers from 1 to 40, n must be at least 4, because 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;40&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.


Now, we construct a minimum solution:

Lemma:  The weighing set S(n)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;} can measure all weights between 1 and |S(n)|.  

Proof by induction:
For S(0) the lemma trivially holds.
Assume that the lemma holds for S(n). We will now prove that it holds for S(n+1).
Because S(n) is a subset of S(n+1), we can surely measure all weighs between 1 and |S(n)|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(3&lt;sup&gt;n&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;)/2 without using the weight 3&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;. By adding this weight on the left side, we can reach all solutions between 3&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;(3&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;)/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|S(n)|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and 3&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(3&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;)/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&lt;sup&gt;n+2&lt;/sup&gt;/2&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|S(n+1)|. QED.

Because of |S(3)|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;40, a solution to the problem is the weighing set {1,3,9,27}, which is minimal.

Questions:
*Prove that this is a unique solution. 
*Can somebody think about an extension to a &quot;fourth dimension&quot; ?

== Usage of the Past Conditional ==
Past conditional is used to refer to an event that could have taken place in the past. Eg. &quot;If he had not got hungry, we would have gone further.&quot;

== Formation of the Past Conditional ==

* The past conditional is a compound tense- it consists of two verbs, the auxiliary verb and the past participle one seeks to use in this tense.
* The auxiliary verb is conjugated as if it were being used in the present conditional.
* The past participle is placed immediately after the auxiliary verb.
* A negative structure such as ''ne ... pas'' is always placed around the auxiliary verb, not the past participle.

== Usage ==

== ''Avoir'' or ''être'' ==

* For the verbs ''aller'', ''arriver'', ''descendre'', ''entrer'', ''monter'', ''mourir'', ''naître'', ''passer'', ''partir'', ''rentrer'', ''rester'', ''retourner'', ''sortir'', ''tomber'', and ''venir'', the auxiliary verb is ''être'' (eg: ''je suis allé à Paris'').
* For pronominal verbs (verbs indicating that the subject performs the action upon itself) ''être'' is the auxiliary verb (eg: ''je me suis mis à écrire''). 
* For all other verbs, ''avoir'' is the auxiliary verb (eg: ''j'ai mis de l'encre dans l'imprimante'').
* When some verbs that are normally conjugated with ''être'' are used transitively (along with a direct object), ''avoir'' is the auxiliary verb (eg: ''j'ai monté un meuble en kit'').
* When the subject of a pronominal verb becomes an object, ''avoir'' becomes the auxiliary verb (eg: ''les deux chefs se sont rencontrés -&gt; un chef a rencontré un autre chef'').

== Usage ==
This is added after an auxiliary verb for many past tenses, including passé composé.
{{sectstub}}

== Formation ==

* For a regular -er verb, the past participle is determined by replacing the -er with ''é''.
* For a regular -ir verb, the past participle is determined by removing the final ''r''.
* For a regular -re verb, the past participle is determined by replacing the -re with ''u''.
* Irregular verbs have irregular past participles, as shown by the table.
* For verbs with the auxiliary verb ''être'', the past participle must agree with the subject. For verbs with the auxiliary ''avoir'', the participle never agree with the subject, but with a possible direct complement, if it is written before the verb. For example, in the sentence ''elles sont arrivées au café'', since the subject is both feminine and plural, the participle ''arrive'' has an &quot;e&quot; and an &quot;s&quot; to agree with the subject ''elles'', because it's written before the verb, but in the sentence ''elle a bu le café'', the participle ''bu'' does not agree with ''elle''.

The table below shows additions to the normal past participle that must be made based on the gender and number of the subject.

== Usage of the Past Anterior ==
* The past anterior is used for actions completely terminated before the main past action. It translates as ''to have done something (before doing something else).'' Ex: I had gone to the store before I picked him up.

== Formation of the Past Anterior ==

* The past anterior is a compound tense- it consists of two verbs, the auxiliary verb and the past participle one seeks to use in this tense.
* The auxiliary verb is conjugated as if it were being used in the pass&amp;eacute; simple.
* The past participle is added immediately after the auxiliary verb.
* A negative structure such as ''ne ... pas'' is always placed around the auxiliary verb, not the past participle.

== Usage ==
This is used in a sentence when there is something in a future tense, but this action is also in the future, but before the other future.
This is called the &quot;futur anterieur&quot; in French.

== Formation ==

* The future anterior is a compound tense—it consists of two verbs, the auxiliary verb and the past participle one seeks to use in this tense.
* The auxiliary verb is conjugated as if it were being used in the future indicative.
* The past participle is added immediately after the auxiliary verb.
* A negative structure such as ''ne ... pas'' is always placed around the auxiliary verb, not the past participle.

In French the ''pluperfect'' is called ''le plus-que-parfait''. In English, it is also called the ''more than perfect''.

==Formation==
* The pluperfect is a compound tense - it consists of two verbs, the auxiliary verb and the past participle of the verb one seeks to use in this tense.
* The auxiliary verb is conjugated as if it were being used in the imperfect.
* The past participle is added immediately after the auxiliary verb.
* A negative structure such as ''ne ... pas'' is always placed around the auxiliary verb, immediately before the past participle.
* All past participle agreement rules that apply to composed tenses apply to the pluperfect.

==Usage==
The pluperfect is used to describe a past action that occurred before a second past action that is in the ''passé composé'' or ''imparfait''.
*Elle était vieille, mais elle avait été jeune. - She was old, but she had been young.
*Je l'aurais aidé si j'avais su. - I would've helped him if I had known.
*J'étais parti(e) quand tu m'as téléphoné. - I had already left when you called (me).

== Usage of the Pluperfect Subjunctive ==

The French pluperfect subjunctive is the least common literary tense - it's the literary equivalent of the past subjunctive.

Like all literary tenses, the pluperfect subjunctive is used only in literature, historical writings, and other very formal writing, so it is important to be able to recognize it but chances are that you will never in your life need to conjugate it.

== Formation of the Pluperfect Subjunctive ==

* The pluperfect subjunctive is a compound tense- it consists of two verbs, the auxiliary verb and the past participle of the verb one seeks to use in this tense.
* The auxiliary verb is conjugated as if it were being used in the imperfect subjunctive.
* The past participle is added immediately after the auxiliary verb.
* A negative structure such as ''ne ... pas'' is always placed around the auxiliary verb, immediately before the past participle.

== Usage of the Imperfect Subjunctive ==
The subjunctive imperfect is very rarely employed in French; generally it only appears in literature and is viewed as archaic. It can in all instances be replaced by the subjunctive present.
The subjunctive imperfect is employed in any instance in which the subjunctive is required, provided the trigger verb is in a past tense.
In the example &quot;Il fallait que le garçon allât à l'école&quot;, the subjunctive trigger verb &quot;falloir&quot; is in the imperfect, thus &quot;aller&quot; has been conjugated in the subjunctive imperfect. French speakers would normally express this as &quot;Il fallait que le garçon aille à l'école&quot;, where &quot;aller&quot; has been conjugated in the present subjunctive.

== Formation of the Imperfect Subjunctive ==

=== Imperfect Subjunctive Stems ===

* For regular -er verbs, the imperfect subjunctive stem is the conjugation of the verb in the 3rd person singular form of the simple past
* For regular -ir verbs, regular -re verbs and irregular verbs, the imperfect subjunctive stem is the conjugation of the verb in the 3rd person singular form of the simple past with the final &quot;t&quot; removed.

=== Imperfect Subjunctive Endings ===

* To conjugate the imperfect subjunctive, add the appropriate ending to the imperfect subjunctive stem.

== Usage of the Imperative ==
This tense is used to give commands, express requests or make suggestions.

== Formation of the Imperative ==

The imperative is used in ''tu'', ''nous'' and ''vous'' forms; the ''nous'' and ''vous'' forms are the same as the indicative in both regular and irregular verbs (except the 3 irregulars shown below). The ''tu'' form is also the same unless it comes from an infinitive that ends in -er, in which case the ''tu'' form would drop the 's' (e.g.: parles -&gt; parle).

You could also drop the 's' when an -ir verb has the same endings as an er verb.

The infinitive can also be used as the imperative, but only for impersonal commands, e.g.: ''mettre la ceinture''.


=== Regular Conjugations ===

* ''danser'', ''perdre'' &amp; ''finir'' are regular verbs that can be used in the imperative.

== Usage of the Present ==
When you want to talk about something that's happening now.



== Formation of the Present ==

To form the present tense, there are seven categories of verbs that you need to know about, sorted by their endings, and if they are regular (follow the rules) or irregular (have their own rules).

They are:
*-er verbs
*-ir verbs
*-re verbs

and
*irregular -er verbs
*irregular -ir verbs
*irregular -re verbs
*really really irregular verbs

===Regular Verbs===

==== Regular -er Verbs ====

* For non stem-changing regular -er verbs, the stem is determined by removing the final -er.
* After determining the stem, conjugate by adding the appropriate endings.

|-
|

|

|-
|
ils
|
-ent
|}

==== Conjugation of Regular -ir Verbs ====

* For regular -ir verbs, the stem is determined by removing the final -ir.
* After determining the stem, conjugate by adding the appropriate endings.

|-

|

==== Conjugation of Regular -re Verbs ====

* For regular -re verbs, the stem is determined by removing the final -re.
* After determining the stem, conjugate by adding the appropriate endings.

=== Irregular Conjugations ===

* Several verbs are irregularly conjugated in the present.
* Some verbs can be categorized by the general pattern they follow, while others are completely irregular.
* Irregular verbs are too numerous to be entirely provided here. Only some common irregular verbs will be shown.

==== Stem Changing -er Verbs ====

* Several French verbs are stem-changing; the endings for conjugation basically remain the same, but slight changes occur with the stem. 
* One may divide the category of stem-changing verbs into two subcategories: verbs whose stems change only in the nous form and verbs whose stems change only in the je, tu, il, and ils forms.

'''-cer Verbs'''

* To conjugate a -cer verb in the nous form, change the ''c'' to a ''&amp;ccedil;''.
* Conjugations in the je, tu, il, vous, and ils forms remain unaffected.

'''-ger Verbs'''

* To conjugate a -ger verb in the nous form, add an ''e'' between the final ''g'' and the ending ''ons''.
* Conjugations in the je, tu, il, vous, and ils forms remain unaffected.

'''-ayer, -oyer, and -uyer Verbs'''

* To conjugate an -ayer, -oyer, or -uyer verb in the je, tu, il, and ils forms, change the ''y'' to ''i''.
* Conjugations in the nous and vous forms remain unaffected.

'''-eler Verbs'''

* To conjugate an -eler verb in the je, tu, il, and ils forms, change the ''l'' to ''ll''.
* Conjugations in the nous and vous forms remain unaffected.

'''-eter Verbs'''

* To conjugate an -eter verb in the je, tu, il, and ils forms, change the ''t'' to ''tt''.
* Conjugations in the nous and vous forms remain unaffected.

'''Verbs with ''e'' in the second to last syllable'''

* To conjugate a verb with an ''e'' in the second to last syllable in the je, tu, il, and ils forms, change the ''e'' to ''&amp;egrave;''.
* Conjugations in the nous and vous forms remain unaffected.

'''Verbs with ''&amp;eacute;'' in the second to last syllable'''

* To conjugate a verb with an ''&amp;eacute;'' in the second to last syllable in the je, tu, il, and ils forms, change the ''&amp;eacute;'' to ''&amp;egrave;''.
* Conjugations in the nous and vous forms remain unaffected.

==== Irregular -ir Verb Patterns ====

'''Couvrir'''

* The verbs ''couvrir'', ''cueillir'', ''offrir'', ''ouvrir'', and ''souffrir'', follow this pattern.
* The stem is determined by removing the final -ir.
* Although the verbs are -ir verbs, they are treated like regular -er verbs for the purpose of conjugation. Thus, they utilize the regular endings for -er verbs.

'''Dormir'''

* The verbs ''dormir'', ''mentir'', ''partir'', ''sentir'', ''servir'', and ''sortir'' follow this pattern.
* For conjugating the plural forms (nous, vous, ils), the stem is determined by removing the final -ir.
* For conjugating the singular forms (je, tu, il), the stem is the same as the plural stem, except that the last letter of the plural stem is removed in addition to the -ir.
* The verb ending pattern for these verbs is as follows:


{| border=&quot;1&quot;

|-
|

|-
|
vous
|
-ez
|-
|
ils
|
-ent
|}

==== Irregular -re Verb Patterns ====

'''-aindre, -eindre, and -oindre Verbs'''

* Verbs ending with -aindre, -eindre, and -oindre follow this pattern.
* For conjugating the singular forms (je, tu, il), the stem is determined by removing the final -dre.
* For conjugating the plural forms (nous, vous, ils), the stem is the same as the singular stem, except that a ''g'' is immediately after the final ''i'' and before the final ''n''.
* The verb ending pattern for these verbs is as follows:

&lt;Big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''Die Zahlen'' ~ &lt;/big&gt;The Numbers&lt;/Big&gt;

== Lektion 3 ~ ''Zählen von 1 bis 12'' ==
'''Counting''' in any language is a valuable skill best learned early on. In German as in English, there are both '''cardinal''' (counting) and '''ordinal''' (place or order) numbers, and number formation is similar in that the first twelve numbers are unique. Above twelve, numbers are formed by combination. For example, 13 is ''dreizehn'' and 14 is ''vierzehn''.  Higher numbers will be the subject of later lessons.

Note in the table how ordinals are formed from the cardinals in German by adding ''te''. 'Ten' becomes 'tenth' in English; ''zehn'' become ''zehnte'' in German.  As in English, there are several nonconforming variants: ''erste'', ''dritte'', and ''siebte''.

| &lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;Aussprache&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learning the German words for the numbers provides an excellent opportunity to practice German pronunciations. Following are some helpful hints for English speakers attempting to count in German. A &quot;dental sound&quot; is made by moving the tongue into the back of the upper teeth&amp;mdash;almost as if the word started with a 't'. A &quot;gutteral sound&quot; comes from deep in the throat. Also, remember, in words of more than one syllable, the emphasis is on the first syllable. final consonants are cut off quickly in German, not drawn out as in many English words. English speakers might call this being curt or brusque with each word. 
''eins''    say ''''eyen'''-zah' but drop the 'ah'; 'z' is between an 's' and 'z'
''zwei''    sounds like 'zveye'; the 'w' is between a 'v' and a 'w'
''drei''    sounds like &quot;dry&quot;, but with dental 'd' and roll the 'r'
''vier''    sound is between &quot;fear&quot; and 'fee-yahr'
''fünf''    say 'foon-fah' without the 'ah'; very slight 'r' after the 'ü'
''sechs''   sounds like &quot;sex&quot;, but with a more dental leading 's'
''sieben''  sounds like &quot;'''see''' Ben&quot; (use dental 's')
''acht''    sounds like 'ahkt'; the 'ch' is guttural
''neun''    sounds like &quot;loin&quot; with an 'n'
''zehn''    sounds like the name, &quot;Zane&quot;, but the 'z' is more dental
''elf''     sounds pretty much like &quot;elf&quot; (the German 'e' is a little higher)
''zwölf''   sounds like 'zwolf', but the 'o' is closer to 'u' in 'up'

== Grammatik 3-1 ~ Telling time (hours) ==
Knowing the numbers from 1 to 12, you can now begin asking and telling time in German.
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:1em 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:20030805121140!IMG 3161 2 web.jpg|Grazer Uhrturm]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Der Uhrturm von Graz''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

=== Gespräch 3-1 ===
:&lt;big&gt;Zwei Jungen, Heinrich und Karl, sind Freunde. Sie begegnen sich eines Nachmittags.&lt;/big&gt;
:* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;Karl. Wie geht's?
:* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hallo!
:* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;Willst du spielen? Ich habe einen Ball.
:* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wie spät ist es?
:* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;Es ist ein Uhr.
:* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dann kann ich bis zwei Uhr spielen.
:* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;Das ist gut. Wir spielen eine Stunde lang!&lt;/big&gt;

Asking for the time is accomplished by the sentence: ''Wie spät ist es?'' (&quot;How late is it?&quot;). The answer places the hour in the line ''Es ist ____ Uhr'' (&quot;It is __ o'clock&quot;), substituting the correct cardinal value (except ''ein'' is used instead of ''eins''). One could also ask: ''Wieviel Uhr ist es?'' (not used very often anymore) or respond ''Es ist eins'' or ''Es ist drei'', etc.&amp;mdash;which may be imprecise, unless the time is close to the hour. The following sentences also relate to telling time:
{|
|''Er fragt nach der Uhrzeit.''
|He asks the time.
|-
|''Sie begegnen sich eines Nachmittags.''
|They meet each other one afternoon.
|-
|''Es ist halb vier.''
|It is half past three (3:30).
|-
|''Es ist Viertel nach zwölf.''
|It is a quarter after twelve (12:15).
|-

Knowing how to express the quarter, half, and three quarter hours will allow you to give the time more precisely. We will, of course, revisit this subject. Once you know how to count beyond twelve, the hour's division into 60 minutes can be expressed. Also, Germans (like most Europeans) utilize what is known in America as &quot;military time&quot; or a 24-hour clock.

== Grammatik 3-2 ~ Introduction to Nouns ==
A '''[[Wikipedia:en:Noun|noun]]''' is a fundamental part of speech, occurring in sentences in two different ways: as subjects (performers of action), or objects (recipients of action). As a generality, a noun is the name of a &quot;person, place, or thing&quot;. Nouns are classified into proper nouns (e.g. &quot;Janet&quot;), common nouns (e.g. &quot;girl&quot;), and pronouns (e.g. &quot;she&quot; and &quot;which&quot;). A '''proper noun''' (also called ''proper name'') is a noun which denotes a unique entity. The meaning of a proper noun, outside of what it references, is frequently arbitrary or irrelevant (for example, someone might be named Tiger Smith despite being neither a tiger nor a smith). Because of this, they are often not translated between languages, although they may be transliterated &amp;mdash; for example, the German surname &quot;Knödel&quot; becomes &quot;Knoedel&quot; in English, as opposed to &quot;Dumpling&quot;. Proper nouns are capitalized in English and all other languages that use the Latin alphabet; this is one way to recognize them. However, '''in German both proper and common nouns are capitalized''' (as are certain formal pronouns; see [[German/Lesson 2#Grammatik 2-3 ~ Familiar and Polite Pronoun Forms|Grammatik 2-3]]).
----

== Grammatik 3-3 ~ Gender of Nouns ==
We have seen evidence of word gender in the pronouns we have been enountering; notably 'he', 'she', and 'it' in English and ''er'', ''sie'', and ''es'' in German. Just like many other languages (but not English), German has '''genders''' for nouns as well. Noun gender is indicated by the ''definite article'', which should always be learned as part of the noun. For this reason, nouns presented in each lesson's ''Vokabeln'' include the gender appropriate definite article.    

=== Definite Articles ===
The definite article (''bestimmter Artikel'') is equivalent to an English 'the', and the three basic gender forms of definite articles in German are as follows:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''der'''''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;masculine&amp;nbsp;
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''die'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;feminine
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''das'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;neuter
|}

To say 'the book' in German, you would say ''das Buch'', because ''Buch'' is a '''neuter''' noun. To say 'the man' in German, you would say ''der Mann'', because ''Mann'' is a '''masculine''' noun. To say 'the woman' in German, you would say ''die Frau'', because ''Frau'' is a '''feminine''' noun.

Noun gender does not always derive from actual gender where gender might be applicable. For example, 'the boy' is ''der Junge'' (''masculine''); but 'the girl' is ''das Mädchen'' (''neuter''). Also, nouns that have no inherent gender are not necessarily neuter. From this lesson: 'the watch or time piece' is ''die Uhr'' ('feminine').

Because German is generally more structured than English, it is important when learning German nouns to always learn them with their gender correct definite article; and in the ''Vokabeln'' nouns are always given with their associated definite article. That is, you must memorize the word for 'book' in German as ''das Buch'', not simply ''Buch''. Not just definite articles, but indefinite articles and adjectives have endings that must match the gender of the noun they precede. Using the wrong gender can alter the meaning of a German sentence, so in forming a proper sentence with ''Buch'', you will need to know that it is a neuter noun.

=== Indefinite Articles ===
In addition to the definite articles&amp;mdash;&quot;the&quot; in English and ''der''-words in German&amp;mdash;discussed above, both languages have '''indefinite articles''' (''unbestimmter Artikel''). Indefinite articles  precede nouns in the same way that definite articles do, but convey a general or indefinite sense.  These are &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot; in English.  Thus, 'the book' or ''das Buch'' refers to a definite or specific book, whereas 'a book' or ''ein Buch'' is indefinite about which book is referred to.  Indefinite articles also have gender as shown here:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
&amp;nbsp;'''''ein'''''
|
&amp;nbsp;''der''&amp;nbsp;
|
&amp;nbsp;masculine&amp;nbsp;
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''''eine''''' ||
&amp;nbsp;''die''
|
&amp;nbsp;feminine
|-
| &amp;nbsp;'''''ein''''' ||
&amp;nbsp;''das''
|
&amp;nbsp;neuter
|}

Here are some examples of indefinite articles (underlined) used in German sentences:
{|
|''Ich habe &lt;u&gt;einen&lt;/u&gt; Ball.''
|I have a ball.
|- 
|''Heute lesen wir &lt;u&gt;ein&lt;/u&gt; Buch.''
|Today we read a book.
|-
|''Markus trifft &lt;u&gt;einen&lt;/u&gt; Studenten auf der Straße.''
|Mark meets a student on the street.
|-
|''Die Geschäftsleute haben &lt;u&gt;eine&lt;/u&gt; Antwort.''
|The business people have an answer.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Ein&lt;/u&gt; Freund spielt Ball mit ihm.''
|A friend plays ball with him.
|}
Why, you ask, are there words like ''einen'' in some sentences above&amp;mdash;a spelling that does not appear in the gender table? The tables for both the definite and indefinite articles above are simplified at this stage, giving only articles in the nominative case (applied to words that are subjects of verbs). In the very next lesson you will start to address all the other cases in German.  However, the '''[[German/Lesson 2#Grammatik 2-2 ~ Pronouns in the Nominative Case|nominative case]]''' is the one used to signify the gender of a noun, as in our ''Vokabeln''.

== Vokabeln 3-2 ==

 das Buch                   book
 die Frau                   woman
 der Knödel                 dumpling
 das Mädchen                (young) girl

 lesen                      read

Newport Beach, CA - Kurt Kawohl, author of a newly released book &quot;Transcendentalism - A New Revelation&quot; has reinstituted Transcendentalism in the USA. Kurt was born in Germany in 1941 and now lives in California where he is an Author/ Financial Advisor/ Real Estate Broker. It is his belief that the American Transcendental movement would have survived and thrived today if their philosophy had been more compatible with the majority American religious beliefs of spiritual inspirations and revelations together with insight as being acceptable communicators of the truth. 

In his book Kurt explores the origin of religious beliefs and religions. Although he credits most past religious leaders, writers and portrayed prophets of the “Holy Books” with having experienced spiritual interaction with a spiritual existence, Kurt attributes their mind’s interpretation of these events as being blended with superstitions which was the norm of that time period. It is the author’s claim that his  concept of a spiritual deity is also derived through his own spiritual experiences and that the spiritual existence in the spiritual realm is in actuality a spiritual collective; the progressive and accumulative spiritual intelligence of the universe; an agglomeration of all of the righteous souls who have passed into the spiritual realm.

Kurt states in his book, “Transcendentalism Today&quot; can influence the beginning of a new integration of rationality  into many religions. In this 21st Century, the Age of Technology, we are still plagued by religious beliefs that is a contributing cause toward terrorism, killings and wars between nations. Belief in a deity who caused catastrophes, punished people and created the universe out of nothingness as if by magic was brought about by hysteria and superstitions. This thought process needs to be reassessed and brought up to date. Open-minded people must use common sense to determine whether this so-called deity was incorrectly perceived, misinterpreted and misunderstood by the masses of a bygone era. When peoples' concepts are flawed, corrections, truth, logic and common sense thereof must eventually prevail.  It is the attributes of human characteristics to exercise upon others power, control, dominance, destruction, punishment, revenge, judgment and not the attributes of a deity. Everyone is personally responsible for his own soul's destiny, the only requirement for achieving spiritual continuity is righteous living. The destruction of civilizations, most sufferings and premature deaths are due to human frailties, stupidity or imperfections and are not a deity’s doings. The deity that mankind calls by several names exists in a spiritual realm and never has and never will interfere with anything on earth or in the universe.” 

Will the author’s concept of Transcendentalism Today survive? Only time will tell. Kurt has had dialogue with religious leaders worldwide and supplies the evidence thereof in his book. On a website catering primarily to active and retired military personnel, at Military.com Kurt has posted his Transcendentalism opinions on who/what “God” is and supplied the website where his book can be accessed free of charge. Surprisingly over 10,000 people have visited there within a one year time period with many expressing their approval.

Beitscher wrote an email to Kurt stating, “As I near the end of your book and turn each page, I marvel at the insight, research and reading you have done to come to this point in your life and how you now affect so many more lives. Sometimes I lose a little hope for mankind but with you, and I know there are many like you, I realize that there is hope that we may transcend that which separates us. You have started that vital journey with a remarkable thesis in your book &quot;Transcendentalism - A New Revelation&quot;. Your courage to fly in the face of  organized religion and see the truth behind the basics of all religion deserves a Nobel Prize. The courage you display in listing the correspondence with other learned people even though it may be at odds with your statements is to be commended. Christopher Phillips writes &quot;It is not enough to have the courage of your convictions, you must also have the courage to have your convictions challenged&quot;. You have that courage and wisdom. Congratulations on a work long needed“.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Presidents of the United States==
Although Washington was a member of the Whig Party before the Revolution, after the war he was not a member of any party, though he tended to lean toward Federalist positions. Since the formation of the Democratic-Republican party and the Federalist Party, there has always been at least one viable political party. Today the United States has a two party system. There have been many third party movements, such as Ralph Nader, and Theodore Roosevelt, but these attempts to create a three-party system have, thus far, failed.

== The alphabet and its pronunciation ==
Indonesian letters are the same as those used in English.  Historically, the languages of Indonesia had been written in Indian alphabets or the Arabic alphabet. All of the letters ''A'' through ''Z''
are used, as in English, though some of the letters are pronounced differently. However, unlike English, Indonesian spelling is very consistent: letters are largely pronounced as they are spelled and no letters are silent. You will find that some of the sounds are similar to Spanish.

Below is a table of the Indonesian alphabet. The pronunciation column shows how each letter is pronounced in Indonesian. The sound column shows how it sounds in
English.  Where the sound isn't spelled out, it is roughly the same as in
English.

'''Listen''' to how Indonesians pronounce the alphabet: [[media:indonesian-alphabet-a-m.ogg|'''A-M''']]; [[media:indonesian-alphabet-n-z.ogg|'''N-Z''']]

{| class=wikitable align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Letter''
! ''Pronunciation''
! ''IPA''
! ''English Approximation''
|-
| a || a (like ''a'' in ''father'') || [a]
| always the ''a'' in ''father'', ''Dali Lama'' but shorter, never the &quot;a&quot; in ''catch''
|-
| b || be (like ''bay'') || [b]
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| c || ce (pronounced &quot;chay&quot;) || [&amp;#680;] (versus English [&amp;#679;])
|
Almost always like the ''ch'' in ''church'', ''chest'', and in some borrowed words or proper nouns like the French ''c'est'' (nearly like English ''say'')
|-
| d || de (like ''da'' in ''day'') || [d]
| like ''de'' in ''deli''
|-
| e || e
| [&amp;#603;], [&amp;#601;], [e] (not [e&amp;#618;])
| there are three ways of pronouncing ''e'' in Indonesian:
# one (and by far the more common) is the schwa sound, as in ''e'' in ''stern'', ''learn''.
# second one is like the ''e'' in ''bed'', ''red''.
# and third is like in ''a'' in ''foray'' and ''came''
|-
| f || ef || [f]
| like the English standalone ''f'', though often substituted with ''p'' and vice versa
|-
| g || ge (&quot;GAY&quot;) || [&amp;#609;]
| always the hard ''g'' in English: ''gas'', ''guard'' except in conjunction with an ''n''
|-
| h || ha || [h]
| as in the English ''have'' except when occurring at the end of a word when it is pronounced but unvoiced
|-
| i || i (pronounced &quot;EE&quot;) || [i] || Like the long &quot;e&quot; sound in &quot;bee&quot;, &quot;see&quot;, but shorter
|-
| j || je (&quot;JAY&quot;) || [&amp;#677;] (versus English [&amp;#676;])
| like the ''j'' in ''joke'', some accents make it sound much heavier making ''dj'' a closer transliteration
|-
| k || ka || [k] (versus English [k&amp;#688;])
| like the ''k'' in ''kite'' except when at the end of the word when it functions more like a glottal stop
|-
| l || el || [l] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| m || em || [m] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| n || en || [n] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| o || o
| [o] (not [o&amp;#650;] or British [&amp;#601;&amp;#650;]), [&amp;#596;]
| there are two ways of pronouncing ''o'' in Indonesian:
# like the [[media:indonesian-o1-sound.ogg|''o'']] in ''post'', ''rope'', but don't pronounce the ''u'' sound.
# more open, like the [[media:indonesian-o2-sound.ogg|''o'']] in ''boss'', ''stop''.

== Contoh Percakapan ''(Dialogue Example)'' ==

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Selamat pagi, Bu!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Apa kabar?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Baik. Anda?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik-baik juga.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Aku sedang membaca novel.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Novel apa yang kamu baca?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Aku sedang membaca novel semua tentang Islam!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Tentu saja.&lt;font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Sudah waktunya aku harus pulang. Sampai berjumpa, dan jangan lupa besok aku akan meminjam novelmu&lt;font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Tentu aku tidak akan lupa. Sampai jumpa kembali.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Selamat jalan.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;Terjemahannya (The Translation):

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good morning, Ma'am!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Good morning, Sir!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;How are you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Good. You?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Also good.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;What are you doing?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;I am reading a novel.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;What novel are you reading?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;I am reading a novel about everything about Islam!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;May I borrow it?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Of course.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;It is already time for me to go home. Goodbye, and don't forget I'll borrow your book tomorrow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Of course I won't forget. Goodbye too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Good bye.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Kosakata Baru ''(New Vocabulary)'' == 
* Selamat pagi - good morning
* Selamat tinggal - goodbye (when leaving)
* Bu - ma'am. Literally means ''mother''.
* Pak - sir. Literally means ''father''.
* Apa kabar - how are you? what's up?
* Baik - good, well
* Anda - you (formal)
* Kamu - you (informal)
* Juga - also
* Dan - and
* Jika- if
* Apa - what

== Selamat ==

The word ''selamat'' means ''safe''. So, ''selamat pagi'' literally means ''safe morning''. The greetings in Indonesian is not quite the same as that of English. Below is the table of words with their meaning and
the time you may want to use it:


{| class=wikitable
|-
! ''Kata'' (Word)
! ''Arti'' (Meaning)
! ''Waktu / Kondisi''
(Time / Condition)
|-
| Pagi || morning
| Sun is already risen, but before 10am.
|-
| Siang || noon || Around noon. Usually 10am-2pm.
|-
| Sore || afternoon || Sun is still up, but after 2pm.
|-
| Malam || night || Sun must have set.
|-
| Tinggal || bye
| When parting, said to the person staying
|-
| Jalan || bye
| When parting, said to the person leaving
|}

Unlike English, it is all right to greet people with ''&quot;selamat malam&quot;'' when meeting at night. To say ''&quot;good bye&quot;'', we can use ''&quot;selamat tinggal&quot;''.

The word ''&quot;selamat&quot;'' also means ''congratulations''. Therefore, it
is also used to congratulate other people. So, you can use the word
''&quot;selamat&quot;'' with the following words:


{| class=wikitable
|-
! ''Kata'' (Word)
! ''Arti'' (Meaning)
|-
| Ulang tahun || Birthday (literally: ''ulang'' = repeat; ''tahun'' = year)
|-
| Tahun baru || New year (literally: ''baru'' = new)
|-
| Natal || Christmas
|-
| Paskah || Easter
|-
| Jalan || voyage (i.e. ''bon voyage'')
|}

So, ''&quot;selamat ulang tahun&quot;'' means ''happy birthday''. And so forth. Note that the word ''&quot;jalan&quot;'' means ''street'' or ''to go'', but when used in ''&quot;selamat jalan&quot;'', it means ''&quot;bon voyage&quot;''.

== Apa Kabar ''(How Are You?)'' ==

The phrase ''&quot;apa kabar&quot;'' literally means ''&quot;what (your) news&quot;''. The word ''&quot;apa&quot;'' means ''&quot;what&quot;'' and the word ''&quot;kabar&quot;'' means ''&quot;news&quot;''. When translated, it means ''&quot;how are you&quot;''.

To answer ''&quot;apa kabar&quot;'', we usually use ''&quot;baik&quot;'' or ''&quot;baik-baik&quot;'' to indicate that it's good. We can answer ''&quot;biasa saja&quot;'' (= &quot;so so&quot;) or
''&quot;kurang baik&quot;'' (= &quot;not good&quot;, literally = &quot;less good&quot;).

In Malay, they use the spelling of ''&quot;khabar&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;kabar&quot;'', and thus the pronunciation is slightly different, with the Malay pronunciation using a hard H sound instead of regular K sound.

== Sapaan ''(Salutations)'' ==

Notice that the dialog above uses ''&quot;pak&quot;'' and ''&quot;bu&quot;'', which mean ''&quot;sir&quot;'' and ''&quot;ma'am&quot;'' respectively. In Indonesian, you'll need to specify proper salutations in most cases when greeting people. This is because Indonesian people tend to be very polite. In formal situations or the work place, adults usually greet using ''&quot;pak&quot;'' or ''&quot;bu&quot;''.

The word ''Anda'' (usually capitalised to show respect) is the general, relatively polite form of ''you''; note that ''bapak'' and ''ibu'' could also be used, as well as casual forms such as ''kamu''.

The article ''&quot;pak&quot;'' is shorthand for ''&quot;bapak&quot;'' (= mister or father), while ''&quot;bu&quot;'' is an abbreviation of ''&quot;ibu&quot;'' (= madam or mother).

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | [[Indonesian/Lesson 1| &lt;&lt; Lesson 1: Greetings]]  | Lesson 2: This, That |[[Indonesian/Lesson 3| Lesson 3: Pronouns &gt;&gt;]]
=== Arti Umum ''(General Meaning)'' ===

The word ''&quot;ini&quot;'' means ''&quot;this&quot;'' or ''&quot;these&quot;''.&lt;br&gt;
The word ''&quot;itu&quot;'' means ''&quot;that&quot;'' or ''&quot;those&quot;''.&lt;br&gt;

=== Penggunaan Pertama: Ini buku ''(First Usage: This [is a] book)'' ===

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Ini buku. ''(&quot;This is a book&quot; or &quot;These are books&quot;)''
* Ini pensil. ''(&quot;This is a pencil&quot; or &quot;These are pencils&quot;)''
* Itu apel. ''(&quot;That is an apple&quot; or &quot;Those are apples&quot;)''
* Itu jeruk. ''(&quot;That is an orange&quot; or &quot;Those are oranges&quot;)''

From the examples above, you can see that there is no explicit word for
''&quot;to be&quot;'' as in English. It is already implied by the structure or the
vocabulary used in the sentence.

In addition, when using a noun, the meaning can be either
singular or plural. It depends on the context. When the context does not
make it clear, the noun is assumed to be singular.

The reader might ask: If ''ini buku'' means this is a book while when naively translated sounds like &quot;This book.&quot; Then how to say &quot;this book&quot; in Indonesian? Answer: ''buku ini''. When learning Indonesian, or when Indonesian learning English, people usually realized that the order of words, especially adjective and noun, are usually swapped.

=== Penggunaan Kedua: Buku ini merah ''(Second Usage: This book [is] red)'' ===

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This book is &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These books are &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Apel ini &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hijau&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This apple is &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These apples are &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Pensil itu '''hitam'''. ''(&quot;That pencil is '''black'''&quot; or &quot;Those pencils are '''black'''&quot;)''
* Jeruk itu &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;jingga&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;That orange is &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;Those oranges are &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''

Notice the difference between the first pattern and the second one:
* The first pattern is ''''(Ini/Itu) + Noun'''', which means ''''This/That is/are Noun''''.
* The second pattern is ''''Noun + (Ini/Itu) + Adjective'''', which means ''''This/That Noun is/are Adjective''''

=== Bentuk Negatif ''(Negative Form)'' ===

There are two words in Indonesian used to indicate negatives:
* Bukan &amp;rarr; Not, referring to nouns, pronouns, or states (it may be easiest to remember the meaning of bukan as &quot;not a&quot;, since only nouns would follow &quot;a&quot; in English)
* Tidak &amp;rarr; Not, referring to adjectives or verbs

In some cases, we can use either ''bukan'' or ''tidak'', but we'll discuss this later.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Ini bukan buku. ''(&quot;This is not a book&quot; or &quot;These are not books&quot;)''
* Ini bukan pensil. ''(&quot;This is not a pencil&quot; or &quot;These are not pencils&quot;)''
* Itu bukan apel. ''(&quot;That is not an apple&quot; or &quot;Those are not apples&quot;)''
* Itu bukan jeruk. ''(&quot;That is not an orange&quot; or &quot;Those are not oranges&quot;)''

Here, we use ''bukan'', because we're negating the nouns. However, look at the following example:

* Ini tidak benar. ''(&quot;This is not right&quot;)''

This time, we are negating the adjective &quot;right&quot;. (Benar = right / correct)

Likewise, look at the following examples:
Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Buku ini tidak &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This book is not &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These books are not &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Apel ini tidak &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hijau&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This apple is not &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These apples are not &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Pensil itu tidak hitam. ''(&quot;That pencil is not black&quot; or &quot;Those pencils not are black&quot;)''
* Jeruk itu tidak &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;jingga&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;That orange is not &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;Those oranges are not &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''

In these examples, we use ''tidak'' because this time we're negating the adjectives.

=== Bentuk Interogatif ''(Interrogative Form)'' ===

The word ''&quot;apa&quot;'' (= ''&quot;what&quot;'') can be used to form questions using ''&quot;ini&quot;'' or ''&quot;itu&quot;''.

* Apa ini?  ''(&quot;What is/are this/these?&quot;)''
* Apa itu?  ''(&quot;What is/are that/those?&quot;)''

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Q: Apa ini?
* A: Ini buku.

You can use ''&quot;apa ini&quot;'' or ''&quot;apa itu&quot;'' to ask what something is called in Indonesian (by pointing to the object).

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | [[Indonesian/Lesson 2| &lt;&lt; Lesson 2: This, That]]  | Lesson 3: Pronouns |[[Indonesian/Lesson 4| Lesson 4: Simple Sentences &gt;&gt;]]
== General Pronoun ==

In Indonesian, both subjective and objective pronouns are the same. Possessive
pronouns are slightly different in informal situations only. Below is the table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! English
! Formal
! Informal
! Informal Possesive
|-
| I ||  Saya    ||  Aku   ||  -ku
|-
| You ||  Anda    ||  Kamu  ||  -mu
|-
| He/She/It ||  Beliau  ||  Dia   ||  -nya
|-
| We (inclusive) ||  Kita    ||  Kita 
| Kita
|-
| We (exclusive) ||  Kami    ||  Kami 
| Kami
|-
| You (Plural) ||  Kalian  ||  Kalian ||  Kalian
|-
| They ||  Mereka  ||  Mereka ||  Mereka
|}

Note that there are two notions of ''&quot;we&quot;'' in Indonesian. If the opposite party is included, then we use ''&quot;kita&quot;''. Otherwise, we use ''&quot;kami&quot;''.

Contoh ''(Example)'':

* Budi: &quot;Wati, ini buku kita.&quot; ''(= Wati, this is our book.)''

Here, Budi speaks to Wati that this book is both Budi's and Wati's book. However, if Budi said, ''&quot;Wati, ini buku kami.&quot;''; it means that this book is Budi's (and probably his other friend's), but not Wati's.

To refer a third person that has already died, He/She/It, when person we are speaking about already passed away and we want to refer to those people with respect, we use another word ''almarhum'' meaning &quot;he&quot; when the he is already died and &quot;he&quot; happens to be a respectable person. For female we use the word ''almarhumah''. This is a rare instance when Bahasa Indonesia is gender specific. This is a loan word from Arabic which literally means: &quot;who was blessed by God.&quot; In this sense, this is actually a euphemism. So we can conclude that words 'almarhum' and 'almarhumah' are purposed to Muslims. The non-Muslim people usually change it with ''''mendiang'''', which is simpler and can be used by both genders.

== Kata Kepunyaan ''(Possessive Pronoun)'' ==

As you probably have noted in the previous example, the position of possessive
pronoun is reversed in Indonesian.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Buku kami. ''(= our book(s))''
* Apel mereka. ''(= their apple(s))''
* Jerukku. ''(= my orange(s))''
* Gelasnya. ''(= his/her/its glass(es))''
* Bolpoinmu. ''(= your pen(s))''
* Coklat saya. ''(= my chocolate(s))''
* Mobil beliau. ''(= his/her/its car)''

In these examples, notice that when using informal possessive of singular person, the suffix is put together with the noun.

Although in spoken Indonesian it is acceptable to say ''&quot;gelas dia&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;gelasnya&quot;'' and ''&quot;bolpen kamu&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;bolpenmu&quot;'', it is incorrect to say ''&quot;jeruk aku&quot;'' to mean ''&quot;my orange&quot;''.

== Kata Kepunyaan #2 ''(Possessive Pronoun Part 2)'' ==

In most languages there is the possibility of both adjective-like posessives &quot;this is &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;my&lt;/font&gt; book&quot; and noun like adjectives &quot;this book is &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;this is &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/font&gt;.&quot; Indonesian doesn't do this exactly like this but does have an equivalent:

# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;ku.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is mine)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;mu.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is yours)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;nya.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is his/hers/its)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; aku.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is mine)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; kami.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is ours)'' (exclusive)
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; kita.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is ours)'' (inclusive)
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; mereka.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is theirs)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; Budi.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is Budi's)''
# Ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;ku.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This is mine)''

Notice that this kind of structure is &quot;bridged&quot; by the word ''&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;/font&gt;&quot;'', which means &quot;to have&quot;. You can then put the appropriate suffix or word to indicate the ownership.

A synonym of ''&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;/font&gt;&quot;'' is ''&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;/font&gt;&quot;''. Hence you can change &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;/font&gt;&quot; with &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;/font&gt;&quot;.

&lt;i&gt;Example:&lt;/i&gt;

# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;ku&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;mu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;nya&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== Contoh ''(Examples)'' ==

Below are some examples that summarise what we've learnt:

# Saya punya buku &lt;font color=&quot;dddd00&quot;&gt;kuning&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= I have a yellow book)''
# Buku saya &lt;font color=&quot;dddd00&quot;&gt;kuning&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= My book is yellow)''.
# Kamu punya bolpen &lt;font color=&quot;0000dd&quot;&gt;biru&lt;/font&gt;, bukan bolpen &lt;b&gt;hitam&lt;/b&gt;. ''(= You have a blue pen, not a black pen)''
# Dia tidak punya pensil &lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;hijau&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= He/she/it doesn't have a green pencil)''
# Budi punya apel &lt;font color=&quot;cc0000&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= Budi has a red apple/red apples)''
# Apel &lt;font color=&quot;cc0000&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt; ini punya Budi. ''(= This red apple is Budi's)''

Note that at the third example we use ''&quot;bukan&quot;'' to deny the noun (i.e. the pen). At the fourth example, we use ''&quot;tidak&quot;'' to deny the ownership, which is considered as a verb (i.e. &quot;doesn't have&quot;). Note also how we can put names in ownership at example five and six with the word ''&quot;punya&quot;''.

== Tenses ==

Basic Indonesian word order is similar to English. Generally, sentences begin with a subject, followed by a verb (also called a predicate), and then an object.

It's good news that Indonesian verbs don't change depending on tense. Indicating the past
or future tense only requires inserting words that indicate the time, in a very regular system.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya makan nasi ''(= I eat rice)''
* Saya telah makan nasi ''(= I ate or have eaten rice)''
* Saya sudah makan nasi ''(= I ate or have eaten rice)''
* Saya akan makan nasi ''(= I will eat rice)''
* Saya sedang makan nasi ''(= I am eating rice)''
* Saya makan nasi kemarin ''(= I ate rice yesterday)''
* Kemarin, saya makan nasi ''(= Yesterday, I ate rice)''

As you noticed in the examples above, the word ''&quot;telah&quot;'' or ''&quot;sudah&quot;''
indicate completed actions, the word ''&quot;akan&quot;'' indicate future actions, and
the word ''&quot;sedang&quot;'' indicate actions in progress. The main verb (i.e. ''&quot;makan&quot;'' = to eat) is left unchanged.

Side note: In English, both cooked and uncooked rice are referred as rice alone. In Indonesian, uncooked rice is called ''beras'' while cooked rice is called ''nasi''. 

Note also that Indonesian has no notions of imperfect tense. Instead, Indonesian uses duration words, such as ''&quot;selama&quot;'' (literally means ''during'' or ''as long as''):

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya sudah belajar Bahasa Indonesia selama dua tahun. ''(= I have studied Indonesian (language) for two years)''
* Selama ini, saya belajar dengan baik. ''(= Until now, I've studied well)''
* Selama dua tahun ini, saya belajar dengan baik. ''(= For the last two years, I've studied well)''
* Selama kamu di sini, saya tidak akan pergi. ''(=As long as you are here, I will not go))''

Don't worry about these &quot;tenses&quot; yet. We'll study it in greater detail later.

=== Adding Emphasis ===

The Indonesian language is very expressive. While basic Indonesian word order matches English, you can scramble up the sentence structure, and the sentence will still have the same underlying meaning. In this regard, Indonesian is somewhat like Latin or Japanese, but without the cases or the particles.
Usually, when a word other than the subject is put at the beginning of a sentence, it becomes the emphasis of the sentence. This is broadly used in spoken
Indonesian.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya sedang makan nasi ''(= I am eating rice, neutral emphasis)''
* Sedang makan nasi saya ''(= emphasis on the progress of eating rice, &quot;I am eating my rice&quot;)''
* Makan nasi sedang saya lakukan ''(= emphasis on eating rice, &quot;Eating rice (is what) I am doing (now)&quot;)''
* Nasi sedang saya makan ''(= emphasis on rice, &quot;Rice (is what) I am eating (now)&quot;)''

Note also that this way of providing emphasis can occur with any &quot;tense&quot; using the same pattern.

Don't be intimidated by this variability in word order. You can always form simple sentences as: '''Subject + Verb + Object'''.

== Cara Pemakaian ''(Usage)'' ==

I plan to structure this book so that for each lesson you will have the corresponding exercise. So, if you have finished [[Indonesian/Lesson 1|lesson 1]], do the exercise 1 before proceeding to [[Indonesian/Lesson 2|lesson 2]], and so forth. This is so that you fully understand the Indonesian.

I understand that it is pretty hard to illustrate simple concepts of Indonesian without knowing anything about it. So, my approach is to illustrate the most important basic components of Indonesian in the basic section. My suggestion is to skim the basic section and grasp a little bit about it and step up to the beginner section so that you can see these components in action.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* 67  =  enam puluh tujuh 
* 111  =  seratus sebelas 
* 2743  =  dua ribu tujuh ratus empat puluh tiga 
* 8015  =  delapan ribu lima belas 
* 17432  =  tujuh belas ribu empat ratus tiga puluh dua 
* 408305  =  empat ratus delapan ribu tiga ratus lima
* 3178856  =  tiga juta seratus tujuh puluh delapan ribu delapan ratus lima puluh enam

== Urutan ''(Series)'' ==

* 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; = pertama
* 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; = kedua (''or'' ke-2)
* 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; = ketiga (''or'' ke-3)
* 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = keempat (''or'' ke-4)
* 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = kelima (''or'' ke-5)
* 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = kesepuluh (''or'' ke-10)
* 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = kesebelas (''or'' ke-11)
* 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; = kedua puluh satu (''or'' ke-21)

As you see, in order to form ordinal numbers in series, you only need to attach the prefix &quot;ke-&quot;, then the number itself. Except for pertama (&quot;1st&quot;), you can spell out the number or just write the digits (like the ones in parentheses).

== Berapa ''(How much)'' ==

To ask about quantities, we use the word ''&quot;berapa&quot;''. For example:
''&quot;Berapa harga X&quot;'' is to ask ''&quot;How much does X cost''&quot;.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Q: Berapa harga buku ini? ''(= How much does this book cost?)''
* A: Lima dolar. ''(= Five dollars)''
* A (alternate): Harga buku ini lima dolar. ''(= This book costs five dollars)''

The word ''&quot;berapa&quot;'' can directly replace the quantity in question. However, you must put a measure word right after it. 

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Q: Kamu punya berapa buah pensil? ''(= How many pencils do you have?)''
* A: Empat. ''(= Four)''
* A (alternate): Saya punya empat buah pensil. ''(= I have four pieces of pencil.)''

The most common measure word is ''&quot;buah&quot;'', which indicates quantity. Coincidentally, this word can also mean ''fruit'' (i.e. apples, oranges, etc). Other common measure words are ''&quot;ekor&quot;'' (for animals; ekor = tail) and ''&quot;orang&quot;'' (for people, orang = person).

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;Interestingly, the word ''biji'' (lit= fruit) is also sometime use to replace ''buah''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The examples below illustrate using measure words:

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Q: Berapa buah pensil kamu punya? ''(= How many pencils do you have?)''
* A: Empat. ''(= Four)''

* Q: Berapa buah apel kamu punya? ''(= How many apples do you have?)''
* A: Tiga. ''(= Three)''

== Contoh Lain ''(Other Examples)'' ==

* Saya punya dua buah buku. ''(= I have two books)''
* Saya punya dua buah buku merah. ''(= I have two red books)''
* Saya tidak punya dua buah buku merah. ''(= I don't have two red books)''

== Angka Lebih Dari 999 ''(Numbers higher than 999)'' ==

In English, to make the number readable, we used to add a comma every three digits. For example, One million and two hundred and fifty-five thousands and three hundred and sixty-four can be written as 1,255,364. However in Indonesian, we insert a dot instead of comma. Hence the same number (Indonesia: ''Satu juta dua ratus lima puluh lima ribu tiga ratus enam puluh empat'') should be written as 1.255.364 . 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
For curious reader, Indonesians use comma (&quot;,&quot;) to indicate decimals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Kata Pembilang - ''Quantification Words'' ==

Indonesian language has no distinction between uncountable and countable nouns. If you want to say that there are more than one of a thing, as a rule of thumb you can repeat the noun using a dash (-) to make it plural. Alternatively you can also put the total number of the thing in front of the noun. 

There is no rule in Indonesian language regarding which nouns should/can be repeated, which nouns should not/cannot, but if we already put some quantification words, we can't do the repetition noun. For example: It is wrong to say '''banyak buku-buku''' - ''lots of books'', instead use either the phrase '''banyak buku''' or '''buku-buku'''

These words are essential to specify indefinite plurals:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #ffd6d6; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Banyak = many / a lot
* Beberapa = some / several
* Sedikit = a little / a few
* Para = some (for a specific group of people)
|}

== Kata Penunjuk Jumlah - Measure Words ==

An example of a measure words is the word &quot;pieces&quot; in &quot;two pieces of paper&quot;. You have seen the word '''buah''' in [[Indonesian/Lessons/Numbers|lesson 5]] to indicate the total of a quantity. The word '''buah''' can be considered as the &quot;universal&quot; measure word because it can fit in so many situations. However, you may want to fine tune it to convey a more precise meaning. For example: in the English language it's more proper to say &quot;two rolls of bread&quot; rather than &quot;two pieces of bread&quot;. This is because the measure word &quot;roll&quot; is more fitting than the word &quot;piece&quot; in this situation. The same thing applies to the Indonesian language.

Below are other common measure words, followed by the noun it measures.

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | [[Indonesian/Lessons/Numbers| &lt;&lt; Lesson 5: Numbers]]  | Lesson 6: Particles |[[Indonesian/Lesson 7| Lesson 7: Introducing Yourself &gt;&gt;]]
== Di ''(In/on/at [place])'' ==

To indicate a place, we use the particle ''di''. It can mean ''in'', ''on'', or ''at''.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Buku saya ada di meja. ''(My book is (in/on/at) [the] table)''
* Mobilmu ada di garasi. ''(Your car is (in/on/at) [the] garage)''

Note the word ''&quot;ada&quot;'', which means ''&quot;to exist&quot;''. It is placed right before the ''di'' particle to indicate existence.

Note also that the particle ''di'' doesn't convey any further detail on how the object is being placed, whether it's in front, inside, etc. To put additional detail, we put a location word after the particle ''di''.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Buku saya ada di atas meja. ''(My book is on [the] table)''
* Mobilmu ada di dalam garasi. ''(Your car is in [the] garage)''

The word ''&quot;atas&quot;'' means ''&quot;top&quot;'' or ''&quot;above&quot;'' and ''&quot;dalam&quot;'' means ''&quot;inside&quot;''. Below is the list of location words you may use:

* Atas = top/above
* Bawah = under/below
* Dalam = inside
* Luar = outside
* Depan = front
* Belakang = behind/back
* Sebelah/Samping = beside
* Sebelah kiri = left side
* Sebelah kanan = right side

In Indonesian, to change the position is quite easy. Like ''Buku saya ada di atas meja'', if you want to change it becomes ''beside'' or ''behind'', you just need to change them into ''Buku saya ada di sebelah/samping meja'' and ''Buku saya ada di belakang meja''. 

Be careful to differentiate between ''di'' as prefix (''awalan'') and ''di'' as showing the place (''kata depan''). Most Indonesian natives forget about this and mistakes are common. If the word ''di'' is followed by a verb, it is a prefix.

Example
* Ia di luar ( ''he is outside'')
* Ia dipukul ( ''he was beaten'' -- pukul = ''beat'')

Indonesian also commonly (and mistakenly) use ''di'' with time, for example ''&quot;di waktu sedih&quot;'' (during sad times). ''Pada'' is the correct proposition for time. Hence, it should be ''&quot;pada waktu sedih&quot;''.

== Pada ''(at [person])'' ==

Although in spoken Indonesian it is acceptable to use ''di'' to indicate the existence of a noun at someone, this is unusual. For example, it is not correct to say: ''&quot;Bukumu ada di Budi&quot;'' to mean &quot;Your book is at Budi&quot;. Rather, you should use the particle ''&quot;pada&quot;'':

&quot;Bukumu ada pada Budi&quot; ''(Your book is at Budi)

This sounds awkward to translate literally. Usually in English, people would say &quot;Budi has your book&quot;.

This preposition is also used for time, for example ''&quot;Pada pukul enam pagi.&quot;'' (At 6 am)

== Ke ''(to [a place])'' ==

The particle ''ke'' is to indicate the notion of ''to a place''. It is often coupled with the word ''&quot;pergi&quot;'', which means ''to go''.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Ibu pergi ke pasar. ''(Mother goes to [the] market)''
* Ayah pergi ke kantor. ''(Father goes to [the] office)''
* Saya pergi ke sekolah. ''(I go to [the] school)''
* Dia pergi ke rumahmu. ''(He/she/it goes to your house)''

In spoken Indonesian, people often omit ''&quot;pergi&quot;'' when the context is clear. So, you'll often hear ''&quot;Ibu ke pasar&quot;'' to mean ''&quot;Mother [goes] to [the] market&quot;''.

== Kepada ''(to [a person])'' ==

Some verbs in English like &quot;to send&quot;, &quot;to give&quot; and so on need the particle &quot;to&quot;, followed by a person. For example: &quot;I give the book to you&quot;. In Indonesian, for this notion of &quot;to&quot;, you cannot use the particle ''ke''. Rather, you'll use the particle ''kepada''.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya memberikan buku ini kepadamu. ''(= I give this book to you)''
* Dia mengirimkan surat ini kepada saya. ''(= He/she sends this letter to me)''

Memberikan = to give&lt;br&gt;
Mengirimkan = to send&lt;br&gt;
Surat = letter&lt;br&gt;

Certainly, in spoken Indonesian, people may violate this rule and use &quot;ke&quot; instead of the proper &quot;kepada&quot;.

== Dari ''(From)'' ==

The particle ''&quot;dari&quot;'' is almost synonymous with ''&quot;from&quot;'' in English. It is to indicate the origin of something.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya datang dari rumah. ''(I come from [the] house)''
* Dia datang dari Amerika. ''(He/she comes from [the] US)''

Not only that ''&quot;dari&quot;'' explains the place origin, but also explains the origin of things. For example:

* Cincin ini terbuat dari emas. ''(This ring is made of gold)''

Cincin = ring&lt;br&gt;
Terbuat = is made&lt;br&gt;
Emas = gold

== Untuk ''(For)'' ==

The particle ''&quot;untuk&quot;'' is almost synonymous with ''&quot;for&quot;''. For example:

* Buku ini untukmu. ''(This book is for you)''
* Pensil ini untuknya. ''(This pencil is for him/her/it)''

It is also used to explain the usage of a thing:

* Pensil ini untuk menulis. ''(This pencil is for writing [things])''

(menulis = write)

----

C should answer &quot;No&quot;.

== Reasoning ==

B is either a knave or a spy.  If B is a spy, then A is truthful and is therefore the knight.

  A - Knight
  B - Spy
  C - Knave

On the other hand, if B is the knave, there are two possibilities:

  A - Spy
  B - Knave
  C - Knight

or

  A - Knight
  B - Knave
  C - Spy

If C is either the knave or the knight, his answer to the question will be &quot;No&quot;, and so the judge will not be able to draw a conclusion.  On the other hand, C can answer &quot;Yes&quot; only if he is the spy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Human civilization in the Americas probably began in the last ice age, when prehistoric hunters crossed a land bridge between the Asian and North American continents. Civilizations in North America, Central America, and South America had different levels of complexity, technology, and cohesiveness.
  
Some of the most powerful and organized societies occurred in South and Central America.  These cultures developed writing, allowing them to spread and dominate. They created some of the largest cities in the Ancient world.

North American cultures were more fragmented and less unified. The tribe was often the major social unit, with exchanges between tribes creating similar societies over vast distances. Tribal dwellings as large as European towns flourished in the rugged desert of southwestern North America.

European-descended historians have difficulty referring to these cultures as a whole, as the native people did not have a unified name for themselves. At first, Europeans called natives &quot;Indians&quot;. This term came from the belief by Christopher Columbus that he had discovered a new passage to India. Despite Amerigo Vespucci ascertaining that the Americas were not actually India, Indian continued to be used as the 'de facto' name for native inhabitants until around 1960. Starting in the 1960s, the term &quot;Native American&quot; was used. Yet this term may be too vague: isn't anyone born in America a Native American? There is also &quot;American Indian&quot;. This is too general a term for a group having little in common other than skin tone and non-European language. In Canada, the term &quot;First People&quot; is used. All these terms for the native people of America show just how diverse Pre-Columbian America was and the disagreement continues between scholars today about this period.

==Early Inhabitants of the Americas==
American history does not begin with Columbus's 1492 arrival. The Americas were settled long before the first European arrived. Civilization began during the last ice age, some 15 to 40 thousand years ago. Huge ice sheets covered the north, so sea levels were much lower, creating a land bridge between Asia and North America. This was the Bering land bridge, a gap in two large ice sheets creating a connection from lands near present day Alaska, through Alberta, and into the continental United States.

[[Image:Beringia_-_late_wisconsin_glaciation.gif|right]]Nomadic Asians following herds of wild game traveled into the continental United States. A characteristic arrow point was found and first described near the present day town of Clovis, NM. Specialized tools and common burial practices are seen in many archaeological sites through North America and into South America.  

The '''Clovis people''' are one of North America's earliest civilizations. It is not clear if the finds represent one unified tribe, or many tribes with a common technology and belief. Their trek across 2000 rugged miles is one of the great feats of pre-history. Their culture disappears dramatically from the archaeological record 12,900 years ago, with widespread speculation about what caused their disappearance. Theories range from the extinction of the mammoth, to sudden environmental changes caused by a comet hitting the earth, to flooding caused by the break of a massive freshwater lake, Lake Agassiz.

There is controversy about Pre-Clovis settlement of North and South America.  Comparisons of culture and linguistics offer evidence of the influence of early America by several different contemporary cultures.  Some genetic and time-dating studies point to the possibility that ancient Americans came from other places and arrived earlier than at the Clovis sites in North America.  Perhaps some ancient settlers to the hemisphere traveled by boat along the seashore, or arrived by boats from the Polynesian islands.

As time went on, many of these first settlers settled down into agricultural societies, complete with domesticated animals.  Groups of people formed stable tribes and developed distinct languages of their own, to the point that more distant relatives could no longer understand them.  Comparative linguistics -- the study of languages of different tribes -- shows fascinating diversity, with similarities between tribes hundreds of miles apart, yet startling differences with neighboring groups.  

At times, tribes would gain regional importance and dominate large areas of America.  Empires rose across the Americas that rivaled the greatest ones in Europe. For their time, some of these empires were highly advanced.

==Early Empires of Mesoamerica==
Meso-American civilizations are among some of the most powerful and advanced civilizations of the ancient world.  Reading and writing were widespread throughout Meso-America, and these civilizations achieved impressive political, artistic, scientific, agricultural, and architectural accomplishments. Many of these civilizations gathered the political and technological resources to build some of the largest, most ornate, and highly populated cities in the ancient world.

The aboriginal Americans settled in the Yucatan peninsulas of present-day Mexico around 10,000 BCE.  By 2000 BCE, the '''Mayan''' culture had evolved into a complex civilization.  The Mayans developed a strong political, artistic and religious identity among the highly populated Yucatan lowlands.  The classic period (250-900 CE) witnessed a rapid growth of the Mayan culture and it gained dominance within the region and influence throughout present-day Mexico.  Large, independent city-states were founded and became the political, religious, and cultural centers for the Mayan people.  

Mayan society was unified not by politics, but by their complex and highly-developed religion. Mayan religion was astrologically based, and supported by careful observations of the sky. The Mayans had a strong grasp of astronomy that rivaled, and, in many ways, exceeded that of concurrent European societies. They developed a very sophisticated system for measuring time, and had a great awareness of the movements in the nighttime sky. Particular significance was attached to the planet Venus, which was particularly bright and appeared in both the late evening and early morning sky. 

Mayan art is also considered one of the most sophisticated and beautiful of the ancient New World.

The Mayan culture saw a decline during the 8th and 9th century.  Although its causes are still the subject of intense scientific speculation, archaeologists see a definite cessation of inscriptions and architectural construction.  The Mayan culture continued as a regional power until its discovery by Spanish conquistadores.  In fact, an independent, non-centralized government allowed the Mayans to strongly resist the Spanish conquest of present-day Mexico.  Mayan culture is preserved today throughout the Yucatan, although many of the inscriptions have been lost.

The '''Aztec''' culture began with the migration of the Mexica people to present-day central Mexico.  The leaders of this group of people created an alliance with the dominant tribes forming the Aztec triple alliance, and created an empire that influenced much of present-day Mexico.

The Aztec confederacy began a campaign of conquest and assimilation.  Outlying lands were inducted into the empire and became part of the complex Aztec society. Local leaders could gain prestige by adopting and adding to the culture of the Aztec civilization.  The Aztecs, in turn, adopted cultural, artistic, and astronomical innovations from its conquered people.   

The heart of Aztec power was economic unity.  Conquered lands paid tribute to the capital city Tenochtitlan, the present-day site of Mexico City.  Rich in tribute, this capital grew in influence, size, and population.  When the Spanish arrived in 1521, it was the fourth largest city in the world (including the once independent city Tlatelco, which was by then a residential suburb) with an estimated population of 212,500 people. It contained  the massive Temple de Mayo (a twin-towered pyramid 197 feet tall), 45 public buildings,  a palace,  two zoos, a botanical garden, and many houses.  Surrounding the city and floating on the shallow flats of Lake Texcoco were enormous ''chinampas'' -- floating garden beds that fed the many thousands of residents of Tenochtitlan. 

While many Meso-American civilizations practiced human sacrifice, none performed it to the scale of the Aztecs.  To the Aztecs, human sacrifice was a necessary appeasement to the gods.  According to their own records, one of the largest slaughters ever performed happened when the great pyramid of Tenochtitlan was reconsecrated in 1487.  The Aztecs reported that they had sacrificed 84,400 prisoners over the course of four days.  

With their arrival at Tenochtitlan, the Spanish would be the downfall of Aztec culture.  Although shocked and impressed by the scale of Tenochtitlan, the display of massive human sacrifice offended European sensitivity, and the abundant displays of gold and silver inflamed their greed.  The Spanish killed the reigning ruler, Montezuma in June 1520 and lay siege to the city, destroying it in 1521, aided by their alliance with a competing tribe, the Tlaxcala.

With the ascension of Manco Capac to emperor of a tribe in the Cuzco area of what is modern-day Peru around 1200 BCE, the '''Incan''' civilization emerged as the largest Pre-Columbian empire in the Americas.
 
Religion was significant in Inca life. The royal family were believed to be descendants of the Inca Sun God. Thus, the emperor had absolute authority, checked only by tradition. Under the emperors, a complex political structure was apparent. The Incan emperor, regional and village leaders, and others were part of an enormous bureaucracy. For every ten people, there was, on average, one official. The organization of the Empire also included a complex transportation infrastructure. To communicate across the entire empire, runners ran from village to village, relaying royal messages.  

In 1438, the ambitious Pachacuti, likely the greatest of the Incan emperors, came to the throne. Pachacuti rebuilt much of the capital city, Cuzco, and the Temple of the Sun. The success of Pachacuti was based upon his brilliant talent for military command (he is sometimes referred as the &quot;Napolean of the Andes&quot;) and an amazing political campaign of integration.  Leaders of regions that he wanted to conquer were bribed with luxury goods and enticed by promises of privilege and importance. As well, the Incans had developed a prestigious educational system which, not incidentally, just happened to extol the benefits of Incan civilization. Thus, much of the expansion throughout South America was peaceful.

At its height of power in the late 15th century, Incan civilization had conquered a vast patchwork of languages, people and cultures from present-day Ecuador, along the whole length of South America, to present-day Argentina.[[Image:Peru_Machu_Picchu_Sunrise.jpg|thumb|250px|Machu Picchu, the &quot;Lost city of the Incas&quot;.]]Cuzco the capital city, was said by the Spanish to be &quot;as fine as any city in Spain&quot;.  Perhaps the most impressive city of the Incan empire, though,  was not its capital, Cuzco, but the city Machu Picchu.

This mountain retreat was built high in the Andes and is sometimes called the &quot;Lost City of the Incas.&quot;  It was intended as a mountain retreat for the leaders of the Incan empire and demonstrates great artistry -- the abundant dry stone walls were entirely built without mortar, and the blocks were cut so carefully that one can't insert a knife-blade between them.

The Spanish discovered the Inca during a civil war of succession and enjoyed great military superiority over the slow siege warfare that the Incan empire had employed against its enemies.  Fueled by greed at the opportunity to plunder another rich civilization, they conquered and executed the Incan emperor.  The Incan empire fell quickly in 1533, but a small resistance force fled to the mountains, waging a guerrilla war of resistance for another 39 years.

The Meso-American Empires were undoubtedly the most powerful and unified civilizations in the new world.  Writings were common in Meso-America and allowed these cultures to spread in power and influence with far more ease than their counterparts in north America.  Each of these civilizations built impressive urban areas and had a complex culture.  They were as 'civilized' as the Spanish who conquered them in the 15th and 16th centuries.

==Early Empires of the Southwest==

Native Americans adapted the arid desert southwest.  A period of relatively wet conditions saw many cultures in the area flourish.  Extensive irrigation was developed that were among the biggest of the ancient world. Elaborate adobe and sandstone buildings were constructed.  Highly ornamental and artistic pottery was created. The unusual weather conditions could not continue forever, though, and gave way, in time, to the more common drought of the area. These dry conditions necessitated a more minimal way of life and, eventually, the elaborate accomplishments of these cultures were abandoned.

One prominent group were the '''Anasazi''', who lived in the present day Northeastern Arizona and surrounding areas.  The geography of this area is that of a flat arid, desert plain, surrounded by small areas of high plateau, called mesas.  Softer rock layers within the mesas eroded to form steep canyons and overhangs along their slopes. 

The Anasazi culture used these cave-like overhangs in the side of steep mesas as shelter from the brief, fierce southwestern storms.  They also found  natural seeps and diverted small streams of snow melt into small plots of maize, squash and beans.  Small seasonal rivers formed beds of natural clays and dried mud.  The Anasazi used hardened dry mud, called adobe, along with sandstone, to form intricate buildings that were sometimes found high in the natural overhangs of the mesas.  The Anasazi people were also skilled at forming the natural clays into pottery. 

Between 900 - 1130 CE a period of relatively wet conditions allowed the Anasazi people to flourish.  Traditional architecture was perfected, pottery became intricate and artistic, turkeys were domesticated, and trade over long distances influenced the entire region.  Following this golden period was the 300 year drought called Great Drought.  The Anasazi culture was stressed and erupted into warfare.  Scientists once believed the entire people vanished, possibly moving great distances to avoid the arid desert.  New research suggests that the Anasazi dispersed; abandoning the intricate buildings and moving towards smaller settlements to utilize the limited water that existed.

Bordering the Anasazi culture in the north, a separate civilization emerged in southern Arizona, called the '''Hohokam'''.  While many native Americans in the southwest used water irrigation on a limited scale,  it was the Hohokam culture that perfected the technology (all without the benefit of modern powered excavating tools).  The ability to divert water into small agricultural plots meant that the Hohokam could live in large agricultural communities of relatively high population density.  This was particularly true in the Gila River valley, where the Gila River was diverted in many places to irrigate large fertile plains and numerous compact towns.  The bigger towns had a 'Great House' at their centers, which was a large Adobe/stone structure.  Some of these structures were four stories in size and probably were used by the managerial or religious elites.  Smaller excavation or pits were enclosed by adobe walls and used as primary residences.  Smaller pit rooms and pits were used for many different functions.

The successful use of irrigation is evident in the extensive Casa Grande village.  Situated between two primary canals, the Casa Grande site has been the focus of nearly 9 decades of archaeological work.  The original town was built around a Great House and incorporated open courtyards and circular plazas.  By the 10th century neighboring settlements had been built to accommodate a large, highly developed region.  The scale of this community can be seen in the results of one excavation of part of it in 1997.  The project identified 247 pit houses, 27 pit rooms, 866 pits, 11 small canals, a ball court, and portions of four adobe walled compounds.  

The Hohokam culture disintegrated when they had difficulty maintaining the canals in the dry conditions of the drought.  Small blockages or collapses of the canal would choke the intricate irrigation networks. Large towns and extensive irrigation canals were abandoned.  The people gave up their cultural way of life and dispersed into neighboring tribes.

==Early Empires of the Mississippi==

Native Americans in the Eastern Continental United States developed mound-building cultures early in North American History.  Groups of native Americans became more stratified as time went on and developed into tribes.  These tribes participated in long networks of trade and cultural exchanges. The importance of trade routes developed urban cities of great influence.

The mound-building people were one of the earliest civilization to emerge in North America. Beginning around 1000 BCE cultures developed that used mounds for religious and burial purposes. These mound-building people are categorized by a series of cultures that describe distinctive artwork and artifacts found in large areas throughout the present-day eastern United States. 

The burial mound was the principle characteristic of all of these societies. These large structures were built by piling baskets of carefully selected earth into a mound. Mounds were pyramid shaped with truncated tops. Sometimes small buildings were built on top of them. Some of these mounds were quite large. The Grave Creek Mound, in the panhandle of present day West Virginia, is nearly 70 feet tall and 300 feet in diameter. Other mounds have even been shown to be oriented in a way that allows for astronomical alignments such as solstices and equinoxes.

Mound building cultures spread out in size and importance. The first culture, the '''Adena''', lived in present-day Southern Ohio and the surrounding areas. The succeeding cultures united to create an impressive trade system that allowed each culture to influence the other. The '''Hopewell''' exchange included groups of people throughout the continental Eastern United States. There began to be considerable social stratification within these people. This organization predates the emergence of the tribe as a socio-political group of people that would dominate later eastern and western native American civilization.

The climax of this civilization was the '''Mississippian''' culture. The mound-building cultures had progressed to social complexity comparable to Post-Roman, Pre-Consolidation Tribal England.  Mounds became numerous and some settlements had large complexes of them. Structures were frequently built on top of the mounds.  Institutional social inequalities existed, such as slavery and human sacrifice.  Cahokia, near the important trade routes of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, became an influential and highly developed community. Extensive trade networks extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

Cahokia was one of the great centers of Mississippian culture and its largest settlement of Mississippi.  The focal point of the settlement was the ceremonial mound called Monk's Mound.  Monk's Mound was the largest mound ever constructed by mound-building people and was nearly 100 feet tall and 900 feet long. Excavation on the top of Monk's Mound has revealed evidence of a large building - perhaps a temple - that could be seen throughout the city. The city was spread out on a large plain south of Monks mound.

[[Image:Monks Mound in July.JPG|thumb|400px|Monk's Mound located at the Cahokia site near Collinsville, Illinois.]]

The city proper contained 120 mounds at a varying distances from the city center.  The mounds were divided into several different types, each of which may have had its own meaning and function.  A circle of posts immediate to Monk's Mound marked a great variety of astronomical alignments.  The city was surrounded by a series of watchtowers and occupied a diamond shape pattern that was nearly 5 miles across.  At its best, the city may have contained as many as 40,000 people making it the largest in  North America.

It is likely the Mississippian culture was dispersed by the onslaught of viral diseases, such as smallpox, which were brought by European explorers.  Urban areas were particularly vulnerable to these diseases, and Cahokia was abandoned in the 1500's.  The dispersal of tribes made it impractical to build or maintain mounds and many were found abandoned by European explorers.

==Contact with European Culture ==
European contact brought immediate changes in many tribes of North America.  One of the most significant changes to all Indian tribes was the introduction of viral diseases and epidemics.  Smallpox was probably the single biggest scourge to hit North America.  Infected contagious Indians spread the plague far inland almost immediately after early encounters with European settlers.  Historians estimate that over 80% of all Native Americans died from diseases soon after first contact.  The effects traumatized many powerful and important cultures.  Urban areas were particularly vulnerable and Native American culture adapted by becoming more isolated, less unified, and with a renewed round of inter-tribal warfare as tribes seized the opportunity to gain resources once owned by rivals. 

On the other hand, Europeans brought invasive plants and animals.  The horse was re-introduced to America (as original paleo-American populations of wild horses from the Bering land bridge were extinct) and quickly adapted to free range on the sprawling great plains.  Tribes of nomadic Native Americans were quick to see the horse's value as an increase in their mobility; allowing them to better adapt to changing conditions and as a valuable asset in inter-tribal warfare. Along with Europeans bringing plants and animals, the Europeans were able to take several plants such as corn back to their native countries. 

== Review Questions ==
1. Give two names for the indigenous peoples living in America, and name the circumstances behind each name.

2. What evidence do we have for the Inca, Mayan, and Aztec cultures? 

3. What in the climate contributed to the rise and fall of the indigenous peoples of South-West North America?

----

Annie - 30&lt;br&gt;
Betty - 51&lt;br&gt;
Carrie - 55&lt;br&gt;
Darla - 46&lt;br&gt;
Eve - 37

== Reasoning ==

=== Symbolic ===

Let the ages and names of Annie, Betty, Carrie, Darla and Eve be A, B, C, D and E.

C says to A, that C = A + 10. If C were younger than A, that would be lying, so C must be older than A. (But still lying.)

We have A &amp;lt; C.

C says to A, that B &amp;lt; D. As C &amp;gt; A, C is lying, so B &amp;gt; D.

We have A &amp;lt; C, D &amp;lt; B.

D says to B, that D = E + 9. As D &amp;lt; B, D is telling the truth, so D &amp;gt; E.

We have A &amp;lt; C, E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B, D = E + 9.

E says to B, that E = A + 7. As E &amp;lt; B, E is telling the truth, so E &amp;gt; A.

We have A &amp;lt; C, A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B, D = E + 9, E = A + 7.

Since D = E + 9 and E = A + 7, D = A + 7 + 9 = A + 16.

We have A &amp;lt; C, A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.

B says to C, that E &amp;lt; C. If B &amp;gt; C then B would be lying, so then E &amp;gt; C, and then A &amp;lt; C &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B. However, C says to D, that C = D &amp;plusmn; 6; since C &lt; D, this gives C = D - 6.  However, we have E = D - 9, which would make E &amp;lt; C, giving a contradiction.  The assumption that B &amp;gt; C is therefore false, so B &amp;lt; C.

We have A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.

A says to B, that B = (17/10)A. As A &amp;lt; B, A is telling the truth.

We have A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, B = (17/10)A, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.

B says to C, that |C - D| = |D - E| &amp;rarr; |C - D| = 9. As B &amp;lt; C, B is telling the truth, so C = D + 9. As D = A + 16, C = A + 16 + 9 &amp;rarr; C = A + 25.

We have A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, B = (17/10)A, C = A + 25, D = A + 16, E = A + 7.

Using D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, we have A + 16 &amp;lt; (17/10)A &amp;lt; A + 25 &amp;rarr; 16 &amp;lt; (7/10)A &amp;lt; 25 &amp;rarr; 160/7 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 250/7 &amp;rarr; 22 + 6/7 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 35 + 5/7. Since B and A must both be whole numbers, and B = (17/10)A &amp;rarr; B - A = (7/10)A, (7/10)A must be a whole number. Hence A must be divisible by 10. The only whole number fitting 22 + 6/7 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 35 + 5/7 is A = 30.

We have A = 30, B = (17/10)A, C = A + 25, D = A + 16, E = A + 7.

Hence A = 30, B = 51, C = 55, D = 46, E = 37.

=== Verbal ===

Carrie tells Annie she's older than her by 10 years.  If Carrie is younger, she's lying, and that's impossible, so Carrie must be older than Annie, just not by 10 years.

'''FACT:''' Carrie is older than Annie (but not by 10 years).

Carrie also lies to (younger) Annie that Betty is younger than Darla.

'''FACT:''' Darla is younger than Betty.

Darla tells the truth to (older) Betty that she's 9 years older than Eve.

'''FACT:''' Darla is 9 years older than Eve.

Eve tells the truth to (older) Betty that she's 7 years older than Annie.

'''FACT:''' Eve is 7 years older than Annie.

Annie tells the truth to (older) Betty that Betty's age is 70% greater than her own.  For Betty's age to be a whole number, Annie's age must be a multiple of 10.  Since Betty is older than Darla, and Darla is 7 + 9 = 16 years older than Annie, that means Betty has to be more than 16 years older than Annie.  The lowest multiple of 7 greater than 16 is 21.

'''FACT:''' Annie is at least 30 years old (and definitely a multiple of 10).

At this point, Betty appears to be the oldest, lying lady.  Let's assume that, and see if it works.

In that case, Carrie is lying to Darla that the difference in their ages is 6 years, but Betty tells the truth to (older) Carrie that the difference between Carrie's age and Darla's is the same as the difference between Darla's and Eve's, namely, 9 years.  Let's test this scenario, assuming Annie's age is 30.  Then we get, from youngest to oldest:

'''TESTING:''' Annie = 30, Eve = 37, Darla = 46, Betty = 51, Carrie = 55

Checking all statements and the age relations shows that this is an answer.  Is this the only answer?

If Annie's age was 40, then Betty's age would be 68, and Carrie's age would be 65, so Carrie would not be the oldest, and that would be a fatal flaw.  If Annie is older than 30, Betty is older than Carrie, and Carrie is not the oldest.  Hence, it must have been the only answer.

----

&quot;Out of the answers 'left' and 'right', which door would the other guard say doesn't lead to freedom, if I asked her?&quot; - The answer will be the door that leads to freedom. Both guards will answer the same.

'''OR similarly'''

&quot;Would the other guard tell me to go through your door to get to freedom?&quot;  If either guard says &quot;Yes,&quot; go through the other guard's door.  If either says &quot;No,&quot; go through her door..
(Here actually a tautology[always true statement] is being asked from the guard. In simple form we are asking the question &quot;Does freedom gate guard lie?&quot;)
[[Category:Puzzles]]

'''OR alternatively'''

Trick question: &quot;If I asked you whether the door you guard is the execution room, would you say yes?&quot; 

If the guard you asked was guarding the freedom room, the lying guard would have said Yes to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, but when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he has to lie and say No to the Trick question. 

If the guard you asked was guarding the freedom room, the true guard would have said No to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, and when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he will truthfully say No to the Trick question.

Thus if it is the freedom door, either guard will give the answer No to the Trick question.

If the guard you asked was guarding the execution room, the lying guard would have said No to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, but when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he has to lie and say Yes to the Trick question. 

If the guard you asked was guarding the freedom room, the true guard would have said Yes to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, and when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he will truthfully say Yes to the Trick question.

Thus if it is the execution door, either guard will give the answer Yes to the Trick question.

Therefore:

If the answer to the trick question by the guard you ask is No - then that guard is guarding the freedom door.

If the answer to the trick question by the guard you ask is Yes - then that guard is guarding the execution door.</text>

The first man saw at most 1 blue hat in front of him, for if he saw 2 he would have said &quot;red&quot; (there are only 2 blue hats).

The second man saw a red hat in front of him, for if he saw a blue hat he would have said &quot;red&quot; (the first man saw at most 1 blue hat).

That's how the last man now knows the 2nd man saw a red hat on him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The man picks up a piece of wood and lights it from the fire on the west end of the island. He then carries it over to set fire to the middle of the island. Fortunately, the wind is hurricane strength, so the fire from the middle only burns the east side of the island.

The man then goes to the east side of the island, where the fire from the west side can't spread, because the east side has already burned down.

The man survives the fire, but dies of starvation, with all the food in the forest burnt.
----
*&lt;b&gt;Comments&lt;/b&gt;
#The puzzle, as stated, does not assert that the &lt;b&gt;entire&lt;/b&gt; island is covered by the forest, but the solution is trivial unless it is.
#In a real fire, the smoke being blown eastward across the island would be as much of a danger to the man as the flames.  (He must have had a source of fresh water on the island to survive... he could dip his shirt in that to use as a gas mask.  He should also lie flat on the ground to try to stay below the smoke.)
#The puzzle does not state anything about the flatness of the island. The presence of hills or canyons would affect the path the fire would take, possibly offering areas of safety due to the fire making its own fire break (a fire break being essentially the solution described above).
#The fire set in the middle of the island would not burn the entire east side of the island, but only a triangular area extending eastward from the point the fire was set. The shape of the triangle would be determined by the balance between the tendency of the fire to burn outward in a circle from where it was started and the force of the wind. This being the case, and with the assertion of hurricane-force winds, the far end of the triangle, where the man would have to stand, might be too narrow to shield him from the heat and smoke.
#Nothing in the puzzle asserts the shape of the island. The entire surface of the island burns only if the island perimeter is convex. If there are concave areas, a peninsula is formed, and the tip of the peninsula would be unscathed. The shape and size of the peninsula would be relevant, per the reasoning above about fire cutting a triangular shape. This solution has the added advantage that the tip of the peninsula would be free of smoke.
##If the island was a circle, which is a convex shape, and the fire burnt in a triangle, not all could burn. If the island was shaped like the concave greek letter &amp;Lambda; (or the roman letter V) and the fire started at the tip, the whole island could burn. Currently, the problem states the whole island would burn without intervention, anyway.
#When one considers that one does not typically find trees on a beach, the man could just make his way to the west beach. The fire and smoke would both travel away from him.  
*um... if the island is circled by cliffs how is he supposed to get to the beach?
#And if cliffs surround the island and he can't get back on, the most obvious question is: ''how did he get on in the first place?''
#*Clearly he crash landed
#Perhaps the man survives the fire by entering the luxurious fire-retardent home, complete with cable television and beer.
#The puzzle doesn't state that the man would die on impact by jumping off the cliff. He could jump off the island and survive the fire.  Most likely he would die of starvation or dehydration, just as he would on the burned out island as stated in the current solution.
*  The man can dig a hole in the ground deep enough to withstand the fire for a few minutes which time would be enough for the fire to recede from his location.
* The man can cut part of the wood and therefore stop it from burning the whole island.

----

Stretch the rubber band, and draw a line along it on the plane.

By stretching the rubber band, while holding the loose end to the nail, you can measure 4cm. By folding it again, you can measure 2cm. Similarly, you can measure 1cm and then 0.5cm. Mark the 0.5cm on the line, and using the last 0,5cm of the rubber band, mark the line you drew at 0.5cm intervals, so you can use it as a ruler.

Draw two circles around the nail, with radius 1.5cm and 2cm. Using 6cm of the rubber band, make a triangle, with a corner touching each circle, and the last corner at the nail. You now have a right angle at the nail.

Which participant in the game know what at which times ?

I've reformulated it a bit, hope it's clearer. Alternatively, I completely misunderstood the question, and have changed the meaning completely. Hope I didn't seem impolite on the solution page, I've seen a similar question before on a different site, just phrased as ambiguously as possible, with a whole forum of people arguing over what it means. [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 15:18, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)

No, in my opinion you did not sound impolite. Any folks from the US here, who now the original version of the game show ? I only now the German version &quot;Geh aufs Ganze&quot; where the &quot;goat&quot; is called &quot;Zonk&quot; and is a stuffed red toy. So, as far as I guess, a &quot;goat&quot; is not a real animal (thus making no sound and rendering the last condition superfluous). And you actually do not have to know in the beginning, what Monty will do in the second round (opening a door with a goat). It does not make any difference, neither for your first nor your second choice. But, you are right, let us be as precise as possible. [[User:doopdoop|doopdoop]]

:As far as I could tell, it may be relevant knowing in advance that whether you choose the door with the prize would not influence what he does after you make the choice, an (unlikely) example, maybe he would open a door with a goat, if you choose the door with the prize (hoping you decide you want the goat more than the prize), otherwise dance around jumping up and down, if you choose a door with a goat (because he gets the prize instead).

      <text xml:space="preserve">The answer is 2, 2 and 9.

The product of their ages is 36, leaving the possibilities

{1,1,36}, {1,2,18}, {1,3,12}, {1,4,9}, {1,6,6}, {2,2,9}, {2,3,6} and {3,3,4}.

Knowing the sum of their ages is not sufficient to determine their ages, eliminating {1,1,36} (38), {1,2,18} (21), {1,3,12} (16), {1,4,9} (14), {2,3,6} (11) and {3,3,4} (10), leaving only

{1,6,6} and {2,2,9}.

Knowing that there exists an eldest daughter eliminates {1,6,6}, leaving only {2,2,9}.

[[Category:Puzzles]]

How does knowing that there exists an eldest daughter eliminate {1,6,6}?  One daughter can be older than another but both have the same age in years.

Hey, questioner, we're going by the same number of years.  We are taking that 
both daughters in the thrown out {1, 6, 6} choice are EXACTLY 6-years-old.</text>

Looking at the last digit, the last digit must be either 0, 1, 5 or 6.

Then looking at the last two digits, the last two digits must be either 00, 01, 25 or 76.

Then looking at the last three digits, the last three digits must be either 000, 001, 625 or 376.

Then looking at the last four digits, the last four digits must be either 0000, 0001, 0625 or 9376.

Out of those, only 9376 is a 4 digit number.

You need 3 weighings.

There are 12 possible places for the fake coin to be and it can either be heavy or light, leaving 24 possibilities. Each weighing can give 3 results. (One side heavier, other side heavier, or both sides equal.) 2 weighings can at most only differentiate between 9 possibilities, therefore 2 or less weighings is ''not'' sufficient.

Label the coins with the symbols &lt;tt&gt;αβγδABCD$£€¤&lt;/tt&gt;. Start at state S00.

 State | Weighings | Pile L | Pile R | if L&lt;R   | if L=R   | if L&gt;R   | Candidates in
 &lt;u&gt;      |    left   |        |        |          |          |          |  αβγδABCD$£€¤&lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S00  |  3        | αβγδ   | ABCD   | goto S01 | goto S02 | goto S03 |  ????????????&lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S01  |  2        | αβC    | Bγδ    | goto S04 | goto S05 | goto S06 |  LLLLHHHH    &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S02  |  2        | αβγ    | $£€    | goto S07 | goto S08 | goto S09 |          ????&lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S03  |  2        | αβC    | Bγδ    | goto S10 | goto S11 | goto S12 |  HHHHLLLL    &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S04  |  1        | α      | β      | α light  | B heavy  | β light  |  LL   H      &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S05  |  1        | A      | D      | D heavy  |  error   | A heavy  |      H  H    &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S06  |  1        | γ      | δ      | γ light  | C heavy  | δ light  |    LL  H     &lt;/u&gt;

 &lt;u&gt; S08  |  1        | α      | ¤      | ¤ light  |  error   | ¤ heavy  |             ?&lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S09  |  1        | $      | £      | $ light  | € light  | £ light  |          LLL &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S10  |  1        | γ      | δ      | δ heavy  | C light  | γ heavy  |    HH  L     &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt; S11  |  1        | A      | D      | A light  |  error   | D light  |      L  L    &lt;/u&gt;
  S12  |  1        | α      | β      | β heavy  | B light  | α heavy  |  HH   L



== Reasoning ==
Since one of the coin is fake, and it can be lighter or heavier, that gives 2 X 12 = 24 possible answers. Also notice that each weighing can have 3 possible outcomes (left lighter, right lighter, equal), and with 3 weighting there are 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 27 possible outcome. Because 27 &gt; 24, it is possible(although not certainly) to have a solution.
=== First weighing ===
Suppose we put x coins on both side of the weigh, we want to ensure that no matter what the outcome is, the remaining case still satisfy the condition of possible outcomes &gt; possible answers, otherwise the plan fails.
In case the result is equal, only the coins not on weigh can be faked, since we don't know yet whether it is lighter or heavier, that leaves 2(12-2x) possible answers. With 2 weighing lefts, there are 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 possible outcomes. Hence 2(12-2x)&lt;9.
When one side is lighter, it can be that one of the coins on the lighter side is lighter, or one of the coins on the heavier side is heavier, which leaves 2x possible answers. Hence we have 2x&lt;9.
Solving the equation, we get x=4.

There is a prior 1/3 chance of the door you picked being the door with the prize, and a 2/3 chance of a different door being the door with the prize.

Therefore, if you want the prize, it is better to switch, and if you want a nice goat, it is better to stick with the door you chose.

== Reasoning ==
There are three doors: the door you first chose, the door that Monty opened, and the third door. Because there are two doors left, one with the prize, then one might want to believe that there is a 1/2 chance of obtaining the prize either way.

However, before Monty opened any door, there was a 1/3 chance that the door contained the prize. When Monty opens a different door, you learn nothing about the door that you first chose. Thus, the chance of the door you first chose containing the prize remains 1/3, not 1/2.

However, when Monty opens a door with the goat, the probability of that door containing the prize drops to 0. As the probabilities must sum to 1, and the probability of a prize at the door you first chose remains 1/3, the probability of a prize at the third door rises to 2/3. This rise in probability results only because you learned that Monty decided not to open that particular door.

== Calculations ==
Let &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; be the door you first picked; let &lt;math&gt;D_o&lt;/math&gt; be the door which Monty opened; let &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; be the third and remaining door. &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a car or other prize and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is any goat. Suppose you choose the third door &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt;, then what is the probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; that this door contains the prize?

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
p &amp; = &amp; P(D_r = C | D_o = G)\\
  &amp; = &amp; P(D_r = C, D_p = C | D_o = G) + P(D_r = C, D_p = G | D_o = G)\\
  &amp; = &amp; P(D_r = C | D_p = C, D_o = G) P(D_p = C | D_o = G)\\
  &amp;   &amp; + P(D_r = C | D_p = G, D_o = G) P(D_p = G | D_o = G)\\
  &amp; = &amp; \underbrace{P(D_r = C | D_p = C, D_o = G)}_{=0}
        \underbrace{P(D_p = C)}_{=\frac{1}{3}}\\
  &amp;   &amp; + \underbrace{P(D_r = C | D_p = G, D_o = G)}_{=1}
          \underbrace{P(D_p = G)}_{=\frac{2}{3}}\\
  &amp; = &amp; 0 * \frac{1}{3} + 1 * \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Line-by-line, these equations state:
# &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the probability that your door &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; contains a goat on condition that Monty opens a door with a goat.
# We partition &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; into two cases, one where the door you first picked &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; has a prize &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, and one where it has a goat &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Now &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that both &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; have prizes on condition that Monty reveals a goat, plus the probability that &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; has a prize and &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; has a goat, on condition that Monty reveals goat.
# Using the formula &lt;math&gt;P(A, B) = P(A | B) P(B)&lt;/math&gt;, we state for the second partition that the probability of &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; having a prize and &lt;math&gt;P_p&lt;/math&gt; having a goat, on condition that Monty reveals a goat, is equal to the probability of &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; having a prize on condition that both other doors have goats, times the probability that that &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; has a goat on condition that Monty reveals a goat. We act likewise for the first partition.
# Monty ''always'' reveals a goat, and never a prize, so &lt;math&gt;D_o = G&lt;/math&gt; is a condition that is always true. We remove that condition from the equations. We then make some substitutions: the probability of door &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; (or any door) is 1/3 for a prize, and 2/3 for a goat. We know that door &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; cannot contain a prize if door &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; already has it, so that probability is 0. But if doors &lt;math&gt;D_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_o&lt;/math&gt; both contain goats, then &lt;math&gt;D_r&lt;/math&gt; must contain the prize for probability one.
# We calculate zero times 1/3 plus one times 2/3, giving &lt;math&gt;p = \frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Intuitively this means that in 2/3 of the cases we initially pick a goat and the entertainer shows us where the car is by revealing the other goat. Only in 1/3 of the cases we picked the car initially and by changing our decision we pick a goat.

You have 6 unit length matchsticks, and you urgently need to make 4 triangles with unit length sides. You can't use anything except matchsticks to make the triangles, and the matchsticks are indestructable and non-replicable. How do you solve the dilemma?

== Linking to other pages ==
* Are people happy with the fact that this page is just a page of links to other pages?
** It doesn't seem very book-like to me.
** It seems that the amount of content we have here would easily fit on one page at the moment, and 
** if it doesn't perhaps it could be broken down into larger conceptual topics rather than individual theorems. If other people agree with this, I don't mind doing the work to restructure it myself.
--[[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 09:26, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

&lt;small&gt;:Hi, Fishpi. Seeing others working on the same book is always nice.

:* Issue 1: Should the index for theorems for groups be entirely on this page
::* I seem to agree with you that some of the links should be moved to the page &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;.
::* The theorems seems too small to be moved to &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;
::* I feel moving links to whole sections like [&quot;Group&quot; and its theorem (cancellations...)], [&quot;Subgroup&quot; and its theorems] to &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot; might be a good idea.

:* Issue 2: one theorem, one page?
::* For me, I think this book need not to be like a book in print and hope that smaller sections can encourage readers to read the whole book
::* Using more pages online would not waste real paper. Unlike real paper books, we can use more pages.
::* I feel learning step by step on many pages is less terrifying than to learn everything on a single page 
::* Beginners like me might &lt;font color = Purple&gt;~ scream in terror ~&lt;/font&gt; If they see a Big page (like the [[Abstract_Algebra/Groups/Older_Version |Older Version]]).
::* New contents will all cram into a single page when this page grows, if no one try to subdivide it at the beginning. In a moment, people will again see a Big page (I have confidence that many people will work on this book).

: Is that good for our readers?&lt;/small&gt;

--[[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 15:12, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

::I'd say the most important thing is that we have good content, so I don't mean to be dictatorial about how it is laid out. I'm new to the Wikibooks project myself, and I've been trying to get used to how things are done round here. My main interest in Wikibooks is in producing books that can be read on an e-book reader or similar, so I tend to favour a structure with fewer links.

::I see your point about people being scared by a page with lots of theorems on it, but there is one advantage to laying things out on one page, which is that the reader can easily skip backwards and forwards as they read down the page (if results of earlier theorems are used in proving later theorems).

::I say we focus on producing good quality content at the moment and don't worry about changing the structure, but I'd be interested to hear what other people have to say. [[User:Fishpi|Fishpi]] ([[User talk:Fishpi|talk]]) 17:36, 18 July 2010 (UTC)


::: I agree that many pages means a lot of distracting flipping or clicking even if the pages are cross-linked.
::: Too few pages means a lot of scrolling and less selectivity in reading.
::: the book should find a balance on amount of content on a page.[[User:Arydye001|Arydye001]] ([[User talk:Arydye001|talk]]) 17:51, 18 July 2010 (UTC)

What if you lift the requirement to determine whether the coin is heavier or lighter? I can solve the pullzle with 13 coins then, but no more. Funny, especially considering that number of possible outcomes drops from 24 to 12 (with 12 coins). --[[Special:Contributions/194.190.194.74|194.190.194.74]] ([[User talk:194.190.194.74|talk]]) 08:35, 28 June 2010 (UTC)</text>

== More confusing ==

last man sees
either 2 Reds or 1R+1B in both the cases he is not sure about its hats colour So he says dont know
man position        red         blue    case
3                    2           0        1
3                    1           1        2
case 1: second must see blue and confuse about its color
case 2: second must see red  and confuse about its color

so how can first  man determine its color??</text>

----

A man was sentenced to death, but the king wanted to give him a last chance.  He asked the man to choose from
one of the three knights that were there. One of the knights was the Knight of Life, and he always told the
truth.  The second Knight was the Knight of Death, and he always told lies.  The third knight was the 
Knight of the Dungeon.  He sometimes lied and sometimes told the truth.  If the man chose the 
Knight of Death, he would be executed before sunset.  If he chose the Knight of Life, he would be 
acquitted and set free right away.  If he chose the Knight of the Dungeon, he would spend the rest 
of his life imprisoned in the Dungeon.  The man was allowed to ask the three knights one question each.  

Thus, he asked the fat knight, &quot;What is the name of this tall knight?&quot;  The reply was, 
&quot;He is the Knight of Life.&quot;  He asked the small knight, &quot;What is the name of this tall knight?&quot; 
The reply was, &quot;He is the Knight of Death.&quot;  Then he asked the tall knight, &quot;Who are you?&quot; 
&quot;I am the Knight of the Dungeon&quot; was the reply. After that, the man was able to correctly choose 
the Knight of Life, and was set free immediately.  

''Who is the Knight of Life, and who are the other two knights?''

----

The small knight is the Knight of Life. The fat knight is the Knight of the Dungeon. The tall knight is the Knight of Death.

== Reasoning ==
The tall knight is not the Knight of the Dungeon, since if he were neither of the other knights could be the Knight of Life. Since he lied, he is not the Knight of Life. Therefore, the tall knight is the Knight of Death.  The small knight must then be the Knight of Life, leaving the fat knight as the Knight of the Dungeon.

----
Provided the fat knight tells the truth he can not be the Knight of Life as he is pointing out the tall knight as Knight of Life. The answer of the tall knight contradicts the answer of the fat knight. Therefore, the fat knight was lying. The tall knight can not be the Knight of Life, because he would have said so when directly asked, who he is. We can conclude that the small knight is the Knight of Life and he is pointing out the tall Knight as Knight of Death as he is always telling the truth. The last job positon left for the fat knight is the Knight of Dungeon.

The convict can be happy that the tall knight did not answer: 'Yes, I am the Knight of Life'. In this context, it would have been possible and would have left our convict very unfortunate, because his chance to find the Knight of Life would have been reduced by 50%

----
A better tactic would be to ask each Knight: &quot;If I asked you who the Knight of Life was, whom might you identify?&quot; The Knight of Life would correctly identify himself. If asked &quot;Who is the Knight of Life?&quot; the Knight of Death would incorrectly identify either himself or the Knight of the Dungeon. Hence, when asked how he might respond, he would lie again, and state that he would have identified the correct Knight of Life (double negative). The Knight of the Dungeon is the unknown quantity, but when at least two Knights agree on someone, that is the correct identification.

----
Unfortunately not foolproof, as if he would have identified the Knight of the Dungeon for his first lie, he could then pick to instead identify the Knight of Death for his second lie.

Python has distributions available for Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, BSD, web browser environments (NCLab, Sage) and many other platforms.  There are currently three major implementations: the standard implementation written in C, Jython written in Java, and IronPython written in C# for the .NET environment. There are two common versions currently in use: 2.x and 3.x. This book describes primarily version 2, but does at times reference changes in version 3.

----
Aaron - green pepper, onions and sausage&lt;br /&gt;
Betty - green pepper, mushrooms and onions&lt;br /&gt;
Charlie - mushrooms, pepperoni and sausage&lt;br /&gt;
Debbie - green pepper, pepperoni and sausage&lt;br /&gt;
Eric - mushrooms, onions and pepperoni&lt;br /&gt;

== Reasoning ==

We are informed that B and D had green pepper, B and C had mushrooms, D and E had pepperoni and A and C had sausage, all marked with a Y.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep |   | Y |   | Y |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms |   | Y | Y |   |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    |   |   |   |   |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni |   |   |   | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y |   | Y |   |

We are also informed that the pairs B and D, B and C, D and E, and A and C, didn't share anything, except what is already marked with a Y. This eliminates the possibilities marked with an N.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep |   | Y | N | Y | N &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms | N | Y | Y | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    |   |   |   |   |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni |   | N |   | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y | N | Y |   |

Knowing everyone had 3 toppings allows us to place another Y.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep |   | Y | N | Y | N &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms | N | Y | Y | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    |   | Y |   |   |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni |   | N |   | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y | N | Y |   |

And we know B didn't share with C or D.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep |   | Y | N | Y | N &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms | N | Y | Y | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    |   | Y | N | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni |   | N |   | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y | N | Y |   |

Allowing us to place 2 more Ys.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep |   | Y | N | Y | N &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms | N | Y | Y | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    |   | Y | N | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni |   | N | Y | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y | N | Y | Y |

D didn't share with E, A didn't share with C.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep |   | Y | N | Y | N &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms | N | Y | Y | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    |   | Y | N | N |   &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni | N | N | Y | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y | N | Y | Y | N

This allows us to place the remaining 4 Ys.

 &lt;u&gt;          | A | B | C | D | E &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Green Pep | Y | Y | N | Y | N &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Mushrooms | N | Y | Y | N | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Onions    | Y | Y | N | N | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 &lt;u&gt;Pepperoni | N | N | Y | Y | Y &lt;/u&gt;
 Sausage   | Y | N | Y | Y | N

Surprisingly, no one chose green pepper, onions and pepperoni.

&lt;b&gt;Gmasters2:&lt;/b&gt; The outline of this book is a great start! Networking is very difficult to teach to high school students in the vocational setting because of the high readability level of traditional textbooks. Further compounding the teaching of networking to high school students in the voc-tech high school is the learning style of many of the students. I teach networking in a voc-tech high school where the students are in networking 3 hours a day, 5 days a week.

The ideal curriculum is certification-based, meaning that the competencies taught meet the requirements set forth by national/international certification bodies, such as CompTIA and others. This is critical as the goal of the voc-tech high shcool is twofold: 1) prepare students for employment upon course completion, and 2) serve as a link to more advanced training at the community college or university level.

Currently, I am using a commercially-produced curriculum produced by Course Technologies that provides training in networking qualifying the students to sit for the CompTIA i-Net+ and Network+ certifications. I also teach Linux to prepare students for the CompTIA Linux+ certification.

The thrust of the programs is lab-based. Students today demand interactive texts and the Internet is perhaps the best way to deliver the material. The only downsides to commercial programs are that they are not always &quot;chunked&quot; into modules that lend themselves to high school students.

I'm willing to submit a course outline that could form the basis of a full-fledged i-Net+ high school curriculum.

&lt;b&gt;Guest:&lt;/b&gt; What is the difference between this project and the wikipedia? Should we copy definitions of all of these net services from the wikipedia as a starting point? In what way will we need to edit that content to make it more &quot;textbook&quot; like?

:Add exercises, questions, don't interlink everything... [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 14:21, 31 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:''What is the difference between this project and the wikipedia?'' - exactly! As written, this page is far too technical and un-interesting for students - it is basically a wikipedia definition. ''don't interlink everything'' - exactly. I have removed the stupid year links for a start. -[[User:Drstuey|Drstuey]] 00:33, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)

&lt;b&gt;[User:PbS]:&lt;/b&gt; Ok so I added some stuff to VNC, and SSH.  Is this kind of what you guys are looking for? [[User:PbS|PbS]] 21:18, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)

----

A major luxury car company has three outlets on the east coast (in New York, Boston, and Miami)
and two outlets on the west coast (in Los Angeles and San Francisco). The sales in Los Angeles were
one quarter of the total sales plus one car. The sales in New York were one quarter of
the '''rest''' (not counting the cars sold in L.A.) plus one car. The sales in San Francisco were
one quarter of the rest (not counting L.A., N.Y.) plus one car. And the sales in Boston were one quarter of the rest
(not counting L.A., N.Y., S.F.) plus one car. The balance so far showed that L.A. and San Francisco 
sold 100 cars more than N.Y. and Boston. However, with the remaining cars sold in Miami it is likely that
the total sales of the east coast will be greater than the total sales of the west coast.

''How many cars were sold in each city?''

----

Here is a problem; you are commissioned to '''connecting utilities''' to the three houses A, B, and C below. The utilities are G for gas, W for water, and E for electricity.

      /-\'      /-\'      /-\'
      |A|       |B|       |C|
     -----     -----     -----


      [G]       [W]       [E]

You must connect each house to each utility without the connections crossing at all.

----
This problem can be analyzed using [[Discrete Mathematics/Graph theory|graph theory]]. 

The problem is essentially showing that the bipartite graph K&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; is planar. However, ''Kuratowski&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s theorem'' tells us that this graph must ''not'' be planar.

Essentially, there is no solution and the required construction ''cannot'' be done! Sorry! :)

However, if we look at where the three houses and utilities are on a ''non-planar'' surface, such as a ''torus'' (or doughnut), we obtain some topological niceties that allow us to solve this problem. 

Here is an example of one solution. Lines moving off the torus and looping around are signified with a V.

   \    | |  |    |      /  |     
  ==V===V=V==V====V=====V===V======
  : |   |  \  \   |    /    |     :
  : |  /-\' | |  /-\'  |   /-\'   :
  : |  |A|  | |  |B|   |   |C|    :
  : | ----- | | -----  |  -----   :
  : |__/ |  |  \_| |___/   | |    :
  :      |   \____________/  |    :
  :      \______     ________/    :
  :             \   /             :
  :              | |              :
  :    [G]---\   [W]       [E]    :
  :     | \  |    |       / | \   :
  ======V=V==V=====V=====V==V==V=== 
        | |  |    |     /   |   \


Here is a picture with forks, essentially equivalent to parallel  connections
[[Image:UtilitiesS.png]]
----
The solution usually given to this puzzle depends upon the fact that the puzzle, as stated, does not prohibit one of the connections going &lt;b&gt;under&lt;/b&gt; a house (for example, the gas connection for A is routed G-&gt;pass under B-&gt;A).  This appears to be topologically equivalent to the above(?).

There exists a difference between Dominica and the Dominican Republic. The Republic is a part of the island of Hispaniola, the latter is a separate island. Thus, it would be incorrect to call &quot;Dominica&quot; the &quot;la République dominicaine,&quot; as that title would go to the Dominican Republic.

*Co to jest? / ''tso to yest'' / - What is it/this?

This question is used to ask about things/objects and refers mostly to both plural and singular, although the answers vary depending on the number:

* To jest ... / ''to yest'' / &gt; This is...
* To są .../ ''to sõ'' / &gt; These/Those are...

eg. 
    &quot; - Co to jest?&quot;
    &quot; - To jest książka.&quot; / ''to yest kshõshka'' / &gt; This is a book.

    &quot; - Co to jest?&quot;
    &quot; - To są książki.&quot; / ''to sõ kshõshki'' / &gt; These are (some) books.

To get information about a person, you need to use &quot;kto?&quot; / who? /:
* Kto to jest? &gt; Who is it?

The possible answers are:
* To jest...- in singular
* To są...- in plural

eg. 
    &quot; - Kto to jest?&quot;
    &quot; - To jest człowiek.&quot; /''to yest chwovyek''/ This is a man/human.
    &quot; - Kto to jest?&quot;
    &quot; - To są ludzie.&quot; /''to sõ looje''/ These are people.

Polish pronunciation is rather regular. Once you learn the rules, you should be able to guess how a word is pronounced and get it more or less right even if you've never heard it before (unlike English which is rather unpredictable).

Vowels are pronounced similar to their counterparts in most other European languages (not English though) but note, there are no long vowels.

Stress is almost always on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable.&lt;ref name=&quot;stress&quot;&gt;As noted above, stress is almost always on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable. The exceptions are:&lt;br&gt;
* words with a [[Wikipedia:Conditional mood|conditional]] ending. Here you need to momentarily ignore the ending (which always starts with &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''by'''&lt;/font&gt;), then find the penult: 
** verbs: &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;''chci'''a'''łabym, rob'''i'''libyśmy''&lt;/font&gt;
** other words: &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;''ż'''e'''byście''&lt;/font&gt;
* a very small number of foreign loanwords: &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;''matem'''a'''tyka'', ''gram'''a'''tyka''&lt;/font&gt;. However, most loanwords have stress on the penult.
* verbs in the past tense using the endings &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''-śmy'''&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''-ście'''&lt;/font&gt; (1st and 2nd person plural). Here ante-penultimate stress is more correct. However, some Poles have a tendency to put stress on the penult.[http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~dominika/icphs_1002.pdf] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

('''b d f h k l m n p t z''' are pronounced as you'd expect them to be.)

* In most cases, vowels are pronounced separately, for example, &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;st'''oi''', m'''oi''', tw'''oi''', n'''au'''czyć, z'''au'''fać&lt;/font&gt;, {{audio|Pl-doić.ogg|d'''oi'''ć|help=no}} (''to milk''), {{audio|Pl-Ukraina.ogg|Ukr'''ai'''na|help=no}} (''Ukraine''), {{audio|Pl-Zaolzie.ogg|Z'''ao'''lzie|help=no}} (name of region), {{audio|Pl-ateista.ogg|at'''ei'''sta|help=no}} (''atheist'') 
**The main exception are vowel combos beginning with &quot;i&quot;. As explained above, &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;n'''ie'''bo&lt;/font&gt; is pronounced &quot;njebo&quot;, not &quot;ni-ebo&quot;. Other examples: {{audio|Pl-pięknie.ogg|pięknie|help=no}} (''beautifully''), {{audio|Pl-pamiętać.ogg|pamiętać|help=no}} (''to remember''), {{audio|Pl-bieg.ogg|bieg|help=no}} (''run'').
**Vowel combos right at the beginning of a word are typically pronounced as a diphthong (these are generally loanwords). For example, {{audio|Pl-Augustyn.ogg|'''Au'''gustyn|help=no}} (personal name), {{audio|Pl-autograf.ogg|'''au'''tograf|help=no}} (''autograph''), {{audio|pl-Europa.ogg|'''Eu'''ropa|help=no}} (''Europe''). 

* If you don't know how to pronounce hard/soft pairs ( {{audio|Pl-ciecz.ogg|'''c'''ie'''cz'''|help=no}} (''liquid'') ) you can use the same form and you will usually be understood. '''Note:''' While the rule seems to be effective in most cases, the word ''ciecz'' might not be the best example for it. If you end up pronouncing it so that is sounds similar to ''cieć'' (pronounced &quot;ćeć&quot;, colloq. janitor), you may get funny looks, especially from older speakers (due to the humorous context it had in the old comedy series ''Alternatywy 4'').

* Doubled consonants are pronounced individually or lengthened, for example, {{audio|Pl-codziennie.ogg|codzie'''nn'''ie|help=no}} (''daily''), {{audio|Pl-chłonny.ogg|chło'''nn'''y|help=no}} (''receptive''), &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''le''kk''i'''&lt;/font&gt; (light), &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''o''dd''ech'''&lt;/font&gt; (breath), &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''dzie''nn''ik'''&lt;/font&gt; (daily newspaper), &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''''zz''a'''&lt;/font&gt; (from beyond, behind), &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''gre''cc''y'''&lt;/font&gt; (&quot;Greek&quot;, masculine, plural, nominative adjective), or &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''''ss''ak'''&lt;/font&gt; (mammal). 

* You may also notice something called [[Wikipedia:Final obstruent devoicing|final devoicing]], for example:&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''chodź'''&lt;/font&gt; (''come!'') sounds like &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''choć'''&lt;/font&gt; (''although'') : {{audio|Pl-bądź.ogg|bą'''dź'''|help=no}} (''be {imperative}'')
**final &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''ż'''&lt;/font&gt; sounds more like &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''sz'''&lt;/font&gt; : {{audio|Pl-gdyż.ogg|gdy'''ż'''|help=no}} (''because, since''), {{audio|Pl-chociaż.ogg|chocia'''ż'''|help=no}} (''although'')
**final &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt; '''b'''&lt;/font&gt; → p : {{audio|Pl-sposób.ogg|sposó'''b'''|help=no}} (''method'') 
**final &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''g'''&lt;/font&gt; → k : {{audio|Pl-pociąg.ogg|po'''cią'''g|help=no}} (''train'') 
**final &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''d'''&lt;/font&gt; → t : {{audio|Pl-błąd.ogg|błą'''d'''|help=no}} (''error''), {{audio|Pl-stamtąd.ogg|stamtą'''d'''|help=no}} (''from over there'')
**final &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''w'''&lt;/font&gt; → f : {{audio|Pl-powiew.ogg|powie'''w'''|help=no}} (''puff''), {{audio|pl-pierwszy.ogg|pier'''w'''szy|help=no}} (''first'')
**final &lt;font color=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;'''z'''&lt;/font&gt; → s : {{audio|Pl-rozsądnie.ogg|ro'''z'''sądnie|help=no}} (''sensibly'')
Devoicing is not something you need to focus on but you should be aware of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depending on the classification chosen, there are either three or five genders in Polish:
* masculine (''męski''):
** masculine personal (''męski osobowy'')
** masculine animate (''męski nieosobowy żywotny'')
** masculine inanimate (''męski nieosobowy nieżywotny'')
* feminine (''żeński'')
* neuter (''nijaki'')

In plural ''męskoosobowy'' (masculine-personal) and ''niemęskoosobowy'' (non-masculine-personal) are used for masculine personal and the remaining ones respectively.

Unlike German, and more like Italian, it is usually possible to find out gender by looking at the noun ending and the meaning of the noun.
* Nouns that end in '''-a''' are usually feminine.
** Exceptions include words that end in '''-ista''' which mean followers of some ideology (like ''komunista'', communist) - they are person-masculine
** And words that end in '''-awca'''/'''-owca''' and describe professions (like ''sprzedawca'', salesman; ''kierowca'', driver) that are also person-masculine
** One particularly annoying word is &quot;mężczyzna&quot; which means adult male person - obviously person-masculine.
** Some other masculine words, like &quot;tata&quot; (dad), &quot;poeta&quot; (poet), &quot;sędzia&quot; (judge).
** Some words that end in a consonant are feminine, eg. ''gałąź'' (branch), ''jesień'' (autumn), ''łódź'' (boat or a Polish city), ''myśl'' (thought), ''noc'' (night), ''podróż'' (journey), ''pomoc'' (help),  ''postać'' (figure), ''północ'' (north and midnight), ''rzecz'' (thing), ''sól'' (salt), ''twarz'' (face), and ''wieś'' (countryside).
** Their declension is quite similar to declension of feminine nouns that end in &quot;-a&quot;.
* Nouns that end in '''-ść''' are usually feminine.
** They are often abstract nouns, like ''miłość'' (love, from adjective ''miły'', nice, old Polish &quot;loved&quot;) and ''wysokość'' (height, from adjective ''wysoki'', high)
* Nouns that end in '''-o''', '''-e''', '''-ę''' or '''-um''' are usually neuter.
** Examples: ''dziecko'' (child), ''zawiniątko'' (package), ''jedzenie'' (food), ''wyjście'' (departure, exit, solution), ''zwierzę'' (animal), ''muzeum'' (museum). UWAGA: Some nouns that end in '''-e''' are plural and require plural verbs, eg. ''grabie'' (rake), ''Katowice'', ''nożyce'' (scissors), ''skrzypce'' (violin), ''spodnie'' (pants), and ''szczypce'' (pliers).  
* Most other nouns that end in a consonant are masculine, and their exact gender depends on their meaning. The most usual exceptions are nouns that are animate-masculine which aren't really animate, especially in the spoken language.
* Nouns that end in '''-i''' or '''-u''' in nominative singular are rare and are mostly of foreign origin. Native Polish words ending in '''-i''' are feminine, like ''gospodyni'' (hostess or farmer's wife) or ''pani'' (lady). UWAGA: Some nouns that end in '''-i''' are plural and require plural verbs, eg. ''drzwi'' (door), ''Helsinki'', ''nożyczki'' (scissors), and ''obcęgi'' (tongs).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Intro to oxidation reactions==
'''Oxidation reactions involve electron loss in the moeity of interest. ''' When iron rusts, iron atoms lose electrons to oxygen molecules, and is said to undergo [[w:oxidation|oxidation]]. 

==Ozonolysis==
This is one of the simplest and easiest reaction mechanisms to learn. In ozonolysis, a carbon-carbon double bond is split in two by reaction with [[w:Ozone|ozone]]. The two products, which can be [[w:aldehyde|aldehydes]] or [[w:ketone|ketones]], each have one oxygen atom double bonded to each of the two carbons that had made up the double bond. The ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) cuts right thru the carbon-carbon double bond and leaves oxygens double bonded to the two newly severed ends.

|}

==Osmylation==
In this reaction, a carbon-carbon double bond turns into a single bond with one hydroxy group attached to each of the two carbons.

When heated, this product splits into two ketones (each of the two carbons ends up double bonded to the oxygen in the hydroxy group).
==Epoxidation (peroxidation)==
This reaction uses [[w:Peroxide|peroxides]] (an oxide with an extra linked oxygen) to produce [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Epoxide|epoxides]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">Combustion is the simplest and most basic organic reaction, so simple that it is often overlooked or taken for granted in organic chemistry texts and classes.

&lt;H2&gt;Combustion&lt;/H2&gt;

Hydrocarbon + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Combustion is the breakdown of a compound in combination with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water. Water and carbon dioxide are both very stable and low-energy, and the atoms that make up these molecules go to form them releasing energy. This energy is heat and light that is the source for campfires and internal combustion engines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The result of hydrogenation reactions is to increase the number of hydrogens on a molecule. The recipient molecule is typically an alkene whose double bond is reduced by the addition of a hydrogen to each of the two carbons.

[[Image:Alkene_to_alkane.png]]

The mechanism of this reaction is usually through a catalyst, such as Nickel, Platinum (used in PtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, otherwise known as &lt;i&gt;Adams' Catalyst&lt;/i&gt; after Roger Adams) or Palladium (Pd) that is mixed onto an inert material like charcoal (sometimes referred to as Palladium on carbon). The reaction takes place not within a solution but actually specifically on the surface of the catalyst.

First the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is absorbed onto the catalyst surface. 

The Alkene forms a complex with the catalyst surface due to the vacancy of the orbital on the metal interacting with the filled &amp;pi; orbital. Thus we have a structure that looks somewhat like this:

[[Image:alkenecatalystcomplex.png|Alkene reduction through a catalyst - The alkene and H2 are both adsorbed to the surface]]

Once the complex is formed the hydrogen is able to apply itself to the double bond twice and then the final product is fully saturated and floats away from the catalyst, thus regenerating it.

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | Why Learn Indonesian? |[[How to use this Indonesian Wikibook| How to use this Indonesian Wikibook &gt;&gt;]]

== Why Learn Indonesian ==

Hi, welcome to this Indonesian tutorial.

You might be wondering why on earth you should learn Indonesian. Allow me to persuade you.

=== Demographic Reasons ===
Studying Indonesian means you can communicate with more than 210 million Indonesians, only a small percentage of whom are able to speak English. Bahasa Malaysia is also a close relative to Indonesian. You can understand both with ease since there are only minor differences in vocabulary. Therefore, learning Indonesian gives access to about 230 million people&amp;mdash;including those in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei. Indonesian (or commonly called as ''''Bahasa Indonesia'''' or simply ''''Bahasa'''') has been taught in some school in Australia, the Netherlands, and Vietnam. In Timor-Leste, although Portuguese and Tetum are official recognized language, but Indonesian is also important as working language, as Timor-Leste was part of Indonesia from 1976 until their independence in 1999.

=== Practical Reasons ===
Indonesian is derived from Malay, a language of South Sumatra which was broadly used for trade purposes in the Malay World (now Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore) for centuries. When Indonesians began their fight for independence from the Dutch, the Malay language was renamed &quot;Bahasa Indonesia&quot; (it was renamed in 1928, while Indonesia proclaimed its independence in 1945).  In Malaysia the national language is referred to as &quot;Bahasa Malaysia&quot;. Indonesian is thus a variant of Malay.

Not even half of Indonesians are native speakers of the Indonesian language, especially those living in rural areas. Many have as a mother tongue one of a diverse array of local languages, including Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, Madurese, Buginese, Batak, Minangkabau, or various Chinese dialects. But most Indonesians can speak Indonesian at least as a second language; it is taught in schools and understood even in the most remote islands.

What a remarkably versatile language Indonesian is! It is the language of education across the country, from the primary school to the university.  It is the language of government and business administration, media, literature, and of everyday life in the big cities. It is a must for foreigners living in Indonesia.  And if you are on a business trip to Jakarta, or on vacation in Bali, knowing some Indonesian can really enrich the experience. For those who are just curious language learners or those with a scholarly bent, Indonesian has an immense collection of literature.

=== Linguistic Reasons ===
Indonesian is very easy&amp;mdash;honest! Learning it is a valuable experience in itself, and what's more: you can pick up the basics within a few weeks. Here's why it is easy:

* '''No tenses'''. Indonesian has no tenses at all. Adding time indicators (like yesterday, next week, etc.) and aspect markers (done, in the process of, will, etc.) into your sentences will do.
* '''No genders or cases'''. Indonesian has no genders or gramatical cases attached to the nouns. This means that there is one less rule to learn.
* '''Simple plurals'''. Unlike in say, German, plurals are very simple in Indonesian. You only need to repeat the noun (e.g. ''buku'' &amp;rarr; ''buku-buku''), or adding quantitative indicators (e.g. many, few) into the sentence (e.g. ''beberapa buku'' &amp;rarr; ''some books'').
* '''A simple system of word formation'''. Indonesian has a straightforward system for combining words with prefixes, suffixes, and infixes to create new words. For example: ''satu'' means ''one'', whereas ''bersatu'' means ''to unite'' (i.e., to make into one). This means fewer words to memorize and you can (sort of) mix-and-match words to form your own word. The catch is that some words cannot be combined with some prefixes or suffixes, but you'll learn that it's simple.
* '''Uses the 26 letters of the Roman alphabet''', which means that there is no need to relearn the alphabet, or use special software to type.
* '''Consistent spelling'''. Indonesian is very phonetic, just like Italian. Every character is consistently spelled the same way in any word, with few exceptions. When you encounter a new word, you will always be able to pronounce it correctly.
* '''No Tones and simple stress patterns'''. Indonesian word stress typically falls on the second-last syllable of the original word. However, no matter where you put the stress, people will still recognize the word.
* '''Sentence form is similar to English'''. Indonesian sentence structure is similar to English: Subject + Verb + [Object]. So, you can form sentences in Indonesian easily.
* '''Everything is regular'''. Since there are no tenses, no genders, and simple plurals, everything is regular. Even the word-formation system is regular with some simple rules. You don't need to memorize lots of exceptions.

I hope now you can see why Indonesian is worth learning.

=== The Catch ===
Now, the catch is that every language has a culture attached to it. Indonesian is no exception. Since the way Indonesian people think differs from most westerners, there are some hurdles in learning it. For example, most western people prefer active sentences, while Indonesians usually prefer passive sentences and omit the subject if it is not important.

Also, in spoken Indonesian, the formal grammatical rules are often broken by lots of shortcuts, usually specific to the region, not to mention slang words and idioms. However, all Indonesians that have finished grade school should be able to speak and comprehend proper Indonesian.

&lt;H2&gt;Bond dissociation energy&lt;/H2&gt;
is the energy needed to break a chemical bond. Also known as the Bond Enthalpy.
|}

The bond dissociation energy, or bond enthalpy, for a diatomic molecule X-Y is defined as the energy required to break one mole of X-Y bonds, as illustrated in the following process...

:X-Y(g) &amp;rarr; X(g) + Y(g)

Bond enthalpies always refer to breaking bonds under gaseous conditions. 

The mean molar bond enthalpy is an average value that is quoted for a bond that can occur in different molecular environments. An example is methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(g) &amp;rarr; C(g) + 4H(g)

Bond enthalpy values are used in Hess's Law Calculations.

The standard enthalpy of a reaction can be found by considering the bond enthalpies of the products and reactants of the reaction - 

:Standard Enthalpy = &amp;Sigma; Enthalpy of formation of the products - &amp;Sigma; Enthalpy of formation of reactants

For stronger bonds, bond dissociation energy is higher as more energy is needed to break the bond. 

A carbon-carbon double bond is stronger than a single bond and  requires more energy to be broken. However, a carbon-carbon double bond is not twice as strong as a single one, it is only 1.5 times stronger.

All chemical bonds need an input of energy to be broken, as bonds allow a lower energy state for the component atoms. If a bond did not offer a lower energy state for the atoms that form it, a bond would not form.

'''Chemical equilibria''' are ratios relating the forward and backward direction of a reaction to each other. This ratio is represented by the letter '''K''' in the following equation:

'''K = products / reactants'''

==Rate of reaction==
===Definitions===
'''Rate of reaction''' is the speed at which a chemical reaction takes place, expressed as moles per unit time and unit volume. 
The rate ''r'' of a general reaction  &lt;math&gt;aA + bB + ... -&gt; p P + q Q + ...&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:

&lt;math&gt;
r = -{1 \over a}  {dC_A \over dt} = -{1 \over b} {dC_B \over dt} = ... = {1 \over p} {dC_P \over dt} =....
&lt;/math&gt;

from the expression above, it is clear that the usual convention is that reaction rate is taken as products formation rate.

Rate is a function of the concentration of reactants and products, temperature, pressure and presence of a catalyst.

===Rate expression===
A common expression for reaction rate is the ''power law'':

&lt;math&gt;r = k C_A^ \alpha\ C_B ^ \beta\ ....&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''kinetic constant'', and &lt;math&gt; \alpha\ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \beta\ &lt;/math&gt;, etc. are called the ''reaction order with respect to the reactant A, B'' (or the ''partial order of A, B'' etc.), respectively. The sum of all the orders is the ''global order'' of the rate expression. Therefore the rate expression
&lt;math&gt; r = k C_A C_B &lt;/math&gt; is a ''second-order'' and ''first-order'' in A and B.

The reaction orders are the same as the stoichiometric coefficient in the case of an elementary reaction '''only'''; in most cases they must be determined experimentally and are valid in the window of experimental conditions.

Elementary data on reaction orders can be obtained by changing the concentration C of one of the reactant, say A, and measuring the initial rate r. Plotting a rate vs concentration log-log graph, one obtains a straight line whose slope is the partial order in—say—A by virtue of the relation &lt;math&gt; log \, r = log \, k  C_A ^ \alpha\ = log \, k + \alpha\ log \, C_A &lt;/math&gt;

====Influence of temperature and pressure====

&lt;math&gt; k = k_0 exp \left ( - \Delta\ G^{*} / RT \right)&lt;/math&gt;

as known as the [[wikipedia:Svante_Arrhenius|Arrhenius]] equation

===Rate equations and reaction mechanisms===
The most important research application of kinetic investigations is the determination of reaction mechanisms. In fact, the rate expression is ''function'' of it.

From a postulated reaction mechanism (the ''model''), a rate equation can be derived and used to analyse the experimental data. If the obtained fit is not statistically significant, the scheme is rejected. In complex systems, several schemes can produce compatible rate expressions and the problem of model discrimination is of primary importance.

====Limiting step====
Often a reaction has two or more steps.  One of the steps, usually the last one, is the slowest step, and is said to be ''rate-limiting''.

====Steady state approximation====
Sometimes it is useful, when calculating the reaction rate, to assume that no particular step is rate-limiting.  Instead, the reaction intermediate can either proceed to the product or return to the original reactant with an equal rate for either possibility.  This is called the ''steady-state approximation''.

===Example===
A classical example is the hydrolysis of haloalkanes:

:R-X + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; ROH + HX

This reaction can occur by two mechanisms: the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1 and S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;. The former is a unimolecular substitution: its rate is determined only by the concentration of R-X, without regard to the concentration of the new substituent.  The latter is bimolecular: its rate is first-order in both R-X and new substituent, for a combined rate order of 2.

==Equilibrium==
'''Chemical equilibrium''' is the state when a net reaction is neither going forward nor backward.  It is a ''dynamic'' equilibrium.  The rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction, so the two cancel each other out, and the ''net'' rate of change is zero.

The chemical equilibrium is dictated by the '''equilibrium constant''' (often written ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''), expressed by the ''mass-action law'':

&lt;math&gt; K_{eq} = \frac { \prod_{i \in products} C_i}{ \prod_{j \in reactants} C_j  } &lt;/math&gt;

The concentration ''C'' can be expressed in any scale, e.g. molar franction, molarity, partial pressure.

If the temperature and pressure are kept constant, no matter what are the initial concentrations, the system will evolve until the mass-action product is equal to the K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, systems with &lt;math&gt;K_{eq} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; are highly displaced to the reactant sides (almost no conversion at equilibrium), whereas when &lt;math&gt;K_{eq} \gg 1&lt;/math&gt; the reaction goes to completion.

From classical thermodynamics it can be showed that the following relation holds:

&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = exp \left( -{\Delta\ G_R}/{RT} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta\ G_R&lt;/math&gt; is the total change in Gibbs free energy with reaction (product minus reactants).

===Influence of temperature===
The influence of temperature can be obtained by differentiation of the equation above to lead:

&lt;math&gt; -ln K_{eq} = \frac {\Delta\ H_R} {RT} - \frac {\Delta\ S_R}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

as known as the ''[[wikipedia:Jacobus_van't_Hoff|van't Hoff]] equation''.
Therefore, for exothermic reaction (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ H_r &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;) an increase in temperature will decrease the &lt;math&gt;{\Delta\ H_R}/{RT}&lt;/math&gt; quantity, leading to a lower ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' , conversely for an endothermic reaction.

Energy diagrams are used to show the favorability of a reaction. They show how energy gained or lost in the different stages of a reaction and show which stages are the slow and fast steps (slow steps have high potential energy). We can also compare the energies of one reaction to another in order to see which reaction will be favored. 

[[Image:Sample energy diagram.png]]

[[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Transition states|Transition states]] are high peaks in an energy diagram. 

If the end of the diagram is lower than the beginning, the product of the reaction is more stable and/or lower in energy than the starting materials, and the overall reaction is energetically favorable. If the tail end of the energy diagram is higher than the front, then the product is less stable or energetically favorable than the starting materials, and the overall reaction is energetically unfavorable. Any high peaks in the diagram indicate difficult points to pass and will slow down the reaction.

Chào anh! Thật vui vì tìm được một người cùng xứ trên wikibook tiếng Anh này. 
Em mới biết đến các dự án wiki và cảm thấy đây là những dự án rất có ích. Tuy nhiên em đã bỏ công &quot;tìm&quot; nhiều mà vẫn không &quot;hiểu&quot; được cách hoạt động của các dự án wikibook, wikiversity (trình độ tiếng Anh của em không tốt lắm). Anh có thể giải thích giùm em được không?

Nhân tiện anh có phải chủ dự án wikibook tiếng Việt? Em thấy wikibook tiếng Việt mình có nhiều bài viết còn sơ sài và hình như mọi người vẫn chưa hiểu cách viết Wikibook và các phần mềm wiki (giống như em).

Nếu có thể xin hãy bỏ chút thời gian trả lời câu hỏi ngốc nghếch này của em nhé! Cảm ơn.

Alkenes are electron-rich. Just look at those electrons all clumped together in the carbon-carbon double bond. They act as [[en:Lewis base|Lewis bases]]  (they give up electrons). 

Hydrohalogenation follows [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes#Markovnikov's_Rule|Markovnikov's rule]]. That is, the carbon of the double bond that starts out more subsituted recieves the halogen (becomes more substituted) while the carbon of the double bond that starts out less substituted ends up with the hydrogen.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Hydrohalogenation_markovnikov.png|A substituated alkene undergoing hydrohalogenation]]&lt;br&gt;''He who has, gets: This is another alkene illustrating hydrohalogenation. Notice how the more highly substituated carbon ends up with the X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;


The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is attracted to the electron-rich double bond and adds first, on the carbon with more hydrogens, leaving the other carbon with a positive charge (a carbocation). Then the X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; reacts with the carbocation.

      <comment>/* Geometric series */ I mean...</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

A ''series'' is the sum of a sequence of terms. An ''infinite series'' is the sum of an infinite number of terms (the actual sum of the series need not be infinite, as we will see below).

An ''arithmetic series'' is the sum of a sequence of terms with a ''common difference'' (the difference between consecutive terms). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;1+4+7+10+13+\dots&lt;/math&gt;
is an arithmetic series with common difference 3, since &lt;math&gt;a_2-a_1=3&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;a_3-a_2=3&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth.

A geometric series is the sum of terms with a common ratio. For example, an interesting series which appears in many practical problems in science, engineering, and mathematics is the geometric series
&lt;math&gt; r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4 + ...&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the series continues indefinitely.  A common way to study a particular series (following Cauchy) is to define a sequence consisting of the sum of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; terms.  For example, to study the geometric series we can consider the sequence which adds together the first n terms:
:&lt;math&gt;S_n(r) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} r^i. &lt;/math&gt;
Generally by studying the sequence of partial sums we can understand the behavior of the entire infinite series.

Two of the most important questions about a series are:
*Does it converge?
*If so, what does it converge to?

For example, it is fairly easy to see that for &lt;math&gt; r &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the geometric series &lt;math&gt;S_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; will not converge to a finite number (i.e., it will diverge to infinity).  To see this, note that each time we increase the number of terms in the series, &lt;math&gt;S_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; increases by &lt;math&gt;r^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;r^{n+1} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (as we defined), &lt;math&gt;S_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; must increase by a number greater than one every term. When increasing the sum by more than one for every term, it will diverge.

Perhaps a more surprising and interesting fact is that for &lt;math&gt; |r| &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; S_n(r) &lt;/math&gt; will converge to a finite value.  Specifically, it is possible to show that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n(r) = \frac{r}{1-r}. &lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, consider the quantity 
:&lt;math&gt;(1-r)S_n(r) = (1-r)\sum_{i=1}^{n} r^n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} r^n - \sum_{i=2}^{n+1} r^n = r - r^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;r^{n+1}\to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this shows that &lt;math&gt;(1-r)S_n(r)\to r&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The quantity &lt;math&gt;1-r&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero and doesn't depend on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; so we can divide by it and arrive at the formula we want.

We'd like to be able to draw similar conclusions about any series.

Unfortunately, there is no simple way to sum a series. The most we will be able to do in most cases is determine if it converges. The geometric and the telescoping series are the only types of series in which we can easily find the sum of.

==Convergence==

It is obvious that for a series to converge, the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; must tend to zero (because sum of an infinite number of terms all greater than any given positive number will be infinity), but even if the limit of the sequence is 0, this is not sufficient to say it converges.

Consider the harmonic series, the sum of 1/''n'', and group terms
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_1^{2^m} \frac{1}{n} &amp; = &amp;1+\frac{1}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{8} &amp;+\ldots &amp; + &amp;\sum_{p=1+2^{n-1}}^{2^n} \frac{1}{p} \\ 
 &amp; &gt; &amp;\frac{3}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{4}(2) &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{8}(4) &amp;+\ldots &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2^n}2^{n-1} \\
 &amp; = &amp;\frac{3}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{2} &amp;+\ldots &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2} \quad (m \mbox{ terms})
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
As ''m'' tends to infinity, so does this final sum, hence the series diverges.

We can also deduce something about how quickly it diverges. Using the same grouping of terms, we can get an upper limit on the sum of the first so many terms, the ''partial sums''.

:&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{m}{2} \le   \sum_1^{2^m} \frac{1}{n} \le 1+m &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{\log_2 m}{2}\le \sum_1^m \frac{1}{n} \le 1+ \log_2 m&lt;/math&gt;
and the partial sums increase like log ''m'', very slowly.

===Comparison test===

The argument above, based on considering upper and lower bounds on terms, can be modified to provide a general-purpose test for convergence and divergence called the ''comparison test'' (or ''direct comparison test''). It can be applied to any series with nonnegative terms:
* If &lt;math&gt;\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges and &lt;math&gt;0 \le a_n \le b_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.
* If &lt;math&gt;\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges and &lt;math&gt;0 \le b_n \le a_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

There are many such tests for convergence and divergence, the most important of which we will describe below.

===Absolute convergence===

Theorem: If the series of &lt;b&gt;absolute&lt;/b&gt; values, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left| a_n \right|&lt;/math&gt;, converges, then so does the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;

We say such a series ''converges absolutely''.

'''Proof:'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

According to the Cauchy criterion for series convergence, exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;
so that for all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;m,n&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

We know that:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;/math&gt;

And then we get:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Now we get:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Which is exactly the Cauchy criterion for series convergence.

&lt;math&gt;Q.E.D&lt;/math&gt;


''The converse does not hold.'' The series 1-1/2+1/3-1/4 ... converges, even though the series of its absolute values diverges.

A series like this that converges, but not absolutely, is said to ''converge conditionally.'' 

If a series converges absolutely, we can add terms in any order we like. The limit will still be the same.

If a series converges conditionally, rearranging the terms changes the limit. In fact, we can make the series converge to any limit we like by choosing a suitable rearrangement.

E.g., in the series 1-1/2+1/3-1/4 ..., we can add only positive terms until the partial sum exceeds 100, subtract 1/2, add only positive terms until the partial sum exceeds 100, subtract 1/4, and so on, getting a sequence with the same terms that converges to 100.

This makes absolutely convergent series easier to work with. Thus, all but one of convergence tests in this chapter will be for series all of whose terms are positive, which must be absolutely convergent or divergent series. Other series will be studied by considering the corresponding series of absolute values.

===Ratio test===

For a series with terms ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, if
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty } \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = r&lt;/math&gt;
then 
*the series converges (absolutely) if ''r''&lt;1
*the series diverges if ''r''&gt;1 (or if ''r'' is infinity)
*the series could do either if ''r''=1, so the test is not conclusive in this case.

E.g., suppose
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=\frac{n!n!}{(2n)!}&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{(n+1)^2}{(2n+1)(2n+2)}=\frac{n+1}{4n+2} \to \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
so this series converges.

===Integral test===

If ''f''(''x'') is a monotonically decreasing, always positive function, then the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt;

converges if ''and only if'' the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges. 

E.g., consider ''f''(''x'')=1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, for a fixed ''p''.

*If ''p''=1 this is the harmonic series, which diverges.
*If ''p''&lt;1 each term is larger than the harmonic series, so it diverges.
*If ''p''&gt;1 then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\int_1^\infty x^{-p}dx &amp; = &amp; \lim_{s \to \infty}\int_1^s x^{-p}dx &amp; \\ 
&amp; = &amp; \lim_{s \to \infty } \left. \frac{-1}{(p-1)x^{p-1}} \right|^s_1 &amp;  \\ 
&amp; = &amp; \lim_{s \to \infty } \left( \frac{1}{p-1}-\frac{1}{(p-1)s^{p-1}} \right) 
&amp; =\frac{1}{p-1} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The integral converges, for ''p''&gt;1, so the series converges. 


We can prove this test works by writing the integral as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x)dx=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_n^{n+1} f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
and comparing each of the integrals with rectangles, giving the inequalities
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) \ge \int_n^{n+1} f(x)dx \ge f(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;
Applying these to the sum then shows convergence.

===Limit comparison test===

Given an infinite series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; with positive terms only, if one can find another infinite series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; with positive terms for which
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = L &lt;/math&gt;
for a positive and finite ''L'' (i.e., the limit exists and is not zero), then the two series either both converge or both diverge. That is,
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, and
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

''Example:''
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = n^{-\frac{n+1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''n'', the terms of this series are similar to, but smaller than, those of the harmonic series.  We compare the limits.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim \frac{a_n}{b_n} = \lim \frac{n^{-\frac{n+1}{n}}}{1/n} = \lim \frac{n}{n^{\frac{n+1}{n}}} 
= \lim \frac {1}{n^{\frac {1}{n}}}=1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

so this series diverges.

===Alternating series===
Given an infinite series &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt;, if the signs of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; alternate, that is if
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=(-1)^n |a_n| \,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''n'' or
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=(-1)^{n+1} |a_n| \,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''n'', then we call it an ''&lt;b&gt;alternating&lt;/b&gt; series.''

The '''alternating series test''' states that such a series converges if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\ |a_{n+1}| &lt; |a_n|&lt;/math&gt;
(that is, the magnitude of the terms is decreasing).

Note that this test ''cannot'' lead to the conclusion that the series diverges; if one cannot conclude that the series converges, this test is inconclusive, although other tests may, of course, be used to give a conclusion.

====Estimating the sum of an alternating series====

The absolute error that results in using a partial sum of an alternating series to estimate the final sum of the infinite series is smaller than the magnitude of the first omitted term.
:&lt;math&gt;\left| \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n - \sum_{n=1}^m a_n \right| &lt; |a_{m+1}|&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric series==
The geometric series can take either of the following forms
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
As you have seen at the start, the sum of the geometric series is
:&lt;math&gt;s=\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n =\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}=\frac{a}{1-r}\quad\mbox{ for } |r| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Telescoping series==
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (b_n - b_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding (or &quot;telescoping&quot;) this type of series is informative.  If we expand this series, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^k (b_n - b_{n+1})= (b_0 - b_1) + (b_1 - b_2) + ... + (b_{k-1} - b_k)&lt;/math&gt;

Additive cancellation leaves:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^k (b_n - b_{n+1})= b_0 - b_k&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (b_n - b_{n+1}) = 
\lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{n=0}^k (b_n - b_{n+1}) =
\lim_{k \to \infty} (b_0 - b_k) = b_0 - \lim_{k \to \infty} b_k&lt;/math&gt;

and all that remains is to evaluate the limit.

There are other tests that can be used, but these tests are sufficient for all commonly encountered series.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Philosophy&quot; is a word with numerous vastly differing definitions, ranging broadly and not always compatible with each other. Today, it is perhaps most often thought of as meaning an individual's set of guiding principles, mostly moral, that he refers to in planning out and living his life. However, philosophy as an intellectual or academic pursuit has little do with this, meaning rather something along the lines of: &quot;The directed search for knowledge and systems of knowledge that explain topical phenomena such as the nature of existence, the causes of existence, the nature and causes of an individual, the nature and causes of knowledge itself, and a million other things.&quot;

What these million other things are constitutes the essence, or ''feel'', of philosophy as a subject, and of what differentiates it from other kinds of directed research such as physics, biology, or even music -- all of which were at one point considered aspects of philosophy itself. As you read on, you'll develop a sense of these questions as they've evolved in the Western canon, and of how philosophy fits in with the entirety of human intellectual pursuits.

Western philosophy as we know it today is generally considered to have originated in Ancient Greece, from the people's cosmogonical or &quot;world-creation&quot; myths. Thales of Miletus brought back kernels of knowledge from Ancient Egypt, which over time the Greeks developed into the earliest philosophy that remains recognizably such today. It is not surprising, then, that the term &quot;philosophy&quot; finds its roots in the Greek language. &quot;Philo-&quot; stems from the Greek word ''philein'', meaning 'to love', and &quot;-sophy&quot; comes from the Greek word ''sophia'', or wisdom. '''Philosophy''', then, can be thought of as &quot;the love of wisdom&quot;.

Consequently, philosophers concern themselves with exploring some of the biggest questions that face humankind: What exists? What is real? What is the nature of the universe? Does God exist? Do humans have souls?  What is knowledge? What is truth? How should individuals govern themselves? What is the nature of consciousness? Like many other fields of inquiry, philosophical questions spring from a certain kind of curiosity about life and reality.
Much of philosophy confronts very abstract ideas and thus, unlike in other academic disciplines such as the sciences, philosophers cannot always rely on gathering empirical data through experimentation. Of course, there are numerous other techniques available to the philosopher, including formal logic, thought experiments, rational dissertation, colloquy, phenomenological analysis, and more.

[The pursuit of philosophical wisdom can be understood as a quest for two different kinds of wisdom. Aristotle characterized these as theoretical wisdom and practical wisdom. The first sort seeks understanding primarily for its own sake, whereas the latter is concerned with understanding in order to ''do''.  The distinction is not unlike those in other fields. The physicist attempts to understand matter and motion simply for the sake of extending the limits human knowledge, but the engineer attempts to understand matter and motion in order to ''make'' something useful. The philosopher who attempts to understand the metaphysical nature of the universe is concerned with a more theoretical area of philosophical inquiry, while his or her colleague who tries to understand the proper way for businesses to behave ethically, is pursuing a much more practical subject matter. Philosophy that concerns itself with these sorts of practical questions is usually called &quot;Applied Philosophy&quot;.]

Philosophy is perhaps unique in its lack of limitation regarding subject matter. Almost every conceivable idea has been or will be tackled by philosophy, and among those that aren't, most are areas of philosophy that matured sufficiently to break off from the discipline proper and form a new field of study: physics was once called &quot;natural philosophy.&quot; In addition, philosophers typically ask questions that touch on almost every other field of academic inquiry. In fact, one major role of philosophy is to provide the underpinning for just about every other field of study, everything from the rules governing research in that field to its relationship to the other fields of human endeavor. As a result, most universities offer courses in the &quot;philosophy of&quot; other academic disciplines, of interest to both philosophers and students of the respective field. Despite these far-ranging interests, there are some unifying features of philosophical inquiry...

Thanks! I am sure I will enjoy it, though it is likely to take me a very long time to complete my first project as I am working full-time in the IT department at my university, I am teaching philosophy at the same school and I have a computer consulting business of my own.  Nonetheless, I support this idea and will contribute what I can as time permits.  Thanks so much for your kind assistance. --[[User:RMK|RMK]]

If you don't mind, I have been so empetuous to add some text to the empty question: &quot;Why study philosophy?&quot;. If you do mind, please change or delete it - but then I'm curious why so... ( NicoBenschop 16jun04)</text>

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;A Textbook on Five Levels&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The question arose early in the development of this textbook as to precisely who would be the target audience. Although intended to be a &quot;beginning&quot; textbook on German, many felt that the early lessons were too difficult for younger students with  very limited or no experience with German and, perhaps more importantly, limited skills in English grammar. For this reason a textbook on three levels was conceived. [[German/Level I|Beginning German]] ('''Level I''') puts more emphasis on building vocabulary around subject matter interesting and useful to young students.  [[German/Level II|Basic German]] ('''Level II''') emphasises grammar, and assumes a greater knowledge of English grammar more typical of an older high school or a college student. If you are just beginning to learn German or attempting to teach yourself, you may wish to try both approaches and see which works better for you, since some people require a strong structural approach to learning a new language while others find this &quot;structure&quot; only impedes progress by adding another layer of complexity. [[German/Level III|Intermediate German]] ('''Level III'''), which requires even more knowledge of English, is for college students, preferably for sophomores or juniors. With even more complex lessons, grammar and vocabulary comes [[German/Level IV|Advanced German]] ('''Level IV'''), which with the most complex and difficult parts of the German language, is for late college students (Seniors) and college graduates. The last level, which is a review level, but also has cultural facts and the history of the German language, is [[German/Level V|Reviewed German.]] ('''Level V'''). An existing, separate text, '''[[German/Grammar]]''', may eventually be merged into the lesson modules or developed into useful appendices as a grammar reference.  At present, however, German Grammar is an expanding, significant contribution to the textbook; it provides an important reference on German language grammar rules useful to the student working through any of the three levels.      

== The German Language ==

German (''Deutsch'') is a member of the western group of the [[w:Germanic language|Germanic language]]s. It is spoken primarily in Germany, Austria, the majority of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Südtirol (South Tyrol) region of Italy, the Opole Voivodship of Poland, the eastern part of Belgium, parts of Romania, the Alsace (Elsass) region of France and parts of Denmark. Additionally, several former colonial possessions of these countries, such as Namibia in Africa, have sizable German-speaking populations. There are German-speaking minorities in several eastern European countries including Russia, and in the United States as well as countries in South America like Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Over 120 million people speak German as their native language. German is the third most popular foreign language taught worldwide, and the second most popular in Europe. Continue reading about the [[w:German language|German language]].

== German and English ==

If you are an English speaker unfamiliar with German, you may be surprised to learn that English and German are closely related languages and share many words that are very similar. Such words are called [[w:cognate|cognate]]s. This is particularly true for everyday words in English that are Anglo-Saxon (that is, Germanic) in origin. Consider the following list of English words followed by their German counterparts:

: arm          ~ ''der Arm''
: book         ~ ''das Buch''
: cat          ~ ''die Katze''
: father       ~ ''der Vater''

: finger       ~ ''der Finger''
: wagon        ~ ''der Wagen''
: house        ~ ''das Haus''

: hand         ~ ''die Hand''
: June         ~ ''der Juni''
: man          ~ ''der Mann''

: mother       ~ ''die Mutter''
: mouse        ~ ''die Maus''
: name         ~ ''der Name''

: son          ~ ''der Sohn''
: garden       ~ ''der Garten''

: lamp         ~ ''die Lampe''
: bush         ~ ''der Busch''
: baker        ~ ''der Bäcker''
: net          ~ ''das Netz''
: storm        ~ ''der Sturm''
: hat          ~ ''der Hut''
: fire         ~ ''das Feuer''
: grass        ~ ''das Gras''
: fish         ~ ''der Fisch''
: kindergarten ~ ''der Kindergarten''

Some German words have the same origin as their English counterparts but the meaning has changed:

: worry        &amp;ne; ''würgen'' (strangle)
: kind         &amp;ne; ''das Kind'' (child)

*'''Audio''': [[Media:English-german words.ogg|OGG]] (308KB) ~ ''Hear these words''

Of course, even words whose spelling is no different in English and German may be pronounced quite differently. But in reading German, you will see the connections between these languages, even in many of the &quot;small&quot; words (the above examples are all nouns). For example:

:This week, my father is with my brother in the city.
:''Diese Woche ist mein Vater mit meinem Bruder in der Stadt''.

*'''Audio''': [[Media:Example sentence.ogg|OGG]] (87KB) ~ ''Hear these sentences''

Note also the general similarity of sentence structure with English. The only real difference in the German is that the verb is moved forward in the sentence. However, there are many German sentences in which a verb form is the last word in the sentence.  

Unfortunately, while German is perhaps the easiest &quot;foreign&quot; language for an English speaker to learn, meanings of words that are spelled similarly are not always identical. These &quot;[[German/Appendices/False friends|false friends]]&quot; can be confusing for the beginner. Further, German is a more structured language than English, with a more complex grammar, and it will become apparent as you learn German that you will also learn more about English language structure than you might ever recall from your high school English classes. For a quick listing of similarities and differences between English and German, read the [[German/Level I/Introduction|Introduction to Level I]].

== Vocabulary and Grammar ==

In learning to read or speak any language with which you have minimal acquaintance (that is, are not a native speaker of), the two aspects to be mastered are vocabulary and grammar. Acquiring vocabulary is a &quot;simple&quot; matter of memorization. For the language(s) we learn as children, this process is so transparent that we have trouble conceiving of the importance of having a large vocabulary. By the age of conscious recognition of our communicating with others through speech, we have already learned the meaning of thousands of words. Even words we have trouble defining, we readily understand their use in conversation. This process can be &quot;reactivated,&quot; as it were, by immersion in a second language: a method of learning a new language by moving to a place where that language is spoken and having to get around and live without use of one's native tongue.

The student of German language, if not residing in a German-speaking environment, must put forth substantial effort to learning words, including their meaning, their pronunciation and their usage in common sentences. Be sure to &quot;learn&quot;—commit to memory—all of the vocabulary words in each lesson as they are presented. Early lessons have simple sentences because it is assumed that the student's vocabulary is limited. But throughout the text, more complex discourses (often as photo captions) are included to introduce the student to regular German in use. It may be helpful to translate these using a German-English dictionary (access to one is a must; see [[German/Appendices/Resources|Appendix 5]] for on-line options). Other sources of German, such as newspapers, magazines, web sites, etc., can also be useful in building vocabulary and developing a sense of how German words are put together. The [http://de.wikipedia.org/ German Wikipedia] provides an ever expanding source of German language articles that can be used for this purpose. Further, a German version of the Wikibooks project—a library of textbooks in German—is available at [http://de.wikibooks.org/ German Wikibooks].

German grammar is more complex than, but sufficiently similar to, English that &quot;reading&quot; German is possible with minimal vocabulary in the sense that the student should generally recognize the parts of a sentence. With a good dictionary or an online translator, an English speaker can usually translate a German sentence close to correctly. However, to accurately speak and understand German, you must learn how each word functions in a sentence. There are eight basic grammatical functions: '''case''', '''gender''', '''number''', '''tense''', '''person''', '''mood''', '''voice''', and '''comparison'''. How words &quot;signal&quot; these functions is an important aspect of learning a new language. English speakers should know all of these functions and the signals used in English, but it is often the situation that you know perfectly well how to speak English, without understanding much about word-functions and signals. For this reason, this textbook incorporates considerable detail on grammar, including both English and German grammar. The reference book ''[[English]]'' at ''Wikibooks'' may be consulted for additional help. When we say German is more complex than English, what we really mean is that the signals used in German are different from and more numerous than those used by English.

== Pronunciation ==

A [[German/Appendices/Alphabet|guide to the pronunciation]] of German is provided. You should become familiar with this page early on, and refer to it often. Nothing can replace learning a language from a native speaker, but the text is liberally sprinkled with audio files providing the student with valuable input from hearing spoken German. Analyze the spoken words carefully. The pronunciation guide can only closely, not exactly, convey how German words should be pronounced. And of course, German (like English) has a number of dialects distinguished by differences in pronunciation.

Help in the pronunciation of individual words can be found by accessing the sound files of either of the online dictionaries, links to which are given in the [[German/Appendices/Resources|German websites]] appendix.

== Layout of Lessons ==

This textbook is intended as a beginning course in the German language for English speakers. Early lessons emphasize conversational subjects and gradually introduce German grammatical concepts and rules. In addition, sound files accompany appropriate parts of each lesson. Although the '''basic lessons''' (''Grundlegende Lektionen'') are presented at about the (US) high school level, beginners (including those attempting to learn German outside of a course structure) are expected to work through several basic lessons up to an indicated point, when review is suggested along with additional study. The basic way lessons go to other lessons is very simple and direct:
* Lesson 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; and on to the end of the text.

== Layout within Lessons ==

The following subheadings or categories are offered within the lessons (Level II and above):

# One or more conversation ('''''Gespräch''''') or story ('''''Geschichte''''') pieces in German alone to illustrate the language in use.
#Study material ('''''Lernen''''') in English and German to present lists of conceptually related words.
# One or more grammar ('''''Grammatik''''') lessons covering elements of German grammar, with illustrations drawn from the conversation, story, or study materials.
# A list of words ('''''Vokabeln''''') and phrases introduced in the lesson, above that point, usually in the conversation, story, or study presentations. Words and phrases are arranged alphabetically within groups, and the groups are presented in the following order: 1) nouns, 2) phrases, 3) verbs, and 4) all other words. A guide to pronunciation of the words presented is consolidated within [[German/Appendices/Alphabet|Appendix 1]]. However, in each ''Vokabeln'', nouns stressed on other than the first syllable (the general rule in German) are indicated by bolding of the stressed syllable (e.g., ''Biolo'''gie'''''). Note that the English translation of all German words in a ''Vokabeln'' is the best equivalent for the lesson example. The lesson ''Vokabeln'' is &lt;u&gt;not a dictionary&lt;/u&gt;, but a quick reference for translation purposes. For this reason, verbs are not translated into a typical English infinitive form with a preceding particle, &quot;to&quot;.  
# A list of additional, related words or phrases ('''''Andere Wörter'''''; advanced lessons only) that relate to, but are not included in, the vocabulary presented in the basic and advanced lessons.
# English sentences and other material to be translated by the student into German ('''''Übersetzung'''''). These are numbered and a matching answer sheet is linked to this category. The student should write out the German using material from the lesson (and previous lessons) before checking their work against the answer list.

== The Student and the Lesson ==

Each level of the text is designed to constitute a course of study in the German language. For any level selected, each lesson should be read thoroughly and mastered before moving on. Substantial text in German is included and the student should read all of it, not once, but multiple times. At Levels II and III, complete translations into English are included only in selected places. Most of this text must be translated by the student using his or her acquired vocabulary and the vocabulary presented at the bottom of each lesson. As the German text is read (preferably out loud), the student must succeed in gaining an understanding of the meaning of each sentence, and of the role each word plays in establishing that meaning. To the beginner, there will seem to be many words in a German sentence that are out of place or even redundant or unnecessary. These add subtleties to the language that will make sense eventually. But it is important to experience these subtleties from the very beginning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;In mathematics, only the most important (yet basic) theorems are coined fundamental. If you see the word fundamental as part of the naming of a theorem, it means that theorem is of extreme importance.&quot;

I am afraid that we have one exception: the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.


Good point, the exception being that it's extremely hard, and hence not basic. But... by basic i dont mean easy, but fundamental. I'll fire up the thesaurus then

I might look stupid, but I don't understand what I'm supposed to notice about the values of the powers of two in modulo 11... can someone help me? [[User:Ugen64|Ugen64]] 20:45, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:In mod 11 arithmetic, 2 is called a ''generator''. Let's list all the powers of 2 from 1 to 10:
::2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 9, 7, 3, 6, 1.
:The number 2 is called a ''generator'', because its powers generate all the numbers from 1 to 10! That is, for every number ''x'' mod 11, we can find a number ''p'', such that 2&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; = x. Utilizing this idea, calculating x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for big ''x'' and ''n'' is no longer a problem! Consider 6&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, notice 2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; is 6, therefore 6&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8.

My mum tells me that when she did mathematics, 1 was considered a prime number. Was it? Is counting 1 as a non-prime more useful? Is her memory just at fault? *g* [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 11:27, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:She may be might right, but that was long time ago. Now, one is not consider a prime. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 15:00, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:::It is not considered a prime because it is more useful to do so. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic would have to be changed to say &quot;every number can be expressed as a unique product of non-unitary primes&quot; (where by non-unitary primes, I mean what we call a prime today), and the phrase &quot;prime number&quot; occurs much more often in mathematics than &quot;prime number or 1&quot;. --[[User:Taejo|Taejo]] ([[User talk:Taejo|talk]]) 14:36, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

::One need not express the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in an English syntax at all, as it is rather more cumbersome to translate into other languages, in comparison to pure mathematical expressions. I'm not very good at this, but let's give it a crack. If we express &quot;primeness&quot; as being a feature of Diophantine inequations, then it becomes a simple matter of what inequations are satisfied by what numbers. If x/y = n, then x cannot be prime. Working from this definition, it can be easily shown that both 0 and 1 are prime numbers, and that all the numbers commonly considered prime satisfy these inequations as well. As must be necessary, non-primes do '''not''' satisfy these inequations. That is, ({Diophantine}, n≠1) x/y≠n, where n is any number (except one), and x is the proposed prime. (If I haven't fully defined all the conditions, I apologize, but it's been awhile since I've worked on this.) --TheLastWordSword  --[[Special:Contributions/208.83.126.102|208.83.126.102]] ([[User talk:208.83.126.102|talk]]) 19:26, 27 October 2010 (UTC) EDIT: A second point is that the Sieve of Eratosthenes is not a mathematical proof of any sort, merely a rather rough algorithm. --[[Special:Contributions/208.83.126.102|208.83.126.102]] ([[User talk:208.83.126.102|talk]]) 19:35, 27 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

For problem 11(b), what exactly is your notation? Where you have &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\equiv \frac{p-1}{2}!&lt;/math&gt;, you don't say what it's equivalent to. (There's no (mod ''n'') clause.) Furthermore, should the &quot;p=1 (mod 4)&quot; equation be written as an equivalence instead?

I'm not entirely sure about these, so I didn't make the edit. Can someone confirm or deny? [[User:Grendelkhan|Grendelkhan]] 17:16, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Thanks for the question. The editing is done. Where obvious I sometimes do use the two notations interchangably. But I'll change it in this case. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 23:20, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I do believe factorization is spelled wrong throughout the document....  Someone may like to fix that.

: It's not &quot;wrong&quot;. Some people spell it with an ''s'' and some with a ''z'' - they are variants, not misspellings. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:59, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)

It might be a temporary thing, but there appears to be a bug in the formula rendering - the example for marking 5 as a prime in the &quot;Finding primes&quot; section does not appear to render. I found that removing the terminating // on the last line of the matrix definition causes the matrix to render correctly again - however (bizarrely) it causes a visible rendering error (in preview mode at least) when applied to any of the other matrixes.

For the life of me, I can't figure out the fifth modulo 11 problem. I don't see how adding or subtracting 11 is ever going to get me a multiple of i. Infact, after the 5th question, the page starts to become a giant nonsequiter for me (I'm sure the page is correct, it's just not clear to me). The question is unclear -- I'm not sure if it means find x if (x mod 11)^2 = -2 or if x^2 mod 11 = -2.

: I don't like the notation in the question. My interpretation of it is that it is asking you for all the numbers modulo 11, that when you square it, you get -2 = 9 (mod 11). So, x^2 = 9 normally you have 3 as a solution. But, 11 mod 11 is zero, so conceivably, 11+3 will also be a solution too, since we're basically &quot;adding zero&quot;. So 3+11 = 14 = 3 (mod 11), and you can consider -3 = 8 to be a solution too (since (-3)^2 = 9 normally).

Then in the division example it says x=3/5. Ok, sure. Then x = 3 * (1/5). Alright, still with you. Then x = 3 * 3. Uh, where the hell did that come from? 3*3 = 9. 3/5 = 0.6. Then, to really confuse the hell out of me, 3 * 3 becomes 2!

: Again, the notation (I've complained about it before, above). You can't really divide when talking about modular arithmetic because you can't always do it, and you don't get fractions. The ''multiplicative inverse'' of 5 mod 7 is the number you multiply 5 by modulo 7 to get 1. 3 * 5 = 1 (mod 7), so you can write &quot;1/5&quot; ('''which should really be written as 5&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''') as 3. The rest should then be clear: get back to me if it isn't.

But I'm confused even before that. 1/5 = 0.2. 1/5 mod 7 is still 0.2. Why are we doing this funky stuff with x in the first place?

: See above. 1/5 is supposed to be the multiplicative inverse, not a fraction. We only work with numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} modulo 5, we don't have fractions or decimals or whatever. If we want to &quot;divide&quot; numbers, we look for numbers we multiply to get 1 (like if we had real numbers, 1/5 is supposed to be the number we multiply 5 by to get 1, modulo 7, 3 is supposed to be the number we multiply 5 by to get 1).

Can someone please clarify here or in the module itself what is going on? I can get a 4 on my AP calc examination but this makes no sense to me ;)

[[User:dataangel|dataangel]]

: As I mentioned, get back to me if anything I told you still doesn't make sense. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:25, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: It seems that my notation (or my uni lecturer's notation) have confused quite a lot of ppl. Just think of &quot;1/5&quot; as the number when multiplied by 5 will give 1, dont think of it as 0.2. I know that &quot;1/5&quot; will be confusing to those with prior exposure to higher mathematics but this book is for high school student and so i want to do it in notations familiar to them. Maybe i should clarify it in the book. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:18, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:: I know you want to use notation familiar to high school students, but you really need to use a different notation. The two operations aren't the same, and you're going to confuse people more if you do, even that high schooler above. But it's up to you. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:52, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:: I think you can effectively use the &quot;1/5&quot; notation.  What's wrong with thinking it is 0.2?  What does 0.2 mean anyway?  It only ever means 2/10 which makes just as much sense in modulo 11 arithmetic as it does in the rationals.  You can &quot;divide&quot; in prime modulos because they are fields.  The important thing to recognize (and communicate) is that the canonical form for all numbers in &quot;modulo 11&quot; arithmetic comes from the list {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.  You get a lot of leeway for students to play around with the algebra and still get sensible answers, they just have to do the algebra correctly.

:: By the way, I have always liked the analogy of &quot;clock&quot; arithmetic as a way of explaining all the funny bits of Z&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.  So image a clock with only 11 hours on the face (strange day!). How many hours would you have to wait from &quot;midnight&quot; before the clock showed 2 o'clock?  There are lots of equivalent answers.  Now DIVIDE that many hours into 10 equal pieces. You get lots of different numerical answers for &quot;how long&quot;, but they are all equivalent to 9 (mod 11).  Which only means that if you work a 9 hour shift 5 times in a row starting at midnight, the clock will read 1.  But if you work a 2/10 hour (do I dare call it 12 minute?) shift 5 times in a row starting at midnight the clock will still read 1. [[User:Thebhgg|beej]] 13:51, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

5^99 mod 11? I'm probably not thinking through this properly/missing something (it's been a while for me since I did any of this stuff), but isn't that a little difficult to do, even with something like Euler's theorem for help? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:40, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I guess the question is a bit tricky. Just note that the inverse of 3 is 4. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 07:55, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I think what students are supposed to see is that 5 is a generator, just like all the other elements in modulo 11 arithmetic.  If you can find which exponent i make 5&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, then you can do normal arithmetic on the exponent.  In this case 5&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, so you figure 5&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt; = 5&lt;sup&gt;10 * 9 + 9&lt;/sup&gt;= (5&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; * 5&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = (1)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; * 5&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.

hello everyone just reading through.  the discription of what the modular arithmatic is was a little confusing so I fixed it up a bit but the rest of the article is a bit hard to fallow through the modular arithmatic section.  I'm not exactly sure what the whole division and inversion section is saying.  the whole section on modular arthmetic brings up some un answered questions.  is there a real number version of modular arthimetic or is there only integers in modular arthimetic.  from there I kind of get lost.  good article though I like what I've read so far. --[[User:Stranger104|Stranger104]] 08:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Revision 1 ==

This chapter is the first chapter to be written. The material, despite others and my best effoects, remain somewhat chaotic and lacking focus. I have moved the much disputed (and confusing) part about division and inverses to Further Modular Arithmetic where it will received a rigorous treatment.
I have also tried to replace the somehwhat colloquiall language/tone with a formal one in most parts. Removal of the personality section on Arnold Ross has been agonised over many times, but the final decision is to remove it. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 07:21, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

Because Wikibooks encompasses many books, pages such as &quot;Table of Contents&quot; may often result where it is unclear which book it may belong to.  Thus, to help distinguish a page belonging to one book from a page belonging to another book, a series of naming conventions must be used.

Existing wikibooks that do not follow these conventions are highly recommended to move their pages appropriately so that they conform to these conventions.

== Naming conventions for new books ==
By convention, each module is associated with a book.  The associated book forms the first part of the module's title (for example, [[Cookbook:Rice]] is part of [[Cookbook]]).  The books are thus arranged in a hierarchical manner.

Currently, only two sets of conventions are permitted for new books, and it is suggested that a book be conformant solely to one of the two.  It is permissible, but not recommended, for a book to mix the two conventions.

=== General guidelines ===
* '''Do not abbreviate the name of the book in the title''' - For example, modules that are part of [[How To Build A Computer]] should always begin with &quot;How To Build A Computer&quot;, and never in an abbreviated form therein, such as &quot;HTBAC&quot;.
* '''Use descriptive titles throughout''' - Just because a page is solely within the scope of a book does not mean that titles can be generic beyond the first level.  It is recommended that titles at all levels should give a good hint to the content of the module.

=== The subpage convention ===
'''The subpage convention is recommended for new books.'''

The subpage convention, where titles are given as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name/Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, takes advantage of the subpage feature of MediaWiki to automatically create a hierarchical structure.  Thus, a page in a book's hierarchy will automatically be linked back to the book's main page (using tags like &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;__NOTOC__&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  This is handy for any book that has a linear or tree-like structure with a narrow, well-defined scope.

Examples of books using the subpage convention:
* [[Wikijunior Big Cats]]
* [[Wikijunior South America]]

=== The namespace convention ===
The namespace convention, where titles are given as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name:Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, has its titles made in the similar of the namespaces found in MediaWiki, with parts of titles being delimited by a colon.  This is best suited for books with a more general graph-like structure, or if the book covers a wider and less well-defined scope (for example, [[Cookbook]]).  However, back-links to the book's main page is not provided by default, and must be written manually to each page.  This, of course, allows for flexibility as to how these back-links are created and written.

Note that Wikibooks reserves the use of &quot;WB&quot; for its [[Wikibooks:Shortcuts|shortcuts]], &quot;Transwiki&quot; for Wikimedia's transwiki conventions, and the use of any module titled &quot;bookshelf&quot; for general book organization.

Examples of books using the namespace convention:
* [[Cookbook]]
* [[Programming]]
* [[Wikiversity]]

== Naming conventions for existing books ==
In general, the naming conventions of a book should be enforced over the entire book, and new additions to a book must follow existing book conventions.  If a book does not strictly conform to either of the two conventions above, it is advised that they should be made conformant to one of the two above.  Naming conventions that have been previously considered acceptable but have fallen in disuse include:

* The hyphen convention: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name - Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* The disambiguation convention: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Section (Name)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, named for the convention used in Wikipedia for its [[w:Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages|disambiguation pages]]
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name: Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name / Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where there is no mention of the book name

== Naming conventions for templates, categories, images, and other media ==
For each book with the title ''Book Title'', the template subspace ''Template:Book Title'' and category subspace ''Category:Book Title'' is reserved for internal use by a book (for example, [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Normal Pokémon]] is an category internal to [[Wikibooks Pokédex]]).  All other templates and categories are reserved for either the Wikibooks proper, usage across multiple books, or future books.

It is recommended, but not a requirement, that images, and other media be named as per the module naming conventions.  As such, these pages should follow the conventions of their associated book.  The requirement for these pages to conform to naming conventions is less strict compared to modules as they often reside in the background.

In many cases these pages may span multiple books, in which case these conventions need not be followed.  Pages relating to the Wikibooks proper (such as policy pages) are also similarly exempt.

I'm very excited on this Wikibooks project.

Edit: As you probably noticed, I don't contribute to Indonesian Wikibooks anymore since Dec 2003. Too many vandals. If they think they know Indonesian enough, they can finish what I left off.</text>

== Dialog Pertama ''(1st Dialog)'' ==

=== Dialog ''(Dialogue)'' ===

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;MS.MERCY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Hai! Nama saya MS. MERCY. Siapa namamu?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AXEL:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Hai MS. MERCY! Nama saya AXEL. Salam kenal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;MS. MERCY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Salam kenal juga.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AXEL:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Apa kabar MS. MERCY?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;MS. MERCY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik-baik, Anda?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;MS. MERCY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik, baik, hati-hati AXEL!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AXEL:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Haha terima kasih MS. MERCY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;MS. MERCY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Selamat tinggal!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AXEL:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Selamat tinggal!&lt;/font&gt; 

Terjemahannya ''(translation)'':

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Hi! My name is KERRY. What's your name?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Hi, KERRY! My name is AUDRIE. Nice to meet you.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Nice to meet you too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;How are you KERRY?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good, and you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Also Good.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Where do you live?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;In London, you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Me too!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Sorry, I've got to go home.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;&quot;Okay&quot;, be careful AUDRIE!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Haha thank you KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Goodbye!&lt;/font&gt;

=== Catatan ''(Note)'' ===

This dialogue illustrates typical informal introductions. Note here that the dialog use ''&quot;nama saya&quot;'' to mean to ''&quot;my name&quot;'' and ''&quot;namamu&quot;'' to mean to ''&quot;your name&quot;''. You can use the phrase ''&quot;namaku&quot;'' as well to mean ''&quot;my name&quot;''.

To refresh our memory, note that the informal possessive pronouns are ''-ku'', ''-mu'', and ''-nya'', for first, second, and third singular person. For more review, you can [[Indonesian/Lesson 3| click here]]. The noun ''&quot;nama&quot;'' is the root of ''&quot;namaku&quot;'' and ''&quot;namamu&quot;''; and the suffixes ''-ku'' and ''-mu'' adding the possessive information.

Certainly, you can substitute ''&quot;namamu&quot;'' with ''&quot;nama anda&quot;'' for more formal situations.

The phrase ''&quot;salam kenal&quot;'' roughly means ''&quot;nice to meet you&quot;''. Note that unlike English, normally Indonesians don't say anything after the introduction and then carry on with the conversation. So, this phrase is not often used in introductions. It's up to you.

The word ''&quot;juga&quot;'' means ''too''.

The word &quot;pergi&quot; and &quot;pulang&quot; both can be translated as &quot;to go&quot; in English. Only &quot;pulang&quot; is strongly associated with home. &quot;pulang&quot; means &quot;to go home&quot;. &quot;pergi&quot; has always been used to point out where would you go to, anywhere else but your own house.

&lt;hr&gt;

== Dialog Kedua ''(2nd Dialogue)'' ==

=== Dialog ''(Dialogue)'' ===

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Selamat pagi, Pak! Perkenalkan, nama saya KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Pak WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Oh! Selamat pagi, KERRY! Nama saya WAKI. Apa kabar?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Baik-baik. Terima kasih.&lt;/font&gt;

Terjemahannya ''(translation)'':

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good morning, Sir! Let me introduce myself, my name is KERRY.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Mr. WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Oh! Good morning, KERRY! My name is WAKI. How are you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good. Thank you.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Catatan ''(Note)'' ===

This is a formal introduction, in casual situation.

The word ''&quot;kenal&quot;'' means ''&quot;to know someone&quot;''. In this dialog, we use the inflected form ''&quot;perkenalkan&quot;'', which in this dialog context means ''&quot;let me introduce myself&quot;''. It is actually the command form of ''&quot;memperkenalkan&quot;'', which means ''&quot;to introduce&quot;''. Don't worry about how the words are composed. This time, you can just consider it as a single word.

The phrase ''&quot;apa kabar&quot;'' means ''&quot;how are you&quot;''. As we've already read from [[Indonesian/Lesson 1 | lesson 1]], it literally means ''&quot;what news&quot;''.

The phrase ''&quot;terima kasih&quot;'' means ''&quot;thank you&quot;''. Actually, it literally means ''&quot;receive love&quot;''.

&lt;hr&gt;

== Dialog Ketiga ''(3rd Dialogue)'' ==


=== Dialog ''(Dialogue)'' ===

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;AUDRIE, perkenalkan, ini Pak WAKI.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Pak WAKI, nama saya AUDRIE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Pak WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Halo, AUDRIE! Salam kenal.&lt;/font&gt;

Terjemahannya ''(translation)'':

&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;KERRY:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;AUDRIE, let me introduce you, this is Mr. WAKI.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;AUDRIE:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Mr. WAKI, my name is AUDRIE.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Mr. WAKI:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Hello, AUDRIE! Nice to meet you.&lt;/font&gt;

=== Catatan ''(Note)'' ===

This dialogue is to introduce someone to someone else. You should introduce the older person to the younger one as a rule of courtesy, as demonstrated in the dialogue. The dialogue assumes that Mr. Waki is older than Audrie. The younger person must then respond by addressing the older one also for courtesy. You can follow it by stating your name again, like the example above. Or, you can just say &quot;Hai, Pak Waki!&quot; instead.

If both people are roughly of the same age, you can choose either one.

Note the usage of the word ''&quot;perkenalkan&quot;''. It is appropriate for both introducing yourself and introducing someone else.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Parallelograms==
A '''parallelogram''' is a geometric figure with two
pairs of parallel sides.  Parallelograms are a special type of quadrilateral.
The opposite sides are equal in length and the opposite angles are also equal.
The area is equal to the product of any side and the distance between that
side and the line containing the opposite side. 
[[Image:pllgm_Geometry.png|Parallelogram]]

== Properties of Parallelograms ==
The following properties are common to all parallelograms (parallelogram, rhombus, rectangle, square)
*both pairs of opposite sides are parallel
*both pairs of opposite sides are congruent
*both pairs of opposite angles are congruent
*the diagonals bisect each other

==Special Parallelograms==

===Rhombus===
* A '''rhombus''' is a parallelogram with four congruent sides.
* The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular.
* Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects two angles the rhombus.
*A rhombus may or may not be a square.

[[Image:rhmbs_Geometry.png|Rhombus]]

===Square===
* A '''square''' is a parallelogram with four right angles and four congruent sides. 
*A square is both a rectangle and a rhombus and inherits all of their properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Robbyjo - Your English is very good, but there are minor grammatical errors.  I would not mind gently editing your stuff if you will not be offended. The errors do lend a certain charm to the writing, which adds to the authenticity of the language lesson, but you may be interested in not having them in there.  Just let me know.  The [[Indonesian]] book looks great, and I enjoyed reading the &quot;Why learn Indonesian&quot; article. I used to speak (barely) Gilbertese (language of Kiribati), which has similar roots to Indonesian, and your points about simplicity and tense, etc. brought back memories of my learning Gilbertese. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 08:43, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)


Hi Marsh -- Sure you can edit this Indonesian book if you like. Thanks. I am sort of having a login problem so that I couldn't continue with the writing. I already set cookies and stuff and it said login successful. However, when I load some pages, it would immediately switch me to &quot;not logged in&quot; again. This doesn't happen with the wikipedia.org, though. [[User:Robbyjo|Roby]]

:Hi, Roby.  Something like this happened to me once.  Are you logging in from http://textbooks.wikipedia.org?  If so, try logging in from http://www.wikibooks.org instead and report to the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]].  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:36, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hi Roby, I just wanted to point out that the [[:id:|Indonesian wikipedia]] has been up and running (with the new software) too for some time, if you are interested in contributing.   The interface is still in English, but we'll be improving these soon enough.  We currently have one active user (not me since I don't speak the language), but maybe you would like to join in? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 23:28, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Sure thing, Kowey. I hope that I have enough time to get to it... [[User:Robbyjo|Roby Joehanes]] 12:46, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Lessons ==

Is there a chance of the rest of the lessons being completed soon? I would appreciate this alot and I'm hoping you'll get around to doing it because it seems the book hasn't been edited for some time.

The book is great, thanks so much for it.

My name is Terry, and I would also love for someone (Robbyjo??) to finish the rest of the sections. It was a great help to me, and I look forward to it's completion. Great job guys!!!

I don't know, but some people modify the book the way I don't want. Some changes are okay, but some others are not. I refuse to work further on this wikibook. (robbyjo)

:That is too bad, the current lessons have been a great help for me. [[User:Tijmen|Tijmen]] 18:04, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Slang Language ==

Hi Roby! I started Wikipedia entry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_slang_language
I hope you can also contribute to it, and perhaps, add Slang Language part into your wikibook.

== Sorry to hear you don't do indon book anymore ==

Who was vandelising?!??
Maybee if you are working on it you should say in big letters &quot;I am doing this book, anybody else wait til I am done, then make your contribution&quot; I personally wouldn't have known you didn't want any help.

Not that I want to be pushy, just giving you my perspective.

This page implies the colonists were united in their opposition to Great Britain, which was hardly the case. Its hard to fix without making things too confusing. There must be a term for the non-loyalists that could replace 'colonists'. 

Americans is a great term.

What about replacing the word ''colonist'' with ''settler''?

The United States didn't exist under Great Britain, silly. Refer to them as the 13 colonies. This page needs to be moved. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 04:00, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Deoxyribonucleic acid''' (DNA) and '''ribonucleic acid''' (RNA) are the information storage molecules and working templates for the construction of proteins.  Every living cell and virus encodes its genetic information using either DNA or RNA.  It is a true marvel of evolution that the vast amount of information needed to produce a human being can fit inside cells.

Friedrich Miescher first isolated DNA and RNA from used surgical bandages in 1869.  A series of experiments done by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty in 1944 defined DNA as the genetic information. They injected virulent encapsulated bacteria into a mouse. As it a result, it died. On the contrary, nonvirulent nonencapsulated bacteria did not kill the mouse. Also, heating the virulent encapsulated bacteria and injecting did not kill the mouse either. The surprise lied in mixing the heat-killed virulent encapsulated bacteria with nonvirulent nonencapsulated bacteria did kill the mouse. Avery's group kept isolating factors until they discovered what killed the mouse, which was the DNA. In conclusion, the nonpathogenic bacteria was made pathogenic by DNA transfer from a pathogenic stain. A.D. Hershey and Martha Chase's work in 1952 reconfirmed that DNA is the carrier of genetic information. Hershey and Chase's group conducted an experiment involving two phages. One of the phages was radioactively labeled with heavy phosphorus to highlight the DNA and heavy sulfur to highlight the protein. The two phages inserted their &quot;genetic material&quot; into the bacterial cell. Afterwards, these cells were &quot;blended&quot; to remove the phage heads. The resulting radioactively-labeled heavy phosphorus was found in the cell. This experiment showed that DNA alone was sufficient to make new viruses, and therefore, defined as the genetic information. Rosalind Franklin, Chargaff, and other chemists provided information that led to the discovery of DNA as well. Franklin provided crystallographic data that implied a helical structure. Chargaff's rule said that the adenine content was equal to the thymine content and cytosine was equal to guanine. Also the aromaticity of the electron-rich purine and pyrimidine rings allowed for tautomer shifts between the keto and enol form. The keto tautomer (lactam) dominated at physiological pH. Garnering all this information, James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA (double-helix) in 1953.

== Structure of DNA and RNA ==

DNA is a polymer of nucleotides.  Nucleotides consist of a pentose sugar (2-deoxyribose for DNA and ribose for RNA), a phosphate group (&lt;math&gt;H_3PO_4&lt;/math&gt;), and a nitrogen-containing base.  There are five nitrogen bases - adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine and uracil.  Individual nucleotides are connected by phosphodiester bonds to form polynucleotides.  

[[Image:DNA-labels.png|thumb|right|DNA]]
DNA exists as a double helix of two (2) strands of polynucleotides. According to the principle of complementarity nucleotides A (adenine) bases are bound with a hydrogen bridge to the T (thymine) or U (uracil in case of RNA) on the other thread and similarly C (cytosine) bind themselves to G (guanine). This principle allows for DNA and RNA replication and for limited possibilities of repairing the genetic information when one of the threads gets damaged.

== Difference between DNA and RNA ==

DNA is the permanent genetic information storage medium, found in the nucleus of most cells of most living organisms. RNA is, in the case of eukaryotes, the medium that transfers the genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where proteins are synthesized. The most basic structural difference between a DNA molecule and an RNA molecule is that DNA lacks an hydroxyl group at its 2' carbon while RNA has an hydroxyl group at its 2' carbon.

There are three major types of RNA:
* messenger RNA (mRNA) - temporarily created RNA used for transferring the information from the DNA in the nucleus to the ribosome in the cytoplasm where it is &quot;read,&quot; or translated, and a protein is synthesized.Each gene produce a separate mRNA molecule when a certain protein is needed in the cell. In addition, the size of an mRNA depends on the number of nucletides in that particular gene.

* transfer RNA (tRNA) - Is the smallest of the RNA molecules  and it is associated with the ribosome and delivers an amino acid to be attached to the growing protein. Only the tRna can translate the genetic information into amino acid for proteins. 
Each tRNA contains an &quot;anticodon&quot; which is a series of 3 bases that complements 3 bases on mRNA.

* ribosomal RNA (rRNA) - a major constituent of the ribosome with both structural and catalytic properties.

Additionally, by 2005, other types of RNA, such as siRNA (small, interfering RNA) and miRNA have been characterized.

[[Category:Biochemistry]]
DNA structure is typically a double stranded molecule with long chain of nucleotides, while RNA is a single stranded molecule     &quot; in most biological roles&quot; and it has shorter chain of nucleotide. Deoxyribose sugar in DNA is less reactive because of the carbon- hydrogen bonds. DNA has small grooves to prevent the enzymes to attack DNA. on the other hand, RNA contain ribose sugar which is more reactive because of the carbon-hydroxyl bonds. RNA not stable in its alkaline conditions.RNA has larger grooves than that of DNA, which makes RNA easier to be attacked by enzymes. 
DNA has a unique features because of its helix geometry which is in B-form. DNA is protected completely by the body in which the body destroys any enzymes that cleave DNA. In contrast the helix geometry of RNA is in the A- form; RNA can be broken down and reused. RNA is more resistance to be damage by Ultra- violet rays, while DNA can be damaged if exposed to Ultra-violet rays. DNA can be found in nucleus, while RNA can be found in nucleus and cytoplasm. The bases of DNA are A,T,C,and G, DNA is a long polymer with phosphate  and deoxyribose backbone. In contrast, RNA bases are A,U, C,and G, RNA backbone contain ribose and phosphate. The job of DNA on the cell is to store and transmit genetic information. RNA job is to transfer the genetic codes that are needed for the creation of proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome, this process prevents the DNA from leaving the nucleus, so DNA stays safe.

==Plasmid==
Plasmids are small, circular DNA molecules that replicate separately from the much larger bacterial chromosome can be use in laboratory to manipulate genes. Plasmids can carry almost any gene and they can passed it on from one generation of bacteria to the next generation, therefore plasmids are key tools for “gene cloning” which is the production of multiple identical copies of a gene carrying piece of DNA

=DNA Replication ;Semi-conservative replication=
In the process of DNA replication, as cells divide, copies of DNA must be produced in order to transfer the genetic information.
In DNA replication, the strands in the original DNA separate, and then each of the parent strands  make copies by synthesizing complementary strands. 
Enzyme called helicase will start The process  of  replication  by  catalyzing the unwinding of protein of the double helix. This enzyme can  break  the H bonds between the complementary bases. These single strands now act as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands.
The energy for the reaction can be provided when a nucleoside triphosphate bonds to a sugar (at the end of a growing strand), and  2 phosphate group are cleaved. Then a T in the template forms  H bond with an A in ATP, and a G on the template forms H bond with CTP.
After the entire double helix of the parent DNA is copied, the new DNA molecule will form . The new  DNA molecule is consist of one strand from the parent (original) DNA and one strand from the daughter strand( newly synthesized strand). This process is called &quot;semi-conservative replication&quot;.


== Recombination ==
Recombination refers  to  ways in which DNA modification leads to  distinct gene expressions and functions. Deletions, insertions and substitutions are the most useful changes implemented for the synthesis of new genes. Recombination techniques and  recombinant DNA technologies  has made possible  the modification and  creation of new genes  for specific  proposes.  These techniques helps clone, amplified and introduce  new DNA  into suitable cells  for replication.  Restriction enzymes  and DNA ligase play a  vital  role   in the in the production of recombinant DNA.  Vectors are useful for cloning. Plasmids or viral DNA (lambda Phage) used  to  introduced a  DNA sequence into a  cell is refer as  vector.

The semi-conservative hypothesis was confirmed by both Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958. The parent DNA was labeled with &quot;heavy nitrogen,&quot; the radioisotope of fifteen. This radioactive nitrogen was made through growing E. coli with ammonium chloride (also with &quot;heavy nitrogen&quot;) environment. Directly after the labeling of &quot;heavy nitrogen&quot; to the parent DNA strand, it was transferred to a medium with only regular nitrogen (isotope of fourteen). The proposed question was &quot;What is the distribution between the two nitrogens in the DNA molecules after successive rounds of replication?&quot; Using density-gradient equilibrium sedimentation, this question was answered. In this centrifugation, similar densities were grouped together in the tube. Afterwards, an absorbance was applied with ultra-violet light to determine the density bands of all the different kinds of DNA in the solution. After one generation, a unique single density band was shown. It was not exactly the band of heavy nitrogen nor the regular band of regular nitrogen, but rather halfway between the two. This proved that DNA was not conservative but semi-conservative due to this nitrogen hybrid. One generation after this one, there were two nitrogen-14 molecules and two hybrid nitrogen molecules. The probability and statistics of this second generation reassures the semi-conservative hypothesis.

As DNA strands can combine and form molecules, it can also be melted, resulting in separation or denaturation. It is important to note that the heat from the melting process does not disrupt the DNA structure, but rather DNA helicase takes energy from the heat, separating the DNA strands. The denaturation process occurs at about ninety-four degrees Fahrenheit where the double strands are converted to single stands. Absorbance readings were taken to reconfirm the denaturation process. When the DNA molecule is in its double-stranded form, it absorbs less UV light. In its single-stranded form, it absorbs more UV light because the single strand is more exposed than its double-strand counterpart. This is known as the hypochromic effect. In a PCR, polymerase chain reaction, it utilizes this denaturation capability in its primary step. Afterwards, it is then annealed at fifty to sixty degrees Fahrenheit. In this step, this is where the primers bind to their corresponding flanking DNA base sequence. In the last step, DNA polymerization, it requires a few ingredients: heat-resistant DNA polymerase, magnesium ion, buffer, and corresponding nucleotides. The DNA polymerase requires heat resistance because throughout the entire process, it undergoes a constant temperatures changes. The magnesium stabilizes the phosphate backbone. The buffer prevents drastic changes in pH, because if the pH lies near the extremes on the scale, it may denature the DNA so drastically that it will not recombine. This final step of DNA polymerization happens at the &quot;melting temperature.&quot; The melting temperature is the temperature at which half of the DNA is single-stranded and the other half is double-stranded. At this optimal temperature of seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit, the DNA is amplified with its respective primers, replicating at an exponential rate.

==Restriction endonucleases==
What's endonuclease?--Endonucleases are enzymes that can recognize specific base sequences in double-helical DNA and cleave, at specific places, both strands of that duplex. Many prokaryotes contain restriction enzymes. Biologically, they cleave foreign DNA molecules. Because the sites recognized by its own restriction enzymes are metylated, the cells' own DNA are not cleaved. One striking properties of endonucleases is that they recognize DNA cleavage sites by &quot;two-fold symmetry&quot;. In another word, within the cleavage site domain (usually 4 to 8 base pair), there exists a center, around which the cleavage site rotate 180 degree, the whole cleavage site would be indistinguishable. The following graph shows an example of how endonuclease recognize cleavage site by symmetry..After cleavage from several different endonulcease, a DNA sample would be sliced into many different duplex fragments, which are then separated by electrophoresis. The restriction fragments are then denatured to form single stranded DNA, which are then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, where they are exposed to a 32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probe. The single-stranded DNA are then hybridized by the radio active complementary strand. These duplex are then examined by autoradiography, which reveals the sequence of the DNA. This technique is named Southern plot,  after Edwin South, who invented the technique. The following image shows the steps for creating a southern plot. 

==DNA sequencing==
DNA subunits are dGMP, dAMP, dCMP and dTMP. In a DNA molecule, these subunits are connected in a way that their phosphate on 5 prime carbon are bonded to another subunit's hydroxy group on 3 prime carbon. If there is no hydroxy group on 3 prime carbon, then the DNA polymeration will be terminated. Utilizing this idea, subunit analogies were invented, ddGMP, ddAMP, ddCMP and ddTMP. These analogies have the same structure as their parent molecule except that they have hydrogen on 3 prime carbon instead of hydroxyl group. In practice, target DNA template is put into four polymeration environments, dNTP+ddGMP or ddAMP or ddCMP or ddTMP, respectively.. Statically, fragments with different length terminated at base, G, A, C, T will be formed, respectively. Then these fragments will be separated by electrophoresis, which will tell the sequence of the target DNA.

==DNA synthesis==
Although nature synthesize DNA from 5 prime carbon to 3 prime carbon, human synthesize DNA from 3 prime carbon to 5 prime carbon. The following monomer is commercially available for each of the base and is used as basic building block for DNA synthesis.  It starts with the subunit with the first base bonded to resin by the 3 prime hydroxyl group. The second monomer with its own 5 hydroxyl protected by DMT (protecting group) was activated on its 3 prime phosphate, which is attached to the 5 prime hydroxyl group by nucleophilic substitution. Then the phosphite is oxidized by iodine to yield phosphate. Then DMT is removed to make the 5 prime hydroxyl available for the incoming of the third monomer. The graphical representation is shown below. 
==Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)==
It is used for amplification of DNA. It includes three stages: DNA denaturation, oligonucleotide annealing, and DNA polymerization. In each cycle, the DNA duplex is denatured at first, then the primers for both strands (forward and reverse) bind to the desired sites and at last both strands polymerize to form the desired sequence. What needed in PCR are the DNA containing the desired sequence, primers for both strands, heat resistant DNA polymerase, dNTP and constantly changing temperature. The following image shows the detailed steps in PCR.
[[Image:PCR.jpg|thumb|center|alt=PCR.|PCR steps in graphs.]]

=RNA Editing=
== Introduction ==
Adenosine deaminases (ADAR) are mRNA editing enzymes that alternate a double stranded RNA sequence by tuning it. When tuning the mRNA, ADARs retype the nucleotides of the mRNA at certain, specific points they wish to change. Because ADARs can change the sequence of mRNA, they can create or remove a splice site, delete or alter the meaning of a codon, and finally change the sequence of the RNA altogether. ADAR plays a vital part in editing mRNA and modulating the mRNA translational activity and is mainly found in the nervous system and is important in regulating the nervous systems. Lacking the ADAR gene is very detrimental to health.
== Function == 
&lt;br&gt; RNA splicing and RNA editing are very similar to one another. RNA splicing is more of a cut, copy, and past process while RNA editing is an alteration of one or more nucleotides. There are mainly two types of ADAR that alternate the sequence of a single nucleotide. The first type of ADAR retypes cytidine nucleotides into uridine nucleotides while a second type of ADAR retypes adenosine into inosine. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; mRNA consisting of many inosine nucleotides in its sequence is known to be very abundant in the nucleus and only mRNAs that leave the nucleus can be translated. In this case, ADAR is modulating the translational activities of mRNAs. In modulating the translational activities of the specified mRNA, it is also modulating the abundance of the certain proteins that are expressed in the edited mRNA. Also, increasing inosine can stabilize the structure of mRNA. Hence, ADAR can function as an mRNA stabilizer too.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ADARs target the coding sequence, introns, and 5’ and 3’ untranslated reigions (UTR). ADAR targets the coding sequence by changing the nucleotide which then changes the geometry of the protein. Change in the geometry of the protein may yield to higher protein-protein affinity interaction. This high protein-protein affinity can improve biological reactions by facilitating those reactions.   Alternation of the non-coding sites such as introns, 5’, and 3’ UTR is still unknown. The only thing that is known is that alternating the sequence within these sites can create new splice sites. 
== Importance of ADAR ==
&lt;br&gt;Adar is mainly found in the nervous system because it plays a very important role in regulating the nervous system.  One of Adars’ primary functions is its regulation of the nervous system.  Adar regulates the nervous system by editing the glutamate receptors’ mRNA. These glutamate receptors construct the glutamate-gated ion channels which are important in transferring electrical signals between neurons.  When ADARs edit gluR mRNA, they change the calcium permeability of these glutamate channels. They can either lower the calcium permeability for certain glutamate channel or increase calcium permeability for other glutamate channels.  Regulation of calcium permeability is important to proper neurotransmission between neurons. 
== Disease connecting to ADAR ==
&lt;br&gt;Adenosine deaminase Deficiency (ADD) is caused by the lack of ADAR gene. Hence ADARs editing is important for survival especially for human.  Without ADAR, the body can not break down the toxin deoxyadenosine.  The accumulation of this toxin destroys the immune cells making its host vulnerable to infection from bacteria and viruses.  
Seizures can also be caused by ADAR.  Unedited version of gluR mRNA strongly causes seizures. When a seizure happens, the body mechanism increases the level of ADAR activity to edit gluR mRNA to prevent future seizures.


==DNA Replication:Initiation==
&lt;br&gt;There are multiple mechanisms that have been proposed for the melting of the DNA strand and the subsequent unwinding of the double helix during the initiation process of DNA replication. 

Two recently proposed models are E1 and LTag. These two models function differently to attain the same overall goal of melting the DNA double helix due to differences in their overall structure.

E1 model: In the E1 hexamer, there are six ß-hairpins in the central channel of the protein. They are arranged in a staircase-like structure. Two adjacent E1 trimers assemble at the origin point to melt the double-stranded DNA. A ring shaped E1 hexamer is then formed around the melted single-stranded DNA and the DNA is then pumped through the ring hexamer to from a fork that allows for the replication of the DNA.

Ltag: The channel diameters of these hexamers vary between 13-17 angstroms. The hexamer responsible for melting has an assortment of planar ß-hairpins in the narrow channel. Two of these hexamers surround the origin point of the double-stranded DNA and squeeze the area together.  This causes the melting of the dsDNA by forcing the breakage of base pairing. The two single-stranded DNA strands are then pumped into a larger channeland finally out through two separate Zn-domains. This allows for the replication of the DNA.

The two mechanisms here are built solely on the structural knowledge of the proteins involved in the process and as such more experimental support is needed to confirm. 

There are not an excessive amount of helicases. Currently, work is being done in discerning the more simple helicases, and trying to find the different mechanisms that they may have. While there are some similarities, for example helicases all seem to have a hexameric structure, there are also differences as well in their structures that contribute greatly to the differences in their mechanisms.

==Installing Linux (outline)==
Intro
*Oftentimes, installing Linux is hard because you want to keep you data/OS
*If not, (new computer, don't care about old OS + data backup), it's easier.
*Depending on what hardware the computer has and your experience level, the ease of installation varies greatly

===Do you want to install Linux?===
*Software
**(usually) compatible and equivalent for most purposes, and (almost always) free [http://linuxshop.ru/linuxbegin/win-lin-soft-en/ (table of equivalents)] (include narrower, deeper list)
*Performance
**Good idea!
*Price
**Not free but close
*Ease-of-use
**mixed ... getting better [http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/answer-bill.php3]
*Stability
**Good ... unless you get so hooked you start using nightly builds and unstable releases

Which of these goals apply?
*keeping data
**...without restoring a backup
*coexistence with another OS
*sharing data with that OS
**both ways?

===Can it be done?===
*Low-end systems are almost always fine (unless you have a 286 lying around)
*Can you backup?  (do you need to?)
*Does the hardware work? (see [[#Trying Linux]])

===Trying Linux===
*Floppy distros
*[[en:Knoppix]]/[[en:Gnoppix]]
**Very useful later on as well;  if it provides an Internet connection while you're trying to set up the main one, it can save you a great deal of trouble.
*Running Linux from another OS's partition.

===Choosing a Linux===
(or do you want a BSD instead?)
*Desktop environment (GNOME/KDE/blackbox/wm/console)

*Distros: ease-of-use vs. power, package management.  A visit to http://www.distrowatch.com/ should be mandantory.
**Debian
***Don't use the stable release (as of 2004, it is over three years old)! (unstable is better)
***For a quick&amp;easy install, get Knoppix 3.3 or later and install that.
***Otherwise, be sure to have an Internet connection and be prepared to learn a lot.

===Stuff you should learn===
*Basic command line manipulation
*Text editor: [[en:vi|vi]]/[[en:EMACS|EMACS]]
*Recompiling the kernel (not that hard, may be necessary).
*Using [[en:Lynx (browser)|Lynx]]

===Getting Linux===
*Download
**CD
**Spare partition
*Network install
**CD
**Floppies
**Spare partition
*Buy a CD/DVD
**price/donations
*Buy a computer with Linux on it
**Skip to [[Using Linux]]

===Dual-booting===
*Nodestructive repartitioning
**defragment first!
**FAT - FIPS
**NTFS - ntfsresize
*Backup and reinstall
**writable CD/DVD
**network
**tape
===(Re)partitioning===
*unnessecary sometimes, with FAT partitions
**but you probably want to do it anyways
*what partions you'll need to make
*ext3?  ReiserFS? XFS?
*how much space per partition
===Installing===
*You ought to already know enough about the hardware at this point.
*This has become a lot easier.
*But, know about your hardware, and be sure to have Internet access, in case something doesn't work.
===After the install===
*Data transfer/conversion
*Configuration
**security
**environment
*Proceed to [[Using Linux]]

==Computer Graphics: 3D==

Because computers are millions of times as fast at arithmetic than humans, they can be used to generate the 2-dimensional view of a 3-dimensional scene algorithmically.

'''Raytracing''' describes the process of simulating the straight lines that light follows as it bounces off objects into the viewer's eye.  Because determining the path of millions of photons is incredibly difficult, '''backwards raytracing''' traces the path from the eye to the object to the light source, so only one ray needs to be sent out per pixel in the finished product.

Here, the '''[[en:POV-Ray|Persistance of Vision Raytracer]]''', or '''POV-Ray''', will be used to demonstrate raytracing for the following reasons:
*It is free software, and availible on virtually all platforms, so it is accessible to everyone.
*Scenes are defined by means of text files, so examples are easy to follow and the underlying aspects of raytracing are more evident.
*The scene files are also modular as in a programming language, so it is easy to build off the work of others.
*''&lt;nowiki&gt;[plus, the author hasn't used anything else]&lt;/nowiki&gt;''
It may be downloaded from http://www.povray.org for Linux, Microsoft Windows, or MacOS.  The help files are extensive and can serve as indrotuction to ray-tracing on their own.

===Sanity check===
We will now render the original computer graphics clich&amp;eacute;: a mirrored sphere hovering over a checkered plane.  Enter the following text into &quot;&lt;tt&gt;lesson01-test.pov&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (Windows users can enter it into POV-Ray for Windows's internal text editor and save it as this when prompted)

&lt;pre&gt;
 /*Test scene*/
 #version 3.5;  //this code will work in POV-Ray version 3.5
 global_settings{
    assumed_gamma 1.0 //make sure that this looks the same on all monitors
 }

 background{
    color rgb &lt;0,0,1&gt;
 }
 //Objects
 plane{
    y, 0  /*normal vector, position along that vector*/
    texture{
       pigment{
          checker
          color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; /*green*/
          color rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt; /*white*/
       }
    }
 }
 sphere{
    &lt;0,2,0&gt;, 1 /*location, radius*/
    texture{
       pigment{
          color rgb &lt;0,0,0&gt;
       }
       finish{
          reflection{0.9} ambient 0.0 specular 0.5
       }
    }
 }
 //light
 light_source{
    &lt;0,0,0&gt; /*location*/
    color rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt; /*colored white*/
 }
 //camera
 camera{
    location &lt;-4,2.5,0&gt;
    look_at &lt;0,2,0&gt;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 250px;float: right;margin:1em 1em 1em 1em;background-color:#E8E8E8;&quot;&gt;
'''What's antialiasing?'''

The pixels on your computer screen are large enough for you to see individually.  Since the real world isn't made up of tiny squares like pictures on a computer screen are, diagonal lines and curves tend to come out looking jagged.  Antialiasing counteracts this by making pixels that cover an edge border an average of the two colors.  This looks better, but takes more time, as multiple rays must be sent out per pixel.&lt;/div&gt; 
Render this with the command line parameters &quot;&lt;tt&gt;+W320 +H240 +A0.3 +FN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; to output a PNG file called &quot;&lt;tt&gt;lesson01-test.png&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; that is 320x240 pixels and is antialiased.  If it goes too slowly, use &quot;&lt;tt&gt;-A&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;tt&gt;+A0.3&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; next time to turn off antialiasing.  If you can see the preview window and don't want to save the image file, next time, use &quot;&lt;tt&gt;-F&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;tt&gt;+FN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

If all goes well, you will see a mirrored sphere hovering over a green and white checkered floor against a blue sky.

===POV-Ray's syntax===
Programmers will feel right at home with POV-Ray's syntax, because it is inspired by the C programming language.  Whitespace and ends of lines are ignored (&lt;tt&gt;camera{location&lt;-4,2.5,0&gt; look_at&lt;0,2,0&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt; is perfectly legal),  comments surrounded by &lt;tt&gt; /*...*/&lt;/tt&gt; are ignored, as are comments coming after &lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt; on a line.  The scene file should consist of sequence of &quot;scene items&quot; (their order doesn't matter), where scene items are usually the camera, lights, and objects.

''A page about setting up POV-Ray belongs here.''

===How to use objects===
There are two objects in the test scene, the plane and the sphere.  Let's look at the sphere.
   sphere{
      &lt;0,2,0&gt;, 1 /*location, radius*/
      texture{
         pigment{
            color rgb &lt;0,0,0&gt;
         }
         finish{
            reflection{0.9} ambient 0.0 specular 0.5
         }
      }
   }
Change the &lt;tt&gt;&lt;0,2,0&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;0,0,0&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and rerender.  What happens?  

[....]

===Objects===
Objects are made of ''primitives'', simple and not-so-simple constructs like &quot;plane&quot;, &quot;sphere&quot;, &quot;isosurface&quot;.  They can be combined by means of ''Constructive Solid Geometry'' or ''CSG''.  CSG works by adding and subtracting primitives and is very useful for the creation of objects with a large number of simple surfaces, such as floppy disks and furniture.

POV-Ray primitives are seperated into categories:

;'''finite solid primitives''' :These are most like real objects.  The simple finite solid primitives include &lt;tt&gt;box, sphere, cone, cylinder, lathe, torus,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt;.
;'''finite patch primitives''' :These don't have any thickness.  They are &lt;tt&gt;polygon, disc, triangle,&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;bicubic_patch.&lt;/tt&gt;  Triangles can be efficiently grouped in very large numbers with &lt;tt&gt;mesh&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;mesh2&lt;/tt&gt;.  Usually, this is used for files imported from other formats.
;'''infinite solid primitives''' :&lt;tt&gt;plane&lt;/tt&gt; is the only common one, the others create surfaces defined by polynomial equations
;'''special math objects''' :&lt;tt&gt;parametric&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;isosurface&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to mathematically define complex surfaces.

The CSG operations are
;'''&lt;tt&gt;union&lt;/tt&gt;'''/'''&lt;tt&gt;merge&lt;/tt&gt;''' :Combine multiple objects into one.  &lt;tt&gt;merge&lt;/tt&gt; removes internal surfaces for use in, for example, glass.
;'''&lt;tt&gt;difference&lt;/tt&gt;''' :Cut out the shape of one object from another.
;'''&lt;tt&gt;intersection&lt;/tt&gt;''' :Remove all the shape that isn't in ''both'' (all) objects.

The &lt;tt&gt;inverse&lt;/tt&gt; keyword turns an object inside-out.  The difference is not visible with a plain object (because objects consist only of their surfaces and the surface is in the same place), but is very useful in CSG. &lt;tt&gt;intersection{object{A} object{B}}&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;difference{object{A} object{B inverse}}&lt;/tt&gt;.  (The &lt;tt&gt;object{}&lt;/tt&gt; syntax will be explained later).

For example, here is a coffee cup scene.  Try this out in &quot;&lt;tt&gt;lesson02-csg.pov&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

   #version 3.5;
   
   background{color rgb &lt;0,0,1&gt;}
   /*objects*/
   plane{ y, 0 pigment{checker color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; color rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt;}}
   
   union{
      difference{
         cylinder{
            &lt;0,0,0&gt;, &lt;0,2,0&gt;, 1 /*bottom, top, radius of cylinder*/
            pigment{
               color rgb &lt;1,0,0&gt; //red
            }
         }
         cylinder{
            &lt;0,.1,0&gt;,
            &lt;0,2.0001,0&gt; /*results are unpredictable when this is &lt;0,2,0&gt;
                           because it creates &quot;coincident surfaces&quot;*/
            0.9
            pigment{
               color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; //green
            }
         }
      }
      torus{
         .5, .15
         rotate x*90
         translate x*1.5+y*1
         pigment{
            color rgb &lt;0,0,1&gt; //blue
         }
      }
      translate z*1
   }
   /*light*/
   light_source{&lt;2,5,-4&gt; /*location*/ color rgb &lt;1,1,1&gt; /*colored white*/}
   /*camera*/
   camera{location &lt;0,3.5,-4&gt; look_at &lt;0,2,0&gt; right x*image_width/image_height }
Notice that the parts that we are not currently concerned with have been compressed onto their own lines.
===Standard practice===
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 250px;float: left;margin:1em 1em 1em 1em;background-color:#E8E8E8;&quot;&gt;
'''But you've been leaving &quot;&lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; out!'''

&lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt; blocks can contain &lt;tt&gt;pigment&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;normal&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;finish&lt;/tt&gt; blocks for objects with complicated surfaces.  It becomes inconvenient to write &quot;&lt;tt&gt;texture{ pigment{ color rgb &lt;0,1,0&gt; }}&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; if a pigment is all that's needed, so POV-Ray allows you to leave that.  &quot;&lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; should be used if more than one of the above blocks are included, or if that object has layered textures (more on them later). &lt;/div&gt;

As in programming, POV-Ray files can become unreadable and hard to modify if not written well.  The code structure is hiearchial &amp;mdash; you could have a &lt;tt&gt;sphere&lt;/tt&gt; which contains a &lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt; block, which contains a &lt;tt&gt;pigment&lt;/tt&gt; block, which contains a &lt;tt&gt;color_map&lt;/tt&gt; block, for example.  The ''general'' rule is that each level of hiearchy is indented one level further than the previous:

&lt;pre&gt;
sphere{
   &lt;0,1,0&gt;, .5
   texture{
      pigment{
         /*don't worry about the unusualness of this section for now*/
         bozo scale .4 
         color_map{
            [0.0 color rgb &lt;1.0,0.4,0.4&gt;]
            [1.0 color rgb &lt;0.1,0.4,0.9&gt;]
         }
       }
       finish{ specular 1.0 diffuse 0.4}
   }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Notice that the rule was violated in the above example - the &lt;tt&gt;finish&lt;/tt&gt; block was squished onto one line.  Well, this &lt;tt&gt;finish&lt;/tt&gt; statement us very short (they almost always are), and one can save space and make the code ''more'' legible by violating the rule for simple statements, especially those deep in the hiearchy.

===Colors===
How does one represent colors in text?  Simple names like &quot;red&quot; and &quot;magenta&quot; aren't good enough for duplicating that &lt;font style=&quot;background-color:#F5E3E9;&quot;&gt;subtle purple-pinkish color&lt;/font&gt; on the [[Main Page|main page]].  Any color can be described as a combination of red, green and blue because of the way the human eye works.  POV-Ray represents colors as vectors of numbers between 0 and 1.  &lt;tt&gt;color rgb &lt;1.0, 0.4, 0.4&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; is a red color with extra green and blue added &amp;mdash; this makes it a light-red color.

Sometimes, a partially-transparent color is needed, like for defining colored cellophane.  In this case something like &lt;tt&gt;color rgbft 
&lt;0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6&gt; &lt;/tt&gt; would be used, adding two numbers to describe the transparencey.  But good-looking transparent objects require more than that, so we'll save that for later.

==Needed/needs consideration==
*standardized code formats
*should we introduce so many things at once? (copy&amp;pasting text files could be annoying, so maybe we should keep the number of things introduced low)
**how about a .zip or .tar.bz2 with all the files needed: one download, and instructions are of the form &quot;open Chapter07/specular.pov&quot;?
*&lt;strike&gt;standard sidebars? (&quot;what's antialiasing?&quot; &quot;why'd &lt;tt&gt;texture&lt;/tt&gt; disappear?&quot; &quot;How do I do this?&quot;)&lt;/strike&gt;</text>

==Introduction==
Logic is the study of the way we reason. In this chapter, we focus on the ''methods'' of logical reasoning, i.e. digital logic, predicate calculus, application to proofs and the (insanely) fun logical puzzles.

==Boolean algebra==
In the black and white world of ideals, there is absolute truth. That is to say ''everything'' is either '''true''' or '''false'''. With this philosophical backdrop, we consider the following examples:
&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;One plus one equals two.&quot; True or false?

That is (without a doubt) true!

:&quot;1 + 1 = 2 AND 2 + 2 = 4.&quot; True or false?
That is also true.

But what about:
:&quot;1 + 1 = 3 OR Sydney is in Australia&quot; True or false?
It is true! Although 1 + 1 = 3 is not true, the OR in the statement made it so that if either part of the statement is true then the whole statement is true.

Now let's consider a more puzzling example
:&quot;2 + 2 = 4 OR 1 + 1 = 3 AND 1 - 3 = -1&quot; True or false?
The truth or falsity of the statements depends on the ''order'' in which you evaluate the statement. If you evaluate &quot;2 + 2 = 4 OR 1 + 1 = 3&quot; first, the statement is false, and otherwise true. As in ordinary algebra, it is necessary that we define some rules to govern the order of evaluation, so we don't have to deal with ambiguity.

Before we decide which order to evaluate the statements in, we do what most mathematician love to do -- replace sentences with symbols.&lt;br&gt;
Let ''x'' represent the truth or falsity of the statement 2 + 2 = 4.&lt;br&gt;
Let ''y'' represent the truth or falsity of the statement 1 + 1 = 3.&lt;br&gt;
Let ''z'' represent the truth or falsity of the statement 1 - 3 = -1.&lt;br&gt;

Then the above example can be rewritten in a more compact way:&lt;br&gt;
:x OR y AND z

To go one step further, mathematicians also replace OR by + and AND by &amp;times;, the statement becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;x + y \times z&lt;/math&gt;

Now that the order of precedence is clear. We evaluate (y AND z) first and then OR it with x. The statement &quot;x + yz&quot; is true, or symbolically
: x + yz = 1
where the number 1 represents &quot;true&quot;.

There is a good reason why we choose the multiplicative sign for the AND operation. As we shall see later, we can draw some parallels between the AND operation and multiplication.

The Boolean algebra we are about to investigate is named after the British mathematician George Boole. Boolean algebra is about two things -- &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; which are often represented by the numbers 1 and 0 respectively. Alternative, T and F are also used.

Boolean algebra has operations (AND and OR) analogous to the ordinary algebra that we know and love.

===Basic Truth tables===
We have all had to memorize the 9 by 9 multiplication table and now we know it all by heart. In Boolean algebra, the idea of a truth table is somewhat similar.

Let's consider the AND operation which is analogous to the multiplication. We want to consider:
:x AND y
where and ''x'' and ''y'' each represent a true or false statement (e.g. It is raining today). It is true if and only if both ''x'' and ''y'' are true, in table form:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The AND function
|-
! x
! y
! x AND y
|-
| F || F || &lt;center&gt;F&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| F || T || &lt;center&gt;F&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| T || F || &lt;center&gt;F&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| T || T || &lt;center&gt;T&lt;/center&gt;
|}

We shall use 1 instead of T and 0 instead of F from now on.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The AND function
|-
! x
! y
! x AND y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

Now you should be able to see why we say AND is analogous to multiplication, we shall replace the AND by &amp;times;, so '''x AND y''' becomes '''x&amp;times;y''' (or just ''xy''). From the AND truth table, we have:
:0 &amp;times; 0 = 0
:0 &amp;times; 1 = 0
:1 &amp;times; 0 = 0
:1 &amp;times; 1 = 1

To the OR operation. ''' ''x'' OR ''y'' ''' is FALSE if and only if both ''x'' and ''y'' are false. In table form:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The OR function
|-
! x
! y
! x OR y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

We say OR is almost analoguous to addition. We shall illustrate this by replacing OR with +:
:0 + 0 = 0
:0 + 1 = 1
:1 + 0 = 1
:1 + 1 = 1 (like 1 OR 1 is 1)

The NOT operation is not a ''binary operation'' like AND and OR, but a ''unary operation'', meaning it works with one argument. '''NOT ''x'' ''' is true if ''x'' is false and ''false'' if ''x'' is true. In table form:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;3&quot; | The NOT function
|-
! ''x''
! NOT ''x''
|-
| 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|}

In symbolic form, '''NOT''' x is denoted x' or ~x (or by a bar over the top of x). 

'''Alternative notations:'''
:&lt;math&gt;x \times y = x \wedge y&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;x + y = x \vee y&lt;/math&gt;

===Compound truth tables===
The three truth tables presented above are the most basic of truth tables and they serve as the building blocks for more complex ones. Suppose we want to construct a truth table for xy + z (i.e. x AND y OR z). Notice this table involves three variables (x, y and z), so we would expect it to be bigger than the previous ones.

To construct a truth table, firstly we write down all the possible combinations of the three variables:


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! z
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

There is a pattern to the way the combinations are written down. We always start with 000 and end with 111. As to the middle part, it is up to the reader to figure out.

We then complete the table by hand computing what value each combination is going to produce using the expression xy + z.
For example:
:000&lt;br&gt;
:x = 0, y = 0 and z = 0&lt;br&gt;
:xy + z = 0

:001&lt;br&gt;
:x = 0, y = 0 and z = 1&lt;br&gt;
:xy + z = 1

We continue in this way until we fill up the whole table

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | z 
! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | xyORz
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

The procedure we follow to produce truth tables are now clear. Here are a few more examples of truth tables.

'''Example 1 -- x + y + z'''

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x

! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | x+y+z
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-

|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

''' Example 2 -- (x + yz)' '''

====Exercise====
Produce the truth tables for the following operations:
# NAND: x NAND y = NOT (x AND y)
# NOR: x NOR y = NOT (x OR y)
# XOR: x XOR y is true if and ONLY if one of x or y is true.

Produce truth tables for:
# xyz
# x'y'z'
# xyz + xy'z
# xz
# (x + y)'
# x'y'
# (xy)'
# x' + y'

===Laws of Boolean algebra===
In ordinary algebra, two expressions may be equivalent to each other, e.g. xz + yz = (x + y)z. The same can be said of Boolean algebra. Let's construct truth tables for:
:xz + yz
:(x + y)z

'''xz + yz'''

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | z 
! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | xz+yz
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

'''(x + y)z'''

{| style=&quot;text-align:center; border-collapse:collapse&quot;
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | x 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | y 
! style=&quot;width:40px; border-bottom: solid black 1px&quot; | z 
! style=&quot;width:60px; border-bottom: solid black 1px; border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | (x+y)z
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 0 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 0 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|-
| 1 || 1 || 0 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 0
|-
| 1 || 1 || 1 || style=&quot;border-left: solid black 1px&quot; | 1
|}

By comparing the two tables, you will have noticed that the outputs (i.e. the last column) of the two tables are the same!

'''Definition'''
:We say two Boolean expressions are '''equivalent''' if the output of their truth tables are the same.


We list a few expressions that are equivalent to each other
:x + 0 = x
:x &amp;times; 1 = x
:xz + yz = (x + y)z
:x + x' = 1
:x &amp;times; x' = 0
:x &amp;times; x = x
:x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)

''Take a few moments to think about why each of those laws might be true.''

The last law is not obvious but we can prove that it's true using the other laws:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(x + y)(x + z) &amp;=&amp; x(x + z) + y(x + z)\\
&amp;=&amp; xx + xz + xy + yz\\
&amp;=&amp; x + xz + xy + yz\\
&amp;=&amp; x(1 + z + y) + yz\\
&amp;=&amp; x + yz
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

It has been said: &quot;the only thing to remember in mathematics is that there is nothing to remember. Remember that!&quot;. You should not try to commit to memory the laws as they are stated, because some of them are so deadly obvious once you are familiar with the AND, OR and NOT operations. You should only try to remember those things that are most basic, once a high level of familiarity is developed, you will agree there really isn't anything to remember.

====Simplification====
Once we have those laws, we will want to simplify Boolean expressions just like we do in ordinary algebra. We can all simplify the following example with ease:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
xyzw' + xyzw &amp;=&amp; xyz(w + w')\\
&amp;=&amp; xyz
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

the same can be said about:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
(x + y)(x' + y') &amp;=&amp; x(x' + y') + y(x' + y')\\
&amp;=&amp; xx' + xy' + yx' + yy'\\
&amp;=&amp; 0 + xy' + yx' + 0\\
&amp;=&amp; xy' + yx'
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

From those two examples we can see that complex-looking expressions can be reduced very significantly. Of particular interest are expressions of the form of a ''sum-of-product'', for example:
:xyz + xyz' + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'z' + x'y'z

We can factorise and simplify the expression as follows
:&lt;math&gt;
xyz + xyz' + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'z' + x'y'z
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=\ xy(z + z') + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'(z' + z)
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=\   xy + xy'z + x'yz + x'y'
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
=\ x(y + y'z) + x'(yz + y')
&lt;/math&gt;

It is only hard to go any further, although we can. We use the identity:
:x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)

''If the next step is unclear, try constructing truth tables as an aid to understanding.'' 

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
&amp;=&amp;\ x(y + z) + x'(z + y')\\
&amp;=&amp;\ xy + xz + x'z + x'y'\\
&amp;=&amp;\ xy + (x + x')z + x'y'\\
&amp;=&amp;\ xy + z + x'y'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

And this is as far as we can go using the algebraic approach (or any other approach). The algebraic approach to simplification relies on the principle of elimination. Consider, in ordinary algebra:
:x + y - x
We simplify by rearranging the expression as follows
:(x - x) + y = y
Although we only go through the process in our head, the idea is clear: we ''bring'' together terms that cancel themselves out and so the expression is simplified.

====De Morgan's theorems====
So far we have only dealt with expressions in the form of a ''sum of products'' e.g. xyz + x'z + y'z'. De Morgan's theorems help us to deal with another type of Boolean expressions. We revisit the AND and OR truth tables:

&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! x &amp;times; y
! x + y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

You would be correct to suspect that the two operations are connected somehow due to the similarities between the two tables. In fact, if you invert the AND operation, i.e. you perform the NOT operations on x AND y. The outputs of the two operations are almost the same:
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! (x &amp;times; y)'
! x + y
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

The connection between AND, OR and NOT is revealed by ''reversing'' the output of x + y by replacing it with x' + y'.
&lt;center&gt;
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! (x &amp;times; y)'
! x' + y'
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt; || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|}&lt;/center&gt;

Now the two outputs match and so we can equate them:
:(xy)' = x' + y'
this is one of de Morgan's laws. The other which can be derived using a similar process is:
:(x + y)' = x'y'
We can apply those two laws to simplify equations:

'''Example 1'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; (ab' + c)'\\
&amp;=&amp; (ab')'c'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a' + b)c'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'c' + bc'
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 2'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; (a + b + c)'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a + b)'c'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'b'c'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;This points to a possible extension of De Morgan's laws to 3 or more variables.

'''Example 3'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; [(a' + c)\cdot (b + d')]'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a' + c)' + (b + d')'\\ 
&amp;=&amp; ac' + b'd\\ 
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 4'''&lt;br&gt;
Express ''x'' in ''sum of product'' form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x
&amp;=&amp; [(a + bc)\cdot (d + ef)]'\\
&amp;=&amp; (a + bc)' + (d + ef)'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'(bc)' + d'(ef)'\\
&amp;=&amp; a'(b' + c') + d'(e' + f')\\
&amp;=&amp; a'b' + a'c' + d'e' + d'f'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Another thing of interest we learnt is that we can ''reverse'' the truth table of any expression by replacing each of its variables by their opposites, i.e. replace x by x' and y' by y etc. This result shouldn't have been a surprise at all, try a few examples yourself.

'''De Morgan's laws'''
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(x + y)' = x'y'&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(xy)' = x' + y'&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Exercise====
# Express in simplified sum-of-product form:
## z = ab'c' + ab'c + abc
## z = ab(c + d)
## z = (a + b)(c + d + f)
## z = a'c(a'bd)' + a'bc'd' + ab'c
## z = (a' + b)(a + b + d)d'
# Show that x + yz is equivalent to (x + y)(x + z)

== Propositions ==

We have been dealing with propositions since the start of this chapter, although we are not told they are propositions. A proposition is simply a statement (or sentence) that is either TRUE or FALSE. Hence, we can use Boolean algebra to handle propositions. 

There are two special types of propositions --  tautology and contradiction. A tautology is a proposition that is always TRUE, e.g. &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot;. A contradiction is the opposite of a tautology, it is a proposition that is always FALSE, e.g. 1 + 1 = 3. As usual, we use 1 to represent TRUE and 0 to represent FALSE. Please note that opinions are not propositions, e.g. &quot;42 is an awesome number&quot; is just an opinion, its truth or falsity is not universal, meaning some think it's true, some do not.

=== Examples ===

* &quot;It is raining today&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;Sydney is in Australia&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 16&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;Earth is a perfect sphere&quot; is a proposition.
* &quot;How do you do?&quot; is ''not'' a proposition - it's a question.
* &quot;Go clean your room!&quot; is ''not'' a proposition - it's a command.
* &quot;Martians exist&quot; is a proposition.

Since each proposition can only take two values (TRUE or FALSE), we can represent each by a ''variable'' and decide whether compound propositions are true by using Boolean algebra, just like we have been doing. For example &quot;It is always hot in Antarctica OR 1 + 1 = 2&quot; will be evaluated as true.

===Implications===
Propositions of the type if ''something'' ''something'' then ''something'' ''something'' are called implications. The logic of implications are widely applicable in mathematics, computer science and general everyday common sense reasoning!
Let's start with a simple example
:&quot;'''If''' 1 + 1 = 2 '''then''' 2 - 1 = 1&quot;
is an example of implication, it simply says that 2 - 1 = 1 is a consequence of 1 + 1 = 2. It's like a cause and effect relationship. Consider this example:
:John says: &quot;''If'' I become a millionaire, ''then'' I will donate $500,000 to the Red Cross.&quot;
There are four situations:
:#John becomes a millionaire and donates $500,000 to the Red Cross
:#John becomes a millionaire and does not donate $500,000 to the Red Cross
:#John does not become a millionaire and donates $500,000 to the Red Cross
:#John does not become a millionaire and does not donate $500,000 to the Red Cross
In which of the four situations did John NOT fulfill his promise? Clearly, if and only if the second situation occurred. So, we say the proposition is FALSE if and only if John becomes a millionaire and does not donate. If John did not become a millionaire then he can't break his promise, because his promise is now claiming nothing, therefore it must be evaluated TRUE.

If ''x'' and ''y'' are two propositions, ''x'' implies ''y'' (if ''x'' then ''y''), or symbolically
:&lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
has the following truth table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! &lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

For emphasis, &lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; is FALSE if and only if ''x'' is true and ''y'' false. If ''x'' is FALSE, it does not matter what value ''y'' takes, the proposition is automatically TRUE. On a side note, the two propositions ''x'' and ''y'' need not have anything to do with each other, e.g. &quot;1 + 1 = 2 implies Australia is in the southern hemisphere&quot; evaluates to TRUE!

If
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) \ \mbox{AND} \ (y \Rightarrow x)&lt;/math&gt;
then we express it symbolically as 
:&lt;math&gt;x \Leftrightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;.
It is a two way implication which translates to ''x'' is TRUE if and only if ''y'' is true. The ''if and only if'' operation has the following truth table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
! x
! y
! &lt;math&gt;x \Leftrightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 0 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 0 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 0 || &lt;center&gt;0&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1 || 1 || &lt;center&gt;1&lt;/center&gt;
|}

The two new operations we have introduced are not really new, they are just combinations of AND, OR and NOT. For example:
:&lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y = x' + y&lt;/math&gt;
''Check it with a truth table''. Because we can express the ''implication'' operations in terms of AND, OR and NOT, we have open them to manipulation by Boolean algebra and de Morgan's laws.

'''Example 1'''&lt;br&gt;
Is the following proposition a tautology (a proposition that's always true)
:&lt;math&gt;[(x \Rightarrow y)(y \Rightarrow z)] \Rightarrow (x \Rightarrow z)&lt;/math&gt;
'''Solution 1'''&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ [(x \Rightarrow y)(y \Rightarrow z)] \Rightarrow (x \Rightarrow z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ [(x' + y)(y' + z)]' + (x' + z)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ (x' + y)' + (y' + z)' + x' + z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ xy' + yz' + x' + z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ y' + y + x' + z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\ 1&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore it's a tautology.

'''Solution 2'''&lt;br&gt;
A somewhat easier solution is to draw up a truth table of the proposition, and note that the output column are all 1s. Therefore the proposition is a tautology, because the output is 1 regardless of the ''inputs'' (i.e. x, y and z).

'''Example 2'''&lt;br&gt;
Show that the proposition z is a contradiction (a proposition that is always false):
:z = xy(x + y)'

'''Solution'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
z 
&amp;=&amp; xy(x + y)'\\
&amp;=&amp; xy(x'y')\\
&amp;=&amp; 0\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore it's a contradiction.

Back to Example 1, :&lt;math&gt;[(x \Rightarrow y)(y \Rightarrow z)] \Rightarrow (x \Rightarrow z)&lt;/math&gt;. This isn't just a slab of symbols, you should be able translate it into everyday language and understand intuitively why it's true.

====Exercises====
# Decide whether the following propositions are true or false:
## If 1 + 2 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 5
## If 1 + 1 = 3, then boys don't like mud
# Show that the following pair of propositions are equivalent
## &lt;math&gt;x \Rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt; : &lt;math&gt;y' \Rightarrow x'&lt;/math&gt;

==Logic Puzzles==
Puzzle is an all-encompassing word, it refers to anything trivial that requires solving. Here is a collection of logic puzzles that we can solve using Boolean algebra. 


'''Example 1'''

We have two type of people -- knights or knaves. A knight always tell the truth but the knaves always lie.

Two people, Alex and Barbara, are chatting. Alex says :&quot;We are both knaves&quot;

Who is who?

We can probably work out that ''Alex'' is a knave in our heads, but the algebraic approach to determine ''Alex'' 's identity is as follows:
:Let ''A'' be TRUE if Alex is a knight
:Let ''B'' be TRUE if Barbara is a knight
:There are ''two'' situations, either:
::Alex is a knight and what he says is TRUE, OR 
::he is NOT a knight and what he says is FALSE.
:There we have it, we only need to translate it into symbols:
:A(A'B') + A'[(A'B')'] = 1
we simplify:
:(AA')B' + A'[A + B] = 1
:A'A + A'B = 1
:A'B = 1
Therefore ''A'' is FALSE and ''B'' is TRUE. Therefore Alex is a knave and Barbara a knight.

'''Example 2'''

There are three businessmen, conveniently named '''A'''rchie, '''B'''illy and '''C'''harley, who order martinis together every weekend according to the following rules:

#If A orders a martini, so does B.
#Either B or C always order a martini, but never at the same lunch.
#Either A or C always order a martini (or both)
#If C orders a martini, so does A.

#&lt;math&gt;A \Rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;A' +  B = 1&lt;/math&gt; (simplified from: &lt;math&gt;AB + A'B' + A'B = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;B'C + BC' = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;A + C = 1&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;C \Rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C' +  A = 1&lt;/math&gt; (simplified from: &lt;math&gt;CA + C'A' + C'A = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Putting all these into one formula and simplifying:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1 &amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (A + C) (C' + A) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (AC' + AA + CC' + AC) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (AC' + A + 0 + AC) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (AC' + A + AC) \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (C' + 1 + C)A \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') (1)A \\
&amp;=&amp; (A' + B) (B'C + BC') A \\
&amp;&amp;\mbox{Now that we know that }A = 1\mbox{ we can substitute that in:} \\
&amp;=&amp; (0 + B) (B'C + BC')  1 \\
&amp;=&amp; (B) (B'C + BC') \\
&amp;&amp;\mbox{Now that we know that }B = 1\mbox{ we can substitute that in:} \\
&amp;=&amp; (1) (0C + 1C') \\
&amp;=&amp; C' \\
&amp;&amp;\mbox{If }1 = C'\mbox{ then }C = 0 \\
&amp;&amp;ABC' = 1
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

----
Ten students are caught cheating on a math exam and the teacher wants to give them a final chance. He makes them sit on separate rows, each one behind the other, facing the board. Each one sees all others at the front (i.e. 10th row student sees 9 students, 9th sees 8 students, ..., 1st one sees no one).

He puts a hat on each student's head randomly, white or red. If at least 9 of them guess what color hat is on his or her head, the teacher will release them without punishment. Each student is allowed to talk once and may only say one word, which is his or her guess. They may decide on a strategy before starting to talk. Once they begin, they are not allowed to say or do anything else but guessing a color. Only one student is allowed to make a mistake. 

''What kind of a strategy should they follow?''

----
= Solution 1 =
The 10th student says ''white'' if she sees an even number of white hats 
and ''red'' if she sees an odd number of white hats (she will be the only one 
that could make a mistake). The 9th student now sees 8 hats in front of her. 
Say X of them are white. Now there are four possibilities:
* 10th student said ''white'' and X is even: She wears a red hat
* 10th student said ''white'' and X is odd: She wears a white hat
* 10th student said ''red'' and X is even: She wears a white hat
* 10th student said ''red'' and X is odd: She wears a red hat
The 9th student can figure out which case occurs and tell her correct hat 
color. From then on the students have to
subtract the correctly guessed hats from the total and apply the even/odd 
reasoning again (using what the 10th student
has said and counting the number of white hats in front of them).

= Solution 2 =

There is a slight variation on this solution by transformation: instead of wearing red and white hats, the students wear hats labeled 0 or 1. Let x1,...,x10 be the numbers on the students' hats. Let a1,...,a10 be the students' answers. The students answer in decreasing order as in the first solution. The answers are defined recursively as
* a10 = (x1+...+x9) mod 2
* a9 = (x1+...+x8+a10) mod 2
* a8 = (x1+...+x7+a9+a10) mod 2
* ...

These equations can be succinctly described as follows: each student sums up the numbers they see and the numbers they've heard. The student says one if the grand total is odd and zero otherwise. To prove that ai === xi mod 2, let si = x1+...+xi and use induction.

'''Base case:''' a9 === x9 mod 2

''Proof:''
* s8 + x9 === a10 mod 2
* x9 === a10 + s8 mod 2
* x9 === a9 mod 2

'''Inductive step:''' Assume ai === xi mod 2 for i = n+1, ..., 9
Then
* an === s(n-1) + a(n+1) + ... + a10 mod 2 (by definition)
* an === s(n-1) + (s9 - sn) + a10 mod 2 (by inductive assumption) 
* an === xn + s9 + a10 mod 2
* an === xn mod 2 (since s9 + a10 is even)

Thus ai === xi mod 2 for i = n, n+1, ..., 9

Therefore ai === xi mod 2 for i = 1,...,9 and at most one answer (a10) is incorrect.
= Solution 3 =
The 10th student will see 9 hats with only one or two colours. One of those colours has to have an odd number showing. The initial setup might be easier for the students if the 10th student just said which colour has an odd number showing. The rest of the students will be correct through the same logical reasoning as in Solution 1.

Solution is not up to the mark: how the 10th person will get to know the color of hat, if number of each color hats are not given properly.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|At|À|review-id=french-at}} ==
&lt;div id='french-at'&gt;
The preposition {{French/Word|à|IPA=/a/|audio=Fr-à.ogg}} means ''at'' or ''in'':
: {{French/Word|Nous sommes à la maison.|en=We are at home.}}
: {{French/Word|Il est à l'hôtel.|en=He is at the hotel.}}

The contraction {{French/Word|au|IPA=/o/|audio=Fr-au.ogg}} is used in place of ''à le'' (singular):
: {{French/Word|Je suis au bar.|en=I am at (in) the bar.}}

Likewise, the contraction {{French/Word|aux|IPA=/o/|audio=Fr-aux.ogg}} is used in place of ''à les'' (plural).
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- /french-at --&gt;

== {{French/Section|Dialogue|Is it going to rain?}} ==
Mireille: {{French/Word|Il fait beau temps !|en=It is fine weather !}}&lt;br /&gt;
Monique: {{French/Word|Il va pleuvoir aujourd'hui ?|en=Is it going to rain today?}}&lt;br /&gt;
: Monique could also use the question form instead of the intonation given above:
:* ''Est-ce qu'il va pleuvoir aujourd'hui ? (Pronounced eh-skeel)''&lt;br /&gt;
:or
:* ''Va-t-il pleuvoir aujourd'hui ?''&lt;br /&gt;
Mireille: {{French/Word|Non, il '''ne''' va '''pas''' pleuvoir, il fera soleil.|en=No, not raining, it will be sunny.}}&lt;br /&gt;
Monique: {{French/Word|Très bien ! Allons '''au''' parc !|en=Very well! let's go to the park.}}&lt;br /&gt;
Marcelle: {{French/Word|Apporte un parapluie, au cas où il pleuvrait.|en=Bring an umbrella in case it rains.}}

Interestingly, ''pleuvoir'' has only a third-person singular conjugation ''il pleut'' (present), ''il va pleuvoir'' or ''il pleuvra'' (future), conditionnal ''il pleuvrait''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Negation|Négation}} ==

In order to say that one did ''not'' do something, the {{French/Word|ne … pas}} construction must be used. The {{French/Word|ne}} is placed before the verb, while the {{French/Word|pas}} is placed after.

=== Formation and rules ===
Simple negation is done by wrapping {{French/Word|ne … pas}} around the verb:
: {{French/Word|Je ne porte pas mon manteau.|en=I am not wearing my coat.}}

In a perfect tense, {{French/Word|ne … pas}} surrounds the auxiliary verb, not the participle:
: {{French/Word|Je n'ai pas porté mon manteau.|en=I did not wear my coat.}}

When an infinitive and conjugated verb are together, {{French/Word|ne … pas}} usually surrounds the conjugated verb:
: {{French/Word|Je ne veux pas porter mes gants.|en=I do not want to wear my gloves.}}

{{French/Word|Ne pas}} can also precede the infinitive for a different meaning:
: {{French/Word|Je veux ne pas porter mes gants.|en=I want not to wear my gloves.}}

{{French/Word|Ne}} precedes any pronoun relating to the verb it affects:
: {{French/Word|Je ne les porte pas.|en=I am not wearing them.}}

==== Examples ====

=== Negation of indefinite articles ===
The indefinite articles ''un'', ''une'', and ''des'' change to ''de'' (or ''d’'') when negating a sentence.

Note that {{French/Word|le temps}} means both ''the weather'' and ''the time''.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To go|Aller}} ==
The verb {{French/Word|aller}} is translated to ''to go''. It is irregularly conjugated (it does not count as a regular {{French/Word|-er}} verb).

===Formation===
{| class=wikitable
!'''aller {{fr/IPA|/a.le/ (''ah-lay'')|audio=Fr-aller.ogg}} !! to read'''
|-
|je vais {{fr/IPA|/vɛ/ (''vay'')|audio=Fr-Paris--vais (je).ogg}} || I go
|-
|tu vas {{fr/IPA|/va/ (''vah'')|audio=Fr-Paris--vas (tu).ogg}} || you go
|-
|il va {{fr/IPA|/va/ (''vah'')|audio=Fr-Paris--va (il).ogg}} || he goes
|-
|nous allons {{fr/IPA|/a.lɔ̃/ (''ah-loh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')|audio=Fr-Paris--allons.ogg)}} || we go
|-
|vous allez {{fr/IPA|/a.le/ (''ah-lay'')}} || you go
|-
|ils vont {{fr/IPA|/vɔ̃/ (''voh&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;'')|audio=Fr-Paris--vont (ils).ogg}} || they go
|-
|allé {{fr/IPA|/a.le/}} || gone
|}

=== Usage ===
There is no present progressive tense in French, so ''aller'' in the present indicative is used to express both ''I go'' and ''I am going'':
: {{French/Word|Où est-ce que tu vas?|en=Where are you going?}}
''Aller'' must be used with a place and cannot stand alone.

In addition to meaning ''at'' or ''in'', the preposition {{French/Word|à|IPA=/a/|audio=Fr-à.ogg}} means ''to'' when used with {{French/Word|aller}}:
: {{French/Word|Je vais à Paris.|en=I am going to Paris.}}
: {{French/Word|Je vais au bureau.|en=I am going to the office.}}
: {{French/Word|Tu vas à l'école ?|en=You're going to school?}}

=== {{French/Section||Near future|Futur proche}} ===
An infinitive preceded by {{French/Word|aller}} is used to say that something is going to happen in the near future:
: {{French/Word|Il va pleuvoir demain.|en=It's going to rain tomorrow.}}
: {{French/Word|Il va faire froid.|en=It's going to be cold.}}
: {{French/Word|Je vais aller au magasin.|en=I will go to the store.}}

Recall that the negative goes around the conjugated verb.
: {{French/Word|Il ne va pas pleuvoir demain.|en=It's not going to rain tomorrow.}}

=== {{French/Section|Grammar|There|y|supplementary-id=french-there}} ===
&lt;div id='french-there'&gt;
In place of a preposition and place, the pronoun {{French/Word|y|IPA=/i/}}, meaning ''there'', can be used; ''y'' comes before the verb:
: {{French/Word|J'y vais.|en=I'm going there.}}
: {{French/Word|Nous allons au Mexique. Nous y allons.|en=We are going to Mexico. We are going there.}}
Remember that ''aller'' must be used with a place (''there'' or a name) when indicating that you are going somewhere, even if a place wouldn't normally be given in English.

The negative form of ''aller'' with the ''y'' pronoun has both the verb and pronoun enclosed between ''ne'' and ''pas'':

=Formulas=
Computing factors of polynomials requires knowledge of different formulas
and some experience to find out which formula to be applied. Below, we give
some important formulas:

&lt;math&gt;{x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^2+2xy+y^2=(x+y)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^2-2xy+y^2=(x-y)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^3-y^3=(x-y)(x^2+xy+y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^3+y^3=(x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc=(a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2-ab-ac-bc)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples:==

 :&lt;math&gt;{a^2+ab}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{a(a + b)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^2+3x+2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{ x^2 + y^2 = 2xy }&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{x(x + 1) + 2(x + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x + 1)(x + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

 :&lt;math&gt;{a^2 - 4x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(a^2 - 2ax) + (2ax - 4x^2)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{a(a - 2x) + 2x(a - 2x)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(a - 2x)(a + 2x)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{x^3+8y^3}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x^3 - 2x^2y + 4xy^2) + (2x^2y - 4xy^2 + 8y^3)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{x(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2) + 2y(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2)(x + 2y)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x + 2y)(x^2 - 2xy + 4y^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

 :&lt;math&gt;{x^3 + 2x^2 - 13x + 10}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x) - (2x^2 + 8x - 10)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{x(x^2 + 4x - 5) - 2(x^2 + 4x - 5)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 + 4x - 5)(x - 2)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)(x^2 + 4x - 5)}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)[(x^2 - x) + (5x - 5)]}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)[x(x - 1) + 5(x - 1)]}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x - 2)(x - 1)(x + 5)}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{3x^4 - 3x^3 - 2x^2 - x - 1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(3x^4 - 3x^3 - 3x^2) + (x^2 - x - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{3x^2(x^2 - x - 1) + 1(x^2 - x - 1)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 - x - 1)(3x^2 + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

 :&lt;math&gt;{x^4 + 4}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4) - 4x^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 + 2)^2 - (2x)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
 :&lt;math&gt;{(x^2 + 2x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 2)}&lt;/math&gt;

(name thorem)

write out the coefficients and if the end is equal to zero, than it is a root

example: &lt;math&gt;{9x^2 - 6x + 9}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{4r^2 - 12 + 9^2}&lt;/math&gt;

= Possible Factors =

To factor we must first look for possible factors. Possible factors are any number that might be a factor. Once we have a possible factor then we divide that number into the number we are factoring. If they divide evenly then we have a factor! The factor is the possible factor we found and the result of the division problem. Here is an example. Let's say the number we are factoring is 20. 2 is the possible factor. 20 / 2 = 10. They divide evenly which means we have a factor. The factors are 2 (the possible factor), and 10 (the result of the division problem). Now that we have a factor we start over with a new possible factor and find all of the factors. 

== Examples ==

'''Factor 12'''

First find all the possible factors

The possible factors are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and 12

next we will try them one by one

12/1 = 12 (1 and 12 are factors)

12/2 = 6  (2 and 6 are factors)

12/3 = 4  (3 and 4 are factors)

12/4 = 3  (we already have the factors 3 and 4)

Once we get a factor we already have then we know we have all the factors.

So the factors for 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

----

'''Factor 54'''

First find all the possible factors

The possible factors are {1, 2, 3 ... 52, 53, 54}

Do not worry this is not as much work as it seems!

54/1 = 54    (1 and 54 are factors)

54/2 = 27    (2 and 27 are factors)

54/3 = 18    (3 and 18 are factors)

54/4 = 13r2  (4 is not a factor)

54/5 = 10r4  (5 is not a factor)

54/6 = 9     (6 and 9 are factors)

54/7 = 7r5   (7 is not a factor)

54/8 = 6r6   (8 is not a factor)

54/9 = 6     (we already have the factors 9 and 6)

So the factors for 54 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, and 54

= Dividing polynomials =

The process of factoring will require dividing polynomials.  This form of division is not too different from long division method, and is known as ''synthetic division''.

Consider the polynomial x^3 - 21x^2 + 143x - 315.  In this case, determining factors may require trial and error (until you learn of alternate techniques), and when you do, you will need to divide the polynomial with the discovered factor. 

In this example, we will divide by (x-5).  The full division starts like this:

 1x -5 | 1x^3  -21x^2 +143x - 315

As with long division, you need to find the number used for subtraction and place it on top - in this case, you need to make sure the left-most term becomes zero.  Next, multiply the newly added top-most term with the left hand side to get the amount to subtract, and perform the subtraction.

                 1x^2
 1x -5 | 1x^3  -21x^2 +143x - 315
         1x^3   -5x^2
         ------------
               -16x^2 +143x - 315

Repeat until the division is complete:

                 1x^2  -16x + 63
 1x -5 | 1x^3  -21x^2 +143x - 315
         1x^3   -5x^2
         ------------
               -16x^2 +143x - 315
               -16x^2 + 80x
               -------------
                        63x - 315
                        63x - 315
                        ---------
                                0

(If there is a remainder at this point, place it as the numerator over the term being factored out.)

Some people may find writing the x^3 and other variables to be bulky - if writing on pen and paper, they can be omitted as part of shorthand.

            1  -16 + 63
 1 -5 | 1 -21 +143 - 315
        1  -5
        -----
          -16 +143 - 315
          -16 + 80
          ---------
                63 - 315
                63 - 315
                --------
                       0

In this case, factoring is straight forward since you can easily determine the number to use for the next step in division.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In a way, this book is about itself. One of the dominant trends in Constructivist theory stresses the social and cultural basis of human knowledge.  [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Wikibooks]] is a prime example of this idea. 
  
So, 
:Let us construct our knowledge about knowledge construction...
:Let us educate ourselves on what this entails for education...
:Let us get practical so that teachers can make a conscious effort to use constructionist theory with their kids...

Access to technology is in the schools, let's use constructivism with kids, even little kids to get them thinking and interested in learning for learning's sake. It needs to hit the grass roots and move once and for all out of the theoretical stages. Bridging, scaffolding, whatever you want to call it, children have to be exposed to this therefore educators have to understand the practical application. 

;:Is it realistic to suggest constructivism for very young children...
;;:Building on prior knowledge should be easy...
;;;:Access prior knowledge...
;;;;:Provide new information...
;;;;:Build or construct from there...

How about kids using blogs as well as wikis. Both seem to be naturals for constructivism. It is just up to teachers to figure out how to move from just posting a daily journal or daily assignments to considering the audience and engaging in responding, rethinking, analyzing. It has started at the university level and at the high school level; it is even happening in the classrooms of the younger kids. One thing though,  'defining proper use of blogs and wikis' , seems as if it would serve no purpose. It is important to know how blogs and wikis can be used, but it may not be constructive to define 'how'.

Teachers, you are already using this theory, building from the known.  Discussion and community is essential.
 
Guided Reading and Making Words may be considered constructivist. Below is a section of this page for specific uses and development of constructivist theories. Classroom teachers will need practical applications.

===Guided Reading===
Guided Reading is by its nature a constructivist application. One moves from where the children are, what their existing knowledge is, into the new learning in the story. And we are already doing it.

===Making Words===
Making Words starts at the knowledge of letters and sounds and evolves to an increasingly advanced knowledge of words.

== The Alphabet ==


The German alphabet, like English, consists of 26 basic letters. However, there are also combined letters and three umlauted forms (an ''umlaut'' is the pair of dots placed over certain vowels; in German, ''Umlaut'' describes the dotted letter, not just the dots.). The following table includes a listing of all these letters and a guide to their pronunciation. As in English, letter sounds can differ depending upon where within a word the letter occurs. The first pronunciation given below (second column) is that in English of the letter (or combination) itself. Reading down this column and pronouncing the &quot;English&quot; words will recite the alphabet ''auf Deutsch'' (&quot;in German&quot;). Note that letter order is exactly the same as in English, but pronunciation is not for many of the letters. In the list of pronunciation notes, no entry means essentially &quot;pronounced as in English&quot;.

&lt;!-- ALPHABET START --&gt;

== Deutsche Aussprache ~ German Pronunciation Guide ==

=== Vokale ~ Vowels===

German vowels are either long or short, but never drawled as in some English dialects. A simple method of recognizing whether a vowel is likely to be long or short in a German word is called the '''Rule of double consonants'''. If a vowel is followed by a single consonant &amp;mdash; as in ''h'''a'''ben'' (have), ''d'''i'''r'' (you, ''dat.''), ''P'''e'''ter'' (Peter), and ''sch'''o'''n'' (already) &amp;mdash; the vowel sound is usually '''long'''. If there are two or more consonants following the vowel &amp;mdash; as in ''f'''a'''lsch'' (false), '''''e'''lf'' (eleven), '''''i'''mmer'' (always), and ''n'''o'''ch'' (still) &amp;mdash; the vowel sound is usually '''short'''. There are some German words that are exceptions to the double consonant rule: ''bin'', ''bis'', ''das'', ''es'', ''hat'', and ''was'' all have short vowel sounds. It is also the case that the silent 'h' does not count as a consonant and the preceding vowel is always long. ''Ihnen'' is an example.

This &quot;rule&quot; is applied to the use of 'ss' vs. 'ß' (see below), in that 'ß' is treated as 'hs'. Thus, the vowel before 'ß' in ''der Fuß'' (foot) is long, while that before 'ss' in ''das Fass'' (cask) is short.

*'''au''' &amp;ndash; 'Ah-oo' is pronounced like 'ow' in English 'c&lt;strong&gt;ow&lt;/strong&gt;'. German examples are ''blau'' (blue) and ''auch'' (also see below under ''ach'' ~ unique German sounds).

*'''äu''' &amp;ndash; 'Ah-umlaut-oo' is pronounced like the German '''eu''' (ay-oo; see next). In written and printed German, 'ae' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ä' if the latter is unavailable.

*'''eu''' &amp;ndash; 'Ay-oo' is pronounced like 'oi' in English word ''''oi'''l'. German examples are ''neun'' (nine) and ''heute'' (today).

*'''ie''' and '''ei''' &amp;ndash; 'Ee-ay' has exactly the same sound as a German long 'i'; that is, like the 'ee' in 'seen'. 'Ay-ee' is pronounced like the 'ei' in 'height'. Note that this appears to be the opposite for these two vowel combinations in English, where the rule is that the first vowel is long and the second is silent. Consider this word: 'die' &amp;mdash; in German it is pronounced 'dee', in English like 'dye'. The word ''mein'' in German is the English 'mine'. In effect, 'ie' follows the same rule as in English, with the first vowel long (ee in German) and the second vowel silent; 'ei' is the equivalent sound in German to the English long 'i' as in 'm'''i'''ne'.

=== Konsonanten ~ Consonants ===

Most German consonants are pronounced similar to the way they are in English, with exceptions noted in column 3 above. Details of certain consonant sounds and uses are discussed further here:

*'''ch''' &amp;ndash; Pronounced like 'k' in many words of Greek origin like ''Christ'' or ''Charakter'', but like 'sh' in words of French origin, and 'tch' in words of English origin. The German ''sechs'' (six) is pronounced very much similar to the English 'sex', but with a voiced 's' (so it's more like 'zex'). See also the discussion of &quot;ich-sound&quot; below. The pronunciation of words with an initial 'ch' followed by e or i, as in ''China'' or ''Chemie'' varies: in High German the &quot;ich-sound&quot; is the standard pronunciation, but in South German dialect and Austrian German 'k' is preferred.

*'''d''', '''t''', '''l''', and '''n''' &amp;ndash; These letters are pronounced similarly in English and German. However, in pronouncing these letters, the German extends his tongue up to the back of the base of the teeth, creating a more '''dental sound'''. As noted above, 'd' is a 'dental d' except at the end of a word, where it becomes a 'dental t'.

*'''sch''' &amp;ndash; in German 'Ess-tsay-hah' is pronounced like 'sh', not 'sk' as in English. German word example: ''Schüler'' (student).

*'''sp''' and '''st''' &amp;ndash; Where the combinations 'ess-pay' or 'ess-tay' appear at the beginning of a word, the 'ess' sound becomes an 'sh' sound. German examples are ''spielen'' (play) and ''spät'' (late). An interesting &quot;exception&quot; is a word like ''Bleistift'' (pencil), where the inside 'sti' is pronounced 'shti' &amp;mdash; however, this is a compound word from ''Blei'' (lead) and ''Stift'' (pen). Some local dialects however pronounce all occurrences &quot;sharp&quot; (with an 'ess' sound -- typical for North German dialects, especially near Hamburg) or &quot;soft&quot; (with an 'sh' sound -- typical for the Swabian dialect).

*'''ß''' &amp;ndash; The former ligature (of 'ss' or 'sz'), 'ess-tset' is widely used in German, but its use is somewhat more restricted in very modern German (always pronounced like 's' in 'sound'). 'ß' is used for the sound 's' in cases where 'ss' or 's' can't be used: this is especially after long vowels and diphthongs (cf. the English usage of 'c' like in 'vice' or 'grocery'). Thus, the vowel before 'ß' in ''der Fuß'' (foot) is long, while that before 'ss' in ''das Fass'' (cask) is short. 'ß' appears after diphthongs ('au', 'ei', 'eu') because they are long. In written and printed German, 'ss' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ß' if the letter is unavailable. The  Greek letter, &amp;beta;, is not to be used as a substitute for 'ß'. Note that in Switzerland, 'ß' is always written as 'ss'.

=== German Sounds not found in English ===

There are sounds in the German language that have no real equivalent in the English language. These are discussed here.

*'''r''' &amp;ndash; German language has two pronunciations for ''r'': The more common is similiar to the French ''r'', a guttural sound resembling a fractionated ''g'', as found in Arabic ''غ'' or some pronunciations of modern Greek ''γ'', as well as modern Hebrew ר (the modern sound was affected by German). The second pronounciation is a &quot;rolled&quot; ''r'' as in Spanish or Scots. Its use is limited to Switzerland and parts of Southern Germany.

*'''ö''' (oh-umlaut) &amp;ndash; The word &quot;umlaut&quot; means &quot;change in sound&quot; and an umlauted 'o' changes to a sound with no equivalent in English. An easy way to get this sound is to think of it as the 'u' in the British word 'murder'. Commonly, the 'long ö' is made by first sounding 'oo' as in moon, then pursing the lips as if to whistle, and changing the sound to 'a' as in 'l'''a'''te'. An example word is ''schön'' (beautiful). The 'short ö' sound is made by first sounding 'oo', pursing  the lips, and changing the sound to 'e' as in 'p'''e'''t. A 'short ö' sounds actually very similar to the 'i' in 's'''i'''r'. An example word is ''zwölf'' (twelve). If you have problems pronouncing ''ö'', do not replace it by &quot;o&quot; but by &quot;e&quot; (as in &lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;lf) like in many German dialects. In written and printed German, 'oe' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ö' if the latter is unavailable.

*'''ü''' (oo-umlaut) &amp;ndash; As with 'ö', 'oo-umlaut' is a rounded vowel sound with no real English equivalent. The 'long ü' is made by first sounding 'oo' as in moon, then pursing the lips as if to whistle, and changing the sound to 'ee' as in 's'''ee'''n'. A simpler approach is to simply shape your lips as if you were to whistle, and then put some voice. An example word is ''früh''. The 'short ü' sound is made by first sounding 'oo', pursing  the lips, and changing the sound to 'i' as in 'p'''i'''t. An example word is ''fünf'' (five). If you have problems pronouncing ''ü'', do not replace it by &quot;u&quot; but by &quot;i&quot; (as in f&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;sh) like in many German dialects. In written and printed German, 'ue' can be an acceptable substitute for 'ü' if the latter is unavailable.

*'''ach''' &amp;ndash; The letter combination 'ch' as in ''auch'' (also) is called the &quot;ach-sound&quot; and resembles a throat-clearing (guttural) sound. It is used after 'a', 'o', 'u', and 'au'. It is pronounced somewhat like &quot;och&quot; in L&lt;u&gt;och&lt;/u&gt; Ness (lock, not loke) in its original form. The Hebrew letter ''ח'' and the Arabic letter ''خ'' as well as continental Spanish ''j'' are pronounced the same as the &quot;ach-sound&quot;.

*'''ich''' &amp;ndash; The &quot;ich-sound&quot; in German is also somewhat guttural, like a more forceful 'h' in English &quot;hue&quot;, &quot;huge&quot;. Another approach is to say &quot;sh&quot; while (almost) touching the palpatine not with the tip but with the middle of your tongue. In the word ''richtig'' (&quot;correct&quot;) both the 'ich' and the final 'ig' have this sound. It is used after 'e', 'i', 'y', 'ä', 'ö', 'ü', 'ei', 'eu', 'äu', after consonant-letters and sometimes at the beginning of words (especially before 'e', 'i', 'y', 'ä', 'ö'). If you have problems pronouncing ''ich'', replace with the sound of 'hue' or by 'sh' but never by a hard 'k' (never &quot;ick&quot;)! In some parts of Germany &quot;ich&quot;, as well as the final 'ig', is pronounced &quot;ish&quot;. In Austria and some local dialects of Germany the final 'ig' (as in &quot;richtig&quot;) is simply pronounced as in English &quot;dig&quot;.

'''Audio''': [[media:German_ach.ogg|OGG]] (37KB) ~ '''ach''', '''auch''', '''ich''', '''richtig'''

=== Syllable Stress ===

The general rule in German is that words are stressed on the first syllable. However, there are exceptions. Almost all exceptions are of Latin, French, or Greek origin. Mostly these are words stressed on the last syllable, as shown by the following:
 Vo=`kal    Kon=so=`nant    Lek=ti=`on
These words (not stressed on the first syllable) appear in the (Level II and III) lesson vocabularies as ''Vo&lt;b&gt;kal&lt;/b&gt;'', ''Lek&lt;b&gt;tion&lt;/b&gt;'' (in some regions: ''Lekti&lt;b&gt;on&lt;/b&gt;''), etc.

Words starting in common prefixes (ge-, be-, ver-, etc.) stress the syllable following said prefix. Examples are Ge'''mü'''se, Be'''am'''te, and Ver'''ein'''igung.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Tenses ==

As we learned from [[Indonesian/Lesson 4|Lesson 4]], Indonesian has no tenses. In order to express idea in different time frame, we need to attach time signals, such as &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot;, &quot;this morning&quot;, etc. These time signals are very easy to learn.

When you say a sentence without any time signal, we can never be sure what time frame it is assumed to be, if it is taken out of context. For example:

Saya makan apel.

The general translation would be in present tense: ''I eat apple''. However, it depends on the speaker on what it means. It may also mean progressive tense. The speaker may be eating an apple as he/she speaks.

Also, you can incorporate as many time signals as you want to express more specific ideas, as long as the addition doesn't contradict the exisiting ones and follows the &quot;general rule of thumb&quot;. This is especially useful since Indonesian has no notion of complex grammar such as future perfect.

=== Present Tense ===

To express habitual activity, we use present tense. In English, we use the form of ''infinitive + (-s/-es)''. In Indonesian, we use the time signal ''setiap X'', where X can be subtituted with ''hari'', ''pagi'', ''siang'', ''malam'', ''minggu'', etc to denote that the activity is recurrent.

Saya makan apel setiap pagi. ''(I eat [an] apple(s) every morning)''

Remember that when you mention a noun, it is uncertain whether it is singular or plural, as discussed [[Indonesian/Lesson 2|here]]. The assumption is always singular, but it can still mean plurals.

Here's a helpful word signals appropriate for present tenses:
* ''Setiap hari'' = Everyday
* ''Setiap kali'' = Every time
* ''Setiap pagi'' = Every morning
* ''Setiap siang'' = Every (around) noon
* ''Setiap sore'' = Every afternoon (but before sunset)
* ''Setiap malam'' = Every night
* ''Setiap minggu'' = Every week
* ''Setiap bulan'' = Every month
* ''Setiap tahun'' = Every year

Note: The word ''setiap'' may be shortened as ''tiap''. Both are acceptable in formal written/spoken Indonesian.

To indicate that the action is a habit, you can put the word ''biasa'' right before the verb:

* Saya biasa makan apel. ''(I usually eat [an] apple(s)) [currently]''

=== Progressive Tense ===

To express a currently ongoing activity, we use progressive tense. In English, we use the form of ''to be + infinitive + -ing''. In Indonesian, we use the time signal ''sedang''.

* Saya sedang makan apel. ''(I am eating [an] apple(s))''

The word other than ''sedang'' that can be used is ''lagi''.

* Saya lagi makan apel. ''(I am eating [an] apple(s))''

Be careful with the word placement. The word ''&quot;sedang&quot;'' or ''&quot;lagi&quot;'' are used right before the verb in order to form progressive tense. Be extra careful in the word ''&quot;lagi&quot;'', because if the placement is wrong, then it will mean ''&quot;again&quot;'' instead of to mean a progressive tense.

* Saya makan apel lagi. ''(I am eating [an] apple(s) again)''

You can also attach time signals to further reinforce your idea; such as: ''&quot;sekarang&quot;'' = ''now''.

=== Past Tense ===

Indonesian only has one notion of past tense, which is simple past. It has no notion of past progressive or past perfect tenses. (See below for further clarification)

As always, to form the tenses, we just need to attach time signals.

* Saya makan apel tadi pagi. ''(I ate [an] apple(s) this morning)''

To express undefinite past, Indonesian has these phrases:
* ''Sudah'' or ''Telah'' &amp;rarr; To express undefinite past (distant or recent)
* ''Dulu'' &amp;rarr; To express undefinite distant past
* ''Tadi'' &amp;rarr; To express undefinite recent past
* ''Baru saja'' or ''Barusan'' &amp;rarr; To express a very recent past (equivalent to &quot;just now&quot;).

Both the words ''sudah'' and ''telah'' literally means ''already''. It explains that the action has already happened. It is uncertain whether it's in the recent or distant past.

* Saya telah makan apel. ''(I already ate [an] apple(s))''

Note that due to English influence, ''sudah'' or ''telah'' are often used to express past perfect tenses due to the closeness of their meaning. See below for more.

When people are talking about distant past, the assumption is that the activity discussed is recurrent (unless the context dictates otherwise), especially if we attach habitual time signal. For example:

* Saya dulu makan apel setiap pagi. ''(I used to eat [an] apple(s) every morning)''

The notion of recent past is roughly limited to about last night. So, ''&quot;tadi malam&quot;'' means ''last night''.

* Saya makan apel tadi malam. ''(I ate [an] apple(s) last night)''

''Baru saja'' is roughly equivalent to &quot;just now&quot;. However, it can also means within an hour or so.

* Saya baru saja makan apel. ''(I ate [an] apple(s) just now)''

To express definite past, we can use the phrase ''&quot;lalu&quot;'', which roughly means ''ago''. For example:
* ''Dua jam lalu'' = Two hours ago
* ''Dua hari lalu'' = Two days ago
* ''Dua minggu lalu'' = Two weeks ago
* ''Dua bulan lalu'' = Two months ago
* ''Dua tahun lalu'' = Two years ago

Note that sometimes the phrase ''&quot;yang lalu&quot;'' is used instead of ''&quot;lalu&quot;''. They are equivalent. Literally, the word ''lalu'' means ''pass'' and ''yang'' means ''that'' or ''which''. So, ''&quot;dua jam yang lalu&quot;'' literally means ''&quot;[at] two hours that pass&quot;''.

Other words that may be useful to express ideas in the past:
* ''Kemarin'' = Yesterday
* ''Kemarin pagi'' = Yesterday morning&lt;br&gt;
(and you can repeat this for ''siang'', ''sore'', and ''malam'')
* ''Kemarin lusa'' = The day before yesterday
* ''Minggu lalu'' = Last week
* ''Bulan lalu'' = Last month
* ''Tahun lalu'' = Last year

=== Future Tense ===

The same goes with future tense: We need to attach time signals. For example:

* Saya akan makan apel. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s))''

To express undefinite future, Indonesian has these phrases:
* ''Akan'' or ''Bakal'' &amp;rarr; Undefinite future, either distant or recent
* ''Kelak'' &amp;rarr; Distant future
* ''Nanti'' &amp;rarr; Near future

Note that the word ''akan'' must be placed right before the verb, just like ''sedang''. See the example above.

The difference between ''kelak'' and ''nanti'' is on the distance to the future they are. Their usage can be combined with the word ''akan''.

* Saya akan makan apel kelak.
* Saya makan apel kelak.
* Saya akan makan apel nanti.
* Saya makan apel nanti.

The first two sentences are equivalent, as are the last two. The difference is that the first two implies more distant future than the last two. How distant? It depends on the context. The good rule of thumb is ''kelak'' usually refers to a time frame of months or years in the future, whereas ''nanti'' refers to a much shorter time in the future than that (i.e. days).

To specify definite future, the word ''akan'' can also be combined with other future time signals, such as ''besok'' ( = ''tomorrow'').

* Saya akan makan apel besok. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) tomorrow)''

The word ''kelak'' or ''nanti'' can be combined with future time signals too in order to specify a definite future:
* ''Dua jam nanti'' = Two hours later
* ''Dua hari nanti'' = Two days later
* ''Dua minggu nanti'' = Two weeks later
* ''Dua bulan nanti'' = Two months later
* ''Dua tahun nanti'' = Two years later

Note that when specifying definite future, the word ''kelak'' and ''nanti'' is equivalent. So, ''&quot;dua jam nanti&quot;'' is equivalent as ''&quot;dua jam kelak&quot;''. Usually people still follow the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; above. So, ''&quot;dua jam nanti&quot;'' is used more often than ''&quot;dua jam kelak&quot;''; and ''&quot;dua tahun kelak&quot;'' is used more often than ''&quot;dua tahun nanti&quot;''. However, people usually use ''&quot;dua bulan nanti&quot;'' and ''&quot;dua bulan kelak&quot;'' interchangeably.

Example:
* Saya makan apel dua jam nanti. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) two hours later)''

Note that the word ''akan'' can also be combined with ''kelak'' or ''nanti''. But ''kelak'' and ''nanti'' cannot be used together. For example:

* Saya akan makan apel dua jam nanti. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) two hours later)''
* Saya akan makan apel dua jam kelak. ''(I will eat [an] apple(s) two hours later)''

The two examples are equivalent.

Another good time signal to use for future tense is ''&quot;depan&quot;'', which means ''next'' (in next week, etc.):
* ''Minggu depan'' = next week
* ''Bulan depan'' = next month
* ''Tahun depan'' = next year

== Tense Combinations ==

As stated above, Indonesian has no complex tenses such as future perfect (i.e. ''will have + infinitive''). The way Indonesian gets around with it is to throw in the appropriate time signals. This practice is influenced by Romanic languages and sounds inherently unnatural to Indonesian people. However, you may do that and people may still be able to understand it, may be just a bit strange.

=== Present Perfect ===

Due to English language influence, people began using the words ''sudah'' or ''telah'' to express present perfect. This is because Indonesian actually doesn't have present perfect. So:

* Saya sudah makan apel. ''(I have eaten [an] apple(s))''

It's a bit weird, but it works. So you can use it if you want to.

=== Future Perfect ===

We use the phrase ''&quot;akan telah&quot;'' or ''&quot;akan sudah&quot;'' to indicate future perfect.

* Saya akan sudah makan apel besok. ''(I will have eaten [an] apple(s) tomorrow)''

=== Conditional Perfect ===

Conditional perfect is expressed using ''&quot;would have&quot;''. Unfortunately, Indonesian has no way to express this. The usual translation is using ''&quot;mungkin telah&quot;'', but that would actually mean ''&quot;may have&quot;''. This is very awkward situation. It sounds very unnatural. The best way translating it is to translate the sentence in its entirety in a different way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am trying to figure out how to start contributing some worthwhile material for an introductory text about Western Philosophy, as I am both a professor and student of the subject (having lived and taught in Asia for a few years, Eastern Philosophy is also an interest, but I have much less formal training in that subject). Unfortunately, my three jobs (see below) keep me ridiculously busy, so my time to contribute will be very limited and the pace of progress on the project undoubtedly slow.

Nonetheless, this Wikibook project interests me less because it will save college students some cash (though I think that is great), and more because it will provide quality educational materials to everyone, everywhere. I am very enthusiastic about open source software, and the collaborative power of the open source model in general. It can clearly produce amazing results outside the software world as evidenced by excellent resources like Wikipedia and her sister projects. Ultimately, I am a proponent of free of speech and thought, and am committed to the transformative power of education. I think it is one of the most liberating and empowering forces on the planet and should be freely available to people all over the world regardless of economic status, culture, language, or location.

What else, can I or should I tell you about myself?  I have a day job as a Technology Consultant at a mid-size university where I also teach both philosophy and technology courses (yes, I realize it is a seemingly strange mix). In addition I have a small computer consulting business in my home town.</text>

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[image:Orchid_lab_smver.jpg|Spathoglottis plicata]]&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Infloresence of the orchid, ''Spathoglottis plicata'' ([[media:Orchid_lab.jpg|enlarge to examine]]).''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
=== An orchid flower ===
This first laboratory exercise for Chapter 4 deals with the flowers of a ground orchid from Southeast Asia.  The photograph on the right demonstrates the descriptive terminology that can be applied to this species.  You may wish to read about [[Wikipedia:en:Orchidaceae|orchids]] to place this plant taxonomically and better understand unusual aspects of the structure of this flower. In reading the description below, be sure you understand how or why each bolded word applies to this specimen.  Also, observe that the flowering-through-fruiting sequence is well demonstrated in the photograph because each flower is in a slightly different phase of its life cycle from bud to fruit.    

:''Spathoglottis plicata'' Blume &amp;mdash; The flowers of this orchid are carried on an erect '''raceme''' growing out of the pseudobulb, each flower subtended by a green to purplish '''bract''' that becomes strongly '''reflexed''' with age.  The purple '''sepals''' and '''petals''' are similar and '''spreading''', elliptic to elliptic-ovate; the '''labellum''' is in three distinct parts: the lateral lobes narrow and erect, the middle lobe horizontal and cleft or 2-lobed. Lying above the latter is the narrowly '''clavate''' '''column'''. The '''inferior ovary''' in ''Spathoglottis'' develops into a cylindrical '''capsule''' (fruit) as the '''perianth''' withers.   

----

'''4-1'''. Review the photograph of the inflorescence of the orchid. ''Which one of these statements is true'':

:a) this inflorescence demonstrates ''determinate'' growth
:b) this inflorescence could as well be called a ''spike''
:c) the uppermost flower shows ''anthesis''.
:d) there are five petals, therefore this is a dicot.

Following are a series of photographs of flowers from various plants. ''Note that by clicking on the word'' &quot;Examine&quot; ''in each title, you can enlarge the particular photograph for closer examination''. Read each question and the offered answers carefully. All parts of answer choice must be correct for that choice to be correct.

'''4-2'''. ''The structure at '''B''' is'':

== Declension? ==

Like the editor of &quot;Pronunciation?&quot;, I'm attempting to learn Latin via this book, however, on the vocabulary lists māter, triclīnium, and templum don't match any of the nominative endings that we're given in the previous table. I'm assuming they're third declension, but clarification would be nice.


The last word in the first homework sentence should perhaps be 'malus', not 'magnus'. Would it be a good idea to give the English of these sentences in Lesson 4?

== Pronunciation? ==

I haven't read the book, and don't speak latin, but I'm hoping to and this might be a good section to add proper pronunciation of words.

I've improved upon the pronunciation section in the last page so that it's more than just a link.

== Example ==

I'm attempting to learn Latin from this book and seem to have spotted something inconsistent on this page. With the fourth example given in the
&quot;Examples&quot; section, &quot;poēta est bonus&quot; the declensions are different in gender. If this is an exception to the rule that all adjectives must have
the same gender, case and number as the noun it is describing, I think this should be explicitly stated, otherwise this could be confusing. - [[User:Nibjib|Nibjib]] ([[User talk:Nibjib|talk]]) 20:19, 1 June 2008 (UTC)


-Poeta is actually a masculine word, owing to the fact that it describes a traditionally masculine profession. There are a variety of words in the first declension that operate in this way, including nauta, poeta, and agricola. Furthermore, there are some words in the second declension, mainly trees, that are feminine. However, the most obvious example of cross gender words in unusual declensions is &quot;manus&quot; of the 4th, which is feminine, and not masculine as is the case with most of the declension.

-Asv


== Furthur Examples ==

Why are these different from the examples preceding it? The &quot;Furthur Examples&quot; say &quot;Triclinium magnum est&quot; is wrong, and &quot;Tricilinium est magnum&quot; is correct. Yet in the &quot;Examples&quot;, all the Latin sentences are constructed in this manner, i.e. &quot;Puellae bonae sunt&quot;, and not &quot;Puellae sunt bonae&quot;.

Which is correct? -Anam



Actually, in this case, and most cases, it does not matter because you can tell what it means either way. However, it is much more common to use subject-adjective-verb format, so one would normally use &quot;Triclinium magnum est&quot;. There is not a &quot;wrong&quot; sentence structure in Latin, although with longer sentences it may often be confusing, so it is usually better to use the common nom-adj-vb format.

-Froggyfred

...Except in the case of ''est'', where the neutral sentence is ''X est Y''. Moving ''est'' to the end gives you emphasis. Verbs that normally come in the middle of two nominatives are called copulative verbs (because they equate, or link, or ''copulate'', one thing to another). Some others are: apparēre, vidēri, manēre. Consider:

* Est puella. There is a girl.
* Puella est. It is ''a girl'' (as opposed to a boy).
* Puella est bona. The girl is good.
* Est puella bona. There is a good girl.
* Puella bona est. The girl is ''good'' (as opposed to bad).
* Bona est puella. ''Good'' is what the girl is (as opposed to bad).
* Bona puella est. What is good is ''the girl'' (as opposed to the boy).


* Puer videtur fessus. The boy seems tired.
* Puer fessus videtur. The boy seems ''tired'' (as opposed to energetic).
* Fessus videtur puer. ''Tired'' is what the boy seems (as opposed to energetic).
* Videtur puer fessus. He seems (to be) a tired boy.

Note that the translations are colloquial, not literal, because a literal translation would not convey the nuances of the word order.

See, for example, D'Ooge ¶28. --[[User:Robert.Baruch|Robert.Baruch]] ([[User talk:Robert.Baruch|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Robert.Baruch|contribs]]) 19:34, 14 June 2011 (UTC)</text>

= Grammatical Introduction to Verbs =

This introductory section may be a bit overwhelming, but is an overall look at verbs. The majority of this section will be covered in later chapters. Nevertheless, looking over this chapter may help you to familiarize yourself with verbs. 

Verbs are parts of speech which denote action. There are two main forms of verbs in Latin:

• Principal Verbs (the main verb which is found in every sentence. e.g.,: vir &lt;B&gt;ambulat&lt;B&gt; = the man &lt;B&gt;is walking&lt;B&gt;)

• Adjectival Verbs (also known as participles, gerunds and gerundives which describe the state of the described noun. e.g.,: vir &lt;B&gt;ambulans&lt;B&gt; = the &lt;B&gt;walking&lt;B&gt; man. The verb behaves as an adjective)

Every sentence &lt;B&gt;must&lt;/B&gt; have a verb. In a sense, the principal verb is the sentence and all the nouns, adverbs and participles are only describing the scenario of the verb. Thus in Latin this constitutes a sentence:

 &lt;I&gt;est.&lt;/I&gt;

If you want to explain 'who' is or exists, you add a nominative substantive:

 &lt;I&gt;Cornēlia est.&lt;/I&gt;

We now know Cornelia 'is'. But what is she? So we add an adjective.

 &lt;I&gt;Cornēlia est bona.&lt;/I&gt;

Now we can see that Cornelia is good, but to elaborate further we can add an adverb:

 &lt;I&gt;Cornēlia vix est bona.&lt;/I&gt;

Now we know that Cornelia is 'hardly' (''[[wiktionary:vix#Latin|vix]]'': hardly, scarcely, barely) good.

Thus, in English, the shortest Latin sentence is:

You are.

in Latin:

 &lt;I&gt;es&lt;/I&gt;

==Examples==

These two examples will demonstrate the difference between an adjectival verb and a principal verb.

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | The '''resurrected''' Jesus '''appeared''' to his disciples.
|-
| 'resurrected' is a ''perfect participle'' (Adjectival) describing Jesus, while 'appeared' is the ''principal verb'' in the sentence.
|-
| bgcolor=&quot;#CCFFFF&quot; | The '''shocked''' disciples '''see''' Jesus.
|-
| 'shocked' is a ''perfect participle'' (Adjectival) describing the disciples, while 'see' is the ''principal verb'' in the sentence.
|}

===Exercises===
{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
#What is the difference between a principal and adjectival verb?
#What constitutes a sentence?
#Write a sentence in English, and Latin.
#Conjugate the verb 'to be' in the present tense in English and Latin (I am, You are, He is etc.)
|
#Principal verbs are main verb which is found in every sentence.   Adjectival Verbs are participles, gerunds and gerundives which describe the state of the described noun.
#a verb
#Egō Sum, I am
#Sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt
  
}}

==Personal Endings==

Verbs in Latin are inflected to reflect the person who performs the action. English does the same to some extent in the verb to be:


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Latin || English
|-
| sum || I am
|-
| es || You are
|-
| est || (He/she/it) is
|-
| sumus || We are
|-
| estis || You (all) are
|-
| sunt || They are
|}

Latin, however, inflects all verbs, and is much more extensive than English, allowing writers and speakers of Latin to often drop the personal pronoun (as mentioned last lesson), as the performer of the action is understood by the formation of the verb. The Personal pronoun is only usually added for emphasis. In a way, the ending on Latin verbs are a type of pronoun.

===Exercises===

{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
# What do the personal pronouns indicate?
|
# Personal pronouns (ego, tu, nos, vos, etc.) add emphasis. They are usually omitted (left out) because they are understood.
#: Example: ''[Ego] amō [[wikt:pater#Latin|patrem]] meum et [[wikt:mater#Latin|matrem]] meam.'' 
#: I love my mother and my father. (you don't have to write ''ego'', it is understood)
}}

== Moods ==

There are several moods. Each has its own uses to convey certain ideas.  The most commons moods are:

• Indicative
• Subjunctive or Conjunctive
• Imperative

The two moods we will first learn are the &lt;B&gt;imperative&lt;/B&gt; (commands and orders) and the &lt;B&gt;indicative&lt;/B&gt; (declarative statements and factual questions).

=== Exercises ===

{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
# List the most common moods.
# What two moods are we going to learn about in this lesson, and what do they let us construct?
|
# Indicative, subjunctive (or conjunctive) and imperative.
# The moods we are going to learn about first are:
#: '''Imperative''': Which we use when we make orders.
#:: ''Go'' away. ''Fetch'' me the keys. ''Do'' not order me around!
#: '''Indicative''': Statements which are declarative, and questions concerning facts.
#:: John ''plays'' football.
}}

== Voice ==

There are two constructions verbs can have regarding voice.

Verbs can have either an active or passive voice.

E.g.  'I smash the car.' 'smash' is an active verb construct.

The passive is used when the nominative is affected by the verb. 

E.g. 'The car is smashed by me.' 'is smashed' is a passive construct.

=== Exercises ===

{{Latin/Exercise|Translate|
# What is 'voice'?
# What is active voice?
# What is passive voice?
# Construct a sentence in English using each of these voices.
|
# Voice is how a verb is constructed.
# When the subject affects the verb
# When the nominative is affected by the verb
#Ex.- I carried, I am being carried.
}}

== Tense ==

Tense in Latin comprises two parts: TIME and ASPECT.  Time reflects when the action is occurring or did occur: past, present, or future.  Aspect refers to the nature of the action: simple, completed, or repeated.  The &quot;completed&quot; aspect is generally termed &quot;perfective&quot; and repeated aspect &quot;imperfective.&quot;  

Theoretically, a verb could have nine tenses (combinations of time and aspect).  However, Latin only has six, since some possible combinations are expressed by the same verb forms.  Latin tenses do not correspond exactly to English ones.

Below is a rough guide to tense in Latin.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;5&quot; | &lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;Time&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
|-
| rowspan=&quot;4&quot; | &lt;CENTER&gt;&lt;B&gt;A&lt;BR&gt;S&lt;BR&gt;P&lt;BR&gt;E&lt;BR&gt;C&lt;BR&gt;T&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/CENTER&gt;
|
 || Present || Future || Past
|-
| Simple
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;i&gt;Present Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I walk&quot;
| &lt;i&gt;Future Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I will walk&quot;
| &lt;i&gt;Perfect Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I walked&quot;
|-
| Imperfective
| &lt;i&gt;Present Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am walking&quot;
| &lt;i&gt;Future Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I will be walking&quot;
| &lt;i&gt;Imperfect Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I was walking&quot;
|-
| Perfective
| &lt;i&gt;Perfect Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I have walked&quot;
| &lt;i&gt;Future Perfect Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I will have walked&quot;
| &lt;i&gt;Pluperfect Tense&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I had walked&quot;
|}

As is evident, some Latin tenses do &quot;double duty.&quot;  The Latin Present and Future Tenses can either express simple or progressive aspect.  Particularly difficult to grasp is the Latin Perfect tense, which can either express an action completed from the point of view of the present (&quot;I have just now finished walking&quot;), or a simple action in past time (its &quot;aorist&quot; sense, from the old Indo European aorist tense, which Latin lost but is still present in Greek).

}}

== Infinitive ==

The infinitive (impersonal) is the form of the verb which simply means 'to (verb)' e.g. 'to do', or 'to be', or 'to love', or 'to hate' etc. All forms which are not in the infinitive are in the finite (personalised) form.

The infinitive has a -re at the end of the stem of the verb. The infinitive of 'to be' is an exception and is 'esse'.

Dēbeō curre&lt;B&gt;re&lt;/B&gt; nunc = I ought to run now.

Esse, aut nōn esse = To be, or not to be?

===Exercises===

Answer these two questions about the '''infinitive''' and '''finite'''.

{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
# What is the '''infinitive'''? Give an example.
# What is the '''finite'''? Give an example.
|
# The '''infinitive''' is the verb-form that simply mean &quot;to (verb)&quot;.
#: To ''sing'', to ''dance'', to ''drink'', to ''love''.
# Every verb which is not in the infinitive, is in the '''finite'''.
#: He ''smells'', we ''plot'', she had ''drunk'', he ''pours''.
}}

== Irregularities ==

Verbs which use the passive formation in an active sense are known as deponent. Verbs which don't have a form for every tense and mood are known as defective. You will meet a few words like this soon.

===Exercises===
{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
#What is a deponent verb?
#What is an irregular verb?
#What is a defective verb?
|
#A verb which uses the passive voice in an active sense.
#A verb that does not follow the normal rules of conjugation.
#A verb missing forms for some tenses or moods.
}}

== Personal Pronouns ==

In case you do ever use a personal pronoun to emphasise the SUBJECT of the verb, you must remember that the personal pronoun must be in the nominative case and the number and person of the verb must match that of the subject. (Review Lesson 7 if unfamiliar with the terms person and subject).

== Principal Parts ==

When one looks up a verb in the dictionary, the principal parts are given. From these principal parts you can find the correct form of the verb for every circumstance.


{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| Present Indicative Active 1st Person || Present Infinitive
| Perfect Indicative Active 1st Person || Supine
|-
| amō || amāre || amāvi || amātum
|-
| Determines whether the vowel is dropped in the 1st person singular present.
| Gives the imperfect stem and infinitive
| Gives the perfect stem
| Allows you to form adjectival forms of the verb (Participles)
|}

=== Exercises ===
Answer this question about '''principal parts'''.

{{Latin/Exercise|Answer|
# What do the '''principal parts''' allow you to do?
|
# The principal parts are the verb-forms you find when you look in the dictionary. E.g. if you look for the verb ''amō'' (love) in a dictionary you would find:
#: amō • amāre • amāvi • amātum 
:: These four forms will help you form every Latin verb you want.
}}

== Using the Dictionary ==

All nouns are given in the nominative, as well as the declension and gender of the noun. Verbs are alphabetized using the 1st person singular  (the first principal part) and the infinitive is given.  Supplementary principal parts are given if the various other principal parts do not follow the standard pattern of formation from the infinitive and 1st person singular.

=Verbs: Conjugation in the Present Imperfect =
 
The present imperfect is the simplest tense. To form the present imperfect all that is required is to place the personal endings at the end of the verb stem.
 
Thus, if you have the stem 'ama' (love), to make it 'I love' you place an ō at the end.

 I love  =  amō (amaō*)
 we love =  amāmus

* Latin drops the 'a' in amaō forming amō.

Latin '''could''' add personal pronouns, however only for added emphasis and in conjunction with the corresponding person ending on the verb. Otherwise the sentence will not make sense. For example:
 
ego amō = I (not you) love

nōs amāmus = We (not you) love
 
but that would be for special emphasis: It's '''I''', not you, who loves.

Here are the forms of the verb 'porta', carry, in the present imperfect tense:

 portō     I carry                     first person singular
 portās    thou carriest, you carry    second person singular
 portat    he, she, it carries         third person singular 
 portāmus  we carry                    first person plural
 portātis  you (all) carry             second person plural
 portant   they carry                  third person plural

'porto' can also be translated 'I am carrying' (present imperfect), 'I do carry' (present emphatic).  'I carry' is known as the 'present simple' tense in English.. Again the 'a' gets dropped when the 'ō' is placed on porta. Porta, and ama are known as 1st conjugation verbs; in other words, verbs which have a stem ending in 'a'.

There are three other conjugations, and below are some examples of verbs from each of the four conjugations (present imperfect tense):

 
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| porta, carry (1st. Conj) || mone, warn (2nd Conj)
| rege, rule (3rd Conj.) || audī, hear (4th Conj)
|-
| portō, I carry || moneō, I warn || regō, I rule
| audiō, I hear
|-
| portās, thou carriest || monēs, thou warnest
| regis, thou rulest || audis, thou hearest
|-
| portat, he/she/it carries || monet, he/she/it warns
| regit, he/she/it rules || audit, he/she/it hears
|-
| portāmus, we carry || monēmus, we warn
| regimus, we rule || audimus, we hear
|-
| portātis, ye carry || monētis, ye warn
| regitis, ye rule || auditis, ye hear
|-
| portant, they carry || monent, they warn
| regunt, they rule || audiunt, they hear
|}

Each verb uses the same final letter or letters to indicate the 'subject' - I, thou, he/she/it, we, you, they.

Before these final letters, the first conjugation has an 'a' (although when an 'o' is placed, the 'a' is often dropped), the second an 'e', and the third and fourth usually an 'i'. The third person plural forms in the third and fourth conjugations have a 'u'. These verb forms really should be learned by heart.

The most common verb of all is irregular (see next lesson). Here is a table of the verb 'to be' in Latin, English, and four Romantic languages (French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese)

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;6&quot; | esto: be
|-
| &lt;B&gt;Latin&lt;/B&gt; || &lt;B&gt;English&lt;/B&gt; || &lt;B&gt;French&lt;/B&gt;
| &lt;B&gt;Spanish&lt;/B&gt;|| &lt;B&gt;Italian&lt;/B&gt; || &lt;B&gt;Portuguese&lt;/B&gt;
|-
| sum || I am || je suis || yo soy || sono || eu sou
|-
| es || thou art || tu es || tú eres || sei || tu és
|-
| est || he/she/it is || il/elle est || él/ella es || è || ele/ela é
|-
| sumus || we are || nous sommes || nosotros/-as somos || siamo || nós somos
|-
| estis || ye are || vous &amp;ecirc;tes || vosotros/-as sois || siete  || vós sois
|-
| sunt || they are || ils/elles sont || ellos/-as son || sono  || eles/elas são
|}

The personal endings are the same as in the four regular conjugations.

=== Exercises ===
:''Conjugate (find how a verb is in different forms) the verb 'amõ'.''

{{Latin/Exercise|Translate|What form of the verb 'amõ' (hint: amõ is conjugated like portõ in the table above) would the following words use to become the suffix:
#ego (I)
#tū (thou)
#puer (the boy)
#nōs (we)
#vōs (ye)
#puellae (the girls)
|
#[ego] amõ (I love)
#[tu] amās (thou lovest ''pl.'', you love ''pl.'')
#puer amat (the boy loves)
#[nos] amāmus (we love)
#[vos] amātis (ye love ''pl.'', you love ''pl.'')
#puellae amant (the girls love)
}}

&lt;br&gt;

== Imperative Mood ==

The imperative mood conveys an order (e.g. Go!, Run!, Away Now!). The imperative mood is formed by simply using the stem of the verb. If the order is to a large group of people, or you are trying to show respect, you must use the -te suffix.

amō eum = I love him.

amā eum = Love him!.

amāte eum = Love (respectful, or plural) him!


currō casam = I run home.

curre casam = Run home!

currite casam = Run (respectful, or plural) home!


Regō prudente = I rule wisely.

Rege prudente = Rule wisely!

Regite prudente = Rule (respectful order) wisely!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your section on McClellan is so filled with errors and mis-representations as to be laughable.  That being the case, I did not bother to read the rest of your piece.  Suggest you do a bit more homework in future.
--

Would the user making the above statement like References? Perhaps if he or she would point out the specific &quot;errors and mis-representations,&quot; one may attempt to amend them in to provide greater accuracy. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]]

I changed the name of John (born Johan) Ericsson to the (dare I say) correct spelling (was Ericcson), but missed the summary box. The main wikipedia entry supports this spelling. It is also the spelling on his mausoleum in Filipstad, Sweden. Also his brother Nils, changed the spelling to 'Ericson' when he was knighted, something that John reportedly never forgave him for. In that light I find it unlikely that he would have let himself to be known under the name of 'Ericcson'. I do however find numerous sources on the web that lists his name with the odd spelling, so there might be a controversy regarding that on the other side of the atlantic? (Or is it just an early error that has been propagated?) I have several links to back this up, but as they are in Swedish it's perhaps not very useful to include them here. (I also went to the Nils Ericson high school, but that's another story).

----
I've been adding a few things to this section starting under 'Shiloh'. Let me know if this is all right, but I'm assuming so. There is a good article on the battle in Wikipedia (and probably on others) so what I have tried to do is a brief expansion of the section to set up the situation and then encourage use of the link. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 16:27, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

Ran into the kilobyte limit when trying to edit this section. Are there any plans to create subsections? Any reasons not to before I start making more involved changes? Personally, if it is desireable to grow and develop this book, I believe it will be necessary to break this &quot;chapter&quot; on the Civil War out into multiple subsections to provide the space necessary for the topics. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 19:56, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

I changed some misspellings on this page and corrected one error. Ben Butler, the Beast of New Orleans, was from Massachusetts, not New Jersey.

== Technical firsts in the Amercan Civil War ==

According to the article the American Civil War was the first to see the use of flamethrowers, organised medical and nursing units and ambulance corps and the introduction of the income tax. This is incorrect, as the Chinese invented the flamethrower in the 10th Century (the following article has a picture of a 12th Century version: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_Flamethrower.JPG) and is attributed to have been first used in World War 1 elsewhere in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamethrower). 

Furthermore income tax is reckoned to have been introduced by the Chinese (again) in the year 10 and used by the UK in the 12th Century, to fund wars against Saladin, and at the end of the 18th Century, to fund wars against Napoleon.  Speaking of Napoleon, he introduced organised medical units and ambulances into his armies (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Jean_Larrey).   Lastly nursing, specifically military nursing, was what Florence Nightgale (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Nightingale) became famous for in the Crimean War in the 1850s, so cannot hae been introduced during the American Civil War. 

Due to these factual errors, the article stands somewhat degraded and should be edited following further research. [[Special:Contributions/81.159.107.166|81.159.107.166]] ([[User talk:81.159.107.166|discuss]]) 19:41, 4 June 2012 (UTC)

I'm going to try to amend it to *the 1st American use* of these things. Thank you. [[User:Pittsburgh Poet|Pittsburgh Poet]] ([[User talk:Pittsburgh Poet|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pittsburgh Poet|contribs]]) 19:47, 28 June 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Eigenvalues and eigenvectors''' are related to fundamental properties of matrices.

:The word ''eigenvalue'' comes from the German ''Eigenwert'' which means &quot;proper or characteristic value.&quot;

== Motivations ==
Large matrices can be costly, in terms of computational time, to use, and may have to be iterated hundreds or thousands of times for a calculation.  Additionally, the behavior of matrices would be hard to explore without important mathematical tools.  One mathematical tool, which has applications not only for Linear Algebra but for differential equations, calculus, and many other areas, is the concept of ''eigenvalues'' and ''eigenvectors''.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are based upon a common behavior in linear systems.  Let's look at an example.

Let
: &lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 2  \\
0 &amp; -2 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \\ \end{pmatrix},\quad \mathbf{y}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

What happens with '''x''' and '''y''' if they are transformed by ''A''? Well,
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -6 \\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{y}=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

But what is remarkable is that 
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x}=(-2)\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 3 \\ \end{pmatrix}=-2\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{y}=(1)\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}=\mathbf{y}=(1)\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;

So when we operate on the vector '''x''' with the matrix ''A'', instead of getting a different vector (as we would normally do),  we get the ''same'' vector '''x''' multiplied by some constant. And the same goes for vector '''y'''.

We call the values 1 and -2 the ''eigenvalues'' of the matrix ''A'', and the vectors '''x''' and '''y'''  are called ''eigenvectors'' for the matrix ''A''.

== Definitions ==
We now generalize this concept of when a matrix/vector product is the same as a product by a scalar as above: essentially if we have a ''n''&amp;times;''n'' matrix A, we seek solutions in '''v''' to find the eigenvectors, and solutions in &amp;lambda; to find the eigenvalues for the equation
: A'''v'''=&amp;lambda;'''v'''

How are we to do this? Let us rearrange the equation
: A'''v'''-&amp;lambda;'''v'''='''0'''
: (A-&amp;lambda;I)'''v'''='''0''' (''note we must multiply the scalar by the identity matrix otherwise A-&amp;lambda; makes no sense'')

But (A-&amp;lambda;I) is a matrix, so we are trying to solve B'''v'''='''0''' where B=(A-&amp;lambda;I), and this solution is merely the kernel of B, ker B. So the eigenvectors are in ker (A-&amp;lambda;I), where &amp;lambda; is an eigenvalue. But how do we find the eigenvalues?

B'''v'''='''0''' has nonzero solution if |B| = det(B) is zero. So to find the eigenvalues, we let |A-&amp;lambda;I|=0 and then solve for &amp;lambda;. We will thus obtain a polynomial equation over the complex numbers (eigenvalues can be complex), known as the ''characteristic equation''. The roots of the characteristic equation are the eigenvalues.

Note that we exclude '''0''' as an eigenvector, because it is trivially a solution to A'''v'''=&amp;lambda;'''v''' and is not really interesting to consider.  Additionally, if the zero vector were to be included, it would allow for an infinite number of eigenvalues, since any value of &amp;lambda; satisfies A'''0'''=&amp;lambda;'''0'''.

If we have an eigenvalue &amp;lambda; of a matrix A, together with a corresponding eigenvector, '''x''', then any multiple of '''x''' is also an eigenvector for the same eigenvalue. To see that k'''x''' is also an eigenvector, follow this argument:
If A'''x'''=&amp;lambda;'''x''', then A(k'''x''')=kA'''x'''=k&amp;lambda;'''x'''=&amp;lambda;(k'''x'''). (Here k may be any scalar.) Thus, every multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector. 

Note the asymmetry here: eigenvalues are unique, while an eigenvalue has many eigenvectors.

=== Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors ===
Here are some examples of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors using our definitions.

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 \\
                           -1 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Firstly, we expand |A-&amp;lambda;I|=0 to find the eigenvalues: 
:  &lt;math&gt;\left| \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 \\  
                                                -1 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}-
                \begin{pmatrix} \lambda &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \lambda\end{pmatrix}
               \right|=0&lt;/math&gt;


: &lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix} 3 - \lambda &amp; 0 \\
                                 -1 &amp; 2 - \lambda \end{vmatrix}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (3-\lambda)(2-\lambda)-(0)(-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; (3-\lambda)(2-\lambda)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Now, elementary algebra tells us the roots of this equation are 3 and 2, and thus these are our eigenvalues. 

(''Exercise: prove that in a 2&amp;times;2 triangular matrix the eigenvalues are on the principal diagonal. Harder: generalize this result'')

Now we can find our eigenvectors. Consider the first eigenvalue &amp;lambda;=3. To find our first eigenvector
: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{ker} (A-3I) =  \mbox{ker} 
            \begin{pmatrix} 3-3 &amp; 0 \\
                           -1 &amp; 2-3 \end{pmatrix}
                            =  \mbox{ker} 
            \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\
                           -1 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
At this point we can row-reduce and back-substitute, '''but usually it suffices to''' guess the kernel since our matrix is small and we have linearly dependent columns. Now, observe:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix}
                            0 &amp; 0 \\
                           -1 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix} 
\begin{pmatrix} a \\ -a \end{pmatrix}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
So, for any scalar a, the vector
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} a \\ -a \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is an eigenvector. Stated another way, the set of all eigenvectors of the matrix ''A'' includes the set &lt;math&gt;\mbox{span} \{\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}\}&lt;/math&gt;. In the plane, this represents a line of slope -1 through the origin.

As noted above the eigenvalues of a matrix are uniquely determined, but for each eigenvalue there are many eigenvectors. We usually choose an eigenvector for some convenience such as &quot;most whole number entries&quot;, &quot;first entry is 1&quot;, or &quot;length of the eigenvector is 1&quot;.  
Most Computer Algebra Systems choose unit vectors for eigenvectors.

So here we may take &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; to be the eigenvector, for example. 

Similarly for our second eigenvalue &amp;lambda;=2, to find our second eigenvector:
: &lt;math&gt; \mbox{ker} (A-2I) =  \mbox{ker} 
            \begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 \\
                           -1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}=
\mbox{span} \{\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
And so, our second eigenvector is chosen as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Our eigenvalues then are &amp;lambda;=2,3, with eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, as may be checked by multiplying each by the given matrix.

(We also could choose &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1/\sqrt(2) \\-1/\sqrt(2)  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; as an eigenvector for the eigenvalue &amp;lambda;=3 . Check this.)

=== Problem set ===
Given the above, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the following matrices (Answers follow to even-numbered questions):
# &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 \\ -4 &amp; 5 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 3 &amp; -1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -2 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
:(Harder. Hint: one eigenvalue is 4.)

==== Answers ====
# eigenvalues: 3, 5; eigenvectors: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}  0\\1  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# eigenvalues: -2, 2; eigenvectors: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}  1\\1  \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# eigenvalues: -3, 1, 4; eigenvectors: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}21\\-6\\-7\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}3\\-2\\3\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not mere pretty facts about these vectors; they have relevant and important applications.

=== Matrix powers ===
Let us first examine a certain class of matrices known as ''diagonal'' matrices: these are matrices in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 
a_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; a_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; a_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; a_k \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, observe that 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 
a_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; a_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; a_2 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; a_k \end{pmatrix}^k=
\begin{pmatrix} 
a_0^k &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; a_1^k &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; a_2^k &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \ldots &amp; a_k^k \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a very useful property! However, the number of matrices to which we can apply this fact is clearly limited, so we ask ourselves whether we can transform a given matrix into a diagonal matrix. 

The answer to this question is &quot;sometimes&quot;, but for the moment, we will only look at matrices for which this answer is &quot;yes&quot;. 

What we seek is a matrix P such that
:PAP&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=D
where D is diagonal.

If such a matrix P exists, we say that A is ''diagonalizable''. (Note that ''xyx''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is often called a ''similarity transformation'').

Then
: PAP&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=D
: AP&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;D
by multiplying throughout forward by P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, then
: A=P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;DP
by multiplying backward by P.

Now, we have
: A&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;=(P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;DP)&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;
::=(P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;DP)(P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;DP)(P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;DP)... (''k'' times)
::=P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;D(PP&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)D(PP&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)DP... (''k'' times)
The PP&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; terms cancel to give
::=P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;DDD...P (''k'' times)
::=P&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;D&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;P

We can calculate D&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; easily, so we need to find P.

It turns out (the entire proof is quite difficult) that we simply create a matrix from concatenating the linearly independent eigenvectors to create P.

D, then, is the diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues on the main diagonal corresponding to the associated eigenvectors (the eigenvalue in the first place corresponds to the eigenvector it is created from, in the first column).

==== Example ====
Let's work through an example to show these ideas.
: &lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix} 
3 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So what do we do if we want to find A&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;? Let's use the method we've just described.

Find the eigenvalues: 
: |A-&amp;lambda;I|=0
: (3-&amp;lambda;)(-&amp;lambda;)-4=0
: &amp;lambda;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-3&amp;lambda;-4=0
: &amp;lambda;=-1, 4

Find the eigenvectors:
: for &amp;lambda;=-1 &lt;math&gt;
\mbox{ker}\begin{pmatrix} 
4 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}=\mbox{span}\{\begin{pmatrix}-1 \\ 4\end{pmatrix}\}&lt;/math&gt;
: for &amp;lambda;=4 &lt;math&gt;
\mbox{ker}\begin{pmatrix} 
-1 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; -4 \\
\end{pmatrix}=\mbox{span}\{\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}\}&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvectors are then 
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}-1 \\ 4\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
so put the eigenvectors together to form the matrix P
: &lt;math&gt;P=\begin{pmatrix}-1 &amp; 1 \\ 4 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now -1 generated the eigenvector in the ''first'' column, and 4 generated the eigenvector in the ''second'' column, so form D in this way:
: &lt;math&gt;D=\begin{pmatrix} 
-1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 4 \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can easily calculate (-1)&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;=1, so we get
: &lt;math&gt;D^{14}=\begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 4^{14} \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and we have the fast method for creating inverses of 2&amp;times;2 matrices:
: &lt;math&gt;P^{-1} = -\frac{1}{5}\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; -1 \\
                             -4 &amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So now we can now directly multiply out
: &lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{5}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; -1 \\ 
-4 &amp; -1\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 4^{14} \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 \\ 
4 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Simplifying we get
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
 214748365 &amp; 53687091 \\
 214748364 &amp; 53687092 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

:(More tedious: only slightly easier because this matrix is in row echelon form)

=====Answers=====

===Coupled ordinary differential equations ===
We can use the method of diagonalisation to solve coupled ordinary differential equations . For example, let x(t) and y(t) be differentiable functions and x' and y' their derivatives. The differential equations are relatively difficult to solve:
:x' = 4x - y
:y' = 2x + y
but
:u' = ku for a constant k is easy to solve
it has solution
:u = Ae&lt;sup&gt;kx&lt;/sup&gt; where A is a constant
remembering this fact, we translate the ODEs into matrix form
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
4&amp;-1\\
2&amp;1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
Diagonalise the square matrix, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;0\\
0&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

we put
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
then it follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
u'\\
v'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
thus
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
u'\\
v'
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
3&amp;0\\
0&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
as discussed above the solutions are easy. We have
:&lt;math&gt;u = Ce^{3t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;v = De^{2t}&lt;/math&gt;
for some constants C and D. Now that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
we get
:&lt;math&gt;

\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;1\\
1&amp;2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
u\\
v
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
x\\
y
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;x = Ce^{3t} + De^{2t}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = Ce^{3t} + 2De^{2t}&lt;/math&gt;
This method generalises well into higher dimensions.

=== Coupled differential equations ===
Matrices, strangely enough, have a great use in relation to ''calculus'' in the calculation of solutions to coupled differential equations, where one differential equation has some  function that depends on another differential equation. For example:
: D ''y'' = 3''y'' + ''x''
: D ''x'' = ''y'' + 3''x''

Without going any further, the solution to these differential equations looks very difficult! However if we formulate this in terms of matrices, it becomes a little bit easier to analyze.

==== Example ====
Let's take the above example, so
: D ''y''(''t'') = 3''y'' + ''x''
: D ''x''(''t'') = ''y'' + 3''x''

Now form a vector:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} y \\ x \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
Then
: &lt;math&gt; D \mathbf{v}(t) = \begin{pmatrix} D y \\ D x \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Now the problem becomes
: &lt;math&gt; D(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix}\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;

This is reminiscent of the differential equation we have already encountered in calculus, that of
: D ''y'' = ''ky''
in which the solution is y = ''c''e&lt;sup&gt;kt&lt;/sup&gt;.
We can make a wild guess then the solution to the above matrix equation will have a solution in a similar form.

So let's try a solution '''v''' = '''w'''e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;t&lt;/sup&gt;. Then D '''v''' = &amp;lambda;'''w'''e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;t&lt;/sup&gt;.

Let us then try and substitute this guess solution into our equation:
: &lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{w}e^{\lambda t} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix}\mathbf{w}e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt;
If we let 
: &lt;math&gt; A = \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
we see that the equation above becomes, on dividing through by &lt;math&gt;e^{\lambda t}&lt;/math&gt; (since it is never zero)
: &lt;math&gt; A\mathbf{w} = \lambda\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;
But wait - this is the equation before to find the eigenvalues - and we have that the solution '''v''' = '''w'''e&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lambda;t&lt;/sup&gt; is a solution if and only if &amp;lambda; is an eigenvalue of A and '''w''' is its corresponding eigenvector.

The eigenvalues are 4, 2, with eigenvectors
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
respectively. 

So we have two solutions 
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{4 t}&lt;/math&gt;
and 
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{2 t}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if we have two solutions to the differential equation D '''v''' = A'''v''', linear combinations of the two solutions will give the same solution. So then we have then the general solution:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=j\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{4 t}+k\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{2 t}=&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} y(t) \\ x(t) \end{pmatrix}=j\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{4 t}+k\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{2 t}=&lt;/math&gt;

Seperating into the first and second components we get our two solutions
: &lt;math&gt; y(t) = je^{4 t}-ke^{2 t}, x(t) = je^{4 t}+ k e^{2 t}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above solve the following problems (Answers follow to even-numbered questions)
# Find y(''t'') and x(''t'') where D y(''t'')=3x(''t'')+6y(''t'') and D x(''t'')=x(''t'')+4y(''t'')
# Find y(''t'') and x(''t'') where D y(''t'')=2x(''t'')+2y(''t'') and D x(''t'')=x(''t'')-2y(''t'')

=====Answers=====
Form the matrix 
: &lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 2 \\ 1 &amp; -2 \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt; 
The eigenvalues of this matrix are
: &lt;math&gt;\pm\sqrt{6}&lt;/math&gt;
and the eigenvectors are
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2-\sqrt{6} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 2+\sqrt{6} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
So now
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} y(t) \\ x(t) \end{pmatrix}=\alpha\begin{pmatrix} 2-\sqrt{6} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{-\sqrt{6}t}+\beta\begin{pmatrix} 2+\sqrt{6} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}e^{\sqrt{6}t}&lt;/math&gt;
and y(''t'') and x(''t'') can be read off by inspection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''vector space''' is a way of generalizing the concept of a set of [[Linear Algebra/Vectors|vectors]]. For example, the complex number 2+3i can be considered a vector, since in some way it is the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

The vector space is a &quot;space&quot; of such abstract objects, which we term &quot;vectors&quot;.

== Some familiar friends ==
Currently in our study of vectors we have looked at vectors with real entries: 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R}^3, ..., \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, and so on. These are all vector spaces. The advantage we gain in abstracting to vector spaces is a way of talking about a space without any particular choice of objects (which define our vectors), operations (which act on our vectors), or coordinates (which identify our vectors in the space). Further results may be applied to more general spaces which may have infinite dimension, such as in Functional Analysis.

== Notations and concepts==
We write a vector, like we have before, bold, but you should write these on paper underlined or with an arrow on top. So we write &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; for that vector.

When we multiply a vector by a scalar number, we usually ascribe it a Greek letter, writing &amp;lambda;'''v''' for the multiplication of '''v''' by a scalar &amp;lambda;. We write addition and subtraction of vectors as we have been doing before, '''x'''+'''y''' for the sum of vectors '''x''' and '''y'''.

With scalar multiplication and adding vectors, we can move to our definition of a vector space.

When we refer to an operation being 'closed' in a definition, we are saying that the result of the operation does not violate our definition.  For example, if we are looking at the set of all integers, we can say that it is closed under addition, because adding any integers results in something inside the set of integers.  However the set of integers is not closed under division, because dividing 3 by 2 (for example) doesn't result in a member of the set of integers.

== Definition==
A ''vector space'' is a nonempty set V of objects, called ''vectors'', on which are defined two operations, called ''vector addition'' and ''scalar multiplication'', respectively, such that, for &lt;math&gt;x,y\in V&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;alpha;&lt;math&gt; \in F&lt;/math&gt;, where F is a field '''x'''+'''y''' and &amp;alpha;'''x''' are well-defined elements of V with the following properties: 
#''commutativity of addition'': '''x'''+'''y'''='''y'''+'''x'''
# ''associativity of addition'': '''x'''+('''y'''+'''z''')=('''x'''+'''y''')+'''z'''
# ''additive identity'': there is a vector '''0''' such that '''0'''+'''x'''='''x''' for all '''x'''
# ''additive inverse'': for each vector '''x''', there exists another vector '''y''' such that '''x'''+'''y''' ='''0'''

# ''scalar associativity'': &amp;alpha;(&amp;beta;'''x''') = (&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;)'''x'''
# ''scalar distributivity'': (&amp;alpha; + &amp;beta;)'''x'''=&amp;alpha;'''x'''+&amp;beta;'''x'''
# ''vector distributivity'': &amp;alpha;('''x'''+'''y''')=&amp;alpha;'''x'''+&amp;alpha;'''y'''
# ''scalar identity'': 1'''x'''='''x'''

=== Alternative Definition ===
People who are familiar with [[w:group theory|group theory]] and [[w:field theory (mathematics) |field theory]] may find the following alternative definition more compact:

* &lt;math&gt;(V, +)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[w:Abelian group|Abelian group]].
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha \in F, (\forall x, y \in V), \alpha (x+y) = \alpha x + \alpha y&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha, \beta \in F, \forall x\in V, (\alpha + \beta)x = \alpha x + \beta x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall \alpha, \beta \in F, \forall x\in V, (\alpha \beta)x = \alpha (\beta x)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in V, 1x = x&lt;/math&gt;

=== Some Basic Theorems===
#The 0 vector is unique. &lt;br&gt; Proof: Let 0&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; both be 0 vectors. Then 0&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=0&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
#The additive inverse is unique. &lt;br&gt; Proof: Suppose there is a x and y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. are inverses of x Then y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+(x+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=(y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+x)+y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
#0x=0. &lt;br&gt; Proof: Let y be the additive inverse of x. Then 0x= 0x + x + y = (0+1)x + y = x+y=0.
#(-1)x is the inverse of x. &lt;br&gt; Proof: x+(-1)x=x(1-1)=x0=0.

== Linear Spaces ==
The linear space is a very important vector space. Let n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; be k elements of a field F. Then the ordered k-tuples (n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) form a vector space with addition being the sum of the corresponding numbers, and scalar multiplication by an element of F being the result of multiplying each one in the k-tuple. This would then be the k dimensional linear space.

== Subspaces ==
A ''subspace'' is a vector space inside a vector space. When we look at various vector spaces, it is often useful to examine their subspaces. 

The subspace S of a vector space V means that S is a sub''set'' of V and that it has the following key characteristics
* S is closed under scalar multiplication: if &amp;lambda;&amp;isin;'''R''', '''v'''&amp;isin;S, &amp;lambda;'''v'''&amp;isin;S
* S is closed under addition: if '''u''', '''v''' &amp;isin; S,  '''u'''+'''v'''&amp;isin;S.

Any subset with these characteristics is a vector space. 

==== The trivial subspace ====
The singleton set with the zero vector ({'''0'''}) is a subspace of every vector space. 

'''Scalar multiplication closure''': ''a'' '''0'''='''0''' for all ''a'' in '''R'''

'''Addition closure''': '''0'''+'''0'''='''0'''.  Since '''0''' is the only member of the set we need to check only '''0'''

'''Zero vector''': '''0''' is the only member of the set and it is the zero vector.

=== Examples ===
Let us examine some subspaces of some familiar vector spaces, and see how we can prove that a certain subset of a vector space is in fact a subspace.

==== A slightly less trivial subspace ====
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the set '''V''' of all vectors from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the form (0,&amp;alpha;) where &amp;alpha; is in '''R''' is a subspace

'''Scalar multiplication closure''': ''a'' (0,&amp;alpha;) = (0,a &amp;alpha;) and a &amp;alpha; is in '''R'''

'''Addition closure''': (0,&amp;alpha;) +(0,&amp;beta;) =(0, &amp;alpha; + &amp;beta;) and &amp;alpha; + &amp;beta; is in '''R'''

'''Zero vector''': taking &amp;alpha; to be zero in our definition of (0, &amp;alpha;) in '''V''' we get the zero vector (0,0)

==== A whole family of subspaces ====
Pick any number from '''R''', say &amp;rho;.  Then the set '''V''' of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Scalar multiplication closure''': ''a'' (&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) = (a&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;a&amp;alpha;) which is in '''V'''.

'''Addition closure''': (&amp;alpha;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha;) +(&amp;beta;, &amp;rho;&amp;beta;) =(&amp;alpha; + &amp;beta;, &amp;rho;&amp;alpha; + &amp;rho;&amp;beta;) = (&amp;alpha;+&amp;beta;, &amp;rho;(&amp;alpha;+&amp;beta;)) which  is in '''V'''

'''Zero vector''': taking &amp;alpha; to be zero in our definition we get (0, &amp;rho;0) = (0,0) in '''V'''.

That means '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,2&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,3&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,4&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,5&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;pi;&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form (&amp;alpha;,&amp;pi;&amp;alpha;) is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

and '''V'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;radic;2&lt;/sub&gt; = the set of all vectors of the form 
&lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\sqrt{2}\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

As you can see, even a simple vector space like '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can have many different subspaces.

== Linear Combinations, Spans and Spanning Sets, Linear Dependence, and Linear Independence ==

=== Linear Combinations ===

Definition: Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a nonempty subset of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. Then a vector &lt;math&gt;x\in V&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''linear combination''' of elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a finite number of elements &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\in S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\in F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; x = a_1y_1 + a_2y_2 + ... a_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Spans ===

Definition: Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all linear combinations of &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\in V&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''span''' of &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;Span(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)&lt;/math&gt;. 


Note that &lt;math&gt;Span(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\in V)&lt;/math&gt; is a subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  

Proof: Consider closure under addition and scalar multiplication for two vectors, x and y, in the span of the vectors &lt;math&gt;{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 + ... + a_nv_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y = b_1v_1 + b_2v_2 + ... + b_nv_n&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x+y = (a_1+b_1)*v_1 + (a_2+b_2)*v_2 + ... + (a_n+b_n)*v_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is also contained in the set.

&lt;math&gt;k*x = (k*a_1)v_1 + (k*a_2)v_2 + ... + (k*a_n)v_n&lt;/math&gt;, which is also contained in the set.


==== Spanning Sets ====

Definition: Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt; are vectors in such a vector space. The set &lt;math&gt;{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a '''spanning set''' for the vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every vector in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;y_1, y_2, ..., y_n&lt;/math&gt;. Alternately, &lt;math&gt;\forall x\in V, (\exists a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\in F), x = a_1y_1 + a_2y_2 + ... +a_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;

=== Linear Independence ===

Definition:  Assume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a ''vector space'' over a field &lt;math&gt;(F, +, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite subset of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we say &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independent if &lt;math&gt;a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...a_nx_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Linear independence is a very important topic in Linear Algebra. The definition implies that linearly dependent vectors may form the nulvector as a non-trivial combination, from which we may conclude that one of the vectors can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. 

If we have a vector space V spanned by 3 vectors &lt;math&gt;{v_1, v_2, v_3}&lt;/math&gt; we say that v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are linearly dependent if there is a combination of one or two of them that can produce a third. For instance, if one of the following equations:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1 + a_2v_2 = v_3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_2v_2 + a_3v_3 = v_1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1 + a_3v_3 = v_2&lt;/math&gt;

can be satisfied, then the vectors in V are said to be '''linearly dependant'''. 

How can we test for linear independence? The definition sets it out to us: If V is a vector space spanned by 3 vectors of length N:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V} = [v_1, v_2, v_3]&lt;/math&gt;

and we try to test whether these 3 vectors are linearly independent, we form the equations:

:&lt;math&gt;a_1v_1+a_2v_2+a_3v_3=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

and solve them. If the only solution is 

:&lt;math&gt;a_1=a_2=a_3=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;

then the 3 vectors are linearly independent. If there is another solution they are linearly dependent.


??????
We can say that for V to be linearly independent it must satisfy this condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where we are using 0 to denote the null vector in V.  If &lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt; is square and invertable, we can solve this equation directly:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}^{-1}\tilde{V}\bar{a} = \bar{a} = \tilde{V}^{-1} \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

And if we know that &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is zero, then we know that the system is linearly independent. If, however, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt; is not square, or if it is not invertable, we can try the following technique:

Multiply through by the transpose matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Find the inverse of &lt;math&gt;[\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}&lt;/math&gt;, and multiply through by the inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;[\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}]^{-1}\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}\bar{a} = [\tilde{V}^T\tilde{V}]^{-1} \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;

Cancel the terms:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a} = \tilde{V}^T\tilde{V} \cdot 0&lt;/math&gt;

And our conclusion:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This again means that V is linearly independent.

=== Span ===

A '''span''' is the set of all possible vectors that are in a given vector space. 

===Basis===

A '''basis''' for a vector space is the least amount of linearly independent vectors that can be used to describe the vector space completely. The most common basis vectors are the '''kronecker vectors''', also called '''canonical basis''':

:&lt;math&gt;i = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;j = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;k = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

In the cartesian graphing space, we say an ordered triple of coordinates is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;v = \begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

And we can make any point (x, y, z) by combining the kronecker basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}x \\ y \\ z\end{bmatrix} = xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;

'''Some theorems''':
*A basis &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(v_1, \ldots, v_n)&lt;/math&gt; of a vector space V has the maximal number of linearly independet vectors.
*(Converse) A maximal number of linearly independent vectors in a vector space is a basis.

== Bases and Dimension ==

If a vector space &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is such that:&lt;br&gt;
it contains a linearly independent set &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; of N vectors,and&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; set of N + 1 or more vectors in &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is linearly dependent,&lt;/br&gt;

then &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt; is said to have &lt;b&gt;dimension&lt;/b&gt; N, and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is said to be a   &lt;b&gt;basis&lt;/b&gt; of &lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;.

== TODO ==

Tell about what is a ''basis'' in a vector space and about coordinate transformations. ([http://www.mathematics21.org/formulas-theory.html this article] contains an abstract definition of a ''basis'' which is a generalization of a basis in vector space and can be used as the foundation to explain about bases and coordinate transformations.)


Discuss the geometry of subspaces (points, lines, planes, hypersurfaces) and connect them to the geometry of solutions of linear systems.  Connect the algebra of subspaces and linear combinations of vectors to the algebra of linear systems.

== A question about contributing ==

Hi,

I have been talking with other Japan-related bloggers about how we can work together to improve the Japan-related content available online and this wikibooks project came up as one of the things that would be great to contribute to. 

I was wondering how we could best get involved and also if anyone who has worked on the project would like to comment on it and I will post the comments on my blog dailyj.net

Please let me know. Thanks ([[User:Toritaiyo|Toritaiyo]] 17:33, 29 November 2007 (UTC))

'''PHP''' is a [[w:Scripting programming language|scripting]] language designed to fill the gap between [[w:Server Side Includes|SSI]] (Server Side Includes) and [[Perl]], intended for the Web environment. Its principal application is the implementation of Web pages having dynamic content. PHP has gained quite a following in recent times, and it is one of the frontrunners in the Open Source software movement. Its popularity derives from its C-like syntax, and its simplicity. The newest version of PHP is 5.6 and it is heavily recommended to always use the newest version for better security, performance and of course features.

If you've been to a website that prompts you to login, you've probably encountered a server-side scripting language. Due to its market saturation, this means you've probably come across PHP. [[Wikipedia:PHP|PHP]] was designed by [[Wikipedia:Rasmus Lerdorf|Rasmus Lerdorf]] to display his resume online and to collect data from his visitors.

Basically, PHP allows a static webpage to become dynamic. &quot;PHP&quot; is an acronym that stands for &quot;'''P'''HP: '''H'''ypertext '''P'''reprocessor&quot;. The word &quot;Preprocessor&quot; means that PHP makes changes before the HTML page is created. This enables developers to create powerful applications that can publish a blog, remotely control hardware, or run a powerful website such as Wikipedia or Wikibooks. Of course, to accomplish something such as this, you need a database application such as MySQL.

Before you embark on the wonderful journey of Server Side Processing, it is recommended that you have a basic understanding of the [[HTML|HyperText Markup Language (HTML)]]. But [[Wikipedia:PHP|PHP]] can also be used to build [[Wikipedia:GUI|GUI]]-driven applications for example by using [[w:PHP-GTK|PHP-GTK]].

Kinematics is the description of motion.  The motion of a point particle is fully described using three terms - position, velocity, and acceleration.&lt;!-- Not fully: the acceleration may change, and its change, in turn, etc. --&gt;  For real objects (which are not mathematical points), ''translational kinematics'' describes the motion of an object's center of mass through space, while ''angular kinematics'' describes how an object rotates about its centre of mass.  In this section, we focus only on translational kinematics.
Position, displacement, velocity, and acceleration are defined as follows.

== Position==
{{Cleanup|reason=this section does not even talk about position and what position is and how it can be helpful. It only talks about vectors, scalars, etc.|date=June 2015}} 
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction, typically written as a column of scalars. That is, a number that has a direction assigned to it. 

In physics, a vector often describes the motion of an object. For example, Warty the Woodchuck goes 10 meters towards a hole in the ground. 

We can divide vectors into parts called &quot;components&quot;, of which the vector is a sum.&lt;!-- A link to &quot;Geometry&quot; (sum of vectors) needed. --&gt; For example, a two-dimensional vector is divided into '''x''' and '''y''' components.

== Displacement ==
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{x}\equiv\vec x_f- \vec x_i\,&lt;/math&gt;}}

Displacement answers the question, &quot;Has the object moved?&quot;

Note the &lt;math&gt;\equiv&lt;/math&gt; symbol.  This symbol is a sort of &quot;super equals&quot; symbol, indicating that not only does &lt;math&gt;\vec x_f- \vec x_i&lt;/math&gt; EQUAL the displacement &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;, but more importantly displacement is '''operationally defined''' by &lt;math&gt;\vec x_f- \vec x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;\vec x_f- \vec x_i&lt;/math&gt; operationally defines displacement, because &lt;math&gt;\vec x_f- \vec x_i&lt;/math&gt; gives a step by step procedure for determining displacement.  

Namely:

# Measure where the object is initially.
# Measure where the object is at some later time.
# Determine the difference between these two position values.

Be sure to note that displacement is '''not''' the same as distance travelled.

For example, imagine travelling one time along the circumference of a circle.  If you end where you started, your displacement is zero, even though you have clearly travelled some distance.  In fact, displacement is an average distance travelled.  On your trip along the circle, your north and south motion averaged out, as did your east and west motion.

Clearly we are losing some important information.  The key to regaining this information is to use smaller displacement intervals.  For example, instead of calculating your displacement for your trip along the circle in one large step, consider dividing the circle into 16 equal segments.  Calculate the distance you travelled along each of these segments, and then add all your results together.  Now your total travelled distance is not zero, but something approximating the circumference of the circle.  Is your approximation good enough?  Ultimately, that depends on the level of accuracy you need in a particular application, but luckily you can always use finer resolution.  For example, we could break your trip into 32 equal segments for a better approximation.

Returning to your trip around the circle, you know the true distance is simply the circumference of the circle.  The problem is that we often face a practical limitation for determining the true distance travelled.  (The travelled path may have too many twists and turns, for example.)  Luckily, we can always determine displacement, and by carefully choosing small enough displacement steps, we can use displacement to obtain a pretty good approximation for the true distance travelled.  (The mathematics of calculus provides a formal methodology for estimating a &quot;true value&quot; through the use of successively better approximations.)  In the rest of this discussion, I will replace &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that small enough displacement steps have been used to provide a good enough approximation for the true distance travelled.

== Velocity ==
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{av}\equiv \frac{\vec{x_f}-\vec{x_i}}{t_f-t_i}\equiv \frac{\Delta\vec{x}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

[Δ, ''delta'', upper-case Greek D, is a ''prefix'' conventionally used to denote a ''difference''.] Velocity answers the question &quot;Is the object moving now, and if so - how quickly?&quot;

Once again we have an ''operational'' definition: we are told what steps to follow to calculate velocity.

Note that this is a definition for '''average''' velocity.  The displacement Δ''x'' is the '''vector''' sum of the smaller displacements which it contains, and some of these may subtract out. By contrast, the distance travelled is the '''scalar''' sum of the smaller distances, all of which are non-negative (they are the ''magnitudes'' of the displacements). Thus the distance travelled can be larger than the magnitude of the displacement, as in the example of travel on a circle, above. Consequently, the average velocity may be small (or zero, or negative) while the speed is positive.

If we are careful to use very small displacement steps, so that they come pretty close to approximating the true distance travelled, then we can write the definition for '''instantaneous velocity''' as 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{inst}\equiv \frac{\vec{\delta x}}{\delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

[δ is the lower-case ''delta''.] Or with the idea of limits from [[calculus]], we have:

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec v_{inst}\equiv \frac{d \vec x}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;}}

[d, like Δ and δ, is merely a ''prefix''; however, its use definitely specifies that this is a sufficiently small difference so that the error--due to stepping (instead of smoothly changing) the quantity--becomes negligible.]

== Acceleration ==
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec a_{av}\equiv \frac{\vec{v_f}-\vec{v_i}}{t_f-t_i}\equiv \frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}
Acceleration answers the question &quot;Is the object's velocity changing, and if so - how quickly?&quot;

Once again we have an operational definition.  We are told what steps to follow to calculate acceleration.

Again, also note that technically we have a definition for '''average acceleration'''.  As for displacement, if we are careful to use a series of small velocity changes, then we can write the definition for '''instantaneous acceleration''' as:
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec a_{inst}\equiv \frac{\delta\vec{v}}{\delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Or with the help of [[calculus]], we have:

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec a_{inst}\equiv \frac{d \vec v}{dt} = \frac{d^2\vec x}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

== Vectors ==
Notice that the definitions given above for '''displacement''', '''velocity''' and '''acceleration''' included little arrows over many of the terms.  The little arrow reminds us that direction is an important part of displacement, velocity, and acceleration.&lt;!-- &quot;the change in velocity&quot; is the acceleration — an extra passage. (the next editor should rub this out) --&gt;  These quantities are '''vectors'''.  By convention, the little arrow always points right when placed over a letter.  So for example, &lt;math&gt;\vec v&lt;/math&gt; just reminds us that velocity is a vector, and does '''not''' imply that this particular velocity is rightward.  

Why do we need vectors? As a simple example, consider velocity.  It is not enough to know how fast one is moving.  We also need to know which direction we are moving.  Less trivially, consider how many different ways an object could be experiencing an acceleration (a change in its velocity).  Ultimately, there are three distinct ways an object could accelerate:

#The object could be speeding up.
#The object could be slowing down.
#The object could be traveling at constant speed, while changing its direction of motion.

More general accelerations are simply combinations of 1 and 3 or 2 and 3. 

Importantly, a change in the direction of motion is just as much an acceleration as is speeding up or slowing down.  

In classical mechanics, no direction is associated with time (you cannot point to next Tuesday).  So the definition of &lt;math&gt;\vec a_{av}&lt;/math&gt; tells us that acceleration will point wherever the '''change''' in velocity &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; points.  Understanding that '''the direction of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec{v}&lt;/math&gt; determines the direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec a&lt;/math&gt;''' leads to three non-mathematical but very powerful rules of thumb:

#If the velocity and acceleration of an object point in the same direction, the object's speed is increasing.
#If the velocity and acceleration of an object point in opposite directions, the object's speed is decreasing.
#If the velocity and acceleration of an object are perpendicular to each other, the object's initial speed stays constant (in that initial direction), while the speed of the object in the direction of the acceleration increases. Think of a bullet fired horizontally in a vertical gravitational field.  Since velocity in the one direction remains constant, and the velocity in the other direction increases, the overall velocity (absolute velocity) also increases.

Again, more general motion is simply a combination of 1 and 3 or 2 and 3.

Using these three simple rules will dramatically help your intuition of what is happening in a particular problem.  In fact, much of the first semester of college physics is simply the application of these three rules in different formats.

= Equations of motion (constant acceleration) =
A particle is said to move with '''constant acceleration''' if its velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, no matter how small the intervals may be


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; \frac{d \vec v}{dt} = 0\ \mathrm{\frac{m}{s^{2}}}&lt;/math&gt;}}

Since acceleration is a vector, constant acceleration means that '''both''' direction and magnitude of this vector don't change during the motion.  This means that average and instantaneous acceleration are equal.  We can use that to derive an equation for velocity as a function of time by integrating the constant acceleration.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}(t)=\boldsymbol{v}(0)+\int\limits_{0}^{t}\boldsymbol{a}\ dt&lt;/math&gt;}}

Giving the following equation for velocity as a function of time.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{v}(t)=\boldsymbol{v}_0+\boldsymbol{a}t&lt;/math&gt;}}

To derive the equation for position we simply integrate the equation for velocity.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\boldsymbol{x}(0)+\int\limits_{0}^{t}\boldsymbol{v}(t)\ dt&lt;/math&gt;}}

Integrating again gives the equation for position.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{x}(t)=\boldsymbol{x}_0+\boldsymbol{v}_0t+\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{a}t^2&lt;/math&gt;}}

The following are the '''equations of motion''':

== What does force in motion mean? ==
 
Force means strength and power.
Motion means movement.
That’s why we need forces and motions in our life.
We need calculation when we want to know how fast things go, travel and other things which have force and motion.
...

== How do we calculate the '''speed'''? ==

If you want to calculate the average speed, distance travelled or time taken you need to use this formula and remember it:       
 &lt;math&gt; {speed} = \frac{distance}{time\ taken} &lt;/math&gt;
This is an easy formula to use, you can find the distance travelled, time taken or average speed, you need at least 2 values to find the whole answer.

== Is velocity the same thing as speed? ==

Velocity is a '''vector quantity''' that refers to &quot;the rate at which an object changes its position&quot;, whereas speed is a scalar quantity, which cannot be negative. Imagine a kid moving rapidly, one step forward and one step back, always returning to the original starting position. While this might result in a frenzy activity, it would result in a zero velocity, because the kid always returns to the original position, the motion would never result in a change in position, in other words &lt;math&gt;\Delta \vec x&lt;/math&gt; would be zero.

Speed is measured in the same physical units of measurement as velocity, but does not contain an element of direction. Speed is thus the '''magnitude component''' of velocity. Velocity contains both the magnitude and direction components. You can think of velocity as the displacement/duration, whereas speed can be though as distance/duration.

== Acceleration ==

When a car is speeding up we say that it is accelerating, when it slows down we say it is decelerating.

== How do we calculate it? ==

When we want to calculate it, the method goes like that: A lorry driver brakes hard, and slows from 25 m/s to 5 m/s in 5 seconds. What was the vehicle's acceleration? 
 &lt;math&gt; {acceleration} = \frac{change\ in\ velocity}{time\ taken} = \frac{5 - 25}{5} = \frac{-20}{5} = -4\ ms^{-2} &lt;/math&gt;
'''''What is initial velocity and final velocity?'''''
Initial velocity is the beginning before motion starts or in the middle of the motion, final velocity is when the motion stops.

There is another way to calculate it and it is like that  
This equations which are written is the primary ones, which means that when you don’t have lets say final velocity, how will you calculate the equation?
 
This is the way you are going to calculate.

== Observing motion ==

When you want to know how fast an athletic person is running, what you need is a stopwatch in your hand, then when the person starts to run, you start the stopwatch and when the person who is sprinting stops at the end point, you stop the watch and see how fast he ran, and if you want to see if the athlete is wasting his energy, while he is running look at his movement, and you will know by that if he is wasting his energy or not.

This athletic person is running, and while he is running the scientist could know if he was wasting his energy if they want by the stop watch and looking at his momentum.

== Measuring acceleration ==

Take a slope, a trolley, some tapes and a stop watch, then put the tapes on the slope and take the trolley on the slope, and the stopwatch in your hand, as soon as you release the trolley, start timing the trolley at how fast it will move, when the trolley stops at the end then stop the timing.
After wards, after seeing the timing , record it, then you let the slope a little bit high, and you will see, how little by little it will decelerate.

= Newton =

Isaac Newton was an English physicist, mathematician (described in his own day as a &quot;natural philosopher&quot;) , astronomer and alchemist. Newton is one of the most influential scientists of all time, and he is known, among other things, for contributing to development of '''classical mechanics''' and for inventing, independently from ''Gottfried Leibniz'', '''calculus'''.

== Newton's laws of motion ==

Newton is also known by his '''three laws of motion''', which describe the '''relationship''' between a ''body'' and the ''forces acting upon it'', and ''its motion in response to said forces''.
# '''First Law''' (also known as the ''law of inertia'') states that every body continues in its star of rest or state of uniform motion unless compelled to change that state by being subject to an external force. The moment of inertia is defined as the tendency of matter to resist any change in its state of motion or state of rest.
# '''Second Law''' The vector sum of the external forces &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; on an object is equal to the mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of the object, or algebraically &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Third Law''' states that when one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

== Force ==

A force is any interaction that tends to '''change the motion of an object'''. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity. Force can also be described by intuitive concepts such as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a '''vector quantity'''. It is measured in the SI unit of ''newtons'' and represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

=== How to calculate the force? ===

When we want to calculate the force, and we have the ''mass'' and ''acceleration'', we can simply use the simple formula stated in the Newton's second law above, that is &lt;math&gt;F = ma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass (or the amount of matter in a body), and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration. Note that the Newton’s second law is defined as a numerical measure of inertia.

=== What is inertia?===

Inertia is the tendency of a body to maintain is state of rest or uniform motion, unless acted upon by an external force.

== Robert Hooke ==
Robert Hooke was an English polymath who played an important role in the scientific revolution, through both experimental and theoretical work.

=== Hooke's law===
Hooke's law is a principle of physics that states that the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to that distance, or algebraically &lt;math&gt;F = -kX&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant factor '''characteristic of the spring''', its stiffness.</text>

== Lesestück 4-1 ~ Eine Geschichte über Zürich ==
:&lt;big&gt;Zürich ist die größte Stadt der Schweiz. Sie liegt am Ausfluss des Zürichsees und ist die Hauptstadt des gleichnamigen Kantons, des Kantons Zürich. Zürich ist ausgesprochen schön gelegen, am nördlichen Ende des Zürichsees&amp;mdash;bei klarem Wetter hat man eine gute Sicht auf die Glarner Alpen.&lt;/big&gt;

:&lt;big&gt;Zürich ist das Zentrum der schweizer Bankenwirtschaft. Neben den beiden Großbanken ('Credit Suisse' und 'UBS') haben auch etliche kleinere Bankinstitute ihren Sitz in der Stadt.&lt;/big&gt;

Although this short story contains quite a number of impressive German nouns and adjectives, with the aid of ''Vokabeln 4-1'' following you should have no trouble reading and understanding it. The passage makes considerable use of the German genitive case (English possessive case), which you have not yet learned. However, a clue applicable here: translate ''des'' as &quot;of the&quot; or &quot;of&quot; and note there are other ''der''-words that also mean &quot;of the&quot;.

== Grammatik 4-1 ~ Introduction to adjectives ==
An '''[[Wikipedia:en:Adjective|adjective]]''' is a part of speech which can be thought of as a &quot;describing word&quot;&amp;mdash;typically, an adjective modifies a noun. In both English and German, adjectives come before the noun they describe or modify. In many other languages (such as French) they usually come after the noun. Here are some examples of &lt;u&gt;adjectives&lt;/u&gt; (underlined) you have already encountered:
{|
|''Ich habe &lt;u&gt;viel&lt;/u&gt; Arbeit.''
|I have &lt;u&gt;much&lt;/u&gt; work.
|-
|''Wir haben &lt;u&gt;keinen&lt;/u&gt; Käse.''
|We have &lt;u&gt;no&lt;/u&gt; cheese.
|-
|''Bei &lt;u&gt;klarem&lt;/u&gt; Wetter hat man eine &lt;u&gt;gute&lt;/u&gt; Sicht.''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|In &lt;u&gt;clear&lt;/u&gt; weather, one has a &lt;u&gt;good&lt;/u&gt; view
|-
|Zürich ist die &lt;u&gt;größte&lt;/u&gt; Stadt.''
|Zurich is the largest city. 
|}
Because nouns are capitalized in German, it is fairly obvious in these sentences where the adjectives occur: just before the nouns they modify. Note how the endings on German adjectives can change, depending upon the noun (''kein'''en''' Käse''; ''klar'''em''' Wetter''; ''gut'''e''' Sicht'')&amp;mdash;specifically, the '''gender''' and '''case''' of the noun they are modifying.  Before explaining the basic rules governing adjective endings, you need to have a better understanding of person, gender, and case in German nouns&amp;mdash;concepts that will be explored in the next few lessons.

Finally, realize that the '''ordinal numbers''' you learned in [[German/Lesson_3|Lektion 3]] are, in fact, adjectives&amp;mdash;subject to the same rules governing word endings for adjectives.

== Grammatik 4-2 ~ Nouns and pronouns in the accusative and dative ==

As was noted previously when the concept of '''case''' was introduced for pronouns ([[German/Lesson_2#Grammatik 2-2 ~ Pronouns in the Nominative Case|Grammatik 2-2]]), there are four cases used in German. Recall that the '''nominative''' case in German corresponds to the ''subjective case'' in English and applies to nouns and pronouns used in a sentence as the subject of a verb. Nouns (and pronouns) that are used as objects of transitive (action) verbs are in the English objective case.  If these are '''direct objects''' (recipients of the action of a verb), then these nouns are in the '''accusative case''' in German.  If '''indirect objects''', then these nouns are in the '''dative case''' in German.  Essentially, the English ''objective case'' is divided, in German, into an &lt;u&gt;accusative case used for direct objects&lt;/u&gt; and a &lt;u&gt;dative case used for indirect objects&lt;/u&gt;.

===Pronouns===
For comparison with English, recall that the singular personal pronouns (''nominative case'') are &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;he/she/it&quot; (1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons). The ''objective case'', personal pronouns in English are &quot;me&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;him/her/it&quot;&amp;mdash;and are used for both direct and indirect objects of verbs. For example:

:He gives &lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;[the Direct Object]&lt;/small&gt; to &lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt;[the Indirect Object]&lt;/small&gt;.

The German '''accusative case''', personal pronouns (singular) are: ''mich, dich, ihn/sie/es''. The German '''dative case''', personal pronouns (singular) are: ''mir'', ''dir'', ''ihm/ihr/ihm''. Thus, the above English example sentence becomes, in German:

:''Er gibt &lt;u&gt;es&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;small&gt;[the Direct Object]&lt;/small&gt; ''&lt;u&gt;mir&lt;/u&gt;'' &lt;small&gt;[the Indirect Object]&lt;/small&gt;.

Because ''mir'' is a dative pronoun, there is no need in German to use a modifier as in English, where &quot;to&quot; is used as a signal of an indirect object.  The following table summarizes the German pronouns in three cases for both singular and plural number:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Singular || || colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Plural
|-
|
 || NOM. || ACC. || DAT. || || NOM. || ACC. || DAT.
|-
| 1st person || '''ich''' || '''mich'''
| '''mir''' || || '''wir''' || '''uns''' || '''uns'''
|-
| 2nd person || '''du''' ('''Sie'''*) || '''dich''' ('''Sie'''*)
| '''dir''' ('''Ihnen'''*) || || '''ihr''' ('''Sie'''*)
| '''euch''' ('''Sie'''*) || '''euch''' ('''Ihnen'''*)
|-
| 3rd person || '''er''', '''sie''', '''es'''
| '''ihn''', '''sie''', '''es''' || '''ihm''', '''ihr''', '''ihm''' ||
| '''sie''' || '''sie''' || '''ihnen'''
|}
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Polite form

Recall from [[German/Lesson_2#Gespräch 2-1 ~ Die Geschäftsleute|Gespräch 2-1]] the &quot;incomplete&quot; sentence ''Und Ihnen?'' ('And you?'). Note that the pronoun agrees in case (here, dative) with the implied sentence &amp;mdash; ''Und wie geht es Ihnen?'' The same rule is evident in [[German/Lesson 1#Gespräch 1-1 ~ Die Freunde|Gespräch 1-1]] (''Und dir?''). Such agreement is important to convey the correct meaning. Tables giving the German personal pronouns in all cases can be found in an appendix:  [[German/Appendix_3|Pronoun Tables]].

=== Nouns ===
Nouns do not change their form (spelling) relative to case in German; instead, a preceding article indicates case. You have learned the nominative case definite and indefinite articles ([[German/Lesson 3#Grammatik 3-3 ~ Gender of Nouns|Grammatik 3-3]]: ''der'', ''die'', ''das'' and ''ein'', ''eine''. ''ein'') for each of the three noun  genders. Now we will learn the ''accusative'' (used to signal a direct object) and ''dative'' (used to signal an indirect object) articles. First, the definite articles:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
|
|colspan=&quot;3&quot;  | Singular || || colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Plural  
|-
|
 || NOM. || ACC. || DAT. || || NOM. || ACC. || DAT.
|-
| Masculine || '''der''' || '''den''' || '''dem''' ||
| '''die''' || '''die''' || '''den'''
|-
| Feminine || '''die''' || '''die''' || '''der''' ||
| '''die''' || '''die''' || '''den'''
|-
| Neuter || '''das''' || '''das''' || '''dem'''
|
 || '''die''' || '''die''' || '''den'''
|}

This table might seem a bit overwhelming (and there is yet one more case in German: the genitive!), but some points to note can make memorizing much easier.  First, as you can see from the table, ''gender'' does not really exist for plural nouns.  No matter what the noun gender in its singular number, its plural always has the same set of definite articles: ''die'', ''die'', ''den'' for nominative, accusative, and dative cases. The plural ''der''-words are similar to the  feminine singular ''der''-words, differing only in the dative case. Another point: the dative for both masculine and neuter nouns is the same: ''dem''. Finally, for feminine, neuter, and plural nouns, there is no change between nominative and accusative cases. Thus, only for masculine nouns is there a definite article change in the accusative compared with the nominative.   

The following examples demonstrate the use of the definite article in various parts of speech:
{|
|''Du hast &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; Wurst und &lt;u&gt;den&lt;/u&gt; Käse.''
|You have &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; sausage and &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; cheese.
|(accusative case)
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Die&lt;/u&gt; Geschäftsleute verstehen &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; Arbeit''
|The business associates understand the work.
|(nominative and accusative cases)
|-
|''Zürich ist &lt;u&gt;die&lt;/u&gt; größte Stadt.''
|Zurich is &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; largest city.
|(nominative case)
|}

In the last example, you need to know that in both English and German, the noun (or pronoun) that follows the verb 'to be' is a '''predicate noun''', for which the correct case is the '''nominative'''. That is why, in English, 'It is I' is grammatically correct and 'It is me' is simply incorrect. 

The indefinite articles are as follows:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | Singular
|-
|
 || NOM. || ACC. || DAT.
|-
| Masculine || '''ein''' || '''einen'''
| '''einem'''
|-
| Feminine || '''eine''' || '''eine'''
| '''einer''' 
|-
| Neuter
| '''ein''' || '''ein''' || '''einem'''
|}

Of course, there are no plural indefinite articles in German or English (''ein'' means &quot;a&quot;. &quot;an&quot;, or &quot;one&quot;).  It is important to see that there is a pattern in the case endings added to ''ein'' related to the ''der''-words in the definite articles table above.  For example, the dative definite article for masculine nouns is ''dem''&amp;mdash;the indefinite article is formed by adding ''-em'' onto ''ein'' to get ''einem''.  The dative definite article for feminine nouns is ''der''&amp;mdash;the indefinite is ''ein'' plus ''-er'' or ''einer''.  These ending changes will be covered in greater detail in a future lesson.  You will see that there are a number of words (adjectives, for example) whose form relative changes by addition of these endings to signal the case of the noun they modify. Finally, we can see a pattern relationship between these &quot;endings&quot; and the 3rd person pronouns as well: 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot;
|-
|
 ||  || NOM. || ACC. || DAT.
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Masculine || indef. article
| '''ein''' || '''einen''' || '''einem'''
|-
| 3rd pers. pronoun || '''er''' || '''ihn'''
| '''ihm'''
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Feminine || indef. article
| '''eine''' || '''eine''' || '''einer'''
|-
| 3rd pers. pronoun || '''sie''' || '''sie'''
| '''ihr''' 
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | Neuter
| indef. article || '''ein''' || '''ein'''
| '''einem'''
|-
| 3rd pers. pronoun || '''es''' || '''es'''
| '''ihm'''
|}
We could construct a similar table to compare the definite articles to the 3rd person pronouns.  And in that case, we would also see how the plural definite articles (''die'', ''die'', ''den'') compare with the third person plural pronouns (''sie'', ''sie'', ''ihnen'').

== Grammatik 4-3 ~ Interrogatives ==
You have encountered nearly all of the '''interrogatives''' commonly used in German (review [[German/Lesson_1#Grammatik_1-2 ~ Word Order in Questions|Grammatik 1-2]]):
  ''wann''                  when
  ''war&lt;b&gt;um&lt;/b&gt;''                 why            ''&lt;u&gt;Warum&lt;/u&gt; sind Sie müde?''
  ''was''                   what           ''&lt;u&gt;Was&lt;/u&gt; ist das?''
  ''wer''                   who            ''&lt;u&gt;Wer&lt;/u&gt; ist das Mädchen?''
  ''wie''                   how            ''&lt;u&gt;Wie&lt;/u&gt; geht es dir?''
  ''wieviel''               how much       ''&lt;u&gt;Wieviel&lt;/u&gt; Uhr ist es?''
  ''wo''                    where          ''&lt;u&gt;Wo&lt;/u&gt; ist das Buch?''
  ''wohin''                 where (to)     ''&lt;u&gt;Wohin&lt;/u&gt; gehst du?'' 
In a question, interrogatives replace the unknown object and establish the class of answer expected.
{|
|''&lt;u&gt;Was&lt;/u&gt; haben Sie?''
|What do you have?
|(Expected is a 'thing')
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Wieviel&lt;/u&gt; Arbeit ist zu viel?''
|How much work is too much?
|(Expected is a 'quantity')
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Wann&lt;/u&gt; gehst du nach Hause?''
|When do you go home?
|(Expected is a sense of 'time')
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Wo&lt;/u&gt; ist der Zürichsee?''
|Where is Lake Zurich?
|(Expected is a 'place')
|}
Note that the English construction for some of the questions differs from the German in that the former uses the progressive form of &quot;do&quot;.

== Comments ==

:So far, I like it.  One suggestion: you instroduce the concept of direct and indirect objects, and you give a rule for forming direct object, but you do not yet give a rule for forming indirect objects.  Those of us who have studied languages before are at the edges of our seats with anticipation...

Has anyone any comments on this lesson? Especially those with no knowledge of Esperanto, is this first lesson clear enough to follow (especially the grammar)? --[[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 12:31, 31 Oct 2003 (UTC)

:Looks like you are structuring things along the lines I have been using for [[German]], and I started out there by copying the [[Spanish]] language textbook well set up by Thomas. So I would say &quot;good start&quot;! What to actually present in each lesson is a difficult decision, and my feeling is, you may shift things around as you progress.  I do believe you should start simple, but make lots of ties (as you are doing) to English grammar as an English speaker can relate to these connections and some learners (like myself) need to see rules to understand why things are said as they are in the foreign language. I'd say you have a good handle on these concepts. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 20:36, 13 Nov 2003 (UTC)


--:Interesting, indeed fairly facsinating, and good choices of words introductory words (Or perhaps it's just that I like reading and cities).  Fairly useful, for a very basic introduction, but as an English speaker learning Spanish and hoping to learn Esparanto, I've found that I've had to go to several other sites to find much what I'm looking for.  It might be helpful if you gave certain common or useful words such as &quot;no&quot; &quot;on&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;as&quot; (or all ases) &quot;yes&quot; &quot;who&quot; &quot;what&quot; &quot;when&quot; &quot;why&quot; &quot;how&quot; and &quot;how many/much&quot;, perhaps as your next lesson.  Thanks though, nice introduction, and useful lesson. 6:24, 9 December 2004 (EST)

Does anyone have ideas for the review section? -[[User:Travisg|travisg]] 23:42, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

==='It is being &quot;verb'ed&quot;, so to speak.'===
I am familiar with nouns being &quot;verb'ed&quot; in an entirely different sense, idiomatically speaking. 
e.g. Google is a company that built a search engine; &quot;Google&quot; was &quot;verb'ed&quot; when people started using the word to mean &quot;search using Google's engine.&quot;
This usage is quite different - we mean to say that the verb is being applied to the direct object.

== Errors ==

I'm new to Esperanto, and I am finding this book fascinating!  Keep it up.  When you say &quot;Please note that not all adverbs use this rule, but the overwhelming majority of them do.&quot; do you mean that not all adverbs end -e?  A brief explanation would be beneficial here.  I thought that since this is a sythetic language, there are no exceptions to the rules! :) 
--[[User:Ralph walden|Ralph walden]] 02:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

:There are no exceptions; the rule is that to turn a root into an adverb, you add and -e. That's always true, but not all adverbs are formed from roots. There are some words that are purely adverbs, like {{lang eo|preskaŭ}} (&quot;almost&quot;). There is no &quot;{{lang eo|preska-}}&quot; root that this comes from (what would &quot;{{lang eo|preskao}}&quot; or &quot;{{lang eo|preskai}}&quot; mean?).

:But you're right - this really needs a bit more discussion. There is just too much crammed into this one lesson, and nothing is getting treated well. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 23:03, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

It seems a bit odd to say &quot;there is no verb conjugation in Esperanto.&quot; Vidi, vidas, vidis, vidos, vidus -- that's conjugation, buddy. If you are going to use grammatical terms please use them properly. [[User:Rikat|Rikat]] ([[User talk:Rikat|talk]]) 03:51, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

:Perhaps it would have been more constructive to edit the phrase in question to &quot;there is no verb conjugation in Esperanto for number or gender&quot;, rather than to criticize and do nothing else. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 23:03, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

The pronouns section seems to be incorrect. I think ''mi'' can only mean &quot;I&quot; not &quot;me&quot;. I'm pretty sure ''min'' is &quot;me&quot;. --[[User:Yair rand|Yair rand]] ([[User talk:Yair rand|talk]]) 20:36, 14 December 2009 (UTC)

:{{lang eo|Mi}} can mean &quot;me&quot;. If you point at a picture of yourself and say &quot;that's me&quot;, that would be &quot;{{lang eo|tio estas mi}}&quot;. This is not an inconsistency in Esperanto, but due to a quirk in English. In English you can use either &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot; as the predicate for the copula in certain conditions: for example, when announcing yourself you can say &quot;it is I&quot; or &quot;it is me&quot;. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 23:03, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

== Restructuring ==

This first &quot;lesson&quot; is way too grammar heavy. How about starting with a sentence like &quot;My name is (Bob). I'm from (USA).&quot; rather than starting with a long grammatical reference? Amazingly people can learn languages without knowing anything explicitly about grammar. Introduce the nouns, verbs, etc later, or introduce them more gradually. [[User:Pengo|Pengo]] ([[User talk:Pengo|talk]]) 05:47, 1 June 2008 (UTC)

:I agree - I looked at what was being introduced in the first lesson (&quot;Nouns, Adjectives, Adverbs, Personal and possessive pronouns, Verbs - Present Tense, Objects&quot;) and went cross-eyed. This really needs to be scaled down and separated substantially. --[[User:Indiana|Indiana]] ([[User talk:Indiana|talk]]) 23:03, 10 February 2010 (UTC)</text>

=About the ''Common uses in Physics''=
While these are indeed common usages, it should be pointed out that there are many other usages and that other letters are used for the same purpose. The reason is quite simple: there are only so many symbols in the Greek and Latin alphabets, and scientists and mathematicians generally do not use symbols from other languages. It is a common trap to associate a symbol exclusively with some particular meaning, rather than learning and understanding the physics and relations behind it.

This book is a guide to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a technique widely used in web pages including Wikipedia to describe their visual style and appearance. CSS can take [[HTML]] to new places creatively and functionally. Once you learn how to style mark-up, you can additionally learn [[JavaScript]] functions that make dynamic web pages.

== Lesestück 5-1 ~ Eine Geschichte über St. Pölten ==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Map at sankt pölten.png|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Karte: St. Pölten in Österreich''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Niederösterreich ist sowohl flächenmäßig als auch nach Einwohnern das größte der neun österreichischen Bundesländer. Sankt Pölten ist die Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich. Der Name St. Pölten geht auf den heiligen Hippolytos zurück, nach dem die Stadt benannt wurde.

Die Altstadt befindet sich dort, wo vom 2. bis zum 4. Jahrhundert die Römerstadt ''Aelium Cetium'' stand. 799 wurde der Ort als &quot;Treisma&quot; erwähnt. Das Marktrecht erhielt St. Pölten um 1050, zur Stadt erhoben wurde es 1159. Bis 1494 stand St. Pölten im Besitz des Bistums Passau, dann wurde es landesfürstliches Eigentum. Bereits 771 findet sich ein Benediktinerkloster, ab 1081 gab es Augustiner-Chorherren, 1784 wurde deren Kollegiatsstift aufgehoben, das Gebäude dient seit 1785 als Bischofssitz. Zur Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich wurde St. Pölten mit Landtagsbeschluss vom 10. Juli 1986, seit 1997 ist es Sitz der Niederösterreichischen Landesregierung.

:::''&quot;It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.&quot;''

==Introduction==
Mathematicians have been, for the past five hundred years or so, obsessed with proofs. They want to prove everything, and in the process proved that they can't prove everything (see [[w:Incompleteness theorem|this]]). This chapter will introduce the axiomatic approach to mathematics, and several types of proofs.

==Direct proof==
The direct proof is relatively simple &amp;mdash; by logically applying previous knowledge, we ''directly prove'' what is required.

'''Example 1'''

Prove that the sum of any two even integers ''x'' and ''y'' is even.

'''Solution 1'''

We know that since ''x'' and ''y'' are even, they must have 2 as a factor. Then, we can write the following:

Let x = 2a, y = 2b, for some integers ''a'' and ''b''

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x + y
&amp;=&amp; 2a + 2b\\
&amp;=&amp; 2(a + b)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
, by the distributive property of integers

The number 2(a + b) clearly has 2 as a factor, which implies it is even. Therefore, x + y is even.

'''Example 2'''

Prove the following statement for non-zero integers ''a, b, c'':

If ''a'' divides ''b'' and ''b'' divides ''c'', then ''a'' divides ''c''.

'''Solution 2'''

If an integer ''x'' divides an integer ''y'', then we can write y = qx, for some non-zero integer ''q''. So let's say that b = qa and c = rb, for some non-zero integers ''q'' and ''r''. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}c
&amp;=&amp;rb\\
&amp;=&amp;r(qa)\\
&amp;=&amp;(rq)a\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
, by the associative property of integer multiplication.

But since ''q'' and ''r'' are integers, their product ''qr'' must also be an integer. Therefore, ''c'' is the product of some integer multiplied by ''a'', so we get that ''a'' divides ''c''.

==Mathematical induction==
Deductive reasoning is the process of reaching a conclusion that is guaranteed to follow. For example, if we know
* All ravens are black birds, and
* For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction 
then we can conclude:
* This bird is a raven, therefore it is black.
* This billiard ball will move when struck with a cue.

Induction is the opposite of deduction. To induce, we observe how things behave in specific cases and from that we draw conclusions as to how things behave in the general case. 

Suppose we want to show that a statement (let us call it ''S'' for easier notation) is true for all natural numbers. This is how induction a proof by induction works:
# First, we show that ''S'' is true for the natural number 1. This is usually called the ''basis'' or the ''base case''.
# Then, we show that ''S'' is true for natural number &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; whenever it is true for natural number &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;.
# By mathematical induction, ''S'' is true for all natural numbers.

To understand how the last step works, notice the following
* ''S'' is true for 1 (due to step 1)
* ''S'' is true for 2 because it is true for 1 (due to step 2)
* ''S'' is true for 3 because it is true for 2 (due to previous)
* ''S'' is true for 4 because it is true for 3 (due to previous)
* ''S'' is true for 5 because it is true for 4 (due to previous)
* and so on ...

'''Example 1'''
Show that the identity
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{(n + 1)n}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
holds for all positive integers.

'''Solution'''
Firstly, we show that it holds for 1
: &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{(1 + 1)1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the identity holds for some natural number ''k'':
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k &lt;/math&gt;

This supposition is known as the induction hypothesis.  We assume it is true, and aim to show that,
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) = \frac{1}{2}(k + 2)(k + 1) &lt;/math&gt;
is also true.

We proceed
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp; &amp; =&amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k\\
\\
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp;+ (k + 1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k + (k + 1)\\
\\
&amp; &amp; = &amp; (k + 1)(\frac{k}{2} + 1)\\
\\
&amp; &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)(k + 2)
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is what we have set out to show. Since the identity holds for 3, it also holds for 4, and since it holds for 4 it also holds for 5, and 6, and 7, and so on.

There are two types of mathematical induction: strong and weak. In weak induction, you assume the identity holds for certain value k, and prove it for k+1. In strong induction, the identity must be true for any value lesser or equal to k, and then prove it for k+1.

'''Example 2'''
Show that n! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for n &amp;ge; 4.

'''Solution'''
The claim is true for n = 4. As 4! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. 24 &gt; 16.
Now suppose it's true for n = k, k &amp;ge; 4, i.e.
:k! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;
it follows that
:(k+1)k! &gt; (k+1)2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;
:(k+1)! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;
We have shown that if for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Since it's true for n = 4, it's true for n = 5, 6, 7, 8 and so on for all n.

'''Example 3'''
Show that
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ n^3 = \frac {(n+1)^2n^2}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution'''
Suppose it's true for n = k, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ k^3 = \frac {(k+1)^2k^2}{4} &lt;/math&gt;
it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ k^3 + (k+1)^3 &amp; = &amp;\frac {(k+1)^2k^2}{4} + (k+1)^3\\
&amp; = &amp;  (k+1)^2 (\frac{k^2}{4} + (k+1))\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac {1}{4}(k+1)^2 (k^2 + 4k + 4)\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac {1}{4}(k+1)^2 (k + 2)^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
We have shown that if it's true for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Now it's true for n = 1 (clear). Therefore it's true for all integers.

=== Exercises ===
1. Prove that &lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = \frac{ n(2n^2 + 3n +1)}{6} &lt;/math&gt;

2. Prove that for n &amp;ge; 1,
:&lt;math&gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})^n = x_n + y_n\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
where x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are integers.

3. Note that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^k - (i-1)^k] = n^k&lt;/math&gt;
Prove that there exists an explicit formula for
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^m&lt;/math&gt; for all integer ''m''. E.g.
&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

4. The sum of all of the interior angles of a triangle is &lt;math&gt;180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the sum of all the angles of a rectangle is &lt;math&gt;360^\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Prove that the sum of all the angles of a polygon with ''n'' sides, is &lt;math&gt;(n - 2)\cdot 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof by contradiction==
:''&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, what ever remains, however improbable must be the truth.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle''

The idea of a proof by contradiction is to:
# First, we assume that the ''opposite'' of what we wish to prove is true.
# Then, we show that the logical consequences of the assumption include a contradiction.
#Finally, we conclude that the assumption must have been false.

=== &amp;radic;2 is irrational ===
As an example, we shall prove that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not a rational number. Recall that a rational number is a number which can be expressed in the form of p/q, where p and q are integers and q does not equal 0 (see the 'categorizing numbers' section [[HSE Complex Number|here]]).

First, assume that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is ''rational'':&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime (i.e. integers with no common factors, with greatest common divisor 1). If ''a'' and ''b'' are not coprime, we remove all common factors. In other words, ''a/b'' is in simplest form. Now, continuing:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\sqrt{2} &amp;=&amp; a/b \\
2 &amp;=&amp; a^2/b^2 \\
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; a^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We have now found that ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is some integer multiplied by 2. Therefore, ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' must be divisible by two. If ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is even, then ''a'' must also be even, for an odd number squared yields an odd number. Therefore we can write ''a = 2c'', where ''c'' is another integer.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; a^2 \\
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; (2c)^2 \\
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; 4c^2 \\
b^2 &amp;=&amp; 2c^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We have discovered that ''b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is also an integer multiplied by two. It follows that ''b'' must be even. We have a contradiction! Both ''a'' and ''b'' are even integers. In other words, both have the common factor of 2. But we already said that ''a/b'' is in simplest form, with no common factors. Since such a contradiction has been established, we must conclude that our original assumption was false. Therefore, &amp;radic;2 is irrational.

=== Contrapositive ===
Some propositions that take the form of ''if xxx then yyy'' can be hard to prove. It is sometimes useful to consider the ''contrapositive'' of the statement. Before I explain what contrapositive is let us see an example
:&quot;If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is odd then ''x'' is also odd&quot;
is harder to prove than
:&quot;if ''x'' is even then ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also even&quot;
although they mean the same thing. So instead of proving the first proposition directly, we prove the second proposition instead.

If ''A'' and ''B'' are two propositions, and we aim to prove
:If ''A'' is true then ''B'' is true
we may prove the equivalent statement
:If ''B'' is false then ''A'' is false
instead. This technique is called proof by contrapositive.

To see why those two statements are equivalent, we show the following boolean algebra expressions is true (see [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Logic | Logic]])
:&lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q \equiv q' \Rightarrow p' \!&lt;/math&gt;
(to be done by the reader).

=== Exercises ===
1. Prove that there is no perfect square number for 11,111,1111,11111......

2. Prove that there are infinitely number of ''k'''s such that, 4''k'' + 3, is prime. (Hint: consider N = p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...p&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + 3)

== Reading higher mathematics ==
This is some basic information to help with reading other higher mathematical literature.
''... to be expanded''

===Quantifiers===
Sometimes we need propositions that involve some description of rough quantity, e.g. &quot;For ''all'' odd integers x, x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also odd&quot;. The word ''all'' is a description of quantity. The word &quot;some&quot; is also used to describe quantity.

Two special symbols are used to describe the quanties &quot;all&quot; and &quot;some&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;for all&quot; or &quot;for any&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;there are some&quot; or &quot;there exists&quot;

'''Example 1'''&lt;br&gt;
The proposition:
:''For all even integers ''x'', x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also even.''
can be expressed symbolically as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(x\mbox{ is even} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is even}) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 2'''&lt;br&gt;
The proposition:
:''There are some odd integers ''x'', such that x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even.''
can be expressed symbolically as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\exist x)(x\mbox{ is odd} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is even}) &lt;/math&gt;
This proposition is false.

'''Example 3'''&lt;br&gt;
Consider the proposition concerning (z = x'y' + xy):
:''For any value of ''x'', there exist a value for ''y'', such that z = 1.
can be expressed symbolically as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(\exist y)(z = 1) &lt;/math&gt;
This proposition is true. Note that the order of the quantifiers is important. While the above statement is true, the statement
:&lt;math&gt;(\exist y)(\forall x)(z = 1) &lt;/math&gt;
is false. It asserts that there is one value of y which is the same for all x for which z=1. The first statement only asserts that there is a y for each x, but different values of x may have different values of y.

====Negation====
Negation is just a fancy word for the opposite, e.g. The ''negation'' of &quot;All named Britney can sing&quot; is &quot;Some named Britney can't sing&quot;. What this says is that to disprove that all people named Britney can sing, we only need to find one named Britney who can't sing. To express symbolically:
:Let ''p'' represent a person named Britney
:&lt;math&gt;[(\forall p)(p\mbox{ can sing})]' = (\exists p)(p\mbox{ cannot sing})&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, to disprove
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(x\mbox{ is odd} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is even}) &lt;/math&gt;
we only need to find one odd number that doesn't satisfy the condition. Three is odd, but 3&amp;times;3 = 9 is also odd, therefore the proposition is FALSE and
:&lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(x\mbox{ is odd} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is odd}) &lt;/math&gt;
is TRUE

In summary, to obtain the ''negation'' of a proposition involving a quantifier, you replace the quantifier by its opposite (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;) and the ''quantified proposition'' (e.g. &quot;x is even&quot;) by its negation (e.g. &quot;x is odd&quot;).

'''Example 1'''
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(\exists y)(x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) + 1 = y^2) &lt;/math&gt;
is a true statement.
Its negation is 
:&lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(\forall y)(x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) + 1 \ne y^2) &lt;/math&gt;

== Axioms and Inference ==
If today's mathematicians were to describe the greatest achievement in mathematics in the 20th century in one word, that word will be '''abstraction'''. True to its name, abstraction is a very abstract concept (see [[w:Abstraction_%28mathematics%29|Abstraction]]).

In this chapter we shall discuss the ''essence'' of some of the number systems we are familiar with. For example, the real numbers and the rational numbers. We look at the most fundamental properties that, in some sense, ''define'' those number systems.

We begin our discussion by looking at some of the more obscure results we were told to be true
* 0 times any number gives you 0
* a negative number multiplied by a negative number gives you a positive number
Most people simply accept that they are true (and they are), but the two results above are simple consequences of what we believe to be true in a number system like the real numbers!

To understand this we introduce the idea of axiomatic mathematics (mathematics with simple assumptions). An axiom is a statement about a number system that we assume to be true. Each number system has a few axioms, from these axioms we can draw conclusions (inferences).

Let's consider the Real numbers, it has axioms
Let ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' be real numbers
: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from the real numbers
:'''A1:''' ''a''+''b'' is a real number also (''closure'')
:'''A2:''' There exist 0, such that 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of zero - an ''identity'')
:'''A3:''' For every ''a'', there exist ''b'' (written -''a''), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive inverse)
:'''A4:''' (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') (associativity of addition)
:'''A5:''' ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' (commutativity of addition)

: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from the real numbers excluding zero
:'''M1:''' ''ab'' is a real number also (''closure'')
:'''M2:''' There exist an element, 1, such that 1''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of one - an ''identity'')
:'''M3:''' For every ''a'' there exists a ''b'' such that ''ab'' = 1
:'''M4:''' (''ab'')''c'' = ''a''(''bc'') (associativity of multiplication)
:'''M5:''' ''ab'' = ''ba'' (commutativity of multiplication)

:'''D1:''' ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac'' (distributivity)

These are the ''minimums'' we assume to be true in this system. These are ''minimum'' in the sense that everything else that is true about this number system can be derived from those axioms!

Let's consider the following true identity
:(x + y)z = xz + yz
which is not included in the axioms, but we can prove it using the axioms. We proceed:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(x + y)z &amp; = &amp; z(x + y) \ \mbox{by M5}\\
         &amp; = &amp; zx + zy \ \mbox{by D1}\\
         &amp; = &amp; xz + yz \ \mbox{by M5}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Before we proceed any further, you will have notice that the real numbers are not the only numbers that satisfies those axioms! For example the rational numbers also satisfy all the axioms. This leads to the abstract concept of a ''field''. In simple terms, a ''field'' is a number system that satisfies all those axiom. Let's define a ''field'' more carefully:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
A number system, ''F'', is a ''field'' if it supports + and &amp;times; operations such that:
: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from ''F''
:'''A1:''' ''a'' + ''b'' is in ''F'' also (''closure'')
:'''A2:''' There exist 0, such that 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of zero - an ''identity'')
:'''A3:''' For every ''a'', there exist ''b'' (written -''a''), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive inverse)
:'''A4:''' (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') (associativity of addition)
:'''A5:''' ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' (commutativity of addition)

: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from ''F'' with the zero removed (sometimes written ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)
:'''M1:''' ''ab'' is in ''F'' (''closure'')
:'''M2:''' There exist an element, 1, such that 1''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of one - the ''identity'')
:'''M3:''' For every ''a'' there exists a ''b'' such that ''ab'' = 1 (inverses)
:'''M4:''' (''ab'')''c'' = ''a''(''bc'') (associativity of multiplication)
:'''M5:''' ''ab'' = ''ba'' (commutativity of multiplication)

:'''D1:''' ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac'' (distributivity)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, for '''M3''', we do not let ''b'' be zero, since 1/0 has no meaning. However for the ''M'' axioms, we have excluded zero anyway.

For interested students, the requirements of ''closure'', ''identity'', having ''inverses'' and ''associativity'' on an operation and a set are known as a [[Abstract algebra:groups|group]]. If ''F'' is a group with addition and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a group with multiplication, plus the distributivity requirement, ''F'' is a field. The above axioms merely state this fact in full.

Note that the natural numbers are not a field, as '''M3''' is generally not satisfied, i.e. not every natural number has an inverse that is also a natural number.

Please note also that (-''a'') denotes the additive inverse of ''a'', it doesn't say that (-a) = (-1)(a), although we can prove that they are equivalent.

'''Example 1'''

Prove using only the axioms that 0 = -0, where -0 is the additive inverse of 0.

'''Solution 1'''
:0 = 0 + (-0) by '''A3:''' existence of inverse
:0 = (-0) by '''A2:''' 0 + a = a

'''Example 2'''

Let F be a field and ''a'' an element of F. Prove using nothing more than the axioms that 0''a'' = 0 for all ''a''.

'''Solution'''
:0 = 0a + (-0a) by '''A3''' existence of inverse
:0 = (0 + 0)a + (-0a) by Example 1
:0 = (0a + 0a) + (-0a) by distributivity and commutativity of multiplication
:0 = 0a + (0a + (-0a)) by associativity of addition
:0 = 0a + 0 by '''A3'''
:0 = 0a by '''A2'''.

'''Example 3'''

Prove that (-''a'') = (-1)''a''.

'''Solution 3'''
:(-a) = (-a) + 0
:(-a) = (-a) + 0a by Example 2
:(-a) = (-a) + (1 + (-1))a
:(-a) = (-a) + (1a + (-1)a)
:(-a) = (-a) + (a + (-1)a)
:(-a) = ((-a) + a) + (-1)a
:(-a) = 0 + (-1)a
:(-a) = (-1)a

One wonders why we need to prove such obvious things (obvious since primary school). But the idea is not to prove that they are true, but to practise inferencing, how to logically join up arguments to prove a point. That is a vital skill in mathematics.

=== Exercises ===

4. Prove by induction &lt;math&gt; {n \choose 0} + 2{n\choose 1} + 2^2{n\choose 2} + ... + 2^n{n\choose n}  = 3^n&lt;/math&gt;

We could use a photo illustrating the conversation in Gespräch 2-2 ~ Das neues Mädchen.  One of a young couple talking in a social setting; even better, with a short, long-haired brunette in the background - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:56, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Would the translation for ''spielen'' be ''play'', as is on the page, or the infinitive ''to play''? [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 02:35, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:I think ''spielen'' is the infinitive, ''I can play'' should be ''Ich kann spiele''. Maybe [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]] can clear this up. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 04:48, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I think it is a matter of how you want to present verbs. I originally had them as &quot;to play&quot; (which is correct), but it is also correct I believe to simply list the english verb that ''spielen'' represents: play. The vocabulary is not a direct translation list, but a list of words in German from the excercise and what they mean in that context) in English. I have two text books and a large Dictionary in front of me and one text gives the verbs thus: spielen - to play; whereas another textbook and the dictionary (New Cassell's) list them thus: spielen - play. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:11, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Hmm, ok. I looked up ''spielen'' on LEO and I got the infinitive 'to play', with(present tense)
&lt;pre&gt;
ich 	spiele 	 AKLL OF THESE ARE &quot;play&quot; IN ENGLISH
du 	spielst 	
er/sie 	spielt 	
wir 	spielen 	
ihr 	spielt 	
sie 	spielen 
&lt;/pre&gt;
but then babelfish/altavista translated 'I can play' as ''Ich kann spielen'', so I don't know what's correct. I suppose since you know more German than I do that you're right. :) [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 08:39, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Yes, ''kann spielen'' is correct:
&lt;pre&gt;
ich       kann spielen
du        kannst spielen (formal: Sie können spielen)
er/sie/es kann spielen
wir       können spielen
ihr       könnt spielen (formal: Sie können spielen)
sie       können spielen
&lt;/pre&gt;
The formal &quot;Sie&quot; is captialized.

Some other forms with the infinitive:
&lt;pre&gt;
ich        muss   / darf   / soll   / will
du         musst  / darfst / sollst / willst
er/sie/es  muss   / darf   / soll   / will
wir        müssen / dürfen / sollen / wollen
ihr        müsst  / dürft  / sollt  / wollt
sie        müssen / dürfen / sollen / wollen
&lt;/pre&gt;

And some things (negation of the above) which are different:
&lt;pre&gt;
ich muss        I must
ich darf        I am allowed to
ich muss nicht  I don't need to
ich darf nicht  I must not 
ich soll        I should
ich soll nicht  I should not
ich kann        I can (I am able to, I am allowed to)
ich kann nicht  I cannot (like above)
ich will        I want to
ich will nicht  I dont't want to
&lt;/pre&gt;
--[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 09:37, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Well, I'm saying either way of presentation is correct. Not giving the English &quot;to play&quot;, but instead using &quot;play&quot; is just a matter of personal preference. My very big German dictionary does not present English verbs as &quot;to xxxxx&quot; in the German to English translations. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 09:44, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::Yes, the &quot;to&quot; is just a confirmation (clarification) that it is the inifinitive. The dictionary usually only lists irregular forms, so it's somewhat reduntant (although my dictionary says &quot;to&quot; ;). --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 09:53, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

''Fräulein'' was used instead of ''Frau'' to refer to an unmarried woman. It's no longer used since the 60s or 70s. It's rather infrequently used to address a waitress. Otherwise it has a humoristic or ironic meaning. --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 07:53, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Hey, that's when I learned German!  What is &quot;Miss&quot; now? Anyway, certainly go in and change anything you see to modernize the German. Really appreciated! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:41, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::''Fräulein'' was replaced by ''Frau'', there is no special &quot;Miss&quot;. You might use it you translate something english and &quot;Miss&quot; (instead of Mrs) is important. But you might also simply use &quot;Miss&quot; in this case. --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 09:19, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Hard to believe a culture would dump a word implying youthful beauty (Fräulein) for a word that has a more (IMHO) frumpy connotation (Frau).  Did the young people simply start calling &quot;chicks&quot; --&gt; &quot;Fraus&quot;?  Or was there always a different set of colloquial expressions, and Fräuline went out with the Miss, Mrs., Ms. trends as in the US? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:34, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC) Along the same lines, would changing the sentence in Gesprach 2-2 &gt;&gt; Helena: ''Sie ist hübsch, wenn man kleine Mädchen mit langen schwarzen Haaren mag.'' to &gt;&gt;Helena: ''Sie ist hübsch, wenn man kleine Fräulein mit langen schwarzen Haaren mag.'' put more of an edge on her jealose reply to Karl?  That is, could one translate ''Fräulein'' in this case as &quot;girl (tart)&quot;? Or is there a word that would be more suitable (or is ''Mädchen'' just fine)?  - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

:::It was considered inappropriate to see if somebody is married in the name (the &quot;title&quot;), especially if it's only used for females (i.e. no &quot;Herrlein&quot;). &quot;Mädels&quot;, &quot;Mädchen&quot; is more like &quot;chicks&quot;. &quot;Schlampe&quot; might do for Helena (*). My dictionary gives &quot;slut&quot; as translation.
(*) to say, not to be - &quot;Zicke&quot; (nanny goat ;), cow, bitch, prude, silly thing) might better characterize Helena. I don't think those translations are right though.
--[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 08:42, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::For now I can leave it at &quot;mädchen&quot; I don't want her attitude to be too obvious: A more subtle &quot;oh yeh, if you like that kind of girl&quot; is what I'm aiming for - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 16:27, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

----

In [[German: Lesson 2]] I've changed one &quot;Fremder&quot; to &quot;Fremde&quot; and another one to &quot;Fremden&quot;. Both are nominative plural, and I don't know exactly why they differ, but I'm quite sure of this because I'm a native German speaker. It probably has something to do with &quot;fremd&quot; being an adjective. &quot;Der Fremde&quot; is a noun, but the endings are the same as those of the adjective: &quot;fremde Leute&quot; (=&quot;foreign people&quot;) but &quot;die fremden Leute&quot; (=&quot;the foreign people&quot;).--[[User:El|El]] 15:57, 7 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Ok, Marsh. I'm not sure if it's necessary to introduce reflexive verbs in the first lesson. You could avoid it by saying: &quot;Heinrich trifft Karl. Sie sind Freunde.&quot; -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 18:38, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:Of course, it's (almost) right to say &quot;Haben Sie Herr Standish schon angetroffen?&quot;. But I feel, the word &quot;antreffen, angetroffen&quot; is pretty difficult for the first lesson. You could say &quot;Haben Sie Herrn Standish schon getroffen?&quot; Anyway, this is more common.
:Or how about &quot;Haben Sie Herrn Standish schon gesehen?&quot; - Note: Actualy, &quot;Herr Standish&quot; stands in the Dativ, here. Nevertheless, many Germans would also say &quot;Herr Standish&quot; in colloquial language.
:Since you want to give a lesson about pronouns and the 2 forms for the 2nd person, I would try to keep the rest as easy as possible. The sentence &quot;Aber verstehe ich richtig, dass er zu Besuch ist?&quot; has a relativ sentence. Wouldn't it easyer just to say: &quot;Ist er zu Besuch?&quot; -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 18:51, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)
::Sounds good to me. Simplifying the early lessons is always a better idea. I will implement changes when I get the chance. Danke! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:06, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I think there's a little problem with &quot;heißen&quot; in section &quot;Grammatik 2-3&quot;: It's only used in a passive meaning like it's said there: &quot;Thus heißen can best be translated as 'to be named' or 'to be called'.&quot; But the 4 examples demonstrate an active meaning of &quot;call/name&quot;. This would be translated as &quot;nennen&quot; in German, so the examples really may make it clearer, but they are wrong... or at least have a quite archaic sound ;) - [[User:Monsi|Monsi]] 17:59, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:I believe there are a number of German nouns that make sense in the present tense in German, but are not so easily or singularly translated into English.  English would never say &quot;I name Eric&quot; for &quot;my name is...&quot; - But if you are saying German would not any more really say &quot;Ich heiße Erick&quot; but....what (?) &quot;Ich nenne Erick?&quot; Still the same non-correspondence between German present tense and English. Please clarify; is it that heißen is really only used in the passive? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:44, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::Yes, heißen is only used in the sense of &quot;to be called&quot;. It used to be used like &quot;jdn etw. heißen&quot;(to call sb. sth.), but that usage is archaic, dating back to the 1920s or so I'd say. &quot;nennen&quot; requires the reflexive pronoun if used to refer to oneself: &quot;Ich nenne mich Judith&quot;, but that's not really common when introducing oneself, it's like saying &quot;I call myself Judith&quot;. &quot;nennen&quot; is what we use to say &quot;to call sb. sth.&quot; nowadays though, e. g. &quot;er nannte ihn einen Idiot&quot; = &quot;he called him an idiot&quot;.
:::I was not happy with the way the lesson was going using ''heißen''&amp;mdash;too complicated for so early in the text, and even the examples come from sentences that have since moved deeper into the book. I will rewrite and drop ''heißen'' here; but it or ''nennen'' will show up sooner than latter. Are some of the examples with ''heißen'' &quot;modern&quot;, or all &quot;archaic&quot; - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:10, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

There is a lot more going on here: 
# The line about 'to be' refering to the use of present continous makes no sense at all. 'Heißen/Nennen' (Heißen is wrong as we know, substitute with 'Nennen'and it works). But nevertheless, 'Nennen' needs a passive construction similar to its closest English equivalent 'to be called xyz'. Continous does not! come into it. &quot;Die Firma wird Trans-Global genannt.&quot; -&gt; &quot;The company is called Trans-Global&quot; Both passive voice.
# Contrary to the commentary there is a different way to express 'is called'. It takes - surprise - the verb 'heißen' only with a change of subjects: Forget the 'They' and a passive voice. It is rather &quot;Die Firma heißt Trans-Global.&quot; Nice, clean and easy.
# What's the deal with 'Um!-Global'? Proper names, especially of Latin origin, only get the worse for translation. Trans-Global sounds like a good German import-export firm. There probably is one for real just around the corner!
# Concerning Company = 'Gemeinde'. 'Gemeinde' means either 'parish' (religious group) or 'district' (local bureaucratic entity). I would go for 'Firma'.
# 'Die Geschäftsmänner'. Thought long and hard about it and the conclusion is, that maybe with pc and the rest of it, the plural of 'Geschäftsmann' is now 'Geschäftsleute'. We just don't use pure masuline plurals anymore, even if they happen to be all male.  
# I will quickly nip over and correct 'das! Vereinigtes! Königreich' 
# Somewhere I changed 'friends' = 'Brüder' into 'Freunde'. To call a mate your sibbling is theoretically possible in a colloquial setting (a bit like Hey Bro'). For the beginner, it could only be confusing. 
# There is also a problem with 'die Frau' = 'Ms.' That is just confusing vocab practice because 'die Frau' = 'the woman'. That does not convey the meaning of honorific adress. You have to cut out the defnite article. Better then to learn it as a phrase than as an ambivlent single word. 
It's even worse for the male form: 'Der Herr' without anything else indicating the use as title/honorific would actually refer to god. 

That's it for the moment. 
: [[User:Floflei6|Floflei6]]

OK. Fix what you regard as archaic (a lot of these words come from LEO which has no systyem for indicating what is currently acceptable and what is archaic). I'll change the Herr und Frau as you suggest. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:42, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

According to [http://dict.leo.org/ LEO], it is &quot;Vereinigtes Königreich&quot; - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:49, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

&quot;Vereinigtes Königreich&quot; without articel, but &quot;Das Vereinigte Königreich ...

== &quot;Das ist richtig.&quot; rather unusual ==

In Germany &quot;Das ist richtig&quot; is mostly used as &quot;That's correct&quot; as a teacher says to his pupil (&quot;Did I make a mistake?&quot; - &quot;No, that's correct&quot;). But here it is used twice in unusual situtations: 
:&quot;Ist er zu Besuch? - Ja. Das ist richtig.&quot; should be simply &quot;Ja.&quot; or &quot;Ja, er wohnt zur Zeit bei mir.&quot; or &quot;Ja&quot; with another additional information.
:&quot;Zu viel ist zu viel. - Das ist richtig.&quot; should be &quot;So ist es.&quot;, &quot;Da haben Sie Recht.&quot; or something like that.
::Obviously such subtleties reflect (among other things) changes in the use of words/phrases over time.  I have no problem with using your suggestions - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:51, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== studieren ==

&quot;Today we study German.&quot; would rather be &quot;Heute lernen wir Deutsch.&quot; 
To study means &quot;studieren&quot; or &quot;lernen&quot; - but in German the two words are not the same thing. &quot;Studieren&quot; is what you do at a university - usually for a couple of years (even though ''we'' tend to drop out or change our subjects quite often // studieren can as well mean to examine thoroughly)
jacs --[[User:Jacs|Jacs]] 01:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
:Considering that the lesson here is going from English to German (from a story about University studies), it complicates things to substitute the &quot;more correct&quot; ''lernen'' - so the implication is simply that &quot;today we study German (at the university)&quot;.  I do not see the need for a change? - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 05:05, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Conjugating 'to be'==

&lt;pre&gt;
Ich bin groß.              I am tall.
Du bist sehr groß.         You are very tall.
Sie ist klein.             She is short.
Sie sind groß.             They are tall.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these cases, we use the correct form of ''sein'' for each situation. Please notice the final two sentences both use 'Sie', and we must look at the verb to determine the difference between 'she' and 'they'.

In German, the English infinitive 'to be' is translated as ''sein''.

This is the table of the forms of 'sein', with rough English translations. Note that in English, there are only three forms (am, is, are) while German has five (bin, bist, ist, sind, seid).

Also, the verb conjugation of the two you-formals are always the exact same.

&lt;big&gt;'''German'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''sein'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Conjugating Normal Verbs==

&lt;pre&gt;
Er spielt Volleyball.      He plays volleyball.
Ich mache Hausaufgaben.    I do my homework.
Wir kommen aus München.    We come from Munich.
Was machst du?             What are you doing?
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these sentences, different verbs and endings are used. Note that the verb is always in second position.

When conjugating normal verbs, use the endings shown below (a memory hook is the ''&quot;best ten&quot;'' endings). Note that in normal verbs, such as spielen and machen, ihr-form and er/sie/es-form are the same and the wir-form, sie (pl)-form and the formal are all the same as the infinitive.

==Conjugating Irregular Verbs==

&lt;pre&gt;
Ich habe keine Zeit.       I have no time.
Gib mir das Buch!          Give me the book.
Sie wandert gern.          She likes to hike.
Er liest einen Roman.      He is reading a novel.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In each of these sentences, we use an irregular verb. Irregularity occurs in the ich-form or the du-form and er/sie/es-forms. There are three types of irregularity.

===E in the first syllable===

One form of irregularity occurs ''sometimes'' when the verb contains an 'e' in the first syllable. The change is simple: the du-form and er/sie/es forms both change the 'e' to an 'i.e.' or an 'i'. Two common examples are shown. Note that the er/sie/es-form and ihr-form are no longer the same.

&lt;big&gt;'''sehen - to see'''&lt;/big&gt;

===Haben===

A similar, yet different, change occurs in the verb &quot;haben&quot;. As in the irregularity above, the du-form and er/sie/es-form change.

&lt;big&gt;'''haben - to have'''&lt;/big&gt;

===Verbs ending in Consonant-N===

Some verbs change the ich-form for obvious reasons. &quot;Wandern&quot;  and &quot;basteln&quot;  are two examples. Both drop the first e in the ich-form.

==Conjugating Modals==

&lt;pre&gt;
Ich will ins Kino gehen.   I want to go to the movies.
Dürfen wir hier essen?     May we eat here?
Was kann ich für dich tun? What can I do for you?
Er mag Romane lesen.       He likes to read books.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Modals are a new kind of verb. They are the equivalent to helping verbs in English. There are seven basic modals: können (can), mögen (like), dürfen (may), wollen (want), sollen (should), müssen (must), and möchten (would like). Möchten isn't technically a modal, but it acts like one in most aspects.

Modals are conjugated very differently. The ich-form and er/sie/es-form are always alike and singular has a different verb in the first syllable (except in sollen and möchten). Below are the conjugations of the six basic modals and möchten.

&lt;big&gt;'''können - can'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Separable Verbs==

&lt;pre&gt;
Du siehst schön aus!       You look good!
Ich muss mein Zimmer aufräumen.
                           I have to clean my room.
Komm mit!                  Come with!
Probier diese Jeans an!    Try these jeans on.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some verbs in German are separable: they have a prefix that can be separated from the base. When the verb is used with a modal, it regains the prefix at the end of the sentence. When it is the main verb of the sentence, the prefix is moved to the end of the sentence.

An &quot;example&quot; in English would be the word &quot;intake&quot;. When it is used as a verb, it becomes &quot;take ... in&quot;. When it is used as an adjective or a noun, it becomes &quot;intake&quot; again.

Two easy examples of separable verbs are ''aussehen'' and ''mitkommen''. Note that aussehen is also irregular.

&lt;big&gt;'''aussehen - to appear'''&lt;/big&gt;

The story about Zurich, Switzerland is modified from the entry at Zürich in the German Wikipedia - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:23, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Might it not be too soon in the lessons to be conjugating a verb? I'm thinking we should introduce indirect articles, pronouns before much can be said about verbs.  Maybe we should make a series of &quot;blank&quot; lesson pages and lay out on each one our ideas of grammar lessons to be taught. We can move the ideas around until it makes some sense, and (at the same time) work on whatever parts we have an interest in. If the &quot;idea&quot; gets moved, the worked on grammar lesson can be moved with it.  The alternative is to develop grammar lessons, then rename the pages after an outline on order is established? What say you all? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:20, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Sure. I was just copying the structure of the French Wikibook, they begin conjugating early. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 05:45, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Oh, BTW, could you check out [[Talk:German:_Lesson_2]]? There seems to by some problem with the conjugation of ''spielen''. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 06:11, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::If you can believe it, I found my old beginning German textbook from highschool.  I'm using that (very roughly) to gage progress through the lessons.  Keep adding stuff in. If I think it looks too advanced, I can always move it a few lessons further on. So no problem, really. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:04, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Actually I responded to that one earlier (see [[Talk:German: Lesson 2]]). Not a problem, just a matter of preference. I think either way is &quot;correct&quot; but I think leaving the &quot;to&quot; off the English verbs makes the presentation easier for the student by better matching the German-English. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]
----
   Du  bist  You  are  
   Ihr  seid  You (formal)  are  
   Sie  sind  They  are''

I beg to differ with the above translations. I was under the impression that &quot;du&quot; and &quot;ihr&quot; are the singular and plural familiar you, while &quot;sie&quot; is both &quot;she&quot; and &quot;they,&quot; and finally, &quot;Sie&quot; (capitalized) is the singular and plural formal you. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 19:07, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I think you have that right Lord Emsworth. As soon as we can establish where it is good to start conjugating verbs, we can get it in correctly (or we can cjhange it now and maybe move it later) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:00, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hi, I've edited some typos in the Gespraech 4-1. Just for the record I'd like to say that German universities are generally not expensive at all (I payed a
little less than $200 per semester and half of it was for a ticket that gave me unlimited public transportation in my area). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Thanks! Keep editing those sentences.  I'm counting on you and the couple of other native speakers to make this thing look real. Does not expensive extend to medical school?  Should I have him going to school somewhere other than Germany?  I was working towards a conversation involving him selling some furniture. Of course, he could have another reason for doing so. Would the idea of a poor graduate student not be typical in Germany as it would in the US? -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:50, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::The idea of a poor graduate student is quite OK, and I guess there are some specific medical schools that are expensive. So we can leave the version as it is (btw. I really like the idea that you are building up plots that go together in a nice story) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

The phrase &quot;Ich habe sie gern!&quot; in the first dialogue is used to refer to a person rather than to an object. &quot;Ich mag sie.&quot; (sie referring to &quot;die Wohnung&quot;) would be more appropriate in this context, but still sounds kinda strange. The first one, &quot;Mir gefällt deine Wohnung.&quot; is the best version, and basically has the same meaning as &quot;Ich habe sie gern!&quot; (&quot;I like it!&quot;, basically)

Also corrected some typos and word order problems (&quot;sieht&quot; not &quot;seht&quot; and &quot;sich umsehen&quot; not &quot;umsehen sich&quot;).

Second dialogue: &quot;Ich glaube, dass sie 'Karoline' heißt.&quot; would sound more natural if phrased &quot;Ich glaube, sie heißt 'Karoline'.&quot;
Oh, and is brunette really black where you come from? It's rather brown around here... [[User:MartinR|Martin]]

I think some sentences aren’t a good German:
* &quot;Ein Bruder besucht&quot; is wrong German. Better: &quot;Markus bekommt Besuch von seinem Bruder&quot; 
:Similar improvement made (now Lesson 6) - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
* I don’t understand the phrase &quot;Mutti sagt Hallo&quot;. Does Karl say that? (Lesson 6)
:It follows &quot;Karl:&quot;  Should say &quot;Mother says hello&quot;; they are brothers and Karl lives with his parents. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
* &quot;Ich glaube, dass sie 'Karoline' heißt.&quot; is correct German. But I think it’s better to say &quot;Ich glaube, sie heißt Karoline&quot;.
:Changed - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
-- [[User:Daniel B|Daniel]] 19:11, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Edit: To call someone &quot;ein Schwein&quot; in German is quite offending even for good friends. Better say: &quot;Du bist ein Ferkel!&quot; (i.e. &quot;Du bist ein Schwein!&quot; means &quot;You are a hog!&quot;) das Ferkel = piglet or in that case substitute and &quot;polite form&quot; for the word pig.
:Good point. &quot;Mark, you are a pig!&quot; is a perfectly appropriate response in English, but too harsh (insulting) in German - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

''die Wörter'' is the plural of ''das Wort''. What about adding (n.) or (n) for neutrum (or neuter ?)?  The nominative plural always is with ''die''.
:Better to just put in both sing. and pl. rather than leave gender &quot;unannounced&quot;. I will fix - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

''zu viel'' is the new spelling after the ''Rechtschreibreform''.--[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 10:08, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Thanks. I do trust you to know about these things. My dictionary is 1958, so could well be dated -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:52, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Additionally: Not only Poetically, die Worte is also used instead of die Wörter. Wörter is used, e. g. in ''Wie viele Wörter beinhaltet das Wörterbuch'' (How many words does the dictionary include)? But: ''Achte auf deine Worte!'' (Take care about what you say). --[[User:Jayk|Jayk]] ([[User talk:Jayk|talk]]) 14:11, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

== Just some remarks on this lesson from an Austrian ==

conversation:
* I don't know this, but it seems unlikely that there is a Hotel &quot;St.Pölten&quot; in St. Pölten. Almost everywhere in Austria, a safe bet for a Hotel's or inn's name is &quot;Zur Post&quot;.
* instead of &quot;dort drinnen&quot; I would use &quot;darin&quot;.
* A restaurant wouldn't be called &quot;Das Wien&quot;, since Wien doesn't have an article. So the lady should say &quot;Es heißt 'Wien'.&quot; Again, this is an unlikely name for a restaurant in St.Pölten. Maybe &quot;Alt-Wien&quot; or something like that.
* &quot;Guten Tag&quot; even as a greeting is rather unusual in Austria (&quot;Grüß Gott&quot; is standard). It is virtually non-existent as a parting and feels very much out of place to me. It's very unlikely that she should say that. She should say &quot;(Auf) Wiedersehn&quot;.

list of vocabulary:
Österreich and Niederösterreich don't have articles (but they have neutral gender).
&quot;gutbürgerliche Küche&quot; is not really plain food, but rather good and traditional food.

:Sehr gut! I'll make the changes as you suggest.  As for the names of places, they are of course not meant to be real locations, but your suggestions seem helpful in adding to the authenticity of the lesson. I suppose I might need to find a way to indicate gender of nouns that normally do not take an article; perhaps &quot;(das) Österreich&quot; or &quot;[das] Österreich&quot; ?

This is a list of all the fruits generally considered edible by various cultures and used for culinary purposes. Some are not widely used and would be hard to get a hold of, but they offer interesting alternatives to the common or garden varieties.

Note that this is a list of &quot;fruits&quot; in the culinary sense of the word, not the botanical sense of the word. Consequently, items that are botanically classified as fruits, but are usually referred to in cooking as &quot;vegetables&quot; (such as the [[cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]) will be in the [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetables]] section, and not here. For a discussion of the '''botanical''' vs. '''culinary''' definitions of that part of a plant called the &quot;fruit&quot; see '''[[Wikipedia:en:Fruit|Fruit]]''' at ''Wikipedia''.

There exist also many fruits that are certainly edible and locally popular but for various reasons have not become widespread in their use.  Often this is due to marketing considerations, more than anything. 

== Temperate fruits ==
Fruits of temperate climates are almost universally borne on trees or woody shrubs or lianas. They will not grow adequately in the tropics, as they need a period of cold (a '''chilling requirement''') each year before they will flower. The [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]], [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], and [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]] are the most widely grown and eaten, owing to their adaptability. Many other fruits are important regionally but do not figure prominently in commerce. Many sorts of small fruit on this list are gathered from the wild, just as they were in Neolithic times.

The [[Wikipedia:en:Rosaceae|Family Rosaceae]] dominates the temperate fruits, both in numbers and in importance. The pome fruits, stone fruits, brambles, and strawberry are all members of Rosaceae.

The '''[[wikipedia:pome|pome]]''' fruits:

[[Image:Fuji apple.jpg|thumb|right|Fuji apples]]

* [[Cookbook:Apple|Apple]] and crabapple (''Malus'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Chokeberry|Chokeberry]] also called cooking apple (''Aronia'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Haw|Haw]], the fruit of the hawthorn (''Crataegus'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Juneberry|Juneberry]] or saskatoon (''Amelanchier'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Medlar|Medlar]] (''Mespilus germanica'')
* [[Cookbook:Pear|Pear]], European and Asian species (''Pyrus'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Quince|Quince]] (''Cydonia oblonga'' and ''Chaenomeles'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Rowan|Rowan]] or mountain ash (''Sorbus aucuparia'')
* [[Cookbook:Sorb|Sorb]] or sorb apple, the fruit of the service tree (''Sorbus domestica'')
* [[Cookbook:Asian Pear|Asian pear]]

The '''stone fruits''', drupes of the Genus ''[[Prunus]]'':

[[Image:W outou4051.jpg|thumb|right|Cherries]]

* [[Cookbook:Apricot|Apricot]]
* [[Cookbook:Cherry|Cherry]], sweet, sour, and wild species (''Prunus avium'', ''P. cerasus'', and others)
* [[Cookbook:Plum|Plum]], of which there are several domestic and wild species; dried plums are called '''prunes'''
* [[Cookbook:Peach|Peach]] and its variant the [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]] (''Prunus persica'')
* Hybrids of the preceding species, such as the [[Cookbook:Pluot|pluot]]

In non-technical usage, '''berry''' means any small fruit that can be eaten whole and lacks objectionable seeds. The '''bramble fruits''', compound fruits of the Genus ''Rubus'', are some of the most popular pseudo-berries:

* [[Cookbook:Blackberry|Blackberry]], of which there are many species and hybrids, such as dewberry, [[Cookbook:Boysenberry|boysenberry]], and [[Cookbook:Loganberry|loganberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Tayberry|Tayberry]], a cross between Raspberry and Blackberries
* [[Cookbook:Raspberry|Raspberry]], several species (genus ''Rubus'')
* [[Cookbook:Cloudberry|Cloudberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Wineberry|Wineberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Goji berry|Goji berry]]

The true berries are dominated by the [[Wikipedia:en:Ericaceae|Family Ericaceae]], many of which are hardy in the subarctic:

* [[Cookbook:Bearberry|Bearberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Bilberry|Bilberry]] or whortleberry or Blueberry (UK)
* [[Cookbook:Blueberry|Blueberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Cranberry|Cranberry]] (''Vaccinium'')
* [[Cookbook:Crowberry|Crowberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Huckleberry|Huckleberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Lingonberry|Lingonberry]]

Other berries (not in Ericaceae):

[[Image:Johannisbeeren.jpg|right|thumb|Red currants]]

* [[Cookbook:Barberry|Barberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Currant|Currant]] (''Ribes'' spp.), red, black, and white types
* [[Cookbook:Elderberry|Elderberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Gooseberry|Gooseberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Nannyberry|Nannyberry]] or sheepberry (''Viburnum'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Seaberry|Seaberry]] or sea buckthorn
* [[Cookbook:Wolfberry|Wolfberry]] (''Lycium barbarum'', ''Lycium'' spp.)

Some fruits native to [[Wikipedia:en:Asia|Asia]] that were not common elsewhere until the 20th century:

* [[Cookbook:Cornelian Cherry|Cornelian cherry]]
* [[Cookbook:Goumi|Goumi]]
* [[Cookbook:Jujube|Jujube]]
* [[Cookbook:Kiwifruit|Kiwifruit]] (a.k.a. the &quot;kiwi&quot; or Chinese gooseberry, ''Actinidia'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Loquat|Loquat]]
* [[Cookbook:Mulberry|Mulberry]] (some species)
* [[Cookbook:Persimmon|Persimmon]], ''Diospyros kaki''

Some tree fruits native to [[Wikipedia:en:North America|North America]] that are eaten in a small way:

* [[Cookbook:Buffaloberry|Buffaloberry]] (''Shepherdia argenta''), which grows wild in the prairies of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]]
* [[Cookbook:Chokeberry|Chokeberry]] (''Aronia'' spp.)
* American [[Cookbook:Grape|grape]]: North American species (e.g., ''Vitis labrusca'') and American-European hybrids are grown where ''Vitis vinifera'' is not hardy and are used as [[wikipedia:rootstock|rootstock]]s
* [[Cookbook:Juneberry|Juneberry]] or saskatoon, which is cultivated in Canada (''Amelanchier'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|Pawpaw]] (''Asimina triloba'', not to be confused with ''Carica papaya'', which is called pawpaw in some English dialects)
* American [[Cookbook:Persimmon|persimmon]] (''Diospyros virginiana'')

Several [[Wikipedia:en:cactus|cacti]] yield edible fruits, which are important traditional foods for some Native American peoples:

* [[Cookbook:Prickly Pear|Prickly pear]]
* [[Cookbook:Saguaro|Saguaro]]

Some exceptions to the statement that temperate fruits grow on woody perennials are:

[[Image:Watermelon seedless.jpg|right|thumb|Watermelon]]

* [[Cookbook:Melon|Melon]] (''Cucumis melo''): cantaloupe and other [[Cookbook:Musk Melon|muskmelons]], [[Cookbook:Honeydew Melon|honeydew]]
* [[Cookbook:Sunberry|Sunberry]] or wonderberry (''Solanum'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Watermelon|Watermelon]] (''Citrullus vulgaris'')

The false fruits are not botanically fruits at all but are used as fruits in the kitchen:

[[Image:Truskawki.jpg|right|thumb|Strawberries]]

* [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|Rhubarb]]
* [[Cookbook:Strawberry|Strawberry]] (''Frigaria spp.'')

== Mediterranean and subtropical fruits ==
Fruits in this category are not hardy to extreme cold, as the preceding temperate fruits are, yet tolerate some frost and may have a modest chilling requirement. Notable among these are natives of the [[Wikipedia:en:Mediterranean|Mediterranean]]:

* [[Cookbook:Fig|Fig]] (''Ficus spp.'')
* [[Cookbook:Grape|Grape]], called [[Cookbook:raisin|raisin]], [[Cookbook:sultana|sultana]], or [[Cookbook:Currant|currant]] when dried (''Vitis'')
* [[Cookbook:Pomegranate|Pomegranate]]
* [[Cookbook:Date|Date]] (''Phoenix dactylifera'')
* [[Cookbook:Mulberry|Mulberry]]

In the important genus ''[[Cookbook:Citrus|Citrus]]'' some members are tropical, tolerating no frost. All common species of commerce are somewhat hardy:

[[Image:Mandarinen.jpg|thumb|right|Mandarins]]

* [[Cookbook:Citron|Citron]]
* [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|Grapefruit]] and its predecesor the [[Cookbook:pummelo|pummelo]] (also known as the shaddock)
* [[Cookbook:Kumquat|Kumquat]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Lime|Lime]] (an important hybrid of the [[Cookbook:Key Lime|Key Lime]] and the [[Cookbook:Citron|Citron]])
* [[Cookbook:Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Cookbook:clementine|clementine]], [[Cookbook:tangelo|tangelo]], [[Cookbook:Tangerine|tangerine]], and similar
* [[Cookbook:Orange|Orange]], of which there are sweet and sour species
* [[Cookbook:Ugli Fruit|Ugli fruit]], a hybrid

Other subtropical fruits:

* [[Cookbook:Feijoa|Feijoa]] (''Feijoa sellowiana'' or ''Acca sellowiana'')

[[image:Pumpkins.jpg|right|251px|thumb|Pumpkins]]

A '''Pumpkin''' is a large, orange, spherical squash. In the USA, pumpkins are traditionally associated with Halloween and Thanksgiving and made into pumpkin pie. In other parts of the world, such as Australia, they are eaten year-round, usually as a savoury dish. It is similar in taste to [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]].

There are many different varieties of pumpkin, and they have slightly different flavours, but the major differences are in the skin colour and the thickness of their rind. Some varieties have a very thin rind which is easy to cut and actually becomes edible when you cook the pumpkin, but as a whole the rind is discarded. Most varieties of pumpkin are at least technically edible. 

As a rule of thumb, the larger the pumpkin, the tougher the skin and the woodier and more tasteless the flesh. The large orange pumpkins sold for carving in the United States at Halloween are still edible, but they are not as good as pumpkins specifically grown for eating. This is less important if you are making pie, but is something to keep in mind when cooking pumpkins to eat directly.

==Preparing a Halloween Pumpkin for Eating==

When preparing pumpkin to eat, ensure that you've thoroughly washed the outside with warm water and soap or detergent. This is especially important for pumpkins bought in a 'pumpkin patch', since they may not have been washed before.  Although typical large carving pumpkins can taste awful, they are edible. It is always best to use &quot;cooking pumpkins&quot; when selecting a pumpkin which you intend to eat.  If you are carving it for Halloween before eating, wash it before you cut into it and rinse it again after displaying. 

This will cut down the amount of bacteria and fertilizer on the peel. Also make sure to cut off any pieces with wax or soot from candles on it. If your pumpkin has dirt on it, it may be worth it to rinse it off outside with a garden hose before washing it in your sink, to avoid making your sink dirty.

If you have a carved pumpkin which you are intending to eat, it would be best to avoid leaving it out for more than 2 days. If possible, carve it on Halloween and bring it in that night. Leave it in a cool, dark place until you cook it. At worst, you would end up with a moldy, rotten pumpkin. If you are lucky, then your pumpkin may just dry out a bit, and you end up with some pieces which are chewy. Either way, best to take down your pumpkin early, or you will have fruit flies!

==Cooking Pumpkin==
An interesting fact is that most canned 'pumpkin' is actually hubbard squash. Hubbard squash has the characteristic rich orange flesh and bold flavor that users of canned pumpkin will be familiar with. If you are trying to make home made pumpkin pie, you may have found that the taste of 'sweet pumpkins' is not as rich as what is normally found in canned pumpkin. For better results try using hubbard squash.

Pumpkin by itself is excellent. To cook pumpkin, slice into chunks no larger than 3&quot;x3&quot;, and all chunks must be about the same size. Leave the peel on. Steam in the microwave or on the stove until all pieces are soft and mushy. Then, you can serve directly at the dinner table with butter, leaving it to diners to remove the peel. Alternatively, you could let it cool, peel in the kitchen, mash it up with butter to taste, then heat and serve.

If you have a small pumpkin, you can roast it whole - just slice the top off first so that the steam can escape, and roast for about an hour. When it is done you can scoop out the seeds and discard, and if you remove some or most of the flesh you can use it as an unusual serving bowl to hold other food.

For a 'poor man's pumpkin pie', after peeling and mashing, instead of butter, mix with sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon to taste. Serve hot, cold, or at room temperature.

For diners on controlled diets, the sugar and butter can be omitted, and still have a tasty side dish or dessert. Without the butter, pumpkin is a very low-fat food, and is also very high in certain vitamins.

=Force=

A net '''force''' on a body causes a body to accelerate.  The amount of that acceleration depends on the body's '''inertia''' (or its tendency to resist changes in motion), which is measured as its '''mass'''.  When Isaac Newton formulated Newtonian mechanics, he discovered three fundamental laws of motion. 

Later, Albert Einstein proved that these laws are just a convenient  approximation. These laws, however, greatly simplify calculations and are used when studying objects at velocities that are small compared with the speed of light.

==Friction==
'''It is the force that opposes relative motion or tendency of relative motion between two surfaces in contact''' represented by f.
When two surfaces move relative to each other or they have a tendency to move relative to each other, at the point (or surface) of contact, there appears a force which opposes this relative motion or tendency of relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It acts on both the surfaces in contact with equal magnitude and opposite directions (Newton's 3rd law). Friction force tries to stop relative motion between two surfaces in contact, if it is there, and when two surfaces in contact are at rest relative to each other, the friction force tries to maintain this relative rest. Friction force can assume the magnitude (below a certain maximum magnitude called limiting static friction) required to maintain relative rest between two surfaces in contact. Because of this friction force is called a self adjusting force.
 
Earlier, it was believed that friction was caused due to the roughness of the two surfaces in contact with each other. However, modern theory stipulates that the cause of friction is the Coulombic force between the atoms present in the surface of the regions in contact with each other.

Formula: Limiting Friction = (Friction Coefficient)(Normal reaction)

Static Friction = the friction force that keeps an object at relative rest.

Kinetic Friction = sliding friction

==Newton's First Law of Motion==
(The Law of Inertia)

'''A static object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or if in movement it will maintain a constant velocity'''

This means, essentially, that acceleration does not occur without the presence of a force. The object tends to maintain its state of motion. If it is at rest, it remains at rest and if it is moving with a velocity then it keeps moving with the same velocity. This tendency of the object to maintain its state of motion is greater for larger mass. The &quot;mass&quot; is, therefore, a measure of the inertia of the object.

In a state of equilibrium, where the object is at rest or proceeding at a constant velocity, the net force in every direction must be equal to 0.

At a constant velocity (including zero velocity), the '''sum of forces''' is 0. If the sum of forces does not equal zero, the object will accelerate (change velocity over time).

It is important to note, that this law is applicable only in non-accelerated coordinate systems. It is so, because the perception of force in accelerated systems are different. A body under balanced force system in one frame of reference, for example a person standing in an accelerating lift, is acted upon by a net force in the earth's frame of reference.   

'''Inertia is the tendency of an object to maintain its velocity i.e. to resist acceleration.'''
*Inertia is not a force.
*Inertia varies directly with mass.

==Newton's Second Law of Motion==

*'''The time rate of change in momentum is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force.'''

*'''The acceleration of an object is proportional to the force acting upon it.''

These two statements mean the same thing, and is represented in the following basic form (the system of measurement is chosen such that constant of proportionality is 1) :

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(m\vec{v})&lt;/math&gt;}}

The product of mass and velocity i.e. ''m'''''v''' is called the momentum.  The net force on a particle is ,thus, equal to rate change of momentum of the particle with time. Generally mass of the object under consideration is constant and thus can be taken out of the derivative.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\vec{v})= m\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;}}


'''Force''' is equal to '''mass''' times '''acceleration'''.  This version of Newton's Second Law of Motion assumes that the mass of the body does not change with time, and as such, does not represent a general mathematical form of the Law.  Consequently, this equation cannot, for example, be applied to the motion of a rocket, which loses its mass (the lost mass is ejected at the rear of the rocket) with the passage of time.

An example:
If we want to find out the downward force of gravity on an object on Earth, we can use the following formula:
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\|\vec{F}\| = m\|\vec{g}\|&lt;/math&gt;}}

Hence, if we replace m with whatever mass is appropriate, and multiply it by 9.806 65 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it will give the force in newtons that the earth's gravity has on the object in question(in other words, the body's weight).

[[File:Example Newton's 2nd in 1D, Thrust and Drag.ogv|thumbtime=10:18|middle|720px|Example problem of Newton's 2nd law in one dimension.'']]

==Newton's Third Law of Motion==

'''Forces occur in pairs equal in magnitude and opposite in direction'''

This means that for every force applied on a body A by a body B, body B receives an equal force in the exact opposite direction.  This is because forces can only be applied by a body on another body.  It is important to note here that the pair of forces act on two different bodies, affecting their state of motion. This is to emphasize that pair of equal forces do not cancel out.

'''There are no spontaneous forces.'''

It is very important to note that the forces in a &quot;Newton 3 pair&quot;, described above, can never act on the same body. One acts on A, the other on B.  A common error is to imagine that the force of gravity on a stationary object and the &quot;contact force&quot; upwards of the table supporting the object are equal by Newton's third law.  This is not true. They may be equal - but because of the second law (their sum must be zero because the object is not accelerating), not because of the third.

The &quot;Newton 3 pair&quot; of the force of gravity (= earth's pull) on the object is the force of the object attracting the earth, pulling it upwards.  The &quot;Newton 3 pair&quot; of the table pushing it up is that it, in its turn, pushes the table down.

==Newtonian Gravity==
Newtonian Gravity (simplified gravitation) is an ''apparent'' [[../Force|force]] (a.k.a. ''pseudoforce'') that simulates the attraction of one mass to another mass. Unlike the three fundamental (real) forces of electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces, gravity is purely attractive. As a force it is measured in '''newtons'''. The distance between two objects is measured between their centers of mass.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Gravitational force''' is equal to the product of the '''universal gravitational constant''' and the masses of the two objects, divided by the square of the distance between their centers of mass.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; g = \frac{Gm_1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

The value of the '''gravitational [[../Fields|field]]''' which is equivalent to '''the acceleration due to gravity''' caused by an object at a point in space is equal to the first equation about gravitational force, with the effect of the second mass taken out.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{GMm}{r}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Gravitational potential energy of a body to infinity''' is equal to the '''universal gravitational constant''' times the mass of a body from which the gravitational field is being created times the mass of the body whose potential energy is being measured over '''the distance between the two centers of mass'''.  Therefore, the difference in potential energy between two points is the difference of the potential energy from the position of the center of mass to infinity at both points.  Near the earth's surface, this approximates:


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_g = mgh\ &lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Potential energy due to gravity near the earth's surface''' is equal to the product of mass, acceleration due to gravity, and height (elevation) of the object.

If '''the potential energy from the body's center of mass to infinity''' is known, however, it is possible to calculate the '''escape velocity''', or the velocity necessary to escape the gravitational field of an object.  This can be derived based on utilizing the '''law of conservation of energy''' and the equation to calculate '''kinetic energy''' as follows:


{{PSG/eq|
&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ke}_{initial} = \Delta U &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ke}_{initial} = {U}_{infinity} - {U}_{initial} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{v}_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

A black hole is a geometrically defined region of space time exhibiting such large centripetal gravitational effects that nothing such as particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light may escape from inside of it. That is the escape velocity upon the event horizon is equivalent to the speed of light. General relativity is a metric theory of gravitation generalizing space time and Newton's law of universal gravitational attraction as a geometric property of space time.

=Work =

'''Work''' is equal to the scalar product of '''force''' and '''displacement'''.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}&lt;/math&gt;}}
The scalar product of two vectors is defined as the product of their lengths with the cosine of the angle between them.
'''Work''' is equal to '''force''' times '''displacement''' times the cosine of the ''' angle ''' between the directions of force and displacement.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W =\|\vec{F}\|\ \|\vec{d}\|\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Work''' is equal to change in ''' kinetic energy ''' plus change in ''' potential energy ''' for example the potential energy due to gravity. &lt;!-- We'd better introduce energy somehow first. --&gt; 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta\mathrm{KE}+ \Delta\mathrm{PE}_g\ &lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Work''' is equal to average ''' power ''' times ''' time. '''
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W = Pt\ &lt;/math&gt;}}
The '''Work''' done by a force taking something from point 1 to point 2 is
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W_{1,2}=\int_{\vec{x}_1}^{\vec{x}_2}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{l}&lt;/math&gt;}}


Work is in fact just a transfer of energy. When we 'do work' on an object, we transfer some of our energy to it. This means that the work done on an object is its increase in energy. Actually, the kinetic energy and potential energy is measured by calculating the amount of work done on an object. The gravitational potential energy (there are many types of potential energies) is measured as 'mgh'. mg is the weight/force and h is the distance. The product is nothing but the work done. Even kinetic energy is a simple deduction from the laws of linear motion. Try substituing for v^2 in the formula for kinetic energy.

When work is applied to an object or a system it adds or removes '''kinetic energy''' to or from that object or system. More precisely, a net force in one direction, when applied to an object moving opposite or in the same direction as the force, kinetic energy will be added or removed to or from that object. Note that work and energy are measured in the same unit, the joule (J).

'''Whole spices compared to ground spices'''

Most spices and herbs are available in either a finely ground form for cooking or in the raw form as a seed, nut, leaf, or tuber.  Most of the time, the ground form is required to properly flavor the dish.  Generally, whole spices keep their flavor longer than the ground spices. [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]] often use whole spices that they roast freshly before grinding for use, maximising the flavors and aromas released into the food.

Bay leaves are generally used in stews and soups and are almost always used whole.

'''Green spices compared to dried spices'''

Often, a recipe will require modifications if the fresh version is used because the flavors do change in the drying process. Fresh herbs are nearly always better than dried herbs, as some subtle aromatics are lost during drying. When substituted in recipes, one part dried herbs are approximately equal to 3 parts fresh herbs. For example, 1/3 tablespoon of dried basil is equal to about one tablespoon of chopped fresh basil.

== Differences ==

The difference between herbs and spices is that, if a leaf of a plant can be used to add flavor or aroma to dishes, then it is an herb. If it is another part, like the seed, fruit, berry, and bark, then it is a spice.

==Indian Spices==
{{cookwork|Move section to a separate page, expand and rewrite for factual correctness}}

The term &quot;curry powder&quot; is the English equivalent of the South Asian spice mixtures known as [[Cookbook:Garam masala|garam masala]].  However in South Asian cuisine these are far more varied in their content than the generic curry powders found in Western supermarkets and grocers. The primary spices used in Indian cooking are:

* [[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]] seeds, either ground or whole.  They are put in the oil before cooking.
* Ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] seeds.
* [[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]] seeds, roasted in the oil before cooking
* [[Cookbook:Carom|Carom]] seeds, roasted in the oil before cooking
* [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry leaves]], used in South Indian cooking (very different from curry powder, see [[w:Curry Tree|Curry Tree]])
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]], aromatic, pungent and spicy, adds a special flavor and zest to Asian stir fries and many fruit and vegetable dishes.
* [[Cookbook:Cayenne pepper|Hot red pepper]], used to achieve hot flavor of Mexican, Creole, Cajun, Thai, and Indian cooking. Red pepper is a pungent, hot powder with a strong bite. It is advisable to use only small amounts of Red pepper as it intensifies as it is cooked.
* [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|Garam masala]], which depending on the recipe is either put in early or late in the cooking process, is a blend of roasted aromatic spices.
* [[Cookbook:Mustard Seed|Mustard seeds]], which are put in the oil before cooking until they pop and release their flavour.
* [[Cookbook:Nigella|Nigella]] (Kalonji) are small black seeds used to give naan bread its distinctive flavour.
* [[Cookbook:Panch Puran|Panch Puran]], a spice blend.
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]] powder, which colors the dish.

Overall, the flavour of Indian cooking is made from a combination of these different spices, often with some of them roasted in oil at the beginning of cooking to release aromatic flavours.  Whether spices are added early or late in the cooking process and cooked in oil or dry roasted can greatly affect the flavour of the resulting dish. Different recipes from the various parts of India and surrounding countries use different combinations.

=Energy=

Kinetic energy is simply the capacity to do work by virtue of motion.

'''(Translational) kinetic energy''' is equal to one-half of '''mass''' times the square of '''velocity'''. 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{KE}_T=\frac{1}{2}m\|\vec{v}\|^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''(Rotational) kinetic energy''' is equal to one-half of '''moment of inertia''' times the square of '''angular velocity'''.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{KE}_R=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Total kinetic energy''' is simply the sum of the translational and rotational kinetic energies.  In most cases, these energies are separately dealt with.  It is easy to remember the rotational kinetic energy if you think of the moment of inertia I as the ''rotational mass''.  However, you should note that this substitution is not universal but rather a rule of thumb.

Potential energy is simply the capacity to do work by virtue of position (or arrangement) relative to some zero-energy reference position (or arrangement).

'''Potential energy''' due to gravity is equal to the product of '''mass''', '''acceleration''' due to gravity, and '''height (elevation)''' of the object. 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PE}_g= -m\vec{g}\cdot\vec{x}=mgy&lt;/math&gt;}}
Note that this is simply the vertical displacement multiplied by the weight of the object.  The reference position is usually the level ground but the initial position like the rooftop or treetop can also be used.
'''Potential energy''' due to spring deformation is equal to one-half the product of the '''spring constant''' times the square of the '''change in length''' of the spring.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PE}_e=\frac{1}{2}k\|\vec{x}-\vec{x}_e\|^2=\frac{1}{2}k\|\Delta\vec{x}\|^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
The reference point of spring deformation is normally when the spring is &quot;relaxed,&quot; i.e. the net force exerted by the spring is zero. It will be easy to remember that the one-half factor is inserted to compensate for finite '&quot;change in length&quot; since one would want to think of the product of force and change in length &lt;math&gt;(k\Delta\vec{x})\cdot\Delta\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; directly.  Since the force actually varies with &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;, it is instructive to need a &quot;correction factor&quot; during integration.

'''Energy:''' a theoretically indefinable quantity that describes potential to do work. SI unit for energy is the joule (J). Also common is the calorie (cal). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''The joule:''' defined as the energy needed to push with the force of one newton over the distance of one meter. Equivalent to one newton-meter (N&amp;middot;m) or one watt-second (W&amp;middot;s).&lt;br&gt;
:'''1 joule = 1 J = 1 newton • 1 meter = 1 watt • 1 second'''&lt;br&gt;
Energy comes in many varieties, including Kinetic energy, Potential energy, and Heat energy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Kinetic energy (K):''' The energy that an object has due to its motion. Half of velocity squared times mass. Units: joules (J)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Potential energy due to gravity (U&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;):''' The energy that an object has stored in it by elevation from a mass, such as raised above the surface of the earth. This energy is released when the object becomes free to move. Mass times height time acceleration due to gravity. Units: joules (J) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Potential energy due to spring compression (U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;):''' Energy stored in spring when it is compressed. Units: joules (J)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Heat energy (Q):''' Units: joules (J)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Spring compression (D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;):''' The difference in length between the spring at rest and the spring when stretched or compressed. Units: meters (m)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Spring constant (k):''' a constant specific to each spring, which describes its “springiness”, or how much work is needed to compress the spring. Units: newtons per meter (N/m) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Change in spring length (&amp;Delta;x):''' The distance between the at-rest length of the spring minus the compressed or extended length of the spring. Units: meters (m)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Moment of inertia (I):''' Describes mass and its distribution. (kg•m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Angular momentum (&amp;omega;):''' Angular velocity times mass (inertia). (rad/s)

=Momentum= 

==Linear momentum==
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Momentum''' is equal to '''mass''' times '''velocity'''.

==Angular momentum==


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{L} = \vec{r}\times\vec{p} = m\vec{r}\times\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Angular momentum''' of an object revolving around an external axis '''O''' is equal to the cross-product of the '''position vector''' with respect to '''O''' and its '''linear momentum'''.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Angular momentum''' of a rotating object is equal to the '''moment of inertia''' times '''angular velocity'''.

==Force and linear momentum, torque and angular momentum==

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

is equal to the '''change in linear momentum''' over the '''change in time'''.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \frac{\Delta\vec{L}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Net torque''' is equal to the '''change in angular momentum''' over the '''change in time'''.

==Conservation of momentum==


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_i = \mathbf{p}_f&lt;/math&gt;}}


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{L}_i = \vec{L}_f&lt;/math&gt;}}

Let us prove this law. 

We'll take two particles, say, ''a'' and ''b''. Their momentums are &lt;math&gt;\vec p_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec p_b&lt;/math&gt;.They are moving opposite to each other along the x-axis and they collide.
Now force is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
According to Newton's third law,the forces on each particle are equal and opposite.So,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}_a}{\mathrm{d}t} =- \frac{\mathrm{d} \vec{p}_b}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d (\vec{p}_a + \vec{p}_b)}{\mathrm{d}t} =0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the sum of the momentums does not change with time. Therefore, the law is proved.

&lt;H2&gt;Variables&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Grammatik 4-4 ~ Personal Pronouns: Accusative Case ==
Here are the personal pronouns in the '''accusative''' case: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Singular&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Plural&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1st person || &amp;nbsp;'''mich'''&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''uns''' || &amp;nbsp;us
|-
| 2nd person&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''dich''' ('''Sie'''*)
| &amp;nbsp;you
| &amp;nbsp;'''euch''' ('''Sie'''*) || &amp;nbsp;you
|-
| 3rd person
| &amp;nbsp;'''ihn, sie, es&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''
| &amp;nbsp;him, her, it&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''sie''' &lt;small&gt;(all genders)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|} *&lt;small&gt;'''Polite''' form.&lt;/small&gt; 

The accusative case is that of the object of a verb. Only transitive verbs take direct objects. The pronoun (and noun in two cases) '''object''' in each of these sentences is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; in the German and the English:
 ''Können Sie &lt;u&gt;mich&lt;/u&gt; verstehen?''       Can you understand &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt;?
 ''Ich kann &lt;u&gt;Sie&lt;/u&gt; verstehen.''          I can understand &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;. 
 ''Ich kann &lt;u&gt;sie&lt;/u&gt; verstehen''           I can understand (&lt;u&gt;her&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;them&lt;/u&gt;).
 ''Ich kann &lt;u&gt;ihn&lt;/u&gt; dir zurück kicken!''  I can kick &lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt; back to you!
Note the order of the pronouns in this last sentence. If the direct object (here: ''ihn'') is a personal pronoun, it precedes the dative (''dir''); if it were a noun, the dative would precede it, as in these sentences:
 ''Hier, ich kicke dir &lt;u&gt;den Ball&lt;/u&gt; zu.''       Here, I kick &lt;u&gt;the ball&lt;/u&gt; to you. 
 ''Darf ich Ihnen &lt;u&gt;meine Freundin&lt;/u&gt; vorstellen?''   May I introduce &lt;u&gt;my friend&lt;/u&gt; to you? 

Other uses of the accusative case in German will be explored in future lessons. Tables of the personal pronouns in all cases are summarized in [[German/Appendix 3|Pronoun Tables]].

== Grammatik 4-5 ~ Personal Pronouns in the Dative Case ==
Here are the personal pronouns in the '''dative''' case: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Singular&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Plural&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1st person || &amp;nbsp;'''mir'''&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''uns''' || &amp;nbsp;us
|-
| 2nd person&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''dir''' ('''Ihnen'''*)
| &amp;nbsp;you
| &amp;nbsp;'''euch''' ('''Ihnen'''*) || &amp;nbsp;you
|-
| 3rd person || &amp;nbsp;'''ihm, ihr, ihm'''
| &amp;nbsp;him, her, it&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''ihnen''' &lt;small&gt;(all genders)&lt;/small&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}*&lt;small&gt;'''Polite''' form.&lt;/small&gt;

The dative case is that of the indirect object of a verb. The pronoun '''indirect object''' of these sentences is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; in the German and the English:
 ''Es geht &lt;u&gt;mir&lt;/u&gt; gut''              It goes (for) &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt; well 
 ''Wie geht es &lt;u&gt;dir&lt;/u&gt;?''             How goes it (for or with) &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;
 ''Und können Sie &lt;u&gt;mir&lt;/u&gt; sagen...?''     And can you tell &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt;...?
 ''Karl gibt &lt;u&gt;ihm&lt;/u&gt; den Ball''       Karl gave &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; the ball.
 ''Wie geht es &lt;u&gt;Ihnen&lt;/u&gt;?''           How goes it (with) &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;? (How are you?)             
This last sentence is an example from Gespräch 1-2 using the polite form of 'you'. Whether singular or plural must be established by context. This next sentence translates with ''ihnen'' as 'them':
 ''Wie geht es &lt;u&gt;ihnen&lt;/u&gt;?''           How goes it with &lt;u&gt;them&lt;/u&gt;? (How are they?)
The meaning of ''ihnen'' (or ''Ihnen'') would have to come from context in a conversation.

Another use of the dative case in German is after these prepositions: '''''aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu'''''. You will be introduced to the meanings of these prepositions over many future lessons rather than all at once, because some have many meanings in English. Indeed, because each language associates specific prepositions with many common sayings (and these often do not correspond in German and English), these &quot;little&quot; words can be troublesome for students. Nonetheless, you should memorize now the list of prepositions above to always remember their association with the dative case. Tables of the pronouns in all cases are summarized in [[German/Appendices/Phrasebook|Appendix 2]].

Word order in a German sentence with an indirect object depends upon whether that direct object is a pronoun or a noun. If the &lt;u&gt;direct object is a noun, the dative precedes the accusative&lt;/u&gt;; if the &lt;u&gt;direct object is a personal pronoun, the accusative precedes the dative&lt;/u&gt;:
{|
|''Ich gebe dem Jungen den Ball.''
|I give the boy the ball.
|-                      
|''Ich gebe ihm den Ball.''
|I give him the ball.
|-
|''Ich gebe ihn ihm.''
|I give it to him.
|-
|''Ich gebe ihn dem Jungen.''
|I give it to the boy. 
|}

This problem can be analyzed using [[Discrete Mathematics/Graph theory|graph theory]]. 

The problem is essentially showing that the bipartite graph K&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; is planar. However, ''Kuratowski&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s theorem'' tells us that this graph must ''not'' be planar.

Essentially, there is no solution and the required construction ''cannot'' be done! Sorry! :)

:That's right. However, if you ''absolutely'' want to find a solution you have to let the buildings be on a more complicated topology (with a plane, or even the surface of a ball it won't work). The problem is solvable if the buildings are located on a ''donut''-shaped &quot;planet&quot;. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

The solution with the donut (or more mathematically: ''torus'') is quite hard to draw on a 2D screen I think :) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Does G connect to C, and E to A, without crossing, in that? [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 23:58, 21 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Yes, it loops around the torus from the lower left to the upper right, same for the lower right to the upper left ([[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]], not logged in)

:I made it a bit clearer that the G-C and E-A connections have to go around the whole torus (I assume this perspective is a frontal view on the torus). Also the connections G-C and E-A have to &quot;cross without actually crossing&quot; which can be done if one path does a turn around the torus tube. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

== Grammar - Past Participle (el participio)==

Spanish uses the past participle primarily for present perfect, past perfect,
and other similar times. For '''-ar''' verbs form the past participle
by adding '''-ado''' to the stem. For '''-er''' and '''-ir''' verbs add
'''-ido''':


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Verb  
! Past Participle  
|-
| hablar || hablado                     
|-
| comer || comido                      
|-
| vivir || vivido                      
|}

If the stem of an '''-er''' or '''-ir''' verb ends in one of the vowels '''-a''',
'''-e''', or '''-o''', the '''i''' of '''-ido''' gets an accent mark:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Verb  
! Past Participle  
|-
| caer || caído                           
|-
| creer || creído                           
|-
| leer || leído                       
|-
| oir || oído                        
|-
| reir || reído                       
|}

There are a few verbs with an irregular past participle:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Verb  
! Past Participle  
|-
| abrir || abierto                     
|-
| cubrir || cubierto                    
|-
| descubrir || descubierto                 
|-
| decir || dicho                       
|-
| escribir || escrito                     
|-
| freír || frito                       
|-
| hacer || hecho                       
|-
| ir || ido                         
|-
| morir || muerto                      
|-
| poner || puesto                      
|-
| romper || roto                        
|-
| satisfacer || satisfecho                  
|-
| ver || visto                       
|-
| volver || vuelto                      
|}


As in English, the past participle can also be used as an adjective for a noun. In
that case the ending has to match gender and number of the noun. Example:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Su barba está '''afeitada'''.                      
|
''His beard is shaved.''
|}


Finally, there are a few verbs with ''both'' a regular and an irregular past participle. In this case, the irregular past participle is used as an adjective, while the regular form is used for the verb tenses.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
! Verb  
! Past Participle  
|-
| imprimir  
| imprimido / impreso  
|-
| ocultar  
| ocultado / oculto  
|}


----

== Grammar - Present Perfect (el pretérito perfecto) ==

The Spanish present perfect is formed by conjugating the auxiliary verb '''haber'''
(= ''to have'') and adding the past participle of the verb.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
!  
! Present Perfect
! ''English''  
|-
| yo || he comido       || ''I have eaten''       
|-
| tú || has comido      || ''you have eaten ''    
|-
| Ud./él/ella || ha comido       || ''you/he/she has eaten''
|-
| nosotros(as) || hemos comido    || ''we have eaten''      
|-
| vosotros(as) || habéis comido   || ''you have eaten''     
|-
| Uds./ellos(as) || han comido     || ''you/they have eaten'' 
|}

Here are a few examples of the Spanish Present perfect. Note that in Spanish
the auxiliary verb '''haber''' and the past participle are never separated:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Carlos y yo '''hemos jugado''' fútbol.
|
&lt;i&gt;Carlos and I '''have played''' soccer.&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|
¿'''Has hecho''' tus tareas escolares de español?
|
&lt;i&gt;'''Have''' you '''done''' your Spanish homework? &lt;/i&gt;
|-
|
Nunca se '''ha enfermado'''.
|
&lt;i&gt;He '''has''' never '''been''' sick. &lt;/i&gt;
|}

----

== Grammar - Pluperfect (el pretérito pluscuamperfecto) ==

The Spanish pluperfect is formed by conjugating imperfect of '''haber'''
(= ''to have'') and adding the past participle of the verb.


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#9999FF&quot;
|-
!  
! Present Perfect  
! ''English''  
|-
| yo || había comido         
| ''I had eaten ''  
|-
| tú || habías comido        
| ''you had eaten''  
|-
| Ud./él/ella || había comido         
| ''you/he/she had eaten''
|-
| nosotros(as) || habíamos comido      
| ''we had eaten''  
|-
| vosotros(as) || habíais comido       
| ''you (all) had eaten''  
|-
| Uds./ellos(as) || habían comido       
| ''you/they had eaten''  
|}

Here are a few examples of the Spanish pluperfect. It is used to refer to
an event that happened before another event in the past. As in the present perfect,
the auxiliary verb '''haber''' and the past participle are never separated:


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#99FF99&quot;
|-
|
Carlos y yo '''habíamos jugado''' el fútbol antes la fiesta anoche.
|
&lt;i&gt;Carlos and I '''had played''' soccer before the party last night.&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|
¿Tu '''habías venido''' antes a Mexico?
|
&lt;i&gt;'''Had''' you '''been''' to Mexico before? &lt;/i&gt;
|-
|
Nunca se '''había enfermado''' cuando era un niño.
|
&lt;i&gt;He '''had''' never '''been''' sick while he was a kid. &lt;/i&gt;
|}

The text sounds strange. &quot;Beim Ballspiel&quot; seems very formal (use &quot;Beim ballspielen&quot;). And the doubling of &quot;Ja.&quot; conveys an annoyingly boring formality!

Thinking about it, this is more complicated. The form changes for a ''bestimmter Artikel'' (article ''the'' instead of ''a''): ''ein erster Mann'' but ''der erste Mann''.

&lt;pre&gt;
nominative case - ''Nominativ'' (who - ''wer''):
der erste Mann / ein erster Mann
die erste Frau / eine erste Frau
das erste Kind / ein erstes Kind

genitive case - ''Genitiv'' (''wessen'')
des/eines ersten Mann(e)s
der/einer ersten Frau
des/eines ersten Kind(e)s

dative case - ''Dativ'' (''wem'')
dem/einem ersten Mann
der/einer ersten Frau
dem/einem ersten Kind

accusative case - ''Akkusativ'' (''wen'')
den/einen ersten Mann
die/eine erste Frau
das erste Kind / ein erstes Kind
&lt;/pre&gt;

Boy, is it! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 09:28, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC) Simply requires more depth be put into the lessons. For example, we could have a third level (more advanced lesson 2B).  The first pass through should be aimed at highschool students and beginners and not too overwhelming! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 09:33, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I changed the '''muß''' to '''muss'''. In older books you will find '''muß''' but after the reform of German orthography a couple of years ago it changed to '''muss'''. A more prominent example is the change from '''daß'''
to '''dass''' (example: Ich glaube, dass Wikibooks eine gute Sache ist = ''I believe that Wikibooks is a good thing''). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:I'm happy. Vulture has been bringing in the modern changes as well.  My German is coming back &quot;pretty&quot; fast. I'll  stop making those case errors with der words once I write the lesson on that. I'm actually pleased that the errors you are finding are not gross ones (numerous, but not large) as I am writing some of the Gespräch totally from scratch, hopefully (with your all help) to be more interesting than the old texbook stuff about Mutter and Vater ....etc. I was so bold this last hour to translate an article from the German Wikipedia (on geography of Lower Austria) and move it into the English Wikipedia! I know, no big deal, but I'm proud of me - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 06:04, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Hi Marsh. I am really impressed that you write much of the &quot;Gespräche&quot; vom scratch, considering that you haven't been using German much lately. And you are right: your mistakes are absolutely minor ones (cases, stylistical) and I  hope that by adding these &quot;detail-comments&quot; that you get an even better feel for the German language than you already have. ''Vielen Dank für die ganze  Arbeit, die du in das Deutschbuch steckst. Mach' weiter so!'' [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

::''Bitte, sehr'' Without looking anything up I think you said: &quot;Many thanks for the entire effort that you have put into the German Textbook. Carry on!&quot; Or something to that effect. Question: is it that all the ess-tset s are gone, or is there a rule that specifies only certain ones become ess-ess? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:45, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::''Kamm'' (comb) has a short 'a', ''kam'' (came) has a long 'a'. The double consonant makes the vowel before it short if it's not a compund word. So the 'ss' is the doubling of 'ß'. ''Fuß'' (foot) has a long 'u' so it's written with 'ß', but ''Fass'' (barrel) has a short 'a' so it's written with 'ss'. After diphtongs (au, ei, eu) you also write 'ß' because they are long. In Switzerland, 'ß' is always written as 'ss'. --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 09:07, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::::Thanks. I can understand that. In essence it maintains consistency by considering the 'ß' a single consonant. Need to work on those rules in Appendix 1 - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:52, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

&quot;Ein volksmäßig Restaurant&quot;: A restaurant where the locals eat or &quot;ein gutbürgerliches Restaurant&quot;, &quot;ein R. mit gutbürgerlichem Essen&quot; (gutbürgerlich: homely, good plain)? --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 08:59, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''Fremde und Freunde'' ~ &lt;/big&gt;Strangers and Friends&lt;/big&gt;
== Grammatik 2-1 ~ Introduction to Verbs ==
A '''[[Wikipedia:en:Verb|verb]]''' is that part of speech that describes an action. Verbs come in an almost bewildering array of tenses, aspects, and types.  For now, we will limit our discussion to verbs used in the '''present tense''' &amp;mdash; i.e., describing an action occurring in the present. You should start to recognize that the form a verb takes is related to the subject of that verb: &lt;u&gt;the verb form must match the '''person''' of the subject&lt;/u&gt;. This requirement is sometimes evident in English, but always so in German. Consider the following English and German sentences (the verb is ''studieren'' in every case):
{|
|I &lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt; biology.
|''Ich &lt;u&gt;studiere&lt;/u&gt; Biologie''.
|-
|She &lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt; mathematics.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|''Sie &lt;u&gt;studiert&lt;/u&gt; Mathematik.''         
|-
|Today we &lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt; German.
|''Heute &lt;u&gt;studieren&lt;/u&gt; wir Deutsch.''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|(Note a subject verb reversal)
|-
|What &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; you &lt;u&gt;studying&lt;/u&gt;?
|''Was &lt;u&gt;studierst&lt;/u&gt; du?''
|(Notice subject verb reversal in question sentence)
|}
Several things are illustrated by these sentence pairs. First, all verbs in German follow the rule just stated that a verb form must agree with its subject. Starting in ''Lektion 6'' we will learn the verb forms associated with each person in German. Second, this rule in English applies mostly to the verb 'to be' (e.g., I am, you are, he is, etc.). In some English verbs, the 3rd person singular form is unique, often taking an 's' or 'es' ending: &quot;I &lt;u&gt;give&lt;/u&gt; at the office&quot;, but &quot;He &lt;u&gt;gives&lt;/u&gt; at the office&quot; (and &quot;She studies...&quot; above).  Finally, some German verbs are best translated with an English 'to be' verb form added. This is called the ''progressive'' form in English ('What are you studying?'), but it does not exist in German. Thus, a verb like ''nennen'' can best be translated as &quot;to name&quot; or &quot;to call&quot;. The following example may make this clearer. In the present tense, the following statements in English:
:'They are calling the corporation, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;'
:'They name the corporation, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;'
:'They call the corporation, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;'
:'They do call the corporation, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;'
are all expressed in German in only one way: ''Sie nennen die Firma, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;''.
And the question statement: 'Do they call the corporation, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;?' becomes, in German: ''Nennen sie die Firma, &quot;Trans-Global&quot;?''

----

== Grammatik 2-2 ~ Pronouns in the Nominative Case ==
Most of the personal pronouns introduced in [[German/Lesson_1|Lektion 1]] are used as subjects of their verbs. These represent the '''nominative case''' in German (as in English). We will shortly learn three other cases in German: the '''accusative''' for direct objects, the '''dative''' for indirect objects, and the '''genitive''' for expressing possession. For now, remember that the singular personal pronouns in English ('''nominative case''') are &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;he/she/it&quot; (1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons) and the &lt;u&gt;nominative case is used as the subject of a verb&lt;/u&gt;. In German, these pronouns are rendered as ''ich'', ''du'', and ''er/sie/es''. In these example sentences, the '''subject''' of the verb is underlined:
{|
|''&lt;u&gt;Ich&lt;/u&gt; gehe einkaufen.''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; go shopping.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Er&lt;/u&gt; studiert Biologie.''    
|&lt;u&gt;He&lt;/u&gt; studies biology.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Es&lt;/u&gt; geht mir gut''.
|&lt;u&gt;It&lt;/u&gt; goes well with me.
|( = I am fine).
|-
|''Wohin gehst &lt;u&gt;du&lt;/u&gt;''?
|Where are &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt; going?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|(Notice subject verb reversal in question sentence)
|}
There are, of course, plural personal pronouns in the English nominative case: &quot;we&quot;, &quot;you&quot;, and &quot;they&quot;; and in German, these nominative case pronouns are ''wir'', ''ihr'', and ''sie''. These appear in the following examples (again, subject underlined):
{| 
|''&lt;u&gt;Wir&lt;/u&gt; gehen einkaufen.''
|&lt;u&gt;We&lt;/u&gt; go shopping.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Ihr&lt;/u&gt; versteht die Frage.''
|&lt;u&gt;You&lt;/u&gt; all understand the question.''
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Ihr&lt;/u&gt; habt die Anleitungen.''
|&lt;u&gt;You&lt;/u&gt; (all) have the instructions.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Sie&lt;/u&gt; verstehen die Arbeit.''
|&lt;u&gt;They&lt;/u&gt; understand the work.
|}
In both English and German, the 3rd person singular also has '''gender'''. As you will next learn, the 2nd person (person being addressed) in German has both '''familiar''' and '''polite''' (formal) forms. Further, it is worth repeating here &amp;mdash; although introduced in ''Grammatik 2-1'' above and to be covered in detail in future lessons &amp;mdash; that the verb form changes when the subject changes. That is, in German the &lt;u&gt;verb form must match the subject of a sentence&lt;/u&gt;. Here are some examples; compare with the previous three example sentences above and note how the verb form changed to match the sentence subject (subject and verb underlined):
{|
|''&lt;u&gt;Ich verstehe&lt;/u&gt; die Arbeit.''
|&lt;u&gt;I understand&lt;/u&gt; the work.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Du gehst&lt;/u&gt; einkaufen.''
|&lt;u&gt;You go&lt;/u&gt; shopping.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Ich habe&lt;/u&gt; alle Antworten.''
|&lt;u&gt;I have&lt;/u&gt; all the answers.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Er hat&lt;/u&gt; die Anleitungen.''
|&lt;u&gt;He has&lt;/u&gt; the instructions.
|}
In the last example, the English verb form ('have') also changed based upon the subject of the sentence.

:* ''Herr Schmidt'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Auf Wiedersehen, Frau Baumann! &lt;/big&gt;

In this conversation, although the subject matter is basically casual, a more formal form of German is being used intoning respect between coworkers in an office setting. The polite form is expressed by the pronouns as explained below (Grammatik 2-3).

== Grammatik 2-3 ~ Familiar and Polite Pronoun Forms ==
Many pronouns were introduced in Lesson 1. In ''Grammatik 2-1'' and ''Gespräch 2-1'' we have been presented with the following additional pronouns:
  ''Ihnen'' &amp;ndash; (to) you    (2nd person singular, dative case)
  ''ihr'' &amp;ndash; you      (2nd person, plural, nominative case)
  ''sie'' &amp;ndash; they     (3rd person, plural, nominative case) 
  ''Sie'' &amp;ndash; you      (2nd person, singular, nominative case)
  ''wir'' &amp;ndash; we       (1st person, plural, nominative case)
In the conversations between friends presented in ''Gespräche 1-1'' and ''1-2'' ([[German/Lesson_1|Lektion 1]]) the '''familiar''' form of the personal pronouns (e.g., ''du'', ''dir'') was used.  However, German also has a '''polite''' or '''formal''' form of some of these personal pronouns. The polite form is used in conversations between strangers and more formal situations, as illustrated in the ''Gespräch 2-1'': greetings between business associates.

The polite form is always first-letter capitalized in German, which can be helpful in differentiating ''Sie'' (you) from ''sie'' (she and they); ''Ihnen'' (you) from ''ihnen'' (them).  However, you will soon learn that the form of the '''verb''' (see ''Grammatik 2-3'' below) is most telling, as shown by these example pairs using the verb, ''haben'' (have):
{|
|''&lt;u&gt;Haben Sie&lt;/u&gt; eine Zigarette?''
|Do you have a cigarette?
|(polite form of you)
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Sie hat&lt;/u&gt; keine Wurst und keinen Käse.''
|She has no sausage and no cheese.
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Sie haben&lt;/u&gt; viel Arbeit.''
|They have much work (to do).
|-
|''&lt;u&gt;Haben sie&lt;/u&gt; zu viel Arbeit?''
|Do they have too much work?
|} 
Because the first letter in a sentence is always capitalized, we cannot determine (without the verb form) whether the second and third examples begin with ''sie'' ('she' or 'they') or with ''Sie'' (polite 'you'); a problem that would also exist in conversation. The fourth example, where subject and verb are reversed in a question, demonstrates the pronoun 'they'; compare it with the polite 'you' in the first example. 

It is relatively easy for an English speaker to appreciate how context, especially in conversation, overcomes confusion considering that English has fewer forms for these pronouns than German. However, this fact does present some difficulty when learning German, since improper use of a pronoun may just create confusion in speaking or writing German.

== Grammatik 2-4 ~ Personal pronoun gender ==
In both English and German the 3rd person personal pronouns have gender ([[German/Lesson_1#Grammatik 1-3 ~ Introduction to pronouns|Grammatik 1-3]]). However, in English, the pronoun &quot;it&quot; is used for most inanimate or non-living things. There are a few exceptions: a ship might be referred to as &quot;she&quot;. However, in German, the 3rd person personal pronoun reflects the '''gender''' of the noun ('''antecedent''') referred to by the pronoun. For examples:
{|
|''Der Kühlschrank ist fast leer.''
|''&lt;u&gt;Er&lt;/u&gt; ist fast leer.''
|&lt;u&gt;It&lt;/u&gt; ('''masculine''') is almost empty.
|-
|''Ich brauche die Wurst.''
|''Ich brauche &lt;u&gt;sie&lt;/u&gt;.''
|I need &lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt; ('''feminine''').
|-              
|''Das Gespräch ist schwer.''
|''&lt;u&gt;Es&lt;/u&gt; ist schwer.''
|&lt;u&gt;It&lt;/u&gt; ('''neuter''') is difficult.
|}        
The following table summarizes these gender relationships:

{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; | 3rd person pronouns
|-
| &amp;nbsp;masculine&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''''er'''''

| &amp;nbsp;she

==Remake==
&lt;big&gt;'''This needs a total remake, it is not even funny. It is very silly and useless to have A WHOLE different sub-section, with all the lessons of level 2, and the only thing which is different is a small, little advance page for each lesson. It needs different, and harder lessons. Isn't that the whole reason for a different sub-section page? We need all the complex grammer and difficult words of German in this level, or put the easier parts of complex German grammer and vocabulary of it here, and make a Level 4 and put the more difficult parts of complex German grammer and vocabulary in there. Derbeth even said we had to do something. And it is time. We need to get a plan together. Yes or No?
'''&lt;/big&gt; &lt;small&gt; -- [[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 0:45, 17 Feb 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
* Okay, I started the remake, now we need to get planning for level 3 &amp; 4, level 5 is a big review level, and it's have a lot cultureal thing, and the history of the german language. -- [[User:German Men92|German Men92]] 14:24, 18 Feb 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;

==Starting discussion==
Under the table of contents, I've listed both what each lesson covers and what should or could be covered.  We can then modify the pages to meet these lesson goals. I think it is important to not have very complex grammar rules in a lesson before other rules supporting those are introduced - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:17, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Thanks Thomas. %^) Just what is needed: the corect terms/words for these things like Advanced Lessons! My having to use a dictionary is a handicap -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 20:02, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hi, Marsh. The more I look at the German-book, the more I feel uncomfortable with the complexity of the grammer you introduce in the early lessons. I would definitely prefere to begin with very easy things in the first lessons (like the different konjugation forms of easy verbs.), but nothing about reflexive verbs, declinations and differnt grammatical times. I know, that is a quite fundamental thing that affects the complete structure of the course, but for me, it seems worth to think about changing its complete structure. --- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 11:57, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:I'll will work on what you suggest when Wikipedia settles down. Right now I keep getting booted out.  I have been following a highschool German textbook, but my stories may be a bit more complex (the stories in the textbook are god awful) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 19:14, 5 Jan 2004 (UTC)

'''Let me give a proposal for a first lesson:'''

Markus ist Student. Er studiert Biologie. Er begegnet Katrin auf der Straße.
Sie studiert Mathematik.
;'''Markus:''' Hallo, Katrin! Wohin gehst du?
;'''Katrin:''' Ich gehe einkaufen. Der Kühlschrank ist fast leer. Ich brauche Wurst und Käse. Und du? Wohin gehst du?
;'''Markus:''' An die Uni. Ich habe viel Arbeit.
;'''Katrin:''' Gut! Dann bis bald. Tschüß.
;'''Markus:''' Tschüß, Katrin.

Now, what's the goal?
* Only simple verbs, i.e. regular conjugations (at least in ''Präsenz'').
* Only Nominativs. Well, actualy, there are other cases, too. But incidently, they are the same as their nominativs, so you need not to explain it for now :-)
* Heinrich and Karl are rather old fashioned names. Markus and Katrin are more usual and give a parity in genders.
* The question ''&quot;Wie geht es dir?&quot;'' is '''unusal''' as a greeting in German. So, it's not such a good example for a typical German small-talk.

What could you explain?
* Pronouns in Nominativ (ich, du, er, sie)
* Simple Conjugations in 1st, 2nd and 3rd person singular.
* How to build questions. 

:I disagree. &quot;Wie geht's?&quot; is common small-talk, but you'd usually first greet. It'd be more common than telling the other person what your fridge is lacking. Also &quot;(Ich gehe) An die Uni. Ich habe viel Arbeit&quot; sounds very very odd. In German (or at least in colloquial German of most regions of Germany I know of) you'd rather say &quot;Zur Uni&quot; and &quot;Ich habe viel zu tun&quot;. I don't know about Austrian and Swiss German, tho -- although I'd guess most foreigners first want to learn the Germany-German variant when intending to learn German (as this is also usually the one taught in schools). -- [[W:User:Ashmodai|W:Ashmodai]]

::I'll work those changes in. I agree, what is always needed here are native speakers assessing the conversational material for &quot;modern&quot; appropriateness. I do not have that ability. I was last in Germany around 1953 and then as a child not speaking German! - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 19:16, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

'''Proposal for a 2nd lesson:'''

Markus ist in der Universität. Er trinkt dort einen Kaffee und isst ein Brötchen. Danach geht er in die Bibliothek. Er sucht ein Buch über Biochemie. Er holt das Buch aus dem Regal und setzt sich an einen Tisch. Nach einer Stunde geht er in den Hof und raucht eine Zigarette. Danach geht er an den Tisch zurück. Er denkt: &quot;Wenigstens eine Stunde...&quot; und stellt das Buch wieder in das Regal. Heute ist nicht sein Tag.

What could you explain?
* Genders
* Articles: der, die das, ein, eine, ein.
* Nominativ, Dativ and Akkusativ. (We could live without Genitiv for a while)
* Daklinations with articles. 
* Keep everthing in singular.


-- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 12:56, 6 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Hansm. These are good ideas, and I am certainly not qualified to &quot;rule over&quot; this textbook. I am concerned myself that the early lessons may be a bit too difficult, one reason that I created '''two levels''' out of each lesson (a simple and a more advanced presentation of the same concepts). We can work your suggestions into the front of the existing material, pushing the existing stuff further back in the book.  While not an easy editing task, I'm willing to do it to make the text more consistent with modern German and, as you say, simplify the earliest lessons. Any corrections/additions you proivide are greatly appreciated &amp;mdash; and input from others would likewise improve the book. That is the idea of doing a book here, so do not worry about stepping on toes. Just be conservative in removing material already worked on and try and preserve the overall style (which can also be improved on).  Others have done some of these lessons (not all by me), and I usually try and keep the material by moving it around to someplace where it best fits in - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:41, 6 Jan 2004 (UTC)     

== Organizing the Approach ==

Hm, now we all have been working on our 'German patchwork', but still I'm not so happy with the result. Maybe the biggest problem I see is the grammatical concept. Summarizing the grammatical themes, I found the following list:

:Realize the result right now is a patchwork because all I have done is adjusted Lesson 1 and 1A to fit the material you suggested be used as &quot;less difficult&quot; to read; I've yet to get to any of the other lessons (just a start on Lesson 2) that are impacted by the changes. Having said that, I do agree with the approach you are starting to outline below. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:02, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)  

:''I've added explanation to each point to give you a sense of what organisation exists (and does not exist in many cases)'' - Marsh
* personal pronouns, all in nominativ, some in dativ  (Lesson 1) ''All are pronouns; that is all that is accomplished here: Introduction to pronouns''
* personal pronouns, but nominativ only (Lesson 1A) ''This is an advanced lesson, not intended for begining students to access, but should amplify one or more of the lessons in the basic Lesson 1 for 2nd year or college level students without introducing something the Basic lessons will need; rather limited on what this can be in Lesson 1A (Hey, you did this lesson :^?)''
* personal pronouns for familar and polite form, nominativ and dativ (Lesson 2) ''Familiar and polite pronoun concept introduced in Grammatik 2-1''
* word order in questions (Lesson 2) ''There are many things to cover about word order in German sentences, so this is just the first one'' 
* again, personal pronouns for familar and polite form, nominativ and dativ. This is the first time that the meaning of cases is explained! (Lesson 2) ''Not so, case is mentioned in Grammatik 1-2; this is first application of the concept (it is afterall only Lesson 2) - it could be argued this is too soon in the sequence'' 
* Composed nouns (Lesson 2A)- ''Please ignore for now. All advanced lessons will change somewhat, based on the premise that they should amplify points made in the basic lesson - Lesson N = Beginning student; Lesson N + NA = advanced student (same lesson, more detail) 
* Numbers, cardinal and ordinal ( Lesson 3) ''Some lessons will have to cover these broader aspects: time, numbers, colors, etc.; best to start early with numbers''
* telling/asking time (Lesson 3) ''Makes pefect sense from fact that fact that German numbers introduced are 1-12. Numbers greater than 12 will be part of a future lesson (2nd &quot;round&quot;)'' 
* nouns, gender, definite articels (Lesson 3) ''May need to go to Lesson 4, but this is the introduction to nouns; seems like articles (definite at least) are good to include at this point.  Again, there can be an appendix page that gives the rules and has tables for nouns, articles, endings, etc. This constitutes information of reference value; lesson should stick to just one aspect about nouns, nothers aspects coming up one at a time in later lessons - this approach allows the examples to grow in complexity in a way meaningful to what the student should know by a particular lesson. This is where I especially need a native speaker to develop (or tweak) the stories and conversations to keep them consistent (or close to) the expected level of grammar knowledge at the point where they appear. Note that the Vokabeln is geared to this approach as well.'' 
* (possesive) pronouns in accusative and dativ (Lesson 3) ''Each case of the personal pronouns is taken in order in successive lessons''
* again, personal pronouns, but nominativ (Lesson 3a) ''out of sequence for reason elaborated above; ignore for now''
* possesive pronouns in dativ (labeled as genitiv) (Lesson 4) ''These are possessive adjectives, not datives''
* indefinite articles (Lesson 4) ''Expands on the definte articles lesson in 3''
* gender of ordinals, nominativ only (Lesson 4A) ''out of sequence''
* details of telling time ( Lasson 4A) ''out of sequence''
* personal Pronouns: accusative case (Lesson 4A) ''out of sequence''
* Conjugating 'to be' (Lesson 5) ''I've not worked on this lesson - contributed by others''
* personal Pronouns: dative case (Lesson 5A) ''ignore for now''

Is there any kind of intension behind that? For me, it looks somewhat like a random result. 

:I do not agree it either is or looks random.  Although after about Lesson 2, it is now all mixed up. One cannot take any area (say verbs) and treat it to completeness in a single or short sequence of lessons. Since language is the melding of all the parts of speech and grammar, the best approach (IMHO) is to start with as many of the basic concepts as can fit in but initially cover each rather superficially, then step these up in complexity in a programmed way (&quot;rounds&quot;).  Thus, the lessons now present cover lots of different areas, but only in a basic way. The next set of lessons (yet to be even dreamed of by me) would go back to all of the concepts in the first 5 or 7 lessons and bulid in complexity on each. It may take many cycles of this to progress from beginning German to any kind of mastery.  That is how language '''courses''' work.  One can now find in several places on the web German language grammatical rules - sites that present everything there is to known about pronouns on one page, all there is to know about verbs on the next, etc.  These are great sources of information, but no one has or could learn to speak a foreign language from them. They are not language courses, but language information sites. In a sense, I did envision having appendices to the language book that somewhat used this approach - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:14, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)       

===Proposal===

'''I'd propose the following strategy''':
# Elaborate a grammatical giudeline. Fix, what grammatical themes should be treated in which lesson.
# Write the example texts.
# Give short additional explanations and vocabulary.

Point 1. is probably better done by those who have learned German as a foreigne langugage since natives often do not realy know what porblems may occure when learning German grammar and what are the actual grammatical rules.

Point 2. is maybe better done by German natives. -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 14:29, 8 Jan 2004 (UTC)

: I think this is a good idea. In fact I proposed something very similar  awhile back on one of the Germam:Talk pages. But you are the first native speaker that has expressed any interest in the organization of the book. I especially agree with your assessment of who should best work on the first two points (although I'd like to stay involved in all aspects as I suspect would anyone else that joins in) &amp;mdash; but clearly a native speaker can do the best job on the example texts. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:19, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Please exapand on your third point. I'm unclear what you are proposing there?&lt;br&gt;As for the grammatical guideline, I can make that clearer, even to the point of getting out ahead of where the lessons presently are; but that will take time.  Just keeping organized/edited what we do have is already a big consumer of my online time.  Realize again, that because of the changes WE made to Lesson 1, it will take a few days for me to work through the consequences to the lessons to the end of Lesson 6.  In fact, the lessons past about 4 are not near any shape to use.&lt;br&gt;Please read the [[German: Introduction|Vorwort]] if you have not already. It explains the overall organization of the book. Otherwise, the organization that is already present is this: Each part of speach (pronoun, noun, verb, etc.) is introduced at some point early in the first lessons.  Each is then elaborated on over the next several lessons to a review point. Only fairly basic information and examples are given on each.  Then another sety of lessons is developed with a bit more complexity introduced.  From the saample Lesson 0.1 you prepared, this seemed to be exactly where you were going - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 02:32, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::I never did say that we have to treat one theme after the other to completeness in a sequence of lessons. It's just the point that we have to find a reasonable and tranparent sequence of grammatical themes we want to explain. E.g., for me, it looks odd using (partly very complicated) different verb forms in 4 lessons without saying anything about verbs. But you may see other preferences. That's why I have suggested to elaborate a guideline first. Anyway, I agree totaly with your idea about more and more detailed rounds.

::To point 3 in my proposal: Maybe I have formulated it a bit confusing. Sorry. What I wanted to say is this: After we know, what the main grammatical points for a lesson should be (Point 1) and the example texts are written (point 2), we need to integrate the key examples from the texts into the grammatical explanation. Furthermore, it might have turned out that the examples must use some additional grammatical stuff that should at least be mentioned in the grammer part. The latter 2 steps are point 3. Maybe, I better had sayd point 3 and 4.

::-- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 14:22, 9 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:::I think I see what you are saying. And of course that is also where you can be a big help.  After 1 and 2 are &quot;completed&quot; you could go back (especially to a conversation or story) and add or modify some lines to better illustrate the lesson points.  We (or others) could extract examples from these to illustrate certain lessons (i.e., Point 3).&lt;br&gt;As to your point on having so many verb forms in the conversations before verbs are introduced I can give two explanations: 1) some grammar rules will lag behind use of the rule in conversation or stories just because all the rules cannot be given up front; 2) however, you and others have been simplifying the conversations to minimize this problem (much appreciated input), so I'm not too concerned that it is a problem that will eventually not be serious - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:08, 10 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::::One more short explanation: I think, point 2 should be oriented as close as possible at point 1, i.e. the story or conversation should be written with some new grammer rules in mind. Idealy, it will give many grammatical examples in a quite naturaly looking way.

::::I simply have begun to organize a possible guideline. The basical idea is to first collect themes (subsection 1) and then diviede it into lessons (subsection 2). I would highly appreciate if you would add your ideas and themes.  -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 19:41, 11 Jan 2004 (UTC)

-------------------------

===Grammatical guideline for the first 10 lessons===


====Themes that should be treated====

This is just a brain storming collection of themes. The enumeration is intended as reference, not as sequential number. So please, '''append new items at the end''' and give them a new number in sequence. 

* 1. Personal pronouns in nominative.
* 2. Personal pronouns in dative.
* 3. Personal pronouns in accusative.
* 4. Meaning of and ideas behind declensions
* 5. Rules for declining nouns with definite article
* 6. Rules for declining nouns with indefinite article
* 7. Meaning of verb conjugations
* 8. Regular conjugation in present tense (''Präsens indikativ'').
* 9. Some important irregular verbs in present tense (''Präsens indikativ'').
* 10. Building the perfect.
* 11. Building the particip perfect for regular verbs.
* 12. Adjectives
* 13. Adjectives must fit in number, case and gender to the noun
* 14. Word order in German sentences: questions; 
* 15. Numbers (1-12), telling time
* 16. Numbers, (13-100), math
* 17. Possessives (pronouns and adjectives)
* 18. Prepositions
* 19. Modal auxiliaries
* 20. Irregular verbs
* 21. Konjunktiv I und II, and uses of werden
* 22. Capitalization of nouns

====What theme in which lesson====

* '''Lesson 1:''' 14 (introduces &quot;grammar&quot; and &quot;pronouns&quot;)
* '''Lesson 2:''' 1 (introduces &quot;verbs&quot;)
* '''Lesson 3:''' 15, 5, 2, 3 (introduces &quot;nouns&quot;)
* '''Lesson 4:''' 4, 6, 7 
* '''Lesson 5:''' 8, 9 (partly?)
* '''Lesson 6:''' 17 (introduces &quot;adjectives&quot;)
* '''Lesson 7:''' 
* '''Lesson 8:''' 
* '''Lesson 9:''' 
* '''Lesson 10:''' 

::I think this is a good way to approach organization; we can &quot;move&quot; the themes around here to set up a good sequencing.  However, I would suggest that Lesson 1 is now done as it stands; that Lesson 2 could have intro to verbs (and possibly therefore #8), but is also about done.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have set things up to have an introduction to each of the parts of speech (English speakers are not always that familiar with this). This does not mean there cannot be a &quot;first&quot; lesson on that subject in the same lesson, but generally it would be best to have that in the very next lesson. Remember, that for each lesson there is also a goodly Vokabeln to be learned in addition to a grammar lesson.  We must also consider that the stories and conversations should be short so sound files can eventually be prepared for each; but that having short ones, means needing to have more. One way to have &quot;more&quot; is to spread the lessons out. Since this is a textbook, there is no reason to cram too much onto each &quot;page&quot;). I'll give this more thought - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:08, 12 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::I've now completed Lesson 1A, Lesson 2, and Lesson 2A.  We can now develop additioonal themes using verbs and pronouns. If nouns are introduced in 3 as I suggesdt, then Lesson 3 is near completion and lessons on verb forms can be developed. I'll move the concepts/themes to the contents page for reference - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 04:37, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

===Vocabulary===

Moved to [[Talk:German: Introduction]].

Why does [[German:Contents]] redirect here? I think, to be fair, it should redirect back to the cover page. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 15:23, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Same Lessons for Level II and III? ==

I'm wondering why level II and III point to the same lessons. Is level III a repetition of II? -- [[User:Messi|messi]] 23:24, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)
:Thought I answered this already somewhere?  Anyway, the answer is that yes Level III is the same as Level II but then Level III includes the advanced lesson page following each basic lesson page. This is explained in the introduction page. Appreciate your corrections. :^) - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:11, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

See also [[../Major Characters|Major Characters]].

As many characters have only a given name, or take &quot;of Somewhere&quot; as their last name, the characters are listed  alphabetically by first name.

Note that characters in ''The Once and Future King'' may not exactly match with traditional Arthurian legend.

&lt;b id=&quot;Ector&quot;&gt;Sir Ector&lt;/b&gt; - Owns the Castle of the Forest Sauvage. He adopts and cares for [[../Major Characters#Arthur|the Wart]] . He is the father of [[#Kay|Kay]].

&lt;b id=&quot;Kay&quot;&gt;Sir Kay&lt;/b&gt; - Son of [[#Ector|Sir Ector]] and friend of [[../Major Characters#Arthur|the Wart]]. He tries to act superior over the Wart. He follows Arthur on one adventure: the rescue mission at [[#Morgan|Morgan le Fay]]'s castle (see ''[[../The Sword in the Stone/]]''). When Arthur brings Kay the Sword in the Stone, Kay falsely claims to have drawn the sword himself, but soon gives the credit to Arthur. He later becomes a knight of the Round Table.

&lt;b id=&quot;Morgan&quot;&gt;Morgan le Fay&lt;/b&gt; - The most evil of the Cornwalls, and the strongest in magic. &quot;Le Fay&quot; means &quot;the Fairy&quot;. She is the antagonist in the major adventure in ''[[../The Sword in the Stone/]]''. Her sisters are Elaine (not mentioned) and [[Major Characters (OaFK)#Morgause|Morgause]].

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Lektion Drei für Fortgeschrittene&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== Gespräch 3-3 ~ ''Mach dir keine Sorgen!'' ==
&lt;big&gt;Beim Ballspielen macht Karl sich Sorgen um die Uhrzeit.&lt;/big&gt;
* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wie spät ist es jetzt? 
* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;Es ist erst halb eins.
* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Kannst du mir bitte sagen, wenn es Viertel vor zwei ist?&lt;/big&gt; 
* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;Warum? 
* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dann muss ich nach Hause gehen.
* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;Und jetzt ist es schon ein Uhr einunddreißig.
* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Du bist komisch! Hier, ich kicke dir den Ball zu.
* ''Heinrich'': &lt;big&gt;Ja. Dann kann ich ihn dir zurückkicken.
* ''Karl'': &lt;big&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ja. Und danach bringst du mich auf deinem Motorrad zu meiner Wohnung. &lt;/big&gt;

== Grammatik 3-5 ~ Numbers ==

=== Gender of Ordinals ===
Ordinal numbers are adjectives, and therefore have forms for each of the three genders in German. The forms are derived from the feminine form (as introduced in the beginning of [[German/Lesson 3|Lesson 3]]) by adding an 'r' (masculine) or an 's' (neuter). Thus: ''erste'' (feminine), ''erste'''r''''' (masculine), and ''erste'''s''''' (neuter). Examples:
:~ ''erster Mann'' ('first man'); ''letzter Mann'' ('last man'); ''siebter Himmel'' (7th heaven)
:~ ''zehnte Frau'' ('tenth woman'); ''zweite Woche'' ('second week')
:~ ''drittes Mädchen'' ('third girl')

== Grammatik 3-6 ~ Expressions of Time ==
===Idioms used in Telling Time ===
As in English, there are a number of idiomatic phrases associated with giving or telling time. For example, note that the half hour is given as approaching the next hour. The German preposition, ''um'', is used to mean &quot;at&quot; a given time.
{|
|''Es ist &lt;u&gt;halb elf&lt;/u&gt;''.
|It is &lt;u&gt;half past ten&lt;/u&gt; (10:30).
|-
|''Er kommt &lt;u&gt;um sieben Uhr&lt;/u&gt;''.
|He is coming &lt;u&gt;at seven o'clock&lt;/u&gt;.
|-
|''Sie kommt immer &lt;u&gt;ungefähr um acht Uhr&lt;/u&gt;''.
|She always comes &lt;u&gt;around eight o'clock&lt;/u&gt;.
|-
|''Wir essen &lt;u&gt;gegen sieben Uhr&lt;/u&gt;''.
|We eat &lt;u&gt;about seven o'clock&lt;/u&gt;.
|- 
|''Sie gehen nach Hause &lt;u&gt;auf eine Stunde&lt;/u&gt;''.
|They go home &lt;u&gt;for an hour&lt;/u&gt;.
|-
|''Es ist &lt;u&gt;viertel zehn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''
|It is a &lt;u&gt;quarter past nine&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|}
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;This idiom (''Es ist viertel zehn'') is used especially in the southern parts of Germany, but is becoming popular among young Germans throughout the Country.

===Periods of the Day===
There are a number of adverbial phrases used in German to denote time periods during the day. Common ones are listed here:
{|
|''am Morgen''
|in the morning; also as ''morgens''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or ''des Morgens''
|-
|''am Mittag''
|at noon, midday; also as ''mittags'' or ''des Mittags''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''am Nachmittag''
|in the afternoon; also as ''nachmittags'' or ''des Nachmittags''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''am Abend''
|in the evening; also as ''abends'' or ''des Abends''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|''am Tage''
|in the daytime
|-  
|''in der Nacht''
|at night
|-
|''gegen Abend''
|towards evening
|-
|''gegen Morgen''
|towards morning
|}
:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Forms like ''morgens'' and ''des Nachmittags'' would tend to be used to indicate  customary or habitual actions, as in this sense:
::''Morgens spiele ich''. = In the morning I (usually) play.
:However, these forms aren't used much anymore.

=== Additional Notes ===
The first sentence in Gespräch 3-3 uses ''Beim Ballspielen'' in the sense of &quot;during the ball game&quot; or &quot;while playing ball&quot;. ''Beim'' is a contraction of ''bei dem'' or &quot;at the&quot;. However, ''das Ballspiel'' is a noun that represents an action (&quot;playing with a ball&quot;), so it is correct to use ''beim'' in the sense intended here. It is not the most beautiful way of saying this&amp;mdash;but is correct. With the infinitive of a verb you can use ''beim'' too: ''Beim Spielen'' means &quot;while playing&quot;. This form is more common in modern German language.

== Vokabeln 3-4 ==
 der Abend               evening
 der Himmel              heaven
 der Mittag              noon, noontime
 der Morgen, die Morgen  morning(s)                    
 der Nachmittag          afternoon
 die Nacht               night
 der Tag, die Tage       day(s)

 abreisen                depart (from a trip)

 auf                     for (duration), after
 gegen                   towards, about, approximately
 letzt(er)               last
 ungefähr                (at) about, approximately

Note that ''morgen'' does not change in plural; thus, ''Die Morgen'' = &quot;the mornings&quot;. It is uncommon to use it in plural, unless as a measure of land ''Vier Morgen Land'' = &quot;four 'morgens of land&quot;. For a plural use of &quot;mornings&quot;, it is better to substitute ''die Vormittage''.

== Andere Wörter 3A ==
Using these additional vocabulary words, you may be able to restate '''Gespräch 3-3''' above, altering the meaning (or time of day) of the conversation.

 die Hälfte           half 
 die Viertelstunde    quarter of an hour

:* &lt;small&gt;[[German/Appendices/Alphabet|Pronunciation Guide]] &gt;&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

== Übersetzung 3-2 ==
Translate the following sentences into German:
&lt;big&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#CC3399&quot;&gt;
# I am always at home in the morning.

&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Oxymercuration''' is a process by which water is added to an alkene through treatment of the alkene with mercury(II) acetate [Hg(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, usually abbreviated Hg(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] in an aqueous tetrahydrofuran ([[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/THF|THF]]) solvent. Rarely this reaction is referred to as Oxymercuration/reduction. This reaction looks just like [[Organic Chemistry/Introduction to reactions/Markovnikov|Markovnikov.]] addition of water across a double bond, however there is no carbocation intermediate, so there is no rearrangement.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Text Formatting''' elements give logical structure to phrases in your '''HTML''' document. This structure is normally presented to the user by changing the appearance of the text.

We have seen in the [[HTML Programming|Introduction]] to this book how we can  ''emphasize'' text by using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. Graphical browsers normally present emphasized text in italics. Some [[w:Screen reader|Screen readers]], utilities which read the page to the user, may speak emphasized words with a different inflection.

'''A common mistake is to tag an element to get a certain ''appearance'' instead of tagging its ''meaning''.''' This issue becomes clearer when testing in multiple browsers, especially with graphical and text-only browsers as well as screen readers.

You can change the default presentation for any element using [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. For example, if you wanted all emphasized text to appear in red normal text you would use the following CSS rule:
&lt;pre&gt;
 em { font-style:normal; color:red; }
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this section, we will explore a few basic ways in which you can markup the logical structure of your document.

==Emphasis==
HTML has elements for two degrees of emphasis:
* The {{HTML:element|em}} element for emphasized text, usually rendered in italics.
* The {{HTML:element|strong}} element for strongly emphasized text, usually rendered in bold.

An example of emphasized text:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
It is essential not only to guess but actually &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; the results.
&lt;/source&gt;

An example rendering:

{{CSS:rendered|1=It is essential not only to guess but actually &lt;em&gt;observe&lt;/em&gt; the results.}}

An example of strongly emphasized text:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
Let us now focus on &lt;strong&gt;structural markup&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/source&gt;

An example rendering:

{{CSS:rendered|1=Let us now focus on &lt;strong&gt;structural markup&lt;/strong&gt;.}}

==Preformatted text==
Preformatted text is rendered using fixed-width font, and without condensing multiple spaces into one, which results in preserved spacing. Newlines are rendered as newlines, unlike outside preformatted text. HTML markup in the preformatted text is still interpreted by browsers though, meaning that &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot; will still be rendered as &quot;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.

To create preformatted text, start it with &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; and end it with &amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;.

An example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
,-----------------------,
| No. | Person          |
|-----------------------|
| 1.  | Bill Newton     |
| 2.  | Magaret Clapton |
'-----------------------'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The resulting rendering:

&lt;pre&gt;
,-----------------------,
| No. | Person          |
|-----------------------|
| 1.  | Bill Newton     |
| 2.  | Magaret Clapton |
'-----------------------'
&lt;/pre&gt;

Omitting the preformatting tags will cause the same text to appear all in one line:

,-----------------------,
| No. | Person          |
|-----------------------|
| 1.  | Bill Newton     |
| 2.  | Magaret Clapton |
'-----------------------'

==Special Characters==

To insert non-standard characters or characters that hold special meaning in HTML, a character reference is required. For example, to input the ampersand, &quot;&amp;&quot;, &quot;&amp;amp;amp;&quot; must be typed.  Characters can also be inserted by their ASCII or Unicode number code.

==Abbreviations==
Another useful element is &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt;. This can be used to provide a definition for an abbreviation, e.g.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
 &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
:Will be displayed as: &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Language&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt;
:&lt;small&gt;When you will hover over HTML, you see HyperText Markup Language&lt;/small&gt;


Graphical browsers often show abbreviations with a dotted underline. The &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; appears as a tooltip. Screen readers may read the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; at the user's request.

Note: very old browsers (Internet Explorer version 6 and lower) do not support &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt;. Because they support the related element &lt;code&gt;acronym&lt;/code&gt;, that element has been commonly used for all abbreviations.

An acronym is a special abbreviation in which letters from several words are pronounced to form a new word (e.g. radar - Radio Detection And Ranging). The letters in HTML are pronounced separately, technically making it a different sort of abbreviation known as an initialism.

==Discouraged Formatting==
HTML supports various formatting elements whose use is discouraged in favor of the use of cascading style sheets (CSS). Here's a short overview of the discouraged formatting, so that you know what it is when you see it in some web page, and know how to replace it with CSS formatting. Some of the discouraged elements are merely discouraged, others are deprecated in addition.

|

|-
| &lt;code&gt;font&lt;/code&gt;
| font size
| &lt;font size=1&gt;size=1&lt;/font&gt;
| ''deprecated''
| font-size:(value)
|-
| &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt;
| center a block
| 
| ''deprecated''
| &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|}

==Cascading Style Sheets==

The use of style elements such as &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; for '''bold''' or &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; for ''italic'' is straight-forward, but it couples the presentation layer with the content layer. By using Cascading Style Sheets, the HTML author can decouple these two distinctly different parts so that a properly marked-up document may be rendered in various ways while the document itself remains unchanged. For example, if the publisher would like to change cited references in a document to appear as '''bold''' text as they were previously ''italic'', they simply need to update the style sheet and not go through each document changing &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; and vice-versa. Cascading Style Sheets also allow the reader to make these choices, overriding those of the publisher.

Continuing with the above example, let's say that the publisher has correctly marked up all their documents by surround references to cited material (such as the name of a book) in the documents with the &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; tag:

&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Great Gatsby&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

Then to make all cited references bold, one would put something like the following in the style sheet:

  cite { font-weight: bold; }

Later someone tells you that references really need to be italic. Before CSS, you would have to hunt through all your documents, changing the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; (but being careful *not* to change words that are in bold that are not cited references).

But with CSS, it's as simple as changing one line in the style sheet to

  cite { font-style: italic; }
&lt;noinclude&gt;
