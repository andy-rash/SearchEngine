      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Manpurse''' is known for confusing languages with soup ingredients, causing her to overseason conversation with far too many foreign loan words. Not only that, but, like the far better bird-in-the-bush, she totally abuses mixed metaphors and puns.

In all seriousness, she's working towards her English major and hopes to one day write and illustrate for a living.

She likes to cosplay and watch fan documentaries. Subcultural studies are her passion. She participated in NaNo 2004--and won!--and Geocaches on sunny days. She enjoys electronic music and video games--especially when the two are mixed. ''Gitaroo Man'' is teh GREATEST GAME EVAAR!!11 She also grooves to the smooth stylin's of ''Eccentric Opera''. 

(And she has a teeny, &lt;small&gt;itty-bitty&lt;/small&gt; anime and manga addiction, which she tries to confine to her room. The other day, the VHS fansubs escaped to the living room; now she's afraid her many tankouban are going to run amok in emulation.)

That's about it. For now.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to keep the juice and flavor ==

A food processor will beat too much heat into the meat (via friction), breaking down the fat which gives the juicy flavor. So, don't a food processor, use your hands.

In fact, your hands will add heat too, so to avoid destroying the flavor, use your hands as little as possible.

Mix all the other ingredients first, while you leave the ground beef in the fridge.

As the last step, bring out the meat. Mix it in. Pat out the burger shapes. Never, ever, squeeze.

While frying, refrain from touching, poking, lifting, and cutting the burger. The more you touch it, the more juice you will lose. Just turn it at half-time.

And, of course, season the meat before forming patties, not after. You don't want lumps of spices, and tasteless bits in between.

(I don't want to blatantly add to the recipe published, and I put this here in the discussion section, for peer review. When you guys have beaten my ideas into shape, move this section to the main page. / J Omark)

Ğírls ♥♣♠¥₩₮৳₪m²m³§‽„«»”ġžÌ−‿== My version of the recipe ==

I can't stress the importance of keeping the juice enough. I wrote the above section too.

That fat is essential for a juicy burger. You need ground beef with at least 20% fat. Look for the words &quot;ground chuck&quot;.

I try to touch my burgers as little as possible. I place chunks on a baking sheet with a wax paper, and pat them down a bit if they look like cubes, and add spices on the lumps, instead of in them.

Using my hands, I gently toss each lump from hand to hand to make them round. I then use a spatula, or something flat, to pat my burgers flat on the wax paper.

I put the stove on high, cook two minutes on one side, turn once, and cook two more minutes.

With the spatula, I move the burgers back on the baking plate, and roast them at 230°C/450°F on the roasting rack in the oven. The last two minuets, I lay a slice of cheddar scheese on top of each burger.

Medium-rare: 8-9 minutes. Medium: 10-11 minutes. Well-done: 12-13 minutes.

Some people would not call my 12-13 minute burgers well-done. Do 14-15 minutes for them, but tell them they are really missing out.

(Should this be considered a separate recipe? If people are interested, I could expand it with my ingredients and such. / J Omark)

== Add a section on pork ==

The article needs pork too. I can't stand beef burgers, and mix half pork and half beef.

== The concept of hamburgers is from Hamburg ==

Needs reason why Hamburgers are called such, considering they are not made from ham.

I think the etymology of the word belongs over at Wikipedia, which has an excellent section on hamburger history. As for where they came from, Wikipedia is my bet there too. / J Omark

== Grilled Meatloaf ==

This recipe is more a grilled meatloaf than a burger recipe. Only meatloafs and meatballs use eggs. Also remember, most professional chefs, including Bobby Flay, season the outside after the patties have been formed. This helps make a nice crust. [[User:Iwatchaltonbrown|''Iwatchaltonbrown'']]


== This recipe disappoints me ==

You know, when I found this recipe, I was disappointed. First of all, I never add eggs and/or breadcrumbs. When I want a burger, I don't want a meatloaf! My criteria for a burger that will amaze people is: 1. Turn often. I know everyone likes those grill marks, but if it's covered by a bun, you're not gonna see it. If you don't turn it often, unless you're doing it in a frying pan, oven, or a broiler, it could stick and burn.

2. Sprinkle the seasonings once the burgers are formed, and keep it simple. The burgers I don't like are the ones way overseasoned and don't let the beef flavor shine through. A lot of people think it's best to put the seasonings in the patties themselves, but it's really best to sprinkle the seasonings on the outside of the patties. This helps form that nice crust everyone knows and loves.

3. Mushy bread. Anyone who's ever put a hot juicy burger on a hot toasty bun knows that the meat juices turn the bread into mush before you eat it. I get around this by applying a layer of fat, such as butter, oil, mayonnaise, or cream cheese. Since they're mostly fat, they repel the water-based juices from turning bread into paste.

4. No salads. Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and bacon are all nice in a big salad bowl coated with vinegar and oil, but not on a burger. Like I said about seasoning, keep it simple. Let the beef shine through.

That's my criteria for great burgers. My burgers are always gone before I can eat one at the neighborhood barbecues. ''Alton Brown is awesome''
: You're not the only disappointed one. The recipe given strikes me as written by someone who hasn't really ever thought about the process, just doing what maybe their mom or dad taught them without thinking about maybe a better way existing. Simple seasoning on the outside and a nice sear on the pan is all you need for a fantastic-tasting burger. Not to say you can't do more, but it'd be nice to consider why first. But burgers and steaks are one of those areas where people can have very strong opinions, I guess. --[[Special:Contributions/216.133.112.234|216.133.112.234]] ([[User talk:216.133.112.234|discuss]]) 23:43, 23 June 2015 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:5aday_salad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical salad.]]

A '''salad''' is a food item generally served either prior to or after the main dish as a separate course, as a main course in itself, or as a side dish accompanying the main dish. The word “salad” comes from the French ''salade'' of the same meaning, from the Latin ''salata'', “salty.”

A salad is most often composed of a mixture of uncooked [[Cookbook:Vegetable | vegetables]], built up on a base of green leafy vegetables such as one or more [[Cookbook:Lettuce | lettuce]] varieties, [[Cookbook:Alfalfa | alfalfa sprouts]], [[Cookbook:Cabbage | cabbage]], [[Cookbook:Spinach | spinach]] or [[Cookbook:Arugula | arugula]] (rocket). This is often referred to as a “green salad.”

Other common vegetables in a green salad include [[Cookbook:Tomato | tomato]], [[Cookbook:Cucumber | cucumber]], [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper | peppers]], [[Cookbook:Mushroom | mushroom]], [[Cookbook:Onion | onion]], [[Cookbook:Spring Onion| spring onion]], [[Cookbook:Carrot | carrot]] and [[Cookbook:Radish | radish]]. 

Other food items such as [[Cookbook:Pasta | pasta]], [[Cookbook:Olive | olive]]s, cooked [[Cookbook:Potato | potato]]es, [[Cookbook:Rice | rice]], [[Cookbook:Quick garlic croutons|croutons]], [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry | meat and poultry]] (e.g. [[Cookbook:Bacon | bacon]], [[Cookbook:Chicken | chicken]]), [[Cookbook:Cheese | cheese]] or [[Cookbook:Seafood | seafood]] (e.g. [[Cookbook:Tuna | Tuna]],[[Cookbook:Crab | crab]]) are sometimes added to green salads.

In modern times, green salads, in particular, are often served 'undressed' and, instead, a separate [[Cookbook:Salad dressing|salad dressing]], often of the eater's choosing, will be served with, or alongside, the salad. 

In addition to green salads, there is a wide variety of classes of recipes types which are considered salads, including:

* [[W:Tabbouleh|Tabbouleh]], a Middle Eastern salad based on parsley, which may be as much as half re-hydrated cracked wheat or [[W:Couscous|couscous]], with lemon juice, diced tomato, a bit of olive oil, and salt.  It is served cold or approaching room temperature with no additional salad dressing.  
* Potato salads, macaroni salads, and Italian-esque pasta salads which are, perhaps 90% or more, composed of starch or grain ingredients, rather than fresh vegetables.  No additional salad dressing is required or served with these salads. Like green salads, they are ideally served cold or approaching room-temperature.
* Asian noodle salads, which include, for example, cold [[W:Cellophane noodles|cellophane noodles]] or [[W:Rice vermicelli|rice vermicelli]] and a variety of fresh diced or julienned vegetables with an appropriate dressing.  They are served cold or at room temperature. The noodles mentioned are fragile so care must be taken to only cook them briefly and immediately chill them quickly and thoroughly in cold water before attempting to use them in a salad.    
* Fruit salads, which are prepared with the same general thought as a green salad, however the simplest of these is composed of bite-sized cut fresh fruit, usually without greens of any sort.  There may be a very light dressing added to the salad prior to serving, perhaps consisting only of the amount of orange juice needed to lightly coat the ingredients.  From there, fruit salads can quickly branch out to be, in essence, desserts, such as [[Cookbook:Ambrosia Fruit Salad|Ambrosia]].
* Seafood, meat, poultry and egg salads, perhaps the most well known of which may be [[Cookbook:Tuna Salad|Tuna Salad]] and [[Cookbook:Chicken Salad|Chicken Salad]]. These salads are served cold or approaching room temperature. Notably, many of these salads can be made with simple ingredients, at home, and can be used to make a quick, cold sandwich for lunch.  For use in a more elegant setting such salads may be served on a bed of greens and can include more elegant ingredients, if desired.
* Slaws, which are typically composed primarily of finely chopped or julienned fresh vegetables of a sturdy sort (such as cabbages, carrots, broccoli, etc.), perhaps the most commonly known of which is [[Cookbook:Coleslaw|Coleslaw]].  Coleslaw, in particular, is primarily composed of cabbage coated in a simple dressing prepared and added by the cook before serving.  The dressing, in some areas of the world, is typically mayonnaise-based, but may also be vinegar-and-water based.  It is served cold to room temperature, without any additional dressing expected to be applied by the eater.
* Single vegetable and Vegetable medley salads. One example of a ‘single’ vegetable salad is [[Cookbook:English Pea Salad | English Pea Salad]] (which might also fit in the starch/grain salad category).  It is a simple salad composed primarily of English peas in a mayonnaise-based dressing, often with chopped hard boiled egg whites.  One example of a vegetable medley salad is [[Cookbook: Three Bean Confetti Salad|Three Bean Salad]], which, in a typical recipe, is composed primarily of green beans, wax beans, and kidney beans, all of which are often canned, in a somewhat clear, sweet, vinegar-based dressing.  Three bean salad, itself, is available canned in some areas.  These salads are, likewise, served cold to room temperature.
* Simple fresh pickles, for example [[Cookbook:Cucumber, Tomato, and Onion Salad|Cucumber, Tomato, and Onion Salad]], in which sliced or diced cucumber, tomato and onion are served anywhere from being merely dressed with, to literally floating in, a water and vinegar mixture, with, perhaps, a bit of black pepper, salt and herbs added.  It is served cold to room temperature, using a slotted spoon or is otherwise drained for serving. 

==Some Guidance in Preparing Salads, Especially Green Salads==
# The ingredients of a salad are expected to be cut by the cook to a size that will fit in the human mouth, such that no cutlery is required, except in a very few cases where the need for cutting by the eater is quite apparent and knives are provided.
# Salads, in general, are intended to be eaten using a fork or chopsticks, rather than by spoon or by hand.  Accordingly, medium-small, round ingredients, for example, cherry tomatoes, grapes, olives, and items of a similar size, should be cut at least in half, otherwise they will be difficult to lift with the intended utensils.
# All salads should be capable of being served cold, although there may be warm ingredients, such as warm dressings or warm meats added on top.
# As with all foods, the ingredients of a salad should be as fresh as possible, without blemish.

* Expand the argument of &lt;math&gt;sin&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;2\pi n!e=2\pi n!+\frac{2\pi n!}{2}+\frac{2\pi n!}{3!}+\frac{2\pi n!}{4!}+...&lt;/math&gt;

Since [[w:sine|sine]] is a [[w:periodic function|periodic function]], adding or subtracting multiples of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; can not change the result, thus the first few terms on the right hand side can be dropped (those first few where &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{z!}&lt;/math&gt; is a whole number thus n is greater or equal to z), and one is left with

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\sin(2\pi n!e)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\sin(\frac{2\pi}{n+1}+\frac{2\pi}{(n+1)(n+2)}+...).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)\approx x+...&lt;/math&gt; for small &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ([[w:Taylor expansion|Taylor expansion]] of [[w:sine|sine]]), the limit is 

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\sin(\frac{2\pi}{n+1})=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}n\frac{2\pi}{n+1}=2\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

A train goes around a circle, the first time with an average velocity of 100 km/h.  How fast should the train be when going around the circle again a second time, so that the average velocity over the two loops is 200 km/h?

==Hint==
* The obvious answer 300 km/h is wrong.
* Assume that the circle is 100 km long. How long does the train need for the distance (at 100 km/h)? How long is twice the distance, and how much time is left for the second loop?

The train would need to be infinitely fast.

The train is required to double its average velocity, so it was travel twice as far in the same amount of time. The first loop has already been travelled in a set time, and makes up half the distance, so the other half of the distance must to be completed in no time (so the train has travelled double the distance in the same amount of time). The train must travel infinitly fast to achieve this.

[[Category:Puzzles]]


*&lt;b&gt;Comments&lt;/b&gt;
Since this is a &quot;physics&quot; puzzle....velocity is vector.  A train going in a circle at ANY speed would have an average velocity of zero.

*The solution seems wrong to me.

Let t1 be the time taken for the first round and t2 for the second round. Let s1, s2 be the average speed and r the radius. Then

100 = 2*Pi*r/t1 =&gt; t1 = 2*Pi*r/100

200 = 4*Pi**r/(t1 + t2)

t2 = 1/100

s2 = 2*Pi*r/t2 =&gt; s2 = 200*pi*r

*Two additional comments
Yes, the average velocity (a vector) would be zero. The average speed (a scalar) would have to be infinite tho.

The calculations made in the Comment section above are wrong. If 100 = 2*Pi*r/t1, then 200 = 4*Pi*r/(t1 + t2) only if t2 is zero. Hence, t2 = 1/100 is not true.</text>

      <comment>I replaced the section about acidic marinades tenderizing with a better one.</comment>

'''Marinating''' involves letting a piece of food to stand, usually refrigerated, in a highly flavorful broth or sauce to add flavor. Many marinades have [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or some other acid.

Contrary to popular belief, acids in marinades will not tenderize meat! Any liquid that has a pH of 1 or lower will, but the only examples are stomach acid and battery acid, which are not very good to cook with. Most vinegars have a pH of 3, and the lowest pH liquid that is used for culinary use is citrus juice, which has a pH of 2, still not enough to tenderize. So those people out there that still believe that acids tenderize, go get some battery or stomach acid for your &quot;tenderizing&quot;.

If you're wondering what the difference between marinades and brines is, here it is: Brines are basically salty water with other flavorings added. Marinades usually don't contain the levels of salt that a brine does, and most marinades don't have added water. They also contain acids.

''You may also be interested in [[Cookbook:Butter]].''

'''Margarine''' is a butter substitute, invented in France in the year 1869 by a French chemist Hippolyte Megè-Mouriès. This was done in response to a challenge proposed by Emperor Louis Napoleon III to produce a low cost butter alternative just to keep both the soldiers and French people nourished. Hippolyte Mege-Mouries accepted the challenge and created recipe for oleomargarine, which would later be renamed as margarine and would eventually evolve into the lovely spread that we enjoy today. According to the US FDA regulations it must consist of 80% fat. Normally in the US, this is various partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and emulsifiers accounting for the fat portion, while the remaining 20% consists of primarily water. To make it taste like butter, butter flavor (which is not generally vegan unless otherwise specified) is added to give it a more butter-like taste, and salt is also generally added, as butter flavor has very little taste without salt.

Margarine works quite well in baking, although the taste and texture can't quite match butter. It is sold in stick or tub form. Margarine in stick form is better for cooking, because it can be easily measured and has melting properties similar to butter. However, margarine in a tub (soft margarine) is easier to spread - but often functions slightly more like oil when you are baking, due to the softer texture. 

It is important to note that a wide variety of products are considered margarine, while they are technically actually vegetable oil spreads and similar products with lower levels of oil. Even some stick products widely used and considered margarine are not technically margarine. As you reduce the fat content, it alters the properties, so use caution when baking with products that appear to be margarine but do not actually say that anywhere on the package. Soft spreads are particularly problematic, as some may have so little fat they are considered fat free.

Typical margarine has less saturated fat than [[cookbook:butter|butter]] but it has instead large amounts of potentially more harmful [[cookbook:trans fat|trans fat]] created during the hydrogenation process. It is important to note that while most margarine products available in the US today are produced using partially hydrogenated oils which contain trans-fats, margarine can be made using other vegetable oils that are not partially hydrogenated, resulting in a trans-fat free product. All margarine produced in Australia has been trans-fat free since 1996. Fully hydrogenated oils may also be used - when an oil is fully hydrogenated, no trans-fats remain.

Some margarines purport to be &quot;trans-fat free&quot; but still contain partially hydrogenated oils - this is often puzzling to people who know that partially hydrogenated oils always means the product contains trans-fat. In most jurisdictions, a certain level of transfats is allowed while calling the product &quot;trans-fat free&quot; - in the U.S. anything under 0.5 g is allowable while being reported as 0 g. This is quite disturbing, because while the FDA and USDA do not specify a maximum intake, the suggest intake at the press conference unveiling the new food pyramid was no more than 2 g per day. That means four servings of &quot;trans-fat free&quot; food could put you at your maximum intake of trans-fat for the day. This is particularly problematic in margarine where the serving size can be easily manipulated to obtain a value of less than 0.5 grams per serving.

'''Lemons''' are [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] from the tree ''Citrus limon''. They are cultivated primarily for their [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|juice]], though the pulp and rind are also used, primarily in cooking or [[Bartending/Cocktails|mixology]]. Lemon juice is about 5% citric acid, which gives lemons a sour taste.

Lemons were not cultivated in the West until after the Arab conquests. They were cultivated in Genoa in the mid-fifteenth century, and appeared in the Azores in 1494. Lemons were once used by the British navy to combat scurvy, as they provided a large amount of vitamin C. The British navy originally thought lemons were overripe limes which they resemble and their sailors became known as limeys, not lemonys.

[[Image:Lemon.jpg|right|thumb|Lemons]]
Both lemons and [[Cookbook:Lime|limes]] are regularly served as [[Cookbook:Lemonade|lemonade]] (natural lemon with [[Cookbook:Water|water]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]) or limeade, its equivalent, or as a garnish for drinks such as cola with a slice either inside or on the rim of the glass. Lemon juice is typically dripped onto battered [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]] dishes in restaurants in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and other countries—the acidic juice neutralizes the taste of amines in fish. Some like to eat lemons as fruit.

Lemon juice contains approximately 500 milligrams of [[Metabolomics/Nutrition/Vitamin C|vitamin C]] and 50 grams of [[Nutrition:Citric acid|citric acid]] per liter.

== Zest ==

'''Lemon zest''', when used as an ingredient, refers to shavings of the thin yellow outer skin of the lemon. The zest contains strong smelling oils which are used to flavor many baked goods. One can remove the zest from a lemon by using a small-holed [[Cookbook:Grater|grater]], a microplane, or by carefully cutting the zest with a knife then [[Cookbook:Mincing|mincing]] the results. Ideally, none of the white pith should be included with the zest. Be sure to scrub and wash the outer skin first to remove any remaining pesticide.

== Recipes ==
Lemon recipes can be found in [[:Category:Lemon recipes]].

Give Wikibooks back to the reader, not empty category titles.

==Too many categories, too few books==
Wikibooks has a big goal, but is evolving slowly (see the [[Wikibooks talk:Why move books?|Talk]] page). Many empty categories and open books are added, without any content. This is frustrating for a user clicking through the [[all bookshelves|bookshelves]].

* '''Bookshelves''' should contain '''books''', not categories.
* Categories can be '''added when necessary''', not before.
* Let us concentrate on '''finishing''' existing books, rather than creating books that nobody writes.

==Active and suggested books==
* Let us focus our work on maintaining good '''active books'''.
* Books that look like stubs and haven't been worked on for the last three months (check its history!) should be moved to '''suggested books'''.

==Let us clean up==
Help cleaning up Wikibooks:
* Move books to the [[all bookshelves|new bookshelves]] that should contain '''books''', not empty categories.
* Move active books to sections labelled '''Active Wikibooks'''.
* Move inactive books (books with modest content, no major change for three months) to '''Suggested Wikibooks''' (We don't delete anything, somebody might take up the book idea and fill it marvellously - then it can be moved back to &quot;active books&quot;).
* Update [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]:

__TOC__

The special character '' ' '' (called tic) has two meanings. Which of the two options is to be used is determined by context from the compiler.

== Character literal ==

As delimiter for characters literals:

 Plus : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Character := '+';

== Attribute delimiter ==

As a separator between an identifier and an [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]]:

 {{Ada/kw|for}} Day_Of_Month'{{Ada/attribute|Size}} {{Ada/kw|use}} 8;

== Operator ==

=== Standard Operations ===

==== Arithmetic Multiplication ====

The &quot;*&quot; operator is defined as arithmetic multiplication for all numeric types.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (Left, Right : T) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := 5.0 * 2.0;  {{Ada/--|A is now 10.0}}
 B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 5 * 2;      {{Ada/--|B is also 10}}

===== Working Example =====

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|operator_multiply.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator_Multiply {{Ada/kw|is}}
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := 5.0 * 2.0;  {{Ada/--|A is now 10.0}}
    B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 5 * 2;      {{Ada/--|B is also 10}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
    {{Ada/kw|package}} F_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO (Float);
    {{Ada/kw|package}} I_IO {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|new}}  Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO (Integer);
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put (&quot;A = &quot;);
    F_IO.Put (
       Item =&gt; A,
       Fore =&gt; 3,
       Aft  =&gt; 1,
       Exp  =&gt; 0);
    T_IO.New_Line;
    T_IO.Put (&quot;B = &quot;);
    I_IO.Put (
       Item  =&gt; B,
       Width =&gt; 3,
       Base  =&gt; 10);
    T_IO.New_Line;
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Operator_Multiply;

=== Common Non-Standard Operations ===

==== Character replication ====

A String is created where a single character is replicated n-times.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (Left : Natural; Right : Character) {{Ada/kw|return}} String;

In addition to standard Strings this [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is also defined for Bounded_String and Unbounded_String.

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 10 * 'X';  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 10 X}}

===== Working Example =====

The character replication [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is part of the ''Ada.Strings.Fixed'' [[Ada Programming/Packages|package]]. You need to {{Ada/kw|with}} and {{Ada/kw|use}} the package to make the [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] visible.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|operator_multiply_2.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator_Multiply_2 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Strings.Fixed;
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 10 * 'X';  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 10 X}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put_Line (&quot;A = &quot; &amp; A);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Operator_Multiply_2;

==== String replication ====

A String is created where a source string is replicated n-times.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;*&quot; (Left : Natural; Right : String) {{Ada/kw|return}} String;

In addition to standard fixed strings this [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is also defined for Bounded_String and Unbounded_String.

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 3 * &quot;Hello &quot;;  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 3 Hello}}

===== Working Example =====

The string replication [[Ada Programming/Operators|operator]] is part of the {{Ada/package|Ada.Strings.Fixed}} [[Ada Programming/Packages|package]]. You need to {{Ada/kw|with}} and {{Ada/kw|use}} the package to make the operator visible.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|operator_multiply_3.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Strings|Fixed}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Operator_Multiply_3 {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Strings.Fixed; 
 
    A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} String := 3 * &quot;Hello &quot;;  {{Ada/--|A is filled with 3 Hello.}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|package}} T_IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    T_IO.Put_Line (&quot;A = &quot; &amp; A);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Operator_Multiply_3;

== Parameter separation ==

This delimiter is used to separate actual parameters in [[Ada Programming/Subprograms|subprogram]] calls.

Also in variable declarations and formal parameters when grouped by type.

== Unit separation ==

This delimiter is used to separate units in a [[Ada Programming/Packages#Using packages|with or use clause]].

== Lists of values ==

The ',' delimiter is used to separate the values (or value associations) in aggregates.

== Operator ==

=== Standard Operations ===

==== Arithmetic Addition ====

The &quot;+&quot; operator is defined as arithmetic addition for all numeric types.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;+&quot; (Left, Right : T) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;

==== Plus sign ====

The &quot;+&quot; operator is defined as arithmetic plus sign for all numeric types.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;+&quot; (Right : T) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := +5.0;  {{Ada/--|A is now 5.0}}
 B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := +5;    {{Ada/--|B is also 5}}

=== Common Non-Standard Operations ===

==== Type Conversion ====

The operator plus sign is often used to create a type conversion operator:

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;+&quot; (Left : T1) {{Ada/kw|return}} T2;

==== Arithmetic Subtraction ====

The &quot;-&quot; operator is defined as arithmetic subtraction for all numeric types.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;-&quot; (Left, Right : T) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := 5.0 - 2.0;  {{Ada/--|A is now 3.0}}
 B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := 5 - 2;      {{Ada/--|B is also 3}}

==== Minus sign ====

The &quot;-&quot; unary operator is defined as arithmetic negative sign for all numeric types.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;-&quot; (Left : T) {{Ada/kw|return}} T;

===== Usage =====

 A : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float   := -5.0;
 B : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := -5;
 C : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Integer := -B;  {{Ada/--|C is now 5}}

__TOC__

A colon (&lt;tt&gt;':'&lt;/tt&gt;) is placed after an identifier, or list of identifiers,
for associating names with some entities, as follows. It occurs in declarations of objects,
or components of objects such as records and protected objects.
Similarly, a colon is to be found after the names of subprogram parameters and
after the names of generic formal objects.

A colon is also used after an identifier when declaring/renaming an
exception, or when declaring an exception choice parameter.
Also, it can be used when specifying a loop or block name.

'''Samphire''', or '''Rock Samphire''', is an edible wild plant found in coastal regions of mainland Britain.

Its fleshy, divided, aromatic leaves have long been regarded as a delicacy in Norfolk. It is now appearing as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]] in London restaurants or can be used a starter. The flavour is highly reminiscent of [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]] hence samphire is sometimes referred to as &quot;Poor Man's Asparagus.&quot; It is often sold by fishmongers when in season (from late spring).  Well worth trying, if you can find it.

Early crops can be eaten raw, but in a later harvest, the leaves will be tougher and slightly bitter. To prepare them for the table, trim away the hard root, wash the leaves and plunge them into boiling water for a few minutes. Serve with a mixture of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] and [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], or with butter alone. Diners pull the green flesh from a hard central stalk by dragging it through their teeth like an over-sized thread of floss.

The tender young shoots of the '''hop''', in season for a very short period in spring, can be lightly boiled and used as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]], starter, or accompanying vegetable. They have a flavour similar to [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Measurement''' is one of the fundamental concepts in experimental sciences, including physics. What is exactly meant by &quot;measurement&quot; is not precisely defined, and in fact it is one of the frontiers of research in quantum physics, where the act of measurement plays an important role in the commonly accepted interpretations of quantum mechanics. For our purposes, we can say measurement is the act of writing down a physical quantity, such as time or length, in objective terms.

Measurement is how one tests theories in experimental sciences as physics. In order to test a theory, one uses the theory to make predictions in a specific physical situation, and then perform an experiment, that is, a series of measurements, to see if the prediction is true. For example, as a consequence of Earth's gravity near its surface (Newtonian theory of gravity), we predict that, in a free fall, an object travels a distance ''D'' in time ''T'', so that D is proportional to &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then we devise an arrangement of equipment and a plan to test this prediction: we can drop a steel marble from height of 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, 1.0 m, 1.25 m and 1.5 m, and measure how long it takes to fall that distance using a stopwatch. If our measurements roughly follows the &lt;math&gt;D \propto T^2&lt;/math&gt; relationship, then this is a confirmation of the theory, in this particular situation.

== Physical Quantities ==
A '''physical quantity''' is anything that we use to describe a physical phenomenon quantitatively. We used a few examples of physical quantities earlier without discussing them further: distance, time, area, and mass. And we will make what we know of those quantities from intuition more precise here.

Some physical quantities can be defined from other quantities. Area and volume are good examples: when we have a square and a cube we can define their respective area and volume in terms of the length of the sides. Such quantitative definition also tells us how to calculate that particular physical quantity, given some other physical quantities.

Intuition tells us that we can't define ''all'' physical quantities in such manner, not without making a circular definition that will not be very useful to us. Physical quantities that cannot be defined in terms of other physical quantities are considered to be fundamental and we can define them only by stating how we measure them. Such definition is called ''operational definition''.

Distance, time, and mass are such fundamental physical quantities. These cannot be defined in terms of other measurable quantities (note that there is some arbitrariness in this choice: it is possible, although not practical, to choose area to be a fundamental physical quantity and define distance as length of the side of a square having certain area). In fact, how we choose to define them determines our unit system, which is a topic of next chapter.

*acceleration toward centre of rotation (centripetal force?) = (scalar velocity)^2/radius = omega^2 x radius
*Force toward centre of rotation = m x r x omega^2 or (mv^2)/r

== Torque ==

I also can't do formulas.  There isn't really anything about torque in the torque section!  The definition of 
torque = radius x force
should be included at least, right?
[[User:Dyknowsore|Dyknowsore]]


== Centripetal Acceleration ==

In regards to your discussion,

''&quot;acceleration toward centre of rotation (centripetal force?) = (scalar velocity)^2/radius = omega^2 x radius&quot;''

Keep in mind the formula you listed above states the ''magnitude'' of circular acceleration for uniform circular motion.  Given that we are dealing with uniform circular motion, we also know that acceleration will always be perpendicular to velocity; thus, we can assume its direction is always towards the center of the circle.  If acceleration wasn't perpendicular to the direction of velocity, then the acceleration would be contributing to the velocity in some sort of way.  Thus, the magnitude of velocity would not remain constant, thus no longer making it uniform circular motion.

Let:
A = Angle&lt;br&gt;
R = displacement vector&lt;br&gt;
V = velocity vector&lt;br&gt;
f = frequency &lt;br&gt;
w(omega) = 2piF = velocity/radius (v/r)&lt;br&gt;
t = time&lt;br&gt;
A = wt&lt;br&gt;
i = x-axis unit vector notation&lt;br&gt;
j = y-axis unit vector notation&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''1. Displacement vector R is equal to displacement in its x- and y-components.  Such that,'''R = R(CosA)i + R(SinA)j
&lt;br&gt;
-or-
&lt;br&gt;
'''2. Since A=wt,'''
R = R(Cos(wt))i + R(Sin(wt))j&lt;br&gt;
[substituting the angle for wt]&lt;br&gt;
Note: If you notice, the resultant vector R is equal to the radius at all points.  It is basically the radius sweeping out a portion of the circle.  In other words, it's only the angle (direction) that changes in uniform circular motion and the magnitude is always equal the radius.  For futher proof, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to show that the magnitude of R equals radius r.
&lt;br&gt;
'''3. Now deriving R, we produce velocity vector V.'''
&lt;br&gt;
V=R'=(Rw(-Cos(wt)))i + (Rw(Sin(wt)))j
&lt;br&gt;
'''4. Then we take the second derivative to get acceleration.'''
&lt;br&gt;
a(circular)=V'=-(Rw^2(Cos(wt)))i-(Rw^2(Sin(wt))j
&lt;br&gt;
'''Then factor the omegas...'''
&lt;br&gt;
a(circular)=-w^2(R(Cos(wt)))i+(R(Sin(wt))j
&lt;br&gt;
'''5. Now taking a look at the line above,'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a(circular)=-w^2'''(R(Cos(wt)))i+(R(Sin(wt))j'''
&lt;br&gt;
'''the bolded region is equal to vector R, so'''
&lt;br&gt;a(circular)=-w^2(R)
&lt;br&gt;
'''6. And since w=v/r'''
&lt;br&gt;a(circular)=-(v/r)^2(r)= -(v^2/r^2)(R)
&lt;br&gt;
But we cannot cancel out r, a scalar value, with a vector R.  We know that the magnitude of R is always going to equal r.  So we can take all of the components, square them individually, add them together, and square root them (according to the Pythagorean Theorem).  The value we produce is now in a format we are all used to:
&lt;br&gt;
|a(circular)|=(v^2/r^2)|R| = (v^2/r^2)r = v^2/r
&lt;br&gt;
'''Note:''' The negative sign in front of (v/r)^2 is removed during the squaring process.
&lt;br&gt;
'''And thus, we have proved:'''
&lt;br&gt;
|a(circular)| = v^2/r
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Centrifugal force==
The following statement from the article on 2/5/07 is incorrect:

::We know that an opposite force should exist for this centripetal force(by Newton's 3rd Law of Motion). This is the centrifugal force, which exists only if we study the body from a non-inertial frame of reference(an accelerating frame of reference,such as in circular motion).

The &quot;equal and opposite force&quot; is usually of the same nature as the centripetal force. For instance, for a uniform planetary orbit, the gravitational force of the planet on the sun is equal and opposite to the force of the sun on the planet. Because of such confusion, I don't think centrifugal force should be discussed in this module -- just mention (correctly) that it is an illusion in the non-inertial frame of reference, and maybe link to a more detailed discussion of the pseudo-force.[[User:Zolot|Zolot]] 20:55, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]]

This recipe for the deep fried Mars bar illustrates a typical procedure. The ingredients in the dish's variations may vary indefinitely, but the procedure will remain more or less the same. For authentic flavor, fry the treat in  [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] drippings rather than vegetable oil (it is worth noting the high saturated fat content this method of cooking involves).

==Ingredients==
*1 UK or Canadian [[w:Mars_Bar|Mars Bar]] or 1 US [[w:Milky_Way%20(confectionery)|Milky Way Bar]] 
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] 
* Enough oil to fill the pot or fryer you are using ([[Cookbook:Oil|oil or fat]] can be used as well as [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] for authenticity)

==Procedure==
* [[Cookbook:Chill|Chill]], but do not [[Cookbook:Freeze|freeze]], the Mars bar by leaving it in a fridge, or freezer, for a short while. 
* Mix the milk, flour and egg in a bowl. 
* [[Cookbook:Whisk|Whisk]] together to create a creamy [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]]. 
* Heat the oil. 
* Coat the Mars bar completely in batter.
* Lower into hot oil (around 350-375 degrees Fahrenheit, 175-190 Celsius) and fry until batter is golden brown. (Note: be careful to lower it gently; otherwise the batter may come off)
* Serve.
{{NOTE|Deep fried foods, if at all, should be consumed with moderation. Extreme deep fat and caloric food, like this recipe describes, require extreme moderation.}}

* Please [[why move books?|move books]] to existing bookshelves.
* Please add a new bookshelf only if necessary, and if it contains enough existing active books (e.g. splitting of a large bookshelf)
* Take out books of the list of active Wikibooks, if they look like stubs and nobody added anything in the last 3 months (check history). These can be moved to the corresponding &quot;Suggested Wikibooks&quot; section of the bookshelf.
* Somebody could move &quot;How-tos&quot; to &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; (creating a section &quot;How-tos&quot; there), since it only contains 4 active books so far.

It's a shame the shelf label says &quot;computer science&quot; and not &quot;computing science&quot;.

== Health Science ==

Medicine has its limits as a bookshelf when I noticed there were a few other books that were related to medical subjects but did not fall withing the purview of Medicine. Hence I went ahead and created a Health Science bookshelf. But after having done that I saw that many named books were yet to start. I thought I would let it stay for two reasons:
*not many medical people have been active though it happens to be the collaboration of the month
*by expanding the boundaries and including more disciplines I hope to encourage the participation of more people.
Your thoughts on this are welcome. I will try and keep only active books in the shelves. At the same time I feel that people feel more encouraged to contribute when they see a book already on the shelf. And by keeping only active books we eliminate the participation of these potential contributors.

== Redirect to [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]]? ==
This is redundant with [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]] and is only being included on [[Wikibooks:All Books]]. Does anyone have any concerns with redirecting this page? --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:35, 13 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Too Slow Compared to What? ==
This sounds good, though the tone is a little bit pessimistic: I don't think that wikibooks is &quot;evolving too slowly&quot;. Hop on over to sourceforge to see a &quot;wasteland&quot; of open source projects that have been started, but never went anywhere. Or look at how long it took before Mozilla was worth using. That's part of the nature of an open source project: you need a dedicated team, or one truly dedicated individual, to do a bulk amount of work before &quot;the community&quot; can really make any thoughtful contributions to that.

Exceptions appear to be the cookbook, in which wikibookians are eager to add on an additional recipe. There is little connection from one recipe to the next. This is the wikipedia model: starting with little stubs, more can be added on communally, resulting in something great.

Textbooks, just like computer programs, however, require more coordination. It is not helpful to expect wikibooks to perform like the wikipedia; the required development models are different. As I've learned from the Algorithms and Data Structures books: (1) writing a quality textbook, even a slim one, is very time consuming (you need to verify that what you are saying is true, and even formatting what to say, after you know what you want to say, can take a long time); (2) the model seems to be more about 2-4 people working on a book, and then everyone else primarily contributing not as authors, but as readers and field testers who find errors and ask for clarification.

However, I approve of the idea of moving content to &quot;suggested&quot; books, so as not to be a repository for table-of-contents-without-books. Just as in the open-source world, there are plenty of people eager to offer ideas, but reluctant to dedicate even five hours a week for a period of six months. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:33, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:I didn't want to sound too pessimistic, but I think a healthy cleaning-up system might help to better focus work on good books. Keeping the bookshelves &quot;tidy&quot; (I'm not saying to throw away anything, just to put better or active work to more prominent position) is also not an easy work. The small images picturing the stages of a book are a very good beginning, but the problem is, they are not updated regularily.
:I will suggest a template, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{checked|25%|Jan 10 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (that doesn't exist yet), which will picture one of the 4 development stage squares, plus a tiny date next to it when the book was last checked. Anyone can then update this information, and one can easily see which books have not been checked for a long time, check those books, and move them accordingly. 
:Also, there should be simple and easy standardized guidelines for setting &quot;development stages&quot;. The 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% is a good start - one could e.g. count how many sections in the book are really filled (not only with stubs).
:I will work this out later, but anybody is invited here to discuss this procedure. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 11:53, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::To follow the OSS metaphor, I guess I could see the cleaning-up as a way to set the scope of the project: Initially dozens of requests for features (i.e., books) might come in, and many of them should instead be saved &quot;for version 2.0&quot;. We should be mindful that some books would move in periodic stages. For example, my school is on a quarter system, and the breaks between each quarter is when I have the most time to write new sections: I could still be actively thinking and planning a book I might not have edited for over two months. I'm sure other people's schedules would also be periodic.

::Perhaps we can start with a template that says &quot;this book has been flagged as a suggested book&quot; and state that if the notice is up for more than a month then the book would get moved. (Q1: Is it just the book gets moved off of the bookshelf, and the module itself stays put?) (Q2: When the wikibooks site says &quot;there are X many books being worked on&quot; is that the number of books listed on the shelves, or is that counting all modules, in which case a 10 module book would be counted as 10 books?)

::One other side note: since my books are still in the early stages it's actually somewhat nice there isn't high traffic and too many edits yet-- the result would be cluttered and incoherent. (At least with programs they cannot run when too many things are slapped on, but the only way to &quot;run&quot; a book is to read it cover to cover.) To address this problem in the future I actually created a third &quot;advanced&quot; book as a place to hold random content for the people who contributed something worth reading, but were mistaken in thinking that adding an article to a book is just like adding an article to the wikipedia. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:09, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:::I implemented new stage markers now. Please look at [[Help:Development stages|Development stages]] for details!
:::To answer your questions: I think the flag is a very good idea. I might implement it later. Also, the &quot;three months&quot; period can be discussed or extended. No hurry at all.
:::your Q1: Only the links (books) within [[All bookshelves]] move around. No book gets deleted or renamed or anything.
:::your Q2: Unfortunately, it lists all the modules, stub or not, so you never know how many quality books there are... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 16:16, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== page move ==

I moved this into the Wikibooks name space because this isn't content designed for users, but for editors and writers.  I'll go through and fix any double redirects I just made. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:31, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''kill''' is a unix command used to send unix signals to running processus. By default it will try to send the TERM signal which will ask the process to stop it works hence the name ''kill''.

Available signals are available from the kill command:

 $ kill -l
  1) SIGHUP       2) SIGINT       3) SIGQUIT      4) SIGILL
  5) SIGTRAP      6) SIGABRT      7) SIGBUS       8) SIGFPE

You can send a given signal to all process having a given name or only to one process giving its PID. For example if you want to send signal SIGHUP to process 23154 :
 kill -s SIGHUP 23154
If you want to send the same signal to all process named Apache :
 kill -s SIGHUP Apache

You can also groups pid, the two commands above can be merged in:
 kill -s SIGHUP 23154 Apache


Issuing signals, you can control your system a bit more. Say you have an ongoing script, running under PID 12345, which use a lot of your cpu and you would like to &quot;pause&quot; it while doing something else. You can issue your process the STOP signal:

 kill -s STOP 12345

To later resume it, you will ask the process to CONTinue its work:

 kill -s CONT 12345

Example:

We will start a simple process (sleep) in the background (&amp;). The sleep process does nothing but waiting for the given number of seconds (in our case 360 seconds or 6 minutes):
 $ sleep 360 &amp;
 [1] 7551
 $
The shell give us back the PID of the process (7551). Let it run a bit then check its status with the [[ps]] command:

 $ ps -o fname,pid,stat,etime
 COMMAND    PID STAT     ELAPSED
 bash      7425 Ss         04:47
 sleep     7551 S          00:58
 ps        7600 R+   49710-06:27:47
 $

Now we ask our process to pause its work:
 $  kill -s STOP 7551

Press enter to update your output buffer and the shell give you the confirmation:
 $
 [1]+  Stopped                 sleep 360
 $

Sometime later, our process is still stopped:
 $ ps -o fname,pid,stat,etime
 COMMAND    PID STAT     ELAPSED
 bash      7425 Ss         10:37
 sleep     7551 T          06:05
 ps        7719 R+   49710-06:27:47
 $
You can notice that 6 minutes elapsed since the start although the process should have ended after 5 minutes (remember we used &quot;sleep 360&quot;).

Now we want to tell the process to continue its operation:
 $ kill -s CONT 7551

Update your buffer by pressing enter:
 $
 [1]+  Done                    sleep 360
 $

Blam the process is finished. When you issued the CONT signal the process resumed and checked the current time, as more than 360 seconds have been elapsed it ended itself.

Call sheets give the broad and essential details of a day's shooting.  Typically, you would send a call sheet out to every member of the cast and crew as early as possible.  During production, this usually means the night before!

==What a Call Sheet contains==

* Project title
* Date
* Day out of days (e.g. &quot;day 3 of a 5 day shoot&quot;)
* Location(s) for the day
* Parking details
* Contact details for (at least) the principal members of the crew (e.g. Producer, Production Manager, 1st AD, Location Manager)
* Recommended clothing (e.g. &quot;wear black&quot; or &quot;wear full waterproofing&quot;)
* Scenes to be shot for the day
* Broad schedule (the call sheet doesn't usually include the shot-by-shot schedule)
** Call times
** Makeup and wardrobe times
** Scenes
** Travel
** Breaks
** Estimated wrap time
* Weather forecast
* Details of the local hospital
* Details of the local police
* Equipment details
* Hire company details

      <text xml:space="preserve">Cryptography has a long and colorful history from Caesar's encryption in first century BC to the 20th century. 

== Caesar Cipher ==
One of the most basic methods of encryption is the use of Caesar Ciphers. It simply consist in shifting the alphabet over a few characters and matching up the letters.

== Classical cryptography ==
This makes transposition and substituting the two major principles in classical cryptography.

== Transposition ciphers ==
Lets look first at transposition, which is the changing in the position of the letters in the message such as a simple writing backwards
     Plaintext: THE PANEL IN THE WALL MOVES
     Encrypted: EHT LENAP NI EHT LLAW SEVOM

or as in a more complex transposition such as:
   
     THEPAN    
     ELINTH     
     EWALLM
     OVESAA        

then take the columns:

     TEEO HLWV EIAE PNLS ATLA NHMA

''(the extra letters are called space fillers)''
The idea in transposition is NOT to randomize it but to transform it to something that is not recognizable with a reversible algorithm (an algorithm is just a procedure, reversible so your correspondent can read the message).

We discuss transposition ciphers in much more detail in a later chapter, [[Cryptography/Transposition ciphers|Cryptography/Transposition ciphers]].

== Substitution ciphers ==

The second most important pin cha principle is substitution. That is, substituting a Symbol for a letter of your plaintext (or word or even sentence). Slang even can sometimes be a form of cipher (the symbols replacing your plaintext), ever wonder why your parents never understood you?
Slang, though, is not something you would want to store a secret in for a long time. In WWII, there were Navajo CodeTalkers who passed along info from unit to unit. From what I hear (someone verify this) the Navajo language was a very exclusive almost unknown and unwritten language. So the Japanese were not able to decipher it. 

Even though this is a very loose example of substitution, whatever works works.
The classical example of a substitution cipher is a shifted alphabet cipher

    Alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
      Cipher: BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA
     Cipher2: CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZAB
         etc...

Example:(using cipher 2)
           Plaintext: THE PANEL IN THE WALL MOVES
           Encrypted: VJG RCPGN KP VJG YCNN OQXGU

If this is the first time you've seen this it may seem like a rather secure cipher, but it's not. In fact this by itself is very insecure. For a time in the 1500-1600's this was the most secure (mainly because there were many people who were illiterate) but a man (old what's his name) in the 18th century discovered a way to crack (find the hidden message) of every cipher of this type he discovered frequency analysis. 

We discuss substitution ciphers in much more detail in a later chapter, [[Cryptography/Substitution cipher|Cryptography/Substitution cipher]]s.

== Frequency Analysis ==

In the shifted alphabet cipher or any simple randomized cipher, the same letter in the cipher replaces each of the same ones in your message (e.g. 'A' replaces all 'D's in the plaintext, etc.). The weakness is that English uses certain letters more than any other letter in the alphabet. 'E' is the most common, etc. Here's an exercise count all of each letter in this article. You'll find that in the previous sentence there are 2 'H's,7 'E's, 3 'R's, 3 'S's, etc. By far 'E' is the most common letter; here are the other frequencies [Frequency tables|http://rinkworks.com/words/letterfreq.shtml]. Basically you experiment with replacing different symbols with letters (the most common with 'E', etc.).

       Encrypted: VJG TCKP KP URCKP

First look for short words with limited choices of words, such as 'KP' this may be at, in, to, or, by, etc. Let us select in. Replace 'K' with 'I' and 'P' with 'N'.

       Encrypted: VJG TC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; URC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt;

Next select VJG this is most likely the (since the huge frequency of 'the' in a normal sentence, check a couple of the preceding sentences).

       Encrypted: &lt;u&gt;THE&lt;/u&gt; TC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt; URC&lt;u&gt;IN&lt;/u&gt;

generally this in much easier in long messages
the plaintext is 'THE RAIN IN SPAIN'

We discuss many different ways to &quot;attack&quot;, &quot;break&quot;, and &quot;solve&quot; encrypted messages in a later section of this book,
&quot;Part III: Cryptanalysis&quot;,
which includes a much more detailed section on [[Cryptography/Frequency analysis|Cryptography/Frequency analysis]].


== Combining transposition and substitution ==

A more secure encryption is a transposed substitution cipher.

Take the above message in encrypted form
      
       Encrypted:VJG RCPGN KP VJG YCNN OQXGU

now spiral transpose it

           VJGRC
           NNOQP
           CAAXG
           YUNGN
           GJVPK

The message starts in the upper right corner and spirals to the center (again the AA is a filler)
Now take the columns:

        VNCYG JNAUJ GOANV RQXGP CPGNK

Now this is more resistant to Frequency analysis, see what we did before that started recognizable patterns results in:

        TNCYE HNAUH EOANT RQXEN CNENK

A problem for people who crack codes.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two types of images that can be formed: Real and virtual.

==Real images==
Real images are images that are formed at the same side as the either the reflected or transmitted rays. Rays actually passed through the points in the image and are being picked up by your eyes.  As a result they can be focused on to a projection screen. By convention, the position of a real image is greater than zero.

==Virtual images==
Virtual images are those that appear at the same side as the incident rays. Rays did not actually pass through the image but you can virtually trace the rays back to the location of the image as if the rays originated from there. Any mirror or lens can produce a virtual image. Virtual images are described by a negative image location.

In the USA, the term '''pickles''' refers specifically to [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]]. These are known as gherkins (or, less formally, &quot;wallies&quot;) in the United Kingdom. (In the US, gherkins are small pickles.) They may be produced by fermentation or by simply treating cucumbers with [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]. Pickles are often flavored with [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]] and [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]. They are generally used to add piquancy to a main meal, and on or with [[Cookbook:Hamburger|hamburgers]] and other types of sandwiches.

One popular type of pickle that comes from Jewish cuisine is the ''kosher pickle.'' The issue with kosher dietary rules comes from the usage of polysorbates that come from animals. (See [[Judaism/Jewish Cooking|Jewish Cooking]] for details.) Additionally, a kosher pickle has a zesty, [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] brine, made with kosher salt.
Outside of the USA, the term &quot;pickle&quot; sometimes refers to any sort of pickled food. These can range from pickled [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]] to complex pickles produced for the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] market.  Even meats and fish can be pickled.

If a recipe calls for &quot;pickles&quot;, it's the US usage; if it is any other kind of pickle, it should be more specific (i.e., pickled [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]], pickled [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|pepper]], etc.)</text>

      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Greeting someone ==

There is a simple standard formula to greet someone:
:''Xin chao&quot;

However, it is much more elegant to address the person you are talking to in some way. Hence, a formula like '''Chào ông!''' is much better. In this phrase, ''ông'' is used to address respectable men, usually older than oneself. Instead of ''ông'', the following words can be used to address persons with different status and age in relation to the speaker:

{| align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse&quot;
| cụ (俱) || people who are much older than oneself, or generally very old
|-
| bà (婆) || elderly ladies, or ladies who are older than oneself
|-
| ông (翁) || elderly men, or men who are older than oneself
|-
| chú (注) || uncle, or if they are older than you and younger than your parents
|-
| cô (姑) || aunt, or if they are older than you and younger than your parents
|-
| chị (姊) || young ladies, or ladies who are in the same age as oneself
|-
| anh (英) || young men, or men who are in the same age as oneself
|-
| em (㛪) || younger persons, children
|-
| thầy (偨 ) || the teacher (if he is a man)
|-
| cô (姑) || the teacher (if she is a woman)
|-
|}

When addressing more than one person, add '''các''' before the noun, e.g. '''Chào các anh!'''

The Vietnamese counterpart for ''How are you?'' is '''Ông có khỏe không?''' Again, here the ''ông'' has to be replaced by the necessary noun from the table, depending on the person addressed. Possible answers are:

;Cám ơn, tôi khỏe.
:Thanks, I am fine.
;Cám ơn, tôi bình thường.
:Thanks, I am normal.
;Tôi vẫn khỏe.
:I am still fine.
;Tôi cũng khỏe.
:I am also fine.

The Vietnamese equivalent to ''Good bye!'' is either '''Tạm biệt!''' or simply '''Chào ông!'''

[[Cookbook:Soybean|Soy bean]] curd, producing in various degrees of firmness. Used in stir fry, [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]]s, and other Asian cuisine. '''Tofu''' (also called '''bean curd''' in English and '''dòufu''' in Mandarin Chinese) is a food made by coagulating [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] with calcium sulfate (gypsum), nigari (a [[Cookbook:Salt|sea-salt]] derived compound rich in magnesium chloride), or other agents (homemade tofu is often curdled using epsom salts, that is, magnesium sulphate) and then pressing into blocks, similar to the way [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] is made from [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]].

Tofu is typically used to replace [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] and is an especially important source of [[:w:protein|protein]] for [[:Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]]. The substance itself has little to no taste, but will absorb flavors of other foods.

[[Image:WasabiOnOroshigane.jpg|thumb|right|Wasabi]]
Also known as '''[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] [[Cookbook:Horseradish|horseradish]]''' (''Wasabia japonica''), this green root is prepared by being ground, dried, and made into a paste. It is used in Japanese cooking and is often served with [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]].

Since the plant is difficult to grow, most wasabi sold outside of Japan is just European horseradish with green coloring added.

Wasabi (Japanese: 山葵 or 和佐比; scientific name Wasabia japonica (syn. Cochlearia wasabi, Eutrema japonica)) is a member of the cabbage family. Commonly known as Japanese horseradish, it grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan. It is green and has an extremely strong flavor. Its hotness is different from [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili pepper]], which burns the tongue; wasabi's strong sensations shoot up one's sinus cavity instead.

The historical purpose for wasabi is supposedly to kill the bacteria in the raw fish often used in sushi.

==BOMBING==
In the sentence concerning Vietnam: &quot;Bombing began 1967&quot;  and  By 1968 more bombs were dropped than in WWII.  I recall these phrases from that era, and consider them propaganda. 

I don't know whether you, the editor, should elaborate or not; considering the brevity of the article.  There is a vast difference between dive bombing and carpet bombing.  Most &quot;official&quot; data was secret or government propaganda. The Media was flagrantly abusive.   The fact is that limited precision dive bombing began over N. Vietnam in 1965.  Carpet bombing by B-52s (the monkey killers) was limited to bombing Jungle-Mountain infiltration trails in N. Vietnam and Laos.  It was primarily an image/morale exercise using up ship-loads (many ships) of bombs that did not fall on villages, towns or cities.  They made match-sticks out of jungle. Really impressive when photographed from the air for TV. In this regard the reference to WWII is egregiously deceptive.

(Another matter, entirely, were Nixon's Christmas 1972 B-52 raids on downtown Hanoi.  I recall 600 sorties, eleven days, that ended the war))

And perhaps you can advise me of the intended difference wetween Wikipedia and Wikibooks?  Truely, I don't know.---plumalley</text>

'''Turmeric''', or yellow ginger, is a spice similar to ginger in appearance, but it has a totally different taste, and it gives its characteristic yellow color to the food.

Turmeric is often used as a low-cost substitute for [[Cookbook:Saffron|saffron]]. The color is similar, but the taste is very different.

Turmeric, along with [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]], gives [[Cookbook:Pickle|pickles]] their characteristic taste.

Be careful using Turmeric, as it can overpower a dish easily.

== Rules ==
In Q.W. (Question Word) the first rule is that:

*The Q.W. takes the first position. Like → (1) Fragewörter → (2) Verb → (3) Subjekt → (4) Alles andere (Everything else) → (5) ? (Fragezeichen)

::So, The basic word order in a German sentence is the same as in English: subject — verb — object(s).

*The second most important rule is that, all '''objects (objekts)''' take Akkusative and all ''subjects (subjekts), take Nominativ artikle.

:*'''Few Examples:'''

*Der Junge spielt Fußball. (Subjekt: der Junge, Verb: spielt, Objekt: Fußball.)
:The boy plays football. (Subject: the boy, verb: plays, object: football.)

To change the English sentence ''The boy plays football.'' into a question, we insert the auxiliary verb ''does'' before ''boy'', change ''plays'' to the infinitive form ''play'' and place a question mark at the end: ''Does the boy play football?''

The process is very similar in German. However, we don't need an auxiliary verb in German; thus, we just '''switch the whole verb with the subject''', ending up with: 

*Spielt der Junge Fußball?
: Does the boy play football?

In German, there are two basic ways of forming a question. The first is the method described above. In addition to this, you can use a question word (an interrogative adverb); for example, ''how'' — ''wie'' as in ''How are you?'' — ''Wie geht's?''

Other question words are summarized in the following table.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; {{German table|Vocabulary|Questions|Fragen|199|2}}
!English||German
|-
| who?||wer? 
|- 
| what?||was?
|-
| where?||wo?
|-
| when?||wann?
|-
| why?||warum?
|-
| how?||wie?
|}

*In order to understand better, we will list all of the '''Question Words''' that are in language German.

The question ''Wie heißt ...?'' literally translates to ''How is ... called?'' meaning ''What is ... called?''. This is why the German question does not contain ''what'' — ''was''. 

A question word comes first in a sentence; thus, the word order is: question word — verb — subject — object(s). For example:

*Warum spielt der Junge Fußball? 
:Why does the boy play football?

Note that in German, '''the verb almost always comes second in the sentence''', except in the case of a question as described above. '''The subject is almost always next to the verb, if not in front of it then following it.''' For example:

*Der Junge spielt nicht Fußball. 
:The boy is not playing football.
*Heute spielt der Junge Fußball. 
:Today, the boy plays football.

## When do we have German?
## What is the boy's name?
## Where are you?
## What is the woman's name?
## Why is your name George?

# Explain in your own words why the translation of ''What is your name?'' — ''Wie heißen Sie?'' contains ''how'' — ''wie'' instead of ''what'' — ''was''.
# Provide questions (in German) for the following answers.

## Wann haben wir Deutsch?
## Wie heißt der Junge?
## Wo bist du? / Wo sind Sie?
## Wie heißt die Frau?
## Warum heißt du George?

# In German, the question is changed from ''What are you called?'' to ''How are you called?'' (Note: This is not the only time ''wie'' replaces ''was''. For example, when asking to repeat something someone said, Germans usually say ''Wie bitte?'' (or just: ''Bitte?'') instead of ''Was?'' In fact, the latter is considered impolite.)
# German questions:
## Wie heißen Sie?
## Wie heißt es?
## Wie heißt sie?
## Wie heißt du? / Wie heißen Sie?

This is Jeffrey A. Meunier's WikiBooks user page.  My full home page can be gviewed here: http://jeffmeunier.wikispaces.com/

== Experience ==

I have a B.S. in CSE (computer science and engineering) and M.S. in CS (computer science).  I'm working on my Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Connecticut.

I have taught a wide variety of courses, and have recently become interested in teaching programming languages.

== Interests ==

Computer-related:

* languages and language implementation
* virtual machines and other computational models
* architecture and assembly language
* networked and distributed computing
* autonomous mobile agents
* constraint programming

== Travel ==

===Germany===
I spent time in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and in Regensburg. I lived in the Ludwig-Thomas Studentwohnneim at the FH Regensburg and worked at Siemens.

===Thailand===
My wife and I lived in Mahasarakham and taught at the university there. She taught English in the department of Western Languages, and I taught computer science in the department of Informatics.

== To do ==
; [[Creating a Virtual Machine]]

; [[Programming Vintage Notebook Computers]]
: Notebooks are more practical than general microcomputers because they are self-contained, easily programmable, and have a long battery life.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==IR==
IR distance sensors are one of the most used distance sensors. They fall in 3 categories:

===Reflection===
(Short range. Not more than 2 - 3cm)
[[Image:IR_reflection_sensor.png|thumb|IR reflection sensor]]
This type uses an IR-LED and IR-diode (or phototransistor). When an object is close to the sensor it reflects the light emitted by the LED to the IR-diode. Using modulated IR-light (A) and filtering (B) the input signal of the IR-diode leads to better results as this blocks (much of) other IR-light.
There are ICs that contain both a modulator, IR-diode and filter-circuit.

===Triangulation===
(Larger range. Around 10 - 30cm)
e.g. Sharp has a family of sensors that use this principle for measuring distance. They consist of an IR-LED and an IR-sensitive LDR strip. Combined with built-in optical lenses, the reflected beam's position on the LDR depends on how far the object is.


===line detecting sensor===

Similar setup as the reflection IR-sensor, but aimed downwards to detect lines on the ground. This sensor makes use of the difference in reflection between a white background and a black line.

More advanced robots use multiple line detection sensors to follow a line more cleanly.

==Ultrasonic==
Ultrasonic distance sensors use sound to measure distance. These sensors emit an ultrasonic pulse train and then measure the time until the pulse is reflected. Since the speed of sound is (more or less; excluding temperature and wind) constant in air (approx. 344m/s) it is easy to calculate the distance to the reflecting object.
These are used for distance ranging from several centimeters up to a few meters.

==Laser==
Laser based distance sensors use the same principle as ultrasonic distance sensors, but use light instead of sound. These sensors are only useful for longer distances. (At least several meters.)

From [[Talk:How To Assemble A Desktop PC]], it sounds like you are interested in building a computer &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;.

What do you think about starting a wikibook to talk about that?
Or [http://tripu.triphoenix.de/ does one already exist]?

Have you seen
[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Relay/ Harry Porter's Relay Computer]
?
It runs at 5 Hz.
(Not 5 GHz or 5 MHz or 5 KHz).
Five cycles per second.

Apparently I'm not the only one crazy enough to think it would be cool to
[http://www.holmea.demon.co.uk/Mk1/Architecture.htm build a CPU out of TTL chips].

I also plan to build something much smaller -- something similar to
[http://img.cmpnet.com/edtn/ccellar/e023pdf1.pdf &quot;Picaro: A Stamp-like Interpreted Controller&quot;]
by Tom Napier.
I hope to end up with something that:
* can run a standard instruction set (perhaps MMIX or 6502 or 8086 or F21)
* the entire CPU + external memory + sensors fits in a small model rocket
** too narrow for a standard 40-pin DIP IC that the original versions of those chips came in
** too narrow for the &quot;standard&quot; memory chips the original versions of those ICs require (but not too narrow for the serial memory chips I plan to use).
* also fits a medical diagnosis tool I'm working on.

''Development stages'' are little indicators placed next to a link to a book or a page to indicate its progress, as reviewed at a certain date. They also are used on a book's main page to indicate the book's progress as a whole.  They help readers identify comprehensive content, while drawing editors' attention to pages needing work.
{{stages}}


{| cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
| style=&quot;width:50%; padding-right:10px;&quot;|
== Quart stages ==
There are two templates that create the quart stages indicators: {{tlx|stage}} and {{tlx|stage short}}. They take the development stage as their first argument and a date as an optional second:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
!  Markup || Displays as
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;[[Main Page]] {{stage|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|[[Main Page]] {{stage|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;[[Main Page]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|[[Main Page]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 11, 2005}}
|}
If the second parameter is not included in the {{tlx|stage}} template the date will not be displayed.
== Deci-stages ==
The {{tlx|decistage}} template creates an indicator with ten stages:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
! Markup || Displays as
|-
|&lt;pre&gt;[[Main Page]] {{decistage|10|Jan 11, 2005}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|[[Main Page]] {{decistage|10|Jan 11, 2005}}
|}
|}

==Book completion status==
Readers browsing through a certain subject area or classification often want to view books that are complete or closer to completion.  In order to indicate the level of completion for a book, add {{tlx|status|&lt;PROGRESS&gt;}} to a book's main page, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;PROGRESS&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is one of the following: &lt;code&gt;0%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;25%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;50%&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;75%&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;100%&lt;/code&gt;.  Don't abuse this to try to make your book more popular; misleading readers will cause them to leave in frustration.
{{completion status}}

==TODO list==
Sometimes it's very hard to figure out what should be added in one page rather than in another.  If you evaluate a page to an incomplete stage, you know what is missing.  So don't forget to fill a TODO list.  Add {{tlx|Todo|&lt;MISSING&gt;}} to the page, where &lt;code&gt;&lt;MISSING&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a text describing what should be added to make the page complete.

      <text xml:space="preserve">To deal with American business persons it is a good idea to understand something about American sports. Many businessmen were athletes in high school and college and have had their way of thinking formed by team sports.  It is important to know a little about the most popular sports: football (not soccer), basketball, baseball, golf, and even hockey in some areas.

Sports metaphors and jargon permeate even polite speech.  Below are some common expressions:a

* &quot;Run with it&quot; or &quot;Take the ball and run with it&quot;
* &quot;Homerun&quot;, &quot;That's a homerun&quot;, or &quot;Hit a homerun&quot;
* &quot;Punt&quot;, &quot;It's time to punt&quot;, &quot;I think we'll have to punt&quot;, or &quot;We punted&quot;
* &quot;Hole in one&quot; or &quot;You hit a hole in one&quot;
* &quot;Hail Mary&quot; or &quot;Throw a Hail Mary&quot;
* &quot;Slam dunk&quot; or &quot;It was a slam dunk&quot;

It is expected that conversational partners will understand these.  Only those speakers who reflect on the cultural derivation of these expressions will modify their speech for those who do not share similar cultural backgrounds.  However, the savvy listener can usually comprehend the meaning of these expressions when heard in context of a discussion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a virtual talk between two people. Imagine that there is a visitor called Mark coming from a forign country to visit his friend Ahmed. They are at the airport, and meeting for the first time. Mark has learnt Arabic (but not very well) and wants to talk to Ahmed in Arabic. This is what they say:
&lt;!-- His ''friend'' AND metting for the first time?? You can explain better ;-)
Could you also add a phonetic transcription of the conversation to plain english? It would also be convenient if it was right below each line of the conversation, ''Italicised'', for example  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Changed the 2nd sentence so that &quot; a country called&quot; is not there --&gt;
&lt;!-- Added transliteration, transliteration notes when a letter is capital it is usually written as a lower case with a dot under it when it is transliterated in Hans Wehr dictionary--&gt;

== Conversation with vowels indicated ==
'''Mark:''' &lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;مارْك: أَهْلاً'''&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would recommend that the title be changed to &quot;Game Engine Design and Programming&quot; since &quot;Game Design&quot; is a completely different topic more akin to level design, etc. [[User:Random|Random]]

Game Design AND Programming is entirely too much material to bite off in one 'book' unless it is going to be a broad survey.  There doesn't seem to be much activity going on here so if nobody objects I'll likely re-structure this considerably. [[User:Geared|Geared]] 23:44, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

Game Design AND Programming is indeed quite a task...perhaps this article should be either merged with &quot;Video Game Design&quot;, and then split into more sections, or there should be some discussion as to which level of abstraction each article should approach the subject matter on...Both articles contain sections on &quot;Input&quot;, which is quite specific, but (until a moment ago) neither contained a section on &quot;Level Design&quot;. Perhaps one article should cover the creative process, marketing, etc., while the other contain more technical specifics, such as program structure, hardware considerations, or commonly used algorithms. Either way, some level of collaboration seems necessary between these two articles. [[User:DarkPhoenix32|DarkPhoenix32]] 05:49, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

I believe as there is another book on Design, we should remove the &quot;design&quot; topic from this book entirely. This book should focus on the programming side, and implementing levels of ANY kind. Design is enough of a task for that separate book. If there are no objections, does anyone want to do the honors of renaming the book, or should I? (I'll do it if there aren't any objections in a week) Thanks, [[User:NinjaSkitch|NinjaSkitch]] ([[User talk:NinjaSkitch|talk]]) 06:17, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

Also, just a proposal to see who is for or against this idea, how many of you would want to turn this book into cross-platform game development? For two reasons: the first being that it's already been started (with C++ and OpenAL) and it would address programmers of every OS, and the second is, if this is going to be a reference for future programmers, wouldn't we as a community want to support openness and compatibility (OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL rather than *gasp* Windows-only C# and DirectX)? Let's get a little vote going, please add your sig. to the For or Against list to see how popular or unpopular this idea is:

Yes! (Cross-platform game programming)
# [[User:NinjaSkitch|NinjaSkitch]] ([[User talk:NinjaSkitch|talk]]) 06:35, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

No!



== Development stage review ==

Hi. I just reviewed your book about Game Design and Programming, see [[Help:Development stages]]. It is a promising start. I would suggest to convert the table of contents from a list of headings &lt;nowiki&gt;== title... ==&lt;/nowiki&gt; to a plain list, if you use those titles as links to other pages anyway. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 00:08, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Request for contributions ==

Hi, i'm busy trying to add some substance to this wikibook because I think it was off to a good start. If anyone has anything to contribute, be it tutorials, code snips, pictures, even laymans explanations of the various concepts, please do. I think this wikibook could be awesome!

--[[User:AfroToad|afroToad]] 14:13, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

: I'm definitely interested, and am going to contribute as much as I can. I think this is a great idea--there aren't many good places for potential game programmers to start, because most game source is kept secret. Also, I don't think there's any reason we can't give examples in multiple languages, maybe even UML. Since there is no one way to make a game though, this does pose another question: should this book focus on the design and structure of an ideal game engine? One that's abstracted to make any type of game? In my opinion, we have to go from a broad spectrum down to narrow modules: The main book could contain detailed descriptions of how a game engine works. Then for each module, Networking, Input, Cameras, etc, we could focus on different options, (Winsock and SDL_net, DirectX and OpenGL) along with examples in a couple different languages. [[User:NinjaSkitch|NinjaSkitch]] ([[User talk:NinjaSkitch|talk]]) 04:24, 11 December 2007 (UTC)

== Cleanup ==

Loads of cleanup needs to be done, and a lot more needs to be added. I'll try and contribute whenever I feel like.

--[[User:GatesPlusPlus|GatesPlusPlus]] 09:41, 1 January 2006 (UTC)
:Don't know know why I'm on this talk page (or every other talk page lol), but this is something I am very interested in. As a side note, has anyone here seen the article on [[Blender 3D]]? It is quite brilliant, in particular have a look at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Game Engine Basics]]

--Andy 12:25, 12 September 2007

I suggest just deleting this wikibook as there's basically nothing useful and there's lots of misinformation.

: I suggest giving it some time, because it has the potential to be a very good resource for beginner game developers. There aren't many free resources out there. I just happened to find it recently, and I'm presently adding content. If this one is deleted, one will simply start up again anyway, so there's [[meta:Deletionism|no point in getting rid of it just yet]]. Bear with us.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stores are places that sell things. People go to stores to buy things. There are many different types of stores. Each store sells different things. Some stores sell clothes, others sell electronic equipment, and still others sell food, or toys.

== Ways to pay ==
People use money to pay for things at stores. Cash is a type of money that is very easy to use. Cash includes paper bills and metal coins. In the United States, cash is also called legal tender and is issued by the US Treasury. Another common way to pay for things is with checks. Customers go to banks to open checking accounts, or bank accounts that have checks. Checks are pieces of paper that people give to stores instead of cash. Stores then take the checks to the banks. Then, the banks give the stores money from the bank accounts of their customers. The other main way that people pay for things is with credit cards. A credit card is a piece of plastic that some banks issue to their customers. Customers can use credit cards to buy things more quickly than with checks. 

== Kinds of stores ==
Most stores sell new things but some stores sell old or used items. The advantage of buying used things is that they are cheaper (that is, less expensive). In America, stores sell used books, used clothes, used cars and very old used furniture and other things. Very old used things are called antiques. 

Stores are usually physical places but are sometimes virtual places. Virtual stores are Internet sites where people can buy things. One of the most famous virtual stores is Amazon.com, a web site that sells books and many other things. 

When people go to a store to buy things they say that they are going shopping. When people look for things at a store it is called browsing or window shopping. Sometimes Americans do this as a pleasure activity or to relax. Because of this, people sometimes criticize Americans as being materialistic. 

The part of a store where customers pay is called the check-out counter or check-out aisle. There, a clerk helps ring up the products to register their prices. To do this, the clerk uses a cash register. If the cash register is computerized, the clerk uses a scanner to ring up the prices. Paying at the register is also called checking out. Sometimes lines of people at the register are long. When this happens, it takes a lot of time to pay and customers have to wait for several minutes. This can be stressful. 

People go to expensive stores to buy luxury items. This makes them feel good. Nice stores like this are often at malls or shopping centers. Rich Americans buy many luxury items, and so do many lower-income Americans, too. The United States is a consumer society, where people use the money that they make to buy more and more consumer products.

== &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; - Flexible Archiving Tool ==

In general, &lt;code&gt;tar&lt;/code&gt; is the preferred method for creating archives,
but in some cases a particular archive format may be desired and
&lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; provides a greater degree of control over how the archive is
generated at the cost of greater complexity.

==== Creating a &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; archive ====

To create a &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; archive, the &lt;code&gt;-o&lt;/code&gt; option is provided (think 'o' for &quot;The archive is being written &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;ut&quot;).  &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; expects a list of files to be provided to its standard input.  The list of files is usually provided by piping results from the find command.  The &lt;code&gt;-H&lt;/code&gt; option can be used to specify the archive format, see the [http://www.sunsite.ualberta.ca/Documentation/Gnu/cpio-2.4.2/man/cpio.1.html man page] for more information.

==== Listing contents of an archive with &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; ====

To view the contents of an archive the &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option is provided
to tell &lt;code&gt;cpio&lt;/code&gt; to expect the archive data on its standard input.
The &lt;code&gt;-t&lt;/code&gt; option is also used then to tell cpio to not extract, but
rather simply list the contents of the archive.

The &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option is used with a combination of options to tell
it how to extract.  Common choices include &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; to tell cpio to
create directories as needed.  &lt;code&gt;-m&lt;/code&gt; to reset file modification

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Finding files with dangerous permissions ==

==== Files that are writable by &quot;other&quot; ====

If we search just based on permission, we'll get false hits from things like symbolic
links.

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find . -perm +002 -ls&lt;/strong&gt;
   4095    0 lrwxrwxrwx   1 user     user           22 Jan  4 08:30 ./rh033 -&amp;gt; rh033-RHEL3-1-20031103
  10209    0 lrwxrwxrwx   1 user     user           18 Jan  4 09:28 ./.mozilla/default/bgdnw5up.slt/lock -&amp;gt; 192.168.0.254:3311
  63259    1 -rw-rw-rw-   1 user     user            6 Jan  5 11:58 ./playground/real-problem

Instead look for files with other write enabled that are regular files.&lt;/p&gt;

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find . -perm +002 -type f -ls&lt;/strong&gt;
  63259    1 -rw-rw-rw-   1 user     user            6 Jan  5 11:58 ./playground/real-problem

==== Directories that are writable by &quot;other&quot; ====

When searching for directories that are writeable by other, one should also consider whether the &quot;sticky bit&quot; is set for the directory.  In octal, the sticky bit is represented as a 1 in the first position in four digit octal representation (ex: 1777).  This is a common setting for temporary directories and is not normally considered a security risk.

World writable temporary directories:

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find / -perm -1002 -type d -ls 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/strong&gt;
    493    0 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root           40 Jan  4 09:25 /dev/shm
      2    4 drwxrwxrwt  11 root     root         4096 Jan  5 11:42 /tmp
  58497    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 xfs      xfs          4096 Jan  4 09:26 /tmp/.font-unix
  29250    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     user         4096 Jan  4 09:27 /tmp/.X11-unix
  14625    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 user     user         4096 Jan  4 09:27 /tmp/.ICE-unix
  29252    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 user     user         4096 Jan  4 09:28 /tmp/.esd
 665189    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Jan  3 07:51 /var/lib/texmf
  97345    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Jan  4 14:00 /var/tmp
 178466    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Aug 11  2003 /var/spool/vbox
 762533    4 drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         4096 Sep 25  2003 /var/spool/samba

Finding the real problem directories:

[user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;find / -perm -002 -not -perm -1000 -type d -ls 2&amp;gt;/dev/null&lt;/strong&gt;
  46931    1 drwxrwxrwx   2 user     user         1024 Jan  5 12:06 /home/kupferer/bad-permissions

==== SUID and SGID executables ====

SUID and SGID executables can present serious security concerns since they allow users to execute programs with permissions of another user.  For this reason they should be closely monitored.  SUID is represented as 4 in the first position and SGID, by a 2.

== &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; ==

The &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; command produces a checksum for a file that can be used later to check whether the file's contents have changed.

 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;echo &quot;some content&quot; &amp;gt;a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;md5sum a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 eb9c2bf0eb63f3a7bc0ea37ef18aeba5  a_file
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;echo &quot;Some content&quot; &amp;gt;a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;md5sum a_file&lt;/strong&gt;
 581ab2d89f05c294d4fe69c623bdef83  a_file

This is often used when downloading files from possibly untrustworthy mirrors.  So long as a trusted checksum can be obtained, it can be used to verify that the data wasn't corrupted whether accidentally or maliciously.  Often checksum files are distributed with downloads or kept on secure media to check systems for possible data corruption or intrusion.  To create an MD5 checksum file, simply redirect the &lt;code&gt;md5sum&lt;/code&gt; output to a file.  &lt;code&gt;md5sum -c&lt;/code&gt; can then be used to run the check later.

 [user@station playground]$ &lt;strong&gt;for I in $(seq 1 6)&lt;/strong&gt;
 &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;do echo &quot;Content for file-$I&quot; &amp;gt;file-$I&lt;/strong&gt;
 &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;done&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station user]$ &lt;strong&gt;ls&lt;/strong&gt;
 file-1  file-2  file-3  file-4  file-5  file-6
 [user@station playground]$ &lt;strong&gt;md5sum * &amp;gt;files.md5&lt;/strong&gt;
 [user@station playground]$ &lt;strong&gt;cat files.md5&lt;/strong&gt;

==== Finding and Checking SUID and SGID executables ====

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the Mechanics 3 module of the [[A-level Mathematics]] book. This module assumes that you are familiar with the [[../C1/]], [[../C2/]], [[../C3/]], [[../C4/]], [[../M1/]] and [[../M2/]] modules. Please post all questions to [[A-level Mathematics/Discussion]].

== Contents ==
# [[/Elastic Strings and Springs/]]{{stage short|75%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Impulse and Momentum/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Circular Motion/]]{{stage short|75%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/Kinematics/]]{{stage short|00%|Dec 14, 2005}}
# [[/SHM|Simple Harmonic Motion]]{{stage short|100%|Dec 14, 2005}}

==Formulae==
By the end of this module you will be expected to have learnt the following formulae:

===Kinematics===
* &lt;math&gt; a = v\frac{dv}{dx} &lt;/math&gt;

===Simple Harmonic Motion===
* &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x} = -\omega ^2x&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;v^2 = \omega ^2(a^2-x^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x = a \sin (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x = a \cos (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt; or, generally, &lt;math&gt;x = a \cos (\omega t + \epsilon)\,&lt;/math&gt;
===Elastic Springs and Strings===
* Hooke's Law: &lt;math&gt; T = \frac{\lambda x}{l} &lt;/math&gt;
* Elastic potential energy: &lt;math&gt; E_p = \frac{\lambda x^2}{2l} &lt;/math&gt;
===Small-angle Approximations===
* &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta \approx \theta&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta \approx 1 - \frac{1}{2}\theta ^2 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; \tan \theta \approx \theta &lt;/math&gt;
only applies when &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is in radians

      <text xml:space="preserve">Your book is nicely evolving. I just reviewed your book to give it a new [[Help:Development stages|development stage]], and I suggest the following improvement: Your Reference/Definitions could be converted into a table. Wiki supports [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:How_to_use_tables#Yet_another_example_.28MediaWiki_table_code.29 tables] like this following example:
{|
! Acronym
! Definition
|-
| AAX
| Advanced Assembly Extension
|-
|APX
|Assembly Performance Extension
|-
|ARX
|Advanced Rendering Extension
|-
|ASX
|Advanced Surfacing Extension
|}
This might improve the visual appearance of your nice book. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:41, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I can do this quite easily in [http://www.vim.org Vim] but I'm concerned about the source of the material.  It appears to be copied directly out of some formatted document, which could possibly have been copyrighted.  There's no indication from the person who added this (Iturner2) whether this material is free to be used.  It will be difficult to write our own version of the definitions reference but legally we may have no choice.  [[User:Praetis|Praetis]] 14:00, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

== Version stuff? ==

Pro/Engineer changed drastically between 2001 and Wildfire, and less so between Wildfire and Wildfire 2.0.  I propose that this WikiBook be written, if possible, to keep pace mainly with the latest version.  If someone has the time or inclination later to add &quot;menu mapper&quot; information or other details of earlier versions, such as might be useful to those upgrading from earlier versions or working on legacy systems, that can have its own section. 

It looks as though this book has been inactive for awhile now.  If anyone is interested in helping me pursue it, please drop me a note on my talk page.  I'm a Wiktionarian first, so I don't know yet how much time I'll devote to this project.--[[User:Dvortygirl|Dvortygirl]] 07:08, 23 October 2005 (UTC)


Um... this is pretty much the dumbest, most useless endeavor I've ever seen anyone attempt. The software changes too quickly and no normal human (or TEAM of them) could keep pace without massive support. Even WITH massive support, Pro/E &quot;experts&quot; abound but few of them *really* know what the heck they're doing. PTC's textbooks are nothing to write home about- but this massive piece of software just does not lend itself to an E-book written by the web community. While I probably owe the guy a kick in the family jewels, Steve Smith's textbooks are probably the best resource for Pro/E knowledge. Spend your money there and save your time for something more worthwhile. And if you happen to SEE ol' Steve, do me a favor and try to get in one good kick for me. Trust me, he deserves it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just reviewed your book for [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]. I think, your tips are well written, but the book`s title (&quot;WordPerfect&quot;) is too general. Please consider renaming the book or moving your content to a new book called e.g. &quot;Tips for WordPerfect&quot; or &quot;Tips to tweak the Classic Mode to resemble more to WordPerfect 5.1 DOS&quot;. You might then get a higher development stage. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:58, 11 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Curry powder''' is a blend of spices used in South and South East Asian cuisine.  Different curries include many different combinations of spices, and are typically sold in powder or paste form.  Common spices included in curry blends include tumeric, black or white pepper, red pepper, and coriander.
 
Some common ingredients in curry powder are:
* [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] seeds
* [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] seeds
* [[Cookbook:Cardamom|cardamom]] seeds
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] seeds
* [[Cookbook:Fenugreek|fenugreek]] seeds
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|turmeric]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">When studying Japanese, it can help greatly to know the terminology or jargon used. These may include different parts of speech, grammar structures, names of particles, etc. This is not an explanation of those forms, but a simple list of what they are called. Beginning students may not want to bother with these until they have completed the first lesson, although there may be some useful terms here.

I believe this article should include links to more specialized indian food articles--[[User:69.171.35.198|69.171.35.198]] 00:02, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Sindhi cuisine ==

There were some recipes on the Wikipedia page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindhi_food Sindhi food]. The article's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sindhi_food AfD] determined that the recipes should be transwikied here. I've put them on a subpage [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fang_Aili/sindi_food_temp here], and anyone interested can copy them from there and place them appropriately at Wikibooks Cookbook. I'd appreciate help from someone who knows what they're doing here. Thanks! --[[User:Fang Aili|Fang Aili]] 23:28, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Brief tutorial on spice preparation needed ==

Cooks from other cultures often fall down on spice preparation: roasting, frying, grinding, etc.  A tutorial on this subject would be extremely helpful!
:I could take a stab at some of this, but am not sure where to link it into the main page.  Any suggestions? [[User:AndyCunningham|AndyCunningham]] 10:42, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

== Cusines from East India ==

The section talks about cuisines from most parts of India. However the cusines from east part of the country have not been discussed. Hope someone does some contributions to this.

== Biryani - Sub topic- Non veg section need to be sub divided ==

Hi everyone,&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to have a discussion on subdividing the Non veg section. There is a biryani link which is given an additional title &quot;Rice based dish also&quot; this does not seem to be legible. Either we can have a separate section for biryani by re arranging the entire page or we can sub divide the Non veg dish section to subsections like e.g. Biryani, Curry e.t.c. Please share your views &lt;br /&gt;
Thanks --[[User:Sunaina Kunju|Sunaina Kunju]] ([[User talk:Sunaina Kunju|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sunaina Kunju|contribs]]) 17:01, 7 August 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most robots have an electronic &quot;brain&quot; (part that uses sensor input to determine actuator output). This can be either a simple electronic circuit, a µcontroller or a PC. This is not the only way to build a robot &quot;brain&quot;.

== Mechanical Robot Brains ==
One of the first robots was designed by Da Vinci, this was a small vehicle powered by wind-up springs and it was &quot;programed&quot; by changing gears.
Although possible this kind of robot brains are very hard to design and build.

== Pneumatic Robot Brains ==
If you need to automate some part of a plant where explosive gases are used it might be too dangerous to use electronic circuits. Instead pneumatic circuits are used. It's possible to construct logical circuits, timers, sequences,... using pneumatic valves and cylinders. 
You can find a lot of pneumatic valves for automation here: www.ngtvalves.com

    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#ecfde4&quot; width=&quot;49&quot;&gt;'''n&amp;oacute;s'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e2e2e6&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#f9fbfa&quot; width=&quot;91&quot;&gt;os

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#f9fbfa&quot;

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e2e2e6&quot; width=&quot;91&quot;&gt;os

      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e2e2e6&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;as suas&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Gender==
The gender in these words is of the object possessed, not the possesor (as in English). 
For example
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Ele vai para a sua casa''' - He goes to his house.

''Even though 'ele' is masculine, we use the feminine 'a sua' because 'casa' is feminine.''
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Confusion==
Unfortunately, confusion can arise with the forms '''seu''', '''sua''', '''seus''' and '''suas'''. This is because they can mean ''his'', ''her'', ''your'' and ''their''. We therefore use the following forms frequently.

&lt;table style=&quot;width: 228px;&quot;
 border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
 width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''dele'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;his house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''dela'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;her house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''deles'''&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;their (m) house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#c8d7f0&quot;
 width=&quot;103&quot;&gt;a casa '''delas''' &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#e6e9f0&quot;
 width=&quot;105&quot;&gt;their (f) house&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

'''Note: The gender of these words refers, unlike the words above, to the possesor, not the object(s) possessed'''.

*ASCO and NCCN recommend maintaining Hb near 12 g/dL.  Should initiate therapy when Hb drops to 11 or lower. 
*However, randomized data from H&amp;N, breast, and NSCLC show adverse outcomes in patients undergoing therapy with Epo support
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Head_%26_Neck/General#Hypoxia|H&amp;N Epo data]]
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Advanced_breast|Breast Epo data]]
**[[Radiation_Oncology/Lung/NSCLC/Palliation#Anemia|NSCLC Epo data]]
*A general randomized trial enrolling patients with Hb &lt;11 showed no improved in transfusion requirements, and significantly worse survival with darbepoetin alfa


==Darbepoetin Alfa ([http://www.aranesp.com/ Aranesp])==
*FDA recommended doses
*:Starting dose: 2.25 mcg/kg SC injection qweek
*:May increase to 4.5 mcg/kg if less than 1g/dL increase in Hb over 2 weeks
*Other doses
*:3 mcg/kg q2week
*:200 mcg q2week
*:300 mcg q3week


*'''Multi-National''' (Europe, North America, Australia)(2004-2006)
**Randomized. 989 patients. Non-myeloid malignancies (NSCL 18%, breast 13%), anemia Hgb &lt;11 (mean 9.5), not receiving chemo or RT. Arm 1) placebo vs. Arm 2) darbepoetin alfa 6.75 ug/kg q4w x 16 weeks
**'''2008''' PMID 18227526 -- &quot;Darbepoetin Alfa for the Treatment of Anemia in Patients With Active Cancer Not Receiving Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy: Results of a Phase III, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.&quot; (Smith RE Jr, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 28 [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: Transfusions week 5-17 similar. Median OS DA 8.5 months vs. placebo 10.8 months (SS)
***Toxicity: more cardiovascular, thromboembolic events, more deaths
***Conclusion: Darbepoetin no impact on transfusions, worse survival


==IV Iron==
*'''Italy''' (2004-2006) -- darbepoetin +/- IV iron
**'''2008''' PMID 18375891 -- &quot;Randomized trial of intravenous iron supplementation in patients with chemotherapy-related anemia without iron deficiency treated with darbepoetin alpha.&quot; (Pedrazzoli P, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 1;26(10):1619-25.)
**Randomized. 149 patients with lung, GYN, BCA, and CRC; Hb &lt;=11 g/L and no iron deficiency. Treated with darbepoetin and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) IV iron (sodium ferric gluconate) 125mg IV Q1W x6 weeks
***Outcome: Hb response EPO 62% vs. EPO + Iron 77% (SS)
***Toxicity: Comparable
***Conclusion: IV supplementation reduces treatment failures to darbepoetin

*'''European Multi-Institutional''' -- darbepoetin +/- IV iron
**Randomized. 396 patients with non-myeloid malignancies, Hb &lt;11 g/dL. Treated with darboepoetin and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) IV iron Q3W x 4 months
**'''2008''' PMID 18375890 -- &quot;Randomized, multicenter, controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alpha administered every 3 weeks with or without intravenous iron in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.&quot; (Bastit L, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Apr 1;26(10):1611-8.)
***Outcome: % achieving Hb &gt;=12 EPO 73% vs. EPO + Iron 86% (SS); also fewer transfusions  20% vs. 9% (SS)
***Toxicity: No difference in adverse events; iron-related were GI
***Conclusion: Addition of IV iron to darbepoetin improved Hb control and decreased number of transfusions

*'''Sundsvall''' (2003-2005) -- EPO +/- IV iron
**Randomized. 67 patients, lymphoproliferative malignancy, Hb 9-11 g/dL. Treated with epoetin 30,000 IU Q1W and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) IV iron 100 mg QW
**'''2007''' PMID 17252006 -- &quot;Addition of intravenous iron to epoetin beta increases hemoglobin response and decreases epoetin dose requirement in anemic patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies: a randomized multicenter study.&quot; (Hedenus M, Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):627-32. Epub 2007 Jan 25.)
***Outcome: Hb response EPO 53% vs. EPO + IV iron 93%; mean weekly EPO dose lower &gt;25% in IV iron group by week 15 (p=0.05)
***Conclusion: Hb reponse significantly improved with IV iron

*'''Karnell Cancer Center''' -- epoetin +/- oral iron or IV iron
**'''2007''' PMID 17296819 -- &quot;Intravenous ferric gluconate significantly improves response to epoetin alfa versus oral iron or no iron in anemic patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.&quot; (Henry DH, Oncologist. 2007 Feb;12(2):231-42.)
**Randomized. 129 patients, Hb &lt;11 g/d, ferritin &gt;= 100 ng/ml, transferring &gt;=15%. Treated with epoetin 40,000 U and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2)oral ferrous sulfacte 325 mg TID vs. Arm 3) IV ferric gluconate 125 mg IV Q1W  
***Outcome: Hb response EPO 41% vs. EPO + oral iron 46% vs. EPO + IV iron 73% (SS)
***Toxicity: Well tolerated
***Conclusion: IV iron in addition to epoetin produces significantly greater Hb response

*'''Averbach Hematology-Oncology''' -- rHuEPO +/- oral iron or IV iron
**Randomized. 157 patients, Hb &lt;=10.5 g/dL or ferritin &lt;=450 pmol/L or transferring &lt;=19%. Treated with rHuEPO 40,000 U QW and Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) oral iron 325 mg BID vs. Arm 3) IV iron (iron dextran) 100 mg bolus vs. Arm 4) IV iron (iron dextran) 100 mg infusion
**'''2004''' PMID 15051778 -- &quot;Intravenous iron optimizes the response to recombinant human erythropoietin in cancer patients with chemotherapy-related anemia: a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial.&quot; (Auerbach M, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 1;22(7):1301-7.)
***Outcome: Hematopoietic response EPO 25% vs. EPO + oral iron 36% vs. EPO + IV iron 68% (both groups). IV iron groups had improved energy, activity and QoL, oral iron group no difference, and no iron worsening
***Conclusion: IV iron improves effect of EPO</text>

An '''oven''' is a closed compartment for [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] and [[Cookbook:Broiling|broiling]]. Usually a [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]] is attached to the top.

==Gas==
Some ovens are heated by burning gas. Water is a byproduct of the burning of gas, and this creates a humid environment inside the oven. While this reduces the need to cover foods to prevent drying, it also prevents drying when drying is desired. Gas ovens generally provide poor support for broiling. Gas fuel is cheaper than electricity in some areas, and gas ovens often come with the generally desirable gas cooktops.

[[Image:Parsley Flat.jpg|right|thumb|Flat leaf parsley]]
[[Image:Parsley Curled.jpg|right|thumb|Curly leaf parsley]]

'''Parsley''' is a bright green, biennial herb that is very common in Middle Eastern, European, and American cooking. Its value as a breath-freshener, and much of its taste, come from its high concentration of chlorophyll. It is also high in [[Cookbook:Vitamins|vitamin]] C.

Two forms of parsley are used as herbs: curly leaf and Italian or flat leaf. Curly leaf parsley is often used as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]]. Many people think flat leaf parsley has a stronger flavor, and it is sometimes used as a substitute for [[Cookbook:Cilantro|coriander leaves]]. Its flat leaves are less springy than those of curly leaf parsley, and hence it is easier to chop. Another type of parsley, Hamburg parsley, is grown for its edible root, similar in appearance to a [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip]].

== Basics ==

==== Handling Arguments ====

This program will display all arguments:
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 for ARG; do
     echo &quot;had arg: $ARG&quot;
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Functions ==

==== Launch Apps and Set Niceness ====
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 showdates () {
      cal
      date
      ddate
 }
 
 donice () {
     COMMAND=$1
     NICEVAL=$(grep &quot;^$COMMAND&quot; ~/.nice-settings | cut -d: -f2)
     if test -n &quot;$NICEVAL&quot;
     then
         nice -n &quot;$NICEVAL&quot; $*
     else
         nice $*
     fi
 }
 
 grpshare () {
     if [ $1 = '-g' ]; then
         SET_GROUP=$2
         shift; shift
     else
         SET_GROUP=users
     fi
 
     for FILE; do
         chgrp $SET_GROUP -R $FILE
         chmod g+rw -R $FILE
     done
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example Scripts ==

==== Setting Environment Variable ====
&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 
 for PROFILE in $(find /home/ -name .bash_profile)
 do
     if egrep -q '^(export[[:space:]]+)?EDITOR' $PROFILE
     then
        # User already set an editor, override that
        sed -i.orig -r 's/^(export[[:space:]]+)?EDITOR=.*/export EDITOR=nano/' $PROFILE
     else
         # No previous editor was set
         echo &quot;export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano&quot; &gt;&gt;$PROFILE
     fi
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Setting Aliases ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 
 for BASHRC in $(find /home/ -name .bashrc)
 do
     for ALIAS in &quot;alias rm='rm -i'&quot; &quot;alias cp='cp -i'&quot; &quot;alias mv='mv -i'&quot;
     do
         ALIAS_CMD=$(echo $ALIAS | cut -d= -f1)
         if ! egrep -q &quot;^$ALIAS_CMD&quot; $BASHRC
         then
             echo $ALIAS &gt;&gt;$BASHRC
         fi
     done
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Checking MD5s for SUID and SGID Executables ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 # /root/bin or /usr/local/bin would be a good place for this script
 # Probably need to run this as root, otherwise many errors will show up about
 # permission problems with reading these files.
 NOTIFY_EMAIL=user@station.example.com
 
 # Assume (for now) that we already have a /etc/suid.md5 to compare new file to
 find / -type f -perm +6000 -exec md5sum {} \; &gt;/etc/suid.md5.new
 
 if diff /etc/suid.md5 /etc/suid.md5.new &amp;&gt;/tmp/suid-check-diff.out
 then
     echo &quot;No SUIDs have changed&quot;
 else
     if [ &quot;$1&quot; = &quot;interactive&quot; ]
     then
         cat /tmp/suid-check-diff.out
         echo &quot;Check FAILED!  SUID executable(s) have changed!&quot;
         read -p &quot;Is this okay? (yes/no) &quot; RESPONSE
         if [ &quot;$RESPONSE&quot; = &quot;yes&quot; ]
         then
             mv /etc/suid.md5.new /etc/suid.md5
         fi
     else
         echo &quot;Check FAILED!  SUID executable(s) have changed!&quot; | mail -s &quot;SUID Change&quot; $NOTIFY_EMAIL
     fi
 fi
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Checking URLs for New Content ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 
 URL_FILE=$HOME/.content-check-urls
 URL_DIR=$HOME/.content-check
 
 if ! [ -d $URL_DIR ]; then
     mkdir $URL_DIR
 fi
 
 if ! [ -f $URL_FILE ]; then
     echo &quot;new-content-check: $URL_FILE not found&quot;
     exit 1
 fi
 
 for URL in $(cat $URL_FILE); do
     MD5_FILE=$URL_DIR/$(echo $URL | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)
 
     if [ -f $MD5_FILE ]; then
         # Looks like we´ve got an old version of this data, gotta check it
         links -dump &quot;$URL&quot; | md5sum &gt; $MD5_FILE.new
         if ! diff $MD5_FILE $MD5_FILE.new &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
             echo &quot;New content at $URL&quot;
             mv -f $MD5_FILE.new $MD5_FILE
         else
             rm $MD5_FILE.new
         fi
     else
         # No old version, just store the new sum
         links -dump &quot;$URL&quot; | md5sum &gt; $MD5_FILE
     fi
 done
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Connecting via ssh using keys ====

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 #!/bin/bash
 SUCCESS=0
 WRONG_ARGS=65
 if [ $# -ne 2 ]
 then
  echo &quot;Uso: `basename $0` user host&quot;
  echo &quot;Es : `basename $0` myuser host.example.com&quot;
  exit $WRONG_ARGS
 fi
 if [ ! -e &quot;$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&quot; ];
 then
 echo &quot;missing rsa key:&quot;
 echo &quot;run \&quot;ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048\&quot; and try again&quot;

A partition is a place on disk which contains 


at the fdisk prompt:
n - create a new partition
e - create an extended partition 
p - will print the table

==== Block Devices ====


==== Overview of Partitions ====
Using Radified's [[http://partition.radified.com]] analogy, a partition is
like

==== Creating a partition ====

===== Using the fdisk utility =====
&quot;fdisk -l&quot; ---&gt; listed
fdisk -l

===== the Mkfs Command =====
mkfs, then hit the tab key twice gives you a list
mkfs -t * which equals mkfs.*

so mkfs.reiserfs equals mkfs -t reiserfs

VFAT filesystem - tends to be used for usb
mkfs -b ----&gt; 
mkfs -t
every partition has 

4k is what you want -&gt; optimized for speed rat
mkfs -f [fragment size]
fdisk -&gt; enters the interactive prompt
w - write
n - new
m - manual
+100m - creates a partition
q - quit
the command &quot;q&quot; will quit fdisk.
if you exit with &quot;q&quot; rather than &quot;w&quot;

1000 bytes is kb
1024 bytes is a kib &quot;kibibytes&quot;

running the command &quot;cat /proc/partitions&quot;
looking at the file /proc/partitions will tell you what block devices the kernel knows about
partprobe - speaks to a higher level of the kernel

it is a good idea to check with &quot;partprobe&quot; if the kernel agrees with our partitions

==== Sysfs filesystem vs. Proc filesystem ====


==== Inodes ====
Metadata is stored in the inode

we have goto our filesystem formatted 

ctime - when was the inode created
mtime - when was the inode last modified

ext2 had to make sure it assigns them to the correct filesystem -
tune2fs -l /dev/xvda1

dumpe2fs /dev/xvda1
holding

====== Mounting the file system =====

if something is to show up on the desktop, then it will show up as mnt

if we &quot;touch /home/share/unmounted&quot;

the command to mount the 

every directory has an inode for the current directory ( in the . entry)

dump e2fs will tell us if

== Filesystems ==

==== ext2 and ext3 ====
ext3 is the ext2 filesystem with journaling added.  Journaling keeps track of what will be written to the disk prior to the write operation beginning.  When the write is done, it is noted in the journal.  If the system crashes during a write, it can recover the operation when it comes back up.  This prevents incomplete writes from occurring on the disk and eliminates the need to do a filesystem check after a system crash.

==== jfs ====
JFS is a high a performance filesystem made by IBM and ported to Linux in 2001. It uses B+ trees,extents, and a journal to guarantee the consistency of the file system in the event of a crash.

==== reiserfs ====

== Labeling Filesystems and Block Devices ==

== Mounting Filesystems ==

==== The &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; Command ====

==== /etc/fstab ====

== AutoFS - Automounting ==

AutoFS allows the system to automatically mount devices and network shares as they are requested and even unmount them again when no longer in use.  The main configuration for the automounter is &lt;code&gt;/etc/auto.master&lt;/code&gt;.  Initially, this file will only contain comments, including examples for a &lt;code&gt;/etc/auto.misc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/etc/auto.net&lt;/code&gt;.

'''Mint''' refers to the leaves of a perennial herb, typically [[Cookbook:Peppermint|peppermint]] (''Mentha piperita'') or [[Cookbook:Spearmint|spearmint]] (''Mentha spicata''), used for flavoring in [[Cookbook:Candy|candy]], [[Cookbook:Tea|teas]], and some dishes. An extract is produced for uses where the leaves would be inconvenient.

Mint is also regarded as a good accompaniment to roast [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]], especially in the form of [[Cookbook:Mint sauce|mint sauce]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Portuguese|Number and Gender|Practise Definite and Indefinite Articles}}

In English, we use definite and indefinite articles all the time. They are the words 'the', 'a' and 'an'.
In Portuguese there are articles as well, but the actual system is quite more complicated.

As you can learn from the [[Portuguese/Contents/Number and Gender|Number and Gender section]], Portuguese makes use of two features known as Number and Gender. What this means is that a noun is either ''singular'' or ''plural'' and at the same time it is either ''masculine'' or ''feminine''. In Portugese, articles and nouns must agree; that is to say that the article and the noun must have both the same number and the same gender. So when there is a feminine noun, you use a feminine article; when the noun is plural, you have to use a plural article as well. Let's have a look at these articles.

==Definite Articles==
The '''definite articles''' are used when one is referring exactly to one particular object or collection of objects. The following table resumes the four Portuguese definite articles. In English, the definite article is ''the''.

{| width=240 border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:#A5ADFA; border:#5061F5; border-collapse: collapse&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''Table I''' - Definite articles
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Singular
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Plural
|-
! Masculine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | o
| align=&quot;center&quot; | os
|-
! Feminine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | a
| align=&quot;center&quot; | as
|}

So, to say ''the house'', we first need to look at the word &quot;casa&quot;, ''house''. It is feminine (see [[Portuguese:Number and Gender#Tips for Identifying Word Gender|Tips for Identifying Word Gender]] for tips on how to recognize word gender). Since there is only one house, we look for the feminine singular. It is ''a'', so we say &quot;a casa&quot;, ''the house''.

==Indefinite Articles==
We now need to look at the indefinite articles. They are used when the noun refers to something of one kind, but the particular instance isn't important. In English, the indefinite article is ''a'' or ''an''.

{| width=240 border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;background:#A5ADFA; border:#5061F5; border-collapse: collapse&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ '''Table I''' - Indefinite articles
| width=&quot;80&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Singular
! width=&quot;80&quot; | Plural
|-
! Masculine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | um
| align=&quot;center&quot; | uns
|-
! Feminine
| align=&quot;center&quot; | uma
| align=&quot;center&quot; | umas
|}

Again, if we want to say ''a house'', we are looking for the feminine singular indefinite article, which is ''uma''. Therefore, we say &quot;uma casa&quot;, ''a house''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Common Prepositions and Contractions==

Prepositions are words that describe location, for instance, 'at', 'of' etc.

However, unlike in English, some of these &quot;contract&quot;. That means they join other words to form new words, not always in a facilitative way.
Here are the prepositions, with the contractions with definite and indefinite articles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Future Tense ==
In portuguese you can use the future tense by saying 'I am going to' or 'I will,' by adding an ending. Ir + infinitive is the first way, and see below for the other way with all the verb endings required.

==Using ''ir''==
In Portuguese, we often use the construction &quot;going to&quot;.

&lt;big&gt;'''ir''' + '''infinitive'''&lt;/big&gt;

You conjugate &quot;ir&quot; as normal, and then add the verb in the infinitive form.

For example, the verb &quot;andar&quot; (to walk):

Eu '''vou''' andar

Você/Ele/Ela '''vai''' andar

Nós '''vamos''' andar

Eles/Elas/Vocês '''vão''' andar

==Simple Future==
It is still possible, but slightly formal, to say &quot;I will eat&quot; or &quot;I will swim&quot;. This is the simple future tense.
This tense is one of the easiest to form in Portuguese. Just conjugate as below.

'''FALAR - To Speak'''
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 282px;&quot;
 border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
 width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;I will speak&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eu falar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ei&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (s,inf) will speak&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Tu falar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ás&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;He will speak&lt;br&gt;
(&lt;i&gt;also ela, voc&amp;ecirc;)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Ele falar&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;á&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot;
 width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;We will speak&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;N&amp;oacute;s falar&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;emos&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;You (p) will speak&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;V&amp;oacute;s falar&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;eis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#edfded&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;They will speak&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(also elas, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;voc&amp;ecirc;s)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;right&quot;
 bgcolor=&quot;#f6f9f7&quot; width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;Eles falar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#dfe0e0&quot; width=&quot;33&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;ão&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

''EXCEPTIONS'' - '''Trazer''', '''dizer''', '''fazer'''. [[Portuguese/Future tense irregular verbs|See how to conjugate these in the future tense]]

Note that this contruction works even if the verb is usually irregular. Ser, ter and ir, for example, can all be made into the future this way.

==Splitting of Stem and Ending==
When using indirect and direct object pronouns, the future stem and ending must be split. The stem is (except for the irregular verbs mentioned above) simply the infinitive. The indirect or direct object pronoun goes between the stem and the ending, as in these examples:

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Eu falar-lhe-ei''' - I will speak to him/her/you

'''Você beijar-me-á''' - You will kiss me.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

However, this construction is rare in spoken Portuguese. When an object pronoun is used, we usually use ''ir'' and the infinitive (see above).

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#EEE8AA&quot;&gt;
'''Eu vou falar-lhe''' - I am going to speak to him/her/you.

'''Você vai beijar-me''' - You are going to kiss me.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! I just reviewed your book, updating your [[Wikibooks:Development stages|development stages]] {{stage short|50%|Jan 12, 2005}}. Wow! This took some time, cause it is really a BIG book with many many sub-chapters! I was impressed by the quality and clear style of writing. Keep up the work, and concentrate on the 75% chapters: I think many of them can be 100% by just finishing up the pages or including those examples that have been announced, but obviously forgotten... (See [[Help:Development stages]] for how to use this template, and if you read this, help by reviewing another book and spreading the word! Thanks!) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:30, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)


I'll work on this again in the fall when I'm in the mood for organic again --[[User:Ghostal|Ghostal]] 23:00 EST, Apr 11, 2005

== In module Ketones and aldehydes ==
I suggest that the topic &quot;Preparing Aldehydes and Ketones&quot; should have subtopics of &quot;Preparing Aldehydes&quot; and &quot;Preparing Ketones&quot;. Not all of the preparation methods can be used in both instances. It would help with clarity. [[User:Glich|Glich]] ([[User talk:Glich|talk]])

==New icons==
I have uploaded to the Commons two pictographs that I made:
[[Image:OrgChem_Nomen_pictograph.png]], [[Image:3 flasks pictograph.png]]. They are both public domain. [[User:Ramir|Ramir]] 13:19, 31 May 2005 (UTC)

== Official Headers / Footers ==

Hello all!  This is an amazing book so far, and I look forward to editing it.  I'm curious which pages include the 'official' Header and Footer (including the little ethane icon).  I'd be happy to standardize as many as I can, but I need to know which you prefer for the standard.

Cheers! [[User:Buxtor|Buxtor]] 22:44, 2 June 2005 (UTC)

== Standard Structure Format? ==

Hey All! There's really quite an impressive array of work here. I'm concerned, though, that there's no nice standard way to display chemical structures. While we don't have the same engine as the math guys do for displaying sturucture like they do equations, we can still try and settle on one program and settings for making structures, no? I'd recommend Chemdraw, ACS template with the bold width 2.5 and line width 1.5. --[[User:Lineweaver|Lineweaver]] 08:46, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] ==

Great work you are doing here. However I must suggest you have a look at the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]].

:Indeed, I shall berenaming all pages in this book so that they start with &quot;Organic Chemistry/&quot;. This will make this book consistent with most other wikibooks, plus allow for easier navigation. I trust this change will be non-controversial (especially as it is being done in a way that preserves all links), [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:41, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

== Print Version of this Wikibook ==

If you look at [[Organic Chemistry/Print Version]], I've put together a compilation of most of the pages for this Wikibook.  I have excluded pages that have not been created yet (so if you add new pages, it might be good to put them here), and I'm still working on the appendix sections.

Feel free to edit and work on this print version, but it is looking pretty nice at the moment.  Don't worry about keeping the content up to date, as if you work on adding just content to the existing parts of this Wikibook it will also be updated in the print version automatically.  This is done through the transclusion process.  Some minor reorganization may have to be done with the various sections, and there is some duplication of a few items that still needs to be dealt with.

Anyway, have fun with this content.  BTW, I'm preparing to make a PDF version of the print version, but it would also be nice to clean up the content before we make this &quot;official&quot;.  There are far too many red linked images, and I'm not sure exactly what happened here to make them red links.  I can't find any history of those images from the deletion log.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:49, 13 March 2006 (UTC)


==A page move==
I've started doing work on the [[Organic_Chemistry/Introduction_to_reactions/Substitution_reactions|Substitution Reactions]] page, but I'd like to rename the page, '''Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions''' because it's a little more accurate as well as being more descriptive. I assume this is done simply by &quot;moving&quot; the page. Being new at this, however, I'm reluctant to make such a change without someone saying &quot;go ahead and do it.&quot; I read the noob stuff and it said, &quot;be bold&quot;, but I'm drawing the line at moving a page, for the moment.
--[[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 15:25, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

==Duplication==
The [[Organic Chemistry/Haloalkanes|Haloalkanes]] page has a short section on reaction mechanisms that duplicates a lot of what is discussed (and in some cases, contradicts) in [[Organic_Chemistry/Introduction_to_reactions/Substitution_reactions|Substitution Reactions]]. I haven't yet gotten to the Elimination reactions page, so I don't know if there are contradictions there, but there is surely some duplication.

It's probably best to link to the Substitution Reactions and Elimination pages from Haloalkanes and move whatever is needed from the Haloalkanes page.

As for contradictions, the first thing that caught my eye (since I was updating this in the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction mechanism, is that in the Haloalkanes page, it says non-polar solvents are preferred. This is, as far as I know, incorrect. Aprotic polar solvents are preferred in S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactions based on nearly every book and online source I have checked. [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 19:56, 11 November 2006 (UTC)

== Some reorganizations ==

Okay, I've moved some stuff around a bit. I've tried to be really careful to fix all links so that they're not going to redirects or blank pages, but I have no doubt I missed something somewhere. This turned out to be a MUCH bigger project than I expected it to be.

Basically, I renamed (via a move) Alkanes and Cycloalkanes to simply Alkanes. It still has a short section on Cycloalkanes and some of this will be left there and maybe some minor changes made because it's a very short introduction to cycloalkanes.

I will add in a new section entirely on cycloalkanes, after the stereochemistry stuff which will go into much greater depth about cycloalkanes.

And the small move was Substitution Reactions was moved to Nucleophilic Substitution Reactions since that is what it was and shouldn't be confused with other types of substitution reactions.

== Standard chapter structure? ==

Should we have a standard format for each chapter? I usually go for:

1: Methods of making this class of compound (often referring to section (3) of other chapters)

2: Properties of this class of compound (including nomenclature, uses, etc)

3: Reactions of this class of compound (often leading to section (1) of other chapters)

[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 10:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)


:Ewen, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I assume you mean the chapters for each functional group.

::Yup! [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:I haven't decided how I want to do it, but I want to bring the Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination reactions stuff into an earlier place in the book, possibly in their own section. I'm also not happy with all those reactions being in the back of the book. Reactions should generally be with the class of compound they're with. If a reaction has been covered previously for another functional group, you just don't need to go into any depth about mechanism, as that will be covered the first time it comes up. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 14:20, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::I agree. I'd prefer that when a reaction type first occurs that it has its own section, so that it can be found more easily later. I'd prefer that to the reaction type being a sub-heading of some or other functional group chapter. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 14:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Precisely and I think this is how most books handle it. I mean, you go read a chapter on carboxylic acids, and in every books I think I've seen, there's a section (or actually, usually multiple sections) dealing with all the reactions related to creating carboxylic acids and reactions that carboxylic acids can take part in. Frequently, the first time that particular type of reaction is shown and it's important, the mechanism is usually laid out with electron pushing, transition states and/or intermediates... I think we need to do all that stuff. I'm all for trying new stuff, but I think the reason it's laid out in most books this way is because it makes sense to lay it out this way. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::As an additional note, I think we ought to move Alkenes and Alkynes an place them between Haloalkanes and alcohols. I think they should be discussed before alcoholis and I think Alkenes is probably the place to begin discussing reactions and reaction mechanisms, not haloalkanes. My reasoning on this is that haloalkanes are often used for creating different functional groups. For example, dehydrohalogenation to create an alkene. I mean, we might want to discuss halogenation of alkanes in the haloalkanes section, but I think that's probably the only thing. It's not a particularly useful reaction since it produces so many products, but that's really the only one I think would be useful there since most of the other reactions involving haloalkanes result in the creation of different functional groups that are discussed later. Anyway, just a thought. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 16:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ewen, on a related note, in regards to structure, if you look at, for example, the Alkene chapter, notice how you go to the alkene page and it simply has links to other pages. I think this is a bad way to do it. Then if you go to Haloalkanes, it's all one one page. I think having it all on one page is the better way to do it. I think for Alkenes and Alkynes and other chapters that might be laid out that way, we ought to take the information from the sub-pages and merge it into the main page.

:::There are alsos some things there that need reorganization. Alkenes, for example, has a section on pi bonds. Pi bonds ought to be covered in the Foundations section along with other bonding stuff. I mean, Pi bonds are certainly worth mentioning elsewhere since they play a huge role, but I think they should be introduced before Alkenes. What are your thoughts? -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 20:36, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

::::Yup! Haloalkanes seems the way to go for structure. What sort of page length are we looking at before splitting them? Pi (and other) bonding is surely fundamental rather than a passing topic of relevance mainly to alkenes. I'll have a bash at some of these issues. I work in a different time zone to you don't I? We'll not have edit conflicts unless I stay up late or you get up very early 8-) [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 20:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

Wow, you've been busy today Ewen. I love what you've done with the Alkanes section... We might step on each other from time to time. I work from home and I sometimes get a little work in on the book during my lunch hour or something. I don't think there's too much danger, though. I'll be doing most of my work in the evenings and weekends, so the 6 hour (maybe 7) time difference should keep us from stepping on each other too often.

I've deicded I'm going to keep away from doing any big moves for a short while. I did that pretty big move of the Alkanes section over the weekend and it turned into a much bigger job than I expected (because of all the links that needed updating) and I just kinda bit off more than I think I was ready for, so I'm going to slow down a bit. I've also almost made some structural changes that I would have regretted because I didn't see some other stuff that was going on.

So, with that in mind, for a week or two, I'm just going to do additions here and there around the book, maybe a little cleanup, and just make sure I have a better feel for where everything is and how it's laid out, what's missing, what's duplicated, etc, and adding it to my [[Organic_Chemistry/To-Do_List|To-Do List]]. I'm also going to try to wrap up some of the stuff I've started, like the Cycloalkanes stuff and I need to do some more work on Elimination and Nucleophilic Substitution, and then bring them together in Haloalkanes, I think. It definitely makes sense to discuss Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination together, if for no other reason, than because they have a tendency to compete with each other and it's easier to address that with them together than it is to address it in each one separately. Anyway, just trying to give you a heads up on where I'm going, but I don't see us bumping heads too much in the near future... -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 22:46, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

== Chapter structure ==

Ewen, you originally proposed chapter layout made sense at the time, but in working on the Alkene section, I ran into problems with it. I think what we ought to do is put together a layout model somewhere off of the [[Organic_Chemistry/Book_outline|Outline]] page and then we'll use that as a basic layout model for all the chapters that are based on functional groups.
Here's the problem I ran into. I was writing about the synthesis of alkenes and for dehydrohalogenation, it goes by the E2 mechanism and thus is regioselective and, depending on the alkane, can produce reliably consistent products or possibly a mix of E and Z product. The problem is, the E and Z naming isn't discussed until later in the section, which made me stop in my tracks and come here.
I think we ought to consider an order like this:
# Naming
# Properties
# Reactions
Properties is sort of a catch-all for everything not falling into the other two categories. Under reactions, we'd begin with synthesis reactions, followed by the rest of the reactions. But at least, at the point that you're discussing synthesis, you can name the products without there being confusion as to what the names mean. I'm also trying to cover reaction mechanisms with the reactions, as much as possible.
But like I said, I think we ought to come up with a model chapter. Look around at other chapters and see if maybe there are specific things that we're not considering for these 3 categories. Maybe there should be other categories that aren't coming to mind right now. But we can then use that model as the basis for all the functional group chapters. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:43, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

:Yes, I was thinking that too. The structure doesn't fit well with some chapters. I should have been more flexible and not imposed a structure that didn't really fit. Live and learn! Perhaps the default structure should look like this anyhow:

::Introductory paragraph (no heading - puts it above the contents)
::Naming
:::Possible structures
::Properties
:::Physical properties (e.g. boiling point)
:::Chemical properties (e.g. acidity, toxicity)
::Reactions
:::Synthesis
:::(other reactions)

:I'm keen to list the details of synthesis reactions under their respective reactants. Haloalkanes, for example, might have a short reference to substitution of alcohols, but the main discussion is under reactions of alcohols and the haloalkanes chapter might merely reference the alcohol reaction section.

:One advantage of this moving stuff around: It helps to tidy things up! There are so many sections where work is duplicated and written to very different standards. Finding one home for each section has brought them together and made the best of them all, or highlighted the need for someone to fill a gap. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 06:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

::Ewen, I think this new order makes more sense. As for reactions, I think it's okay to mention them more than once. For example, the Wittig synthesis of Alkenes, I'm going to show the reaction and write a short paragraph about it in Alkenes, but it's a reaction between an aldehyde or ketone and a triphenylphosphonium ylide. So I'm thinking, the earliest it should be discussed in detail (i.e. mechanism details) is maybe aldehydes and ketones. So, to that degree, I don't mind duplication, as long as say, the Nucleophilic Substitution and Elimination reaction mechanisms aren't covered completely in both Alkenes and Alcohols, for example. Some reactions apply to multiple functional groups and deserve at least some mention with each of those functional groups, but the degree of duplication that's been in some places is way too much.

I'm heading off to visit my family for the traditional turkey feast and offer thanks to the native Americans for letting us steal their land and virtually wipe them out. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 13:47, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Ewen, another thing we've forgotten is problems. Currently, there are very few problem exercises for the reader to work on. For me, this is really a low priority, but we ought to consider how they should be placed in the book. I was thinking the best way would probably be to have them as links at the end of each chapter. There would be two links: A link to the problems and a link to the answers, hopefully with explanations where appropriate. My thinking is there ought to be about 50 problems per chapter. That's a lot of work in itself, but like I said, it's low on my priorities. There are so many other things that still need work. But I didn't want it to slip through the cracks. I've added it to the to-do list. -- [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] 03:26, 25 November 2006 (UTC)

== Ethers ==
I noticed that ethers are discussed in the module about alcohols.  Might it be better to move them into a module of their own? That way, readers might be able to find them more easily. I personally would not think to look for ethers under the topic of alcohols. -- [[User:WilliamJenkins09|WilliamJenkins09]] 04:25, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

:Good idea! Alternatively, we could rename 'Alcohols' as 'Alcohols and ethers'. Certainly ethers deserve a mention in the contents. [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 08:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

==Index==

Anybody know how we could add an index to the book? [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 08:40, 28 January 2007 (UTC)

== An outdated and copycat organisation ==

Why on Earth has this book been organised by functional groups? It should be organised by reaction types and mechanisms, the true basis of organisation in organic chemistry. A functional group organisation belongs to the barbaric ages when terms such as electron density and carbocation stability were unknown. Such an organisation is a very poor effort in the twenty-first century.

Also, the book is seriously lacking in comprehensiveness. Only classically important topics are included, at the expense of overwhelmingly important modern topics such as orbital symmetry rules (pericyclic reactions), borderline mechanism in solvolysis, retrosynthetic analysis, chiral synthesis, basic organometallic chemistry etc. Physical chemistry is oversimplified. For example, entropy-controlled catalysts so important in biological systems are never discussed. In fact the whole process of kinetics is misrepresented, as is the difference and relation between rate and equilibrium (that is, equilibrium thermodynamics and kinetics).

Many experimental observations are left unexplained, such as why certain reactions proceed only at certain temperatures at the presence of a certain concentration of a certain catalyst. Catalytic mechanisms are rarely given. Overall, the book in its current form continues the long-observed tradition in chemistry textbooks of emphasising rote memorisation over logical analysis and understanding. The book is in need of  major overhaul and a complete change in the organisation and outlook to make it into a truly modern organic chemistry text that actually enriches wikibooks instead of simply rehashing material from commonly available high-school texts. [[User:59.93.198.128|59.93.198.128]] 08:53, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:To take your last point first: 'High-school texts' are not 'commonly available' if you can't afford them, and the scope of this book is beyond high school anyway.

:We've discussed the organisation and the consensus seems to be that organising according to functional groups (the 'nouns' of organic chemistry, as it were) is preferable to organisation by reaction types (the 'verbs'). Why? It's the status quo.

:Perhaps the reaction types and mechanisms organisation can be included by cross-referencing the relevant sections in the various chapters. Please go ahead and add such cross-referencing.

:Your second paragraph asks about the comprehensiveness of the content: Feel free to add what you think is missing!

:[[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 10:47, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Regular access to an internet connection and a computer is not more affordable than a low price edition or second hand version of a standard text. Also, in its current form the book is written exactly at the level of Indian high-school OChem curricula (though US curricula is probably more elementary).

:: Cross-referencing can not be a substitute for organisation. Where did this discussion about organisation take place? It should be reopened. It does not make sense to use functional groups rather than mechanisms, as it is mechanisms that unite OChem into a cohesive whole. Use of functional groups creates the impression that OChem is simply about memorising seemingly unconnected mechanisms of reactions of many different functional groups. I quote a professor below:

:::&quot;...overall the books are criminally incoherent, much due to that substance classes rather than reaction classes form the &quot;basis&quot; of the chapter division [note: NOT &quot;...the basis of the 'organization'...&quot;, since organization can only exist when the reaction classes are the basis for the discussions, the one thing that brings order to organic chemistry!]; never does anyone take a more &quot;holistic&quot; or just &quot;passioned&quot; view, to actually demonstrate the monumental versatility of the concepts discussed - and exactly the same highly vital information is left out, about how to interpret or control all the hundreds of written consecutive equillibria, or what difference it makes to use the methoxide rather than the ethoxide, or why 70% phosphoric acid is used (or, indeed, what is meant by 70%), or why precisely 780K and not 775Kis needed, or how you actually carry out a single reaction and what apparatus should be used, or how you handle and isolate the substances; or how you name those compounds that show up later than the first few chapters (when all the authors suddenly forget the previous efforts of showing completeness in presentation).&quot; 
::[[User:59.93.201.127|59.93.201.127]] 18:26, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::I do appreciate your criticisms are well-intentioned and constructive.

:::If you have a problem with the content - why not write some? No amount of requests will give me, or anyone else, more time to write material. Why not use your time to add to this book instead of criticising it? You obviously have spent some time reading the book and considering its failings.

:::If you missed the [[Organic_Chemistry/Foreword|foreword]] then you may have missed some of the rationale - the intention is to supersede expensive college-level texts. You're right about the cost of computing or internet access, but this book also has a printable version - it would cost no more than the printing costs to make a copy.

:::Your suggestion for organisation is novel and interesting (thanks for proposing and explaining it), but I'm not persuaded that it's substantially better than the system we use now. I didn't use the analogy of verbs and nouns lightly: You need both to learn a language, but vocabulary is more important than grammar (to change the analogy slightly). How can we discuss the chemical reactions before we can name the chemicals and know their physical properties? 

:::You're right, though - I can't find any formal discussion of the organisation. [[User:Pdavis68|Pete]] and I discussed whether the structure should be flatter or deeper but nobody, to my knowledge, has suggested reorganising along the lines you suggest. 

:::Would you like to register and choose a username? I find it a bit odd writing to an IP address! You'd also be able to add pages like this to your 'watch' list which helps discussions.

:::Regards, [[User:Ewen|Ewen]] 19:39, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

:::: It takes significantly more money to print all these pages instead of buying the book. But irrespective of whether this book replaces or supplements standard texts,I think nobody will like it to become a copy of content that is already available.

:::: As for the organisation, if the goal was to discuss nomenclature and physical properties then the best organisation would undoubtably have been functional groups. But I think you will agree that the principal objective of a general introductory OChem text is to discuss reactions, and it is here that the advantage of a mechanistic discussion arises.

:::: Arranged by functional groups, the conversion of a halide and an alcohol into nitriles become different things, when in reality they are the same reaction, nucleophilic substitution. This separation gives a student the idea that the only way to get through OChem is to memorise the countless reaction mechanisms separately for each different class of compounds, when he would have a far easier time if only he understood that there are only a handful of basic reactions in introductory OChem and that which one occurs can be predicted (not memorised) from a knowledge of general principles and reaction conditions. Elimination of water and elimination of hydrohalide is the same reaction, but since one involves alcohol and the other halogen a student is forced to learn them separately, adding to his burden.

:::: As for functional groups being status quo, fashion can not be the foundation of science. Writing a textbook is not less important an exercise than writing a paper, and the same principles apply. Also, this status quo is increasingly being broken and most important second level OChem texts like March, Carey and Sykes have for a very long time used reaction types as their basis of organisation. It seems meaningless to deprive beginning students from what is already considered best for their seniors. Writing a good and original textbook that not simply a conventionally-organised collage from existing textbooks with sudden and inexplicable emphasis on the author's personal interests is a difficult and time-consuming task for which I don't have the time. However this labour can be significantly lessened by the collaboration offered by a wiki system, but that first requires consensus. [[User:59.93.162.4|59.93.162.4]] 07:13, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

==Organisation==

Re: [[User:59.93.162.4|59.93.162.4]]'s comments on organisation:

Bluntly; I don't think this book will be reorganised along reaction lines unless somebody has a huge amount of time to do it. I'm not sure that the majority of readers and writers would want this to happen anyway. It's my impression, but the 'consensus' seems to be to organise the book on functional group lines. Of course you're right; progress can be stymied by consensus and the status quo, but some projects develop by evolution, not revolution. Help in evolving the project is appreciated.

I think you exaggerate the problem. We have a section on reaction types - I gues sit needs expanding and re-emphasising. We also organise reactions from the viewpoint of the products, not the reactants. You say that &quot;Elimination of water and elimination of hydrohalide is the same reaction, but since one involves alcohol and the other halogen a student is forced to learn them separately, adding to his burden.&quot; but in fact both reactions form alkenes, and so the reactions are also dealt with in the alkene chapter.  Similary, it is not exaclty the  case that &quot;the conversion of a halide and an alcohol into nitriles become different things&quot; because both reactions come under nitriles too.

Thankyou for highlighting the problem: By organising along the lines of functional groups we have fragmented discussion of reaction types. I think all editors of this book should be conscious of this issue and ensure that common reaction types are cross-referenced as much as possible; and that the appendix on reaction types should be used to draw these common threads together as much as possible.

Agreed, and the wiki system ''is'' a way to share this task. However, this is an ambitious project and it is a work-in-progress. If some sections are currently further developed than others, and these sections are the result of one or other author's personal enthusiasms and interests, then is that so surprising? Eventually, the gaps will be filled (we hope).

You have identified many areas you consider under-developed. Do please dive in and develop them!

==Cost==

Re: [[User:59.93.162.4|59.93.162.4]]'s comments on cost:

The aim of the book is to make it as comprehensive and up-to-date as can be, with constant revisions. The competition would be the books listed on the Main Page, which are more expensive than the wikibook. Of course, you could buy an inferior book or on old copy of a good one; but the quality of this wikibook should justify its limited cost. We're not there yet; but already for the many students who have free internet access through their colleges the cost of this book cannot be beaten.

==Would like to contribute==
:I would like to contribute at this site. I am a scholarly chemical professional.  However, to do so I would have three prerequisites.  
*First, there would have to be an '''''agreed upon outline of the material that will appear''''', understanding that this will maintain some flexibility as the writing proceeds. The outline should seek to be consistent across Wikipedia-related venues. People who collaborate, seriously, in scientific textbook writing do so after early agreeing upon an outline to follow.  For instance, I am now working on an outline for the Wikipedia ochem article, to guide a major reedit, amalgamating the Clayden text's approach, with the William Reusch msu.edu Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry [http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/intro1.htm], and 1-2 of the key American textbooks. Where is the comparable discussion here, about ''the goal'' of this textbook writing effort?
*Second, since there does not appear to be the requirement or conviction to source the information appearing here, and since Wikipedia demands no credentials of participants, there would have to be an '''''agreed upon set of sources''''', and discussion about how these would be prioritised when there are discrepancies. (Anyone teaching ochem knows that there are mistakes in published texts, some gross and some subtle, and there are many differences in emphasis as well, that together will require discussion.) Is there currently a list of sources that are agreed upon as having reliable material, and suitable level of presentation? Otherwise, where are we getting our material from?
*Third and finally, '''''attention would need to be paid to the contributor list''''', keeping it up to date, and using this Talk as a convenient way to speak to all caring about the text or otherwise involved in the project, so all could be pre-notified about any major change, and collegially discuss any issues that might arise.
I also believe that one person should emerge as a senior editor on the project, to mediate issues that might arise, and, more importantly, to review text to create a scientifically stylistically consistent final product. More on this hope/expectation, later.  Le Prof  [[User:Leprof 7272|Leprof 7272]] ([[User talk:Leprof 7272|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Leprof 7272|contribs]]) 15:37, 15 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi! I just reviewed your book for [[Wikibooks:Development stages]]. I suggest that you have a look how to set mathematical formulae. It would make the excercises easier to read. Have a look at [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]] or check out this example:
&lt;math&gt;\sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta)=1&lt;/math&gt;
--[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 23:57, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I was looking for a project like this to contribute. I like to make a database of excercises of physics. I think that a book of Physics exercises would be better if it contains both solved and unsolved problems. What do you think?

--gabrielvc, wikibooks user--

: I think it is better to have the solutions around somewhere for reference. They don't have to be on the same page though as it is now. Also, the solutions don't have to be written by you, but you might encourage others to provide them. Also, there might be a &quot;Teacher's wikibook&quot; that contains solutions to exercises without solutions in this book? So there is no point in omitting solutions in a wiki... Also, this is the only way to look for errors, should the exercises by accident be wrong or unsolvable... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:37, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Merge into Physics Study Guide? ==
I think this book would be better served as part of the [[Physics Study Guide]] book since the goal is to have worked examples to study from --[[User:msmithma|Mart&amp;iacute;n S-M]]
: At the moment, Physics Study Guide links to this book (as an appendix), and IMHO, that seems like the best thing to do. The Study Guide, as a whole, does not focus on problems (more of a quick-review guide, it seemed like), and having problems interpersed throughout the guide will rather be distracting, not to mention it does not serve those students/instructors who are simply looking for problems to work out. I am removing the merge tag, as it appears to have been done already. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 07:01, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Automatically numbered equations ==

How do you do that? Also, is it possible to just upload postscript or PDF files instead of typing text here? [[User:Count Iblis|Count Iblis]] 01:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
: Automatically numbered questions are done through HTML lists, or in Wiki markup, by lists starting with &quot;#&quot;, like
# First question
# Second question
: I should note that this notation is rather fragile (if you break the list, it'll restart numbering), so there are a lot of stuffs in between, you should use ordered HTML list like (see code)
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; First question&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Second question&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
: And, no, I don't think there's a way to just upload PS or PDF files. There are tools that will turn PS or PDF to HTML code, and you can *probably* more or less paste that in here, but short of making a link to a PS or PDF file (which I don't think is recommended), you can't do that. [[User:Novakyu|novakyu]] ([[User talk:Novakyu|talk]]) 06:52, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Refraction exercises ==

I think [[A-level Physics (Advancing Physics)/Refraction/Worked Solutions]] should be included here, either as a copy or as a redirect. [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 20:43, 18 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

You should have already had a look at the page [[Portuguese/Contents/Definite and Indefinite Articles|Definite and Indefinite Articles]]. If you haven't, have a look over it. Now it's time to have a little practice, as well as learn some vocabulary. It might be best to print this page out or copy it to fill out in a word processing application.

Note that when a word ends in an '''-s''' it is plural: to determine whether it is masculine or feminine, take off the '''-s''' (or sometimes '''-es''' if the word ends in '''-res''', '''-ses''' or '''zes''') to determine gender. Pay attention to the real meaning of the word because the way to determine gender needs it.

In this lesson you will learn how to ask and identify objects.
== Lesson ==
=== What is that? ===
When you want to ask someone what something is, you might ask
* Kanji and hiragana: それは何ですか
* Hiragana: それ　は　なん　です　か 
* Romaji: ''sore wa nan desu ka?''
* English: What's that?

==== Words ====
* '''[[wiktionary:それ|それ]]''' means &quot;that&quot; (''sore'')
* '''[[wiktionary:何|何]]''' ([[wiktionary:なん|なん]], ''nan'') means &quot;what&quot; (from [[wiktionary:なに|なに]], ''nani'')
* Recall that AはBです (''A wa B desu'') means &quot;A is B.&quot; 
* '''[[wiktionary:か|か]]''' (''ka'') is the question particle. Questions are formed by adding か to the end of a sentence. Unlike English, the word order doesn't change. Question words, such as 何 (&quot;what&quot;), simply replace the words you are asking about.

As in English, you would ask about an object depending on its distance from yourself (speaker) and the person you are talking to (listener). In Japanese, there are three words denoting an object's distance from the speaker and listener.
* [[wiktionary:これ|これ]] (''kore'') &quot;this&quot; - refers to an object '''near the speaker''' (e.g., you are holding the object)
* [[wiktionary:それ|それ]] (''sore'') &quot;that&quot; - refers to an object '''near the listener''' (e.g., the person you are talking to is holding the object)
* [[wiktionary:あれ|あれ]] (''are'') &quot;that over there&quot; - refers to an object that is '''far away from both speaker and listener'''.

To summarize, これ (''kore'', this), それ (''sore'', that), あれ (''are'', that - far).

=== That is a... ===
To reply to the question それは何ですか you would say これは___です. &quot;This is a ___.&quot; You should use the name of the object in place of the blank.

In the above question, person A used それ to indicate the object is near person B. In response, person B uses これ to indicate the object is near person B.

'''Note:''' The distance of an object from the speaker and listener is taken into consideration when asking or responding to a question. You must familiarize yourself with これ・それ・あれ

Try to remember how to reply to a question with these tips.
* When someone asks you これ, you reply それ.
* When someone asks you それ, you reply これ.
* When someone asks you あれ, you also reply あれ.

=== も - Also ===
When you want to ask or say that something is also a type of object, you use the particle も.
* Question: これ / それ / あれ'''も'''___ですか &quot;Is this/that/that (far) '''also''' a ___?&quot;

There are two possible responses to this question...

If the answer is affirmative, you say 「はい、これ/それ/あれも___です。」.

If the answer is negative, you say 「いいえ、これ/それ/あれは___では　ありません」. (では is pronounced /dewa/, or /ja/ in less formal conversation.) 

* はい means &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; 
* いいえ means &quot;no&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; 
* ___では　ありません means &quot;is not ___&quot;. When you want to say something is not a type of object you use this phrase.

=== の - Possessive particle ===
The possessive particle, の, is added after a noun or pronoun to indicate that an object belongs to them.

==== Example ====
* それは私の___です。 &quot;That is my ___.&quot;
* あれは___さんの___ですか。 &quot;Is that (far) ___-san's ___?&quot;
* これは私の___ではありません。 &quot;This is not my ___.&quot;
'''''Note:''''' You can omit the name of the object.
* 私のです。 &quot;It's mine.&quot;
* ___さんのです。 &quot;It's ___-san's.&quot;
* 私のではありません。 &quot;It's not mine.&quot;

=== Whose is this? ===
A useful phrase to use is 「これは誰の___ですか。」 (これは　だれの ___　ですか) &quot;Whose ___ is this?&quot; or 「これは誰のですか」 &quot;Whose is this?&quot;

=== More specific ===
これ・それ・あれ, which was used to indicate an object's location can be used in their more specific form of この・その・あの to refer to a specific object.
* この車 (この　くるま) &quot;This (particular) car.&quot;
* そのペン　&quot;That (particular) pen.&quot;
'''''Note:''''' これ車, これペン is not possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Imperfect Tense ==
The imperfect Tense is used in Portuguese to express something that was happening at a particular moment in time. For instance, we would NOT use the imperfect for the sentence &quot;I ate an apple&quot; because the action has finished. However, the sentence &quot;I was eating an apple&quot; describes something that was happening at a moment in time.

Let's see how to form the imperfect tense. First, take the &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;er&quot; or &quot;ir&quot; off the infinitive (so '''falar''' becomes '''fal''', '''comer''' becomes '''com''' and '''partir''' becomes '''part'''
==Regular -ar verbs==

    &lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Regular -er and -ir verbs==
You only need to learn one conjugation for the 'ir' and 'er' verbs. That means that the verb '''partir''' is conjugated exactly like '''comer''' in the imperfect tense.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you want to say that something exists, there two verbs you have to choose from depending on whether the subject is an ''animate-'' or ''inanimate object''. The difference is not quite living/non-living, as plants would be considered inanimate (as they don't move ... well, most only really slowly). A fish swimming in its fish-bowl would be an animate object, but a dead fish (whether at the fish-mongers or — let's hope not — in its bowl) would be in-animate.

* For '''animate''' objects (humans and animals), use &quot;いる&quot; (polite present positive: &quot;います&quot;).
* For '''inanimate''' objects, use &quot;ある&quot; (polite present positive: &quot;あります&quot;).

Note that these can denote both presence or possession.

In the dialogues below, you may replace &quot;います&quot; with &quot;あります&quot;.

== Dialogue ==
=== The presence of no particular object ===
{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= 何かいますか。
| english = Is something (animate) there?
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= &lt;animate object&gt; がいます。
| english = There's a &lt;animate object&gt;.
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= 何もいません。 (なにも　いません)
| english = There's nothing.
}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

=== To ask about the presence of a particular animate object ===
{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= &lt;object&gt; がいますか。
| english = Is there a &lt;animate object&gt;?
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= はい、います。
| english = Yes, it's there.
}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese= いいえ、いません。
| english = No, it's not there.
}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

If the animate object in question is not present but something else is, you can suggest this by saying:
{{Japanese conversation|begin}}
{{Japanese conversation
| japanese=いいえ、&lt;animate object&gt; はいません。
| english = No, &lt;animate object&gt; is not there.
}}
{{Japanese conversation|end}}

Notice that this reply uses &quot;は&quot; instead of &quot;が&quot;. The &quot;は&quot; particle can be translated as &quot;as for such and such&quot;, while &quot;が&quot; directly marks the subject.{{citation needed}}

== Vocabulary ==
{{furi|何|なに}}か: &quot;anything/something&quot;.
{{furi|何|なに}}も: &quot;everything/nothing&quot; (positive/negative depends on the verb)

{{Japanese todo|
* Create a real dialogue above and set up a pattern structure with a discussion below.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A matroid is an algebraic construct that is related to the notion of independence.

Matroids are an abstraction of several combinatorial objects, among them graphs and matrices. The word matroid was coined by Whitney in 1935 in his landmark paper &quot;On the abstract properties of linear dependence&quot;. In defining a matroid Whitney tried to capture the fundamental properties of dependence that are common to graphs and matrices. Almost simultaneously, Birkhoff showed that a matroid can be interpreted as a geometric lattice. Maclane showed that matroids have a geometric representation in terms of points, lines, planes, dimension 3 spaces etc. Often the term combinatorial geometry is used instead of simple matroids. However, combinatorial geometry has another meaning in mathematical literature. Rank 3 combinatorial geometries are frequently called linear spaces. Matroids are a unifying concept in which some problems in graph theory, design theory, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization become simpler to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">How do you think about languages as you study them? Typically, you will consider every punctuation mark and letter, all the verbs and nouns, adverbs and adjectives, and study them in order to make connections. Ideally, you will have a teacher to point you in the right direction, and help you make those connections. But when you have no teacher, these connections are left for you to discover. They may be clear or hidden, but either way you will have to make them yourself. As you explore this Wikibook, it will require the skill of critical thinking.

You can never go wrong studying a language if you remember that exposing yourself to a language, even if you stumble in practice, is itself learning it. Looking things up too much can sometimes impede progress. Stretch your memory, read slowly, and re-read. As you will soon discover, you are about to study a language that is rich and full of meaning, an ancestor of many modern languages spoken around the world, including romance languages, like Spanish, French, Italian, Romanian, and even English.

== So do not assume that... ==
...Latin is like any other language. Do not assume ancient Roman culture is entirely unlike other cultures, however. The Romans grappled with issues that are universally dealt with.

We, the authors, endorse memorization, and after that, immersion. You must develop Latin muscles, and a willingness to write or type things out, or drill using software, or with a friend. Note the patterns after you have memorized the forms, not before. Allow yourself to be mesmerized by them. Similarly, seek out explanation only after you have memorized forms. Memorize forms, then make sentences, then use your knowledge to speak the language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Q Basic uses REM to insert descriptions and comments in source program

==Commands==
====ABS()====
 N = ABS(expression returning a numerical value)

Returns the 'absolute' value of the expression, turning a negative to a positive (e.g. -4 to 4)

&lt;pre&gt;PRINT ABS(54.345) 'This will print the value ABS now as it is (54.345)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;PRINT ABS(-43)    'This will print the value as (43)&lt;/pre&gt;

====ACCESS====

&lt;pre&gt;OPEN &quot;file.txt&quot; FOR APPEND ACCESS WRITE&lt;/pre&gt;

This sets the access of a file that has been declared into the program. There are three settings that the programmer can set. These are:
 READ - Sets up the file to be read only, no writing.
 WRITE - Writes only to the file. Cannot be read.
 READ WRITE - Sets the file to both of the settings above.

APPEND means 'add' to the 'end of' the existing &quot;file.txt&quot;. If omitted, any existing &quot;file.txt&quot; is over-written without warning

====ASC()====

&lt;pre&gt;PRINT ASC(&quot;t&quot;)  'Will print 116&lt;/pre&gt;

Prints the ASCII code number of the character found within the brackets. If the programmer put in a string into brackets, only the first character of the string will be shown.

====ATN()====

 ATN(expression)

Part of the inbuilt trigonometry functions. An expression that evaluates to a numeric vale is converted to it's Arc-Tangent.
 angle = ATN( B ) 
 angle2 = ATN( 23 / 34 )

====BEEP====
 BEEP
The BIOS on the motherboard is instructed to emit a &quot;Beep&quot; sound from the PC 'speaker'. See also SOUND and PLAY.

====CASE====
 SELECT CASE [variable]
 CASE [value]: [command]
 CASE ELSE: [command]
 END SELECT
Use this when using multiple values in your program and assigning them separate paths. This is an example of a program with no CASE commands that assigns different paths to values:
 10 PRINT &quot;1. Print 'path'&quot;
 PRINT &quot;2. Print 'hello&quot;
 PRINT &quot;3. Quit&quot;
 INPUT &quot;Enter a choice: &quot;; a$
 IF a$ = &quot;1&quot; THEN
 PRINT &quot;path&quot;
 GOTO 10
 IF a$ = &quot;2&quot; THEN
 PRINT &quot;hello&quot;
 GOTO 10
 IF a$ = &quot;3&quot; THEN END
 PRINT &quot;That is not a valid choice&quot;
 GOTO 10
This is what a program looks like with the CASE command:
 PRINT &quot;1. Print 'path'&quot;
 PRINT &quot;2. Print 'Hello'&quot;
 PRINT &quot;3. Quit&quot;
 INPUT &quot;Enter a choice: &quot;; a$
 SELECT CASE a$
 CASE &quot;1&quot;:
 PRINT &quot;path&quot;
 CASE &quot;2&quot;:
 PRINT &quot;Hello&quot;
 CASE &quot;3&quot;:
 END
 CASE ELSE:
 PRINT &quot;That is not a valid choice&quot;
 END SELECT

====CHAIN====
 CHAIN {filename.format (parameters list)}

This 'calls' (transfers execution) to another program (typically another .bas file, a command (.bat or .cmd) script or an executable (.com, .exe) ).

Values may be passed directly in the invoking command (to files accepting command line parameters). Values may be passed to another basic script by using the 'COMMON' statement before the CHAIN command.

Control returns to the basic interpreter when the 'chained' program terminates.

====CHDIR====
 CHDIR [directory name]
This is used for changing a directory. Used in conjunction with MKDIR and RMDIR. The directory name is declared exactly like in DOS PROMPT. For example:
 CHDIR &quot;c:/Program Files/QBasic_FIles/Testing_Files&quot;
To use this command, the programmer will have to know how MS DOS and COMMAND PROMPT work.

====CHR$()====
This returns the string character symbol of an ASCII code value.
 name$ = CHR$([acsii character code])
Often used to 'load' characters into string variables when that character cannot be typed (e.g. the Esc key or the F{n} (Function Keys) or characters that would be 'recognised' and acted upon by QBASIC interpreter (eg &quot;, the double quote). Here is a list of some character codes :-
 07 Beep (same as BEEP)
 08 Backspace
 09 Tab
 27 Esc
 34 Double quote
 72 Up Arrow
 75 Left Arrow
 77 Right Arrow
 80 Down Arrow

====CINT()====
This rounds the contents of the brackets to the nearest integer.
 PRINT CINT(4573.73994596)
4574

====CIRCLE====
 CIRCLE ([X Coordinate], [Y Coordinate]), [Radius], [Colour]
Lets the programmer display a circle. Like all graphics commands, it must be used with the SCREEN command.
====CLEAR====
 CLEAR
Resets all variables, strings, arrays and closes all files. The reset command on QBasic.
====CLOSE====
 CLOSE
Closes all open files
 CLOSE #2
Closes only the file opened as data stream 2. Other files remain open

====CLS====
 CLS
Clears the active screen. Erases all text, graphics, resets the cursor to the upper left (1,1), and also applies the current background color (this has to be set using the COLOR command) to the whole screen.

====COLOR====
 COLOR [Text Colour], [Background Colour]
This lets you change the colour of the text and background used when next 'printing' to the current output window. It can be done like this:
 COLOR 14, 01
 PRINT &quot;Yellow on Blue&quot;

You have a choice of sixteen colours:
 00: Black            08: Dark Grey
 01: Dark Blue        09: Light Blue
 02: Dark Green       10: Light Green
 03: Dark Cyan        11: Light Cyan
 04: Dark Red         12: Light Red
 05: Dark Purple      13: Magenta
 06: Orange Brown     14: Yellow
 07: Grey             15: White
These values are the numbers that you put in the COLOR command.

Note Only screen modes 0, 7, 8, 9, 10 support a background color. To 're-paint' the whole screen in a background colour, use the CLS command.

====COMMON====
Declares a variable as 'global', which allows its value to be accessed across multiple QBasic programs / scripts (see also the CHAIN command) 
 COMMON SHARED [variablename]

Each program that declares 'variablename' as COMMON will share the same value.

NOTE. All COMMON statements must appear at the start of the program (i.e. before any executable statements).

====CONST====
Fixes a variable so it can not be changed within the program.
 CONST (name) {AS (type = INTEGER / STRING)} = (expression or value)
For example :-
 CONST PI = 3.14159265
Assigns the value 3.14159265 to PI.
 CONST PI2 = 2 * PI
PI must be assigned a value before it is used to calculate PI2. Typically all CONST are declared at the beginning of a program.

====DATA====
 DATA [constant]
Use in conjunction with the READ and RESTORE command. Mostly used in programs dealing with graphics, this command lets QBasic read a large number of constants. The READ command accesses the data while the RESTORE command &quot;refreshes&quot; the data, allowing it to be used again.

====DATE$====
A system variable that always contains the current date as a string in mm-dd-yyyy format. Use it like this:
 a$ = DATE$

====DIM====
This is used to declare an array (early versions of Basic required all variables to be defined, not just arrays greater than 10)

 DIM [Array Name] ([count],[count], ..)

The Array name can be of any type (Integer, Double, String etc). If not declared, single precision floating point is assumed. Strings can be 'declared' using $ sign (Integers with the '%' sign). The QBASIC interpreter tolerates numeric arrays of up to 10 count without these needing to be declared.

NOTE Early versions of QBasic did not explicitly set the contents of an array to zero (see CLEAR command)

 DIM table%(100,2)
Create an integer array called table% containing 100x2 = 200 entries

 DIM form$(5)
Create a string array called form$ containing 5 strings

 DIM quotient(20) AS DOUBLE
Create an array called quotient that contains 20 double precision numbers

====DO .. LOOP====
 DO
 [program]
 LOOP UNTIL [test condition becomes TRUE]
Used to create a loop in the program. The [condition] is tested only after the [program] code is executed for the first time (see also WHILE). For example:
 num$ = 1
 sum$ = 0
 DO
 sum$ = 2 * num$
 PRINT sum$
 num$ = num$ + 1
 LOOP UNTIL num$ = 13
This program outputs the Two Times Tables up to 12. The Reason why we put 13 is that the program stops at that point and does not continue the loop. If we put LOOP UNTIL num$ = 12 the last output on the screen would be &quot;22&quot;.

See also EXIT DO

====DRAW====
 DRAW &quot;[string expression]&quot;
Used to draw a straight line from the current 'cursor' position in the current colour. DRAW defines the direction (up, down etc.) and the length of the line (in pixels). For example:-
 SCREEN 7
 PSET (50, 50), 4
 DRAW &quot;u50 r50 d50 l50&quot;
 
The letter in front of each number is the direction:
 U = Up    E = Upper-right
 D = Down  F = Lower-right
 L = Left  G = Lower-left
 R = Right H = Upper-left

The drawing 'cursor' is left at the position where the line ends.
u50 draws from 50,50 upwards ending at 50,0
r50 draws from 50,0 to the right, ending at 100,0
d50 draws from 100,0 downwards, ending at 100,50
l50 draws from 100,50 to the left, ending at 50,50

The example shown will thus draw a red 'wire frame' square.

See also LINE and CIRCLE commands.

Note: Pixels are square. The diagonal from 0,0 to 100,100 will be 100 * root(2) pixels long (i.e. 141)

====END====
 END
Signifies the end of the program. When QBasic sees this command it usually comes up with a statement saying: &quot;Press Any Key to Continue&quot;.
====END IF====
 END IF
Ends the program if a condition is reached.
====ENVIRON====
 ENVIRON [string expression]
NOTE: If you are running QBasic on a Windows system, you will not be able to use this command.

This command lets you set an environment variable for the duration of the session. On exit from the QBasic.exe interpreter, the variables revert to their original values.

====EOF()====
This checks if there are still more data values to be read from the file specified in (). EOF() returns a boolean / binary value, a one or zero. 0 if the end of file has not been reached, 1 if the last value in the file has been read (see also LINE INPUT)

 OPEN File.txt FOR INPUT AS #1
 DO
 INPUT #1, text$
 PRINT text$
 LOOP UNTIL EOF(1)
 END

Note that, since the INPUT is executed before UNITIL is reached, File.txt must contain at least one line of text - if the file is empty, you will receive an 'ERROR (62) Input past end of file'.

====ERASE====
 ERASE [arrayname] [,]
Used to erase all dimensioned arrays.
====ERROR====
System variable holding a numeric value relating to the processing of the previous line of code. If the line completed without error, ERROR is set to 0. If the line failed, ERROR is set to one of the values shown below. Most commonly used to redirect program flow to error handling code as in :-
 ON ERROR GOTO [line number / label]
If ERROR is non=zero, program flow jumps to the line number or label specified. If ERROR is zero, program flow continues with the next line below.

To manually test your program and check to see if the error handling routine runs OK, ERROR can be set manually :- 
 ERROR [number]
Set ERROR = number

The error numbers are as follows:
 1 NEXT without FOR                 39 CASE ELSE expected 
 2 Syntax Error                     40 Variable required 
 3 RETURN without GOSUB             50 FIELD overflow 
 4 Out of DATA                      51 Internal error

 8 Label not defined                55 File already open 
 9 Subscript out of range           56 FIELD statement active 
 10 Duplicate definition            57 Device I/O error 
 11 Division by zero                58 File already exists 
 12 Illegal in direct mode          59 Bad record length 
 13 Type mismatch                   61 Disk full 
 14 Out of string space             62 Input past end of file 
 16 String formula too complex      63 Bad record number 
 17 Cannot continue                 64 Bad file name 
 18 Function not defined            67 Too many files 
 19 No RESUME                       68 Device unavailable 
 20 RESUME without error            69 Communication-buffer overflow

 37 Argument-count mismatch 
 38 Array not defined

Note that ERROR is set when execution fails, not when the code is 'read' - so, for example, a 'divide by 0' will be found before the result is assigned to a non-existent array variable or written to a non-existent file.
====EXIT====
Allows the immediate exit from a subroutine or a loop, without processing the rest of that subroutine or loop code  

 EXIT DEF
Exits from a DEF FN function.
 EXIT DO
Exits from a DO loop, execution continues with the command directly after the LOOP command
 EXIT FOR
Exits from a FOR loop, execution continues with the command directly after the NEXT command
 EXIT FUNCTION
Exits a FUNCTION procedure, execution continues with the command directly after the function call
 EXIT SUB
Exits a SUB procedure.

====FOR .. NEXT====
 FOR [variable name] = [start value] TO [end value] {STEP n}
 [program  code]
 NEXT [variable name]

The variable is set to the [start value], then program code is executed and at the Next statement the variable is incremented by 1 (or by the STEP value, if any is specified). The resulting value is compared to the [end value] and &lt;b&gt;if not equal&lt;/b&gt; program flow returns to the line following the FOR statement.

For example:
 FOR a = 200 TO 197 STEP-1
 PRINT a
 NEXT a

200
199
198

Care must be taken when using STEP, since it is quite possible to step past the (end value) with the result that the FOR loop will run 'for ever' (i.e. until the user aborts the interpreter or an error occurs), for example :-

 FOR a = 200 TO 197 STEP-2
 PRINT a
 NEXT a

200
198
196
194
192
...
0
-2
-4
...
-32768
ERROR overflow

====GOSUB====
 GOSUB [subroutine line number / label]
Command processing jumps to the subroutine specified. When the RETURN command is encountered, processing returns to this point and  continues with the line below the GOSUB.

====IF====
 IF [variable or string] [operator] [variable or string] THEN [command] {ELSE [command]}
Compares variables or strings. For example, if you wanted to examine whether or not a user-entered password was the correct password, you might enter:&lt;br&gt;
IF a$ = &quot;password&quot; THEN PRINT &quot;Password Correct&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Where a$ is the user entered password. Some operators include:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;=&quot;- equal to&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;&quot;- less than (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&gt;&quot;- greater than (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;- does not equal&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&lt;=&quot;- less than or equal to (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&gt;=&quot;- greater than or equal to (only used when variable or string is a number value)&lt;br&gt;
One can also preform actions to number values then compare them to other strings or variables using the if command, such as in the below examples:&lt;br&gt;
IF a+5 = 15 THEN PRINT &quot;Correct&quot;&lt;br&gt;
IF a*6 = b*8 THEN PRINT &quot;Correct&quot; &lt;br&gt;

====INCLUDE====

[[QBasic]] supports the use of include files via the $INCLUDE directive:

 '$INCLUDE: 'foobar.bi'

Note that the include directive is prefixed with an apostrophe, dollar, and that the name of the file for inclusion is enclosed in single quotation mark symbols.

====INKEY$====
 [variable] = INKEY$
This is used when you want a program to function with key input from the keyboard. Look at this example on how this works:
 a$ = INKEY$
 PRINT &quot;Press Esc to Exit&quot;
 END IF a$ = CHR$(27)
You can use this in conjunction with the CHR$ command or type the letter (e.g. A).

====INPUT====
 INPUT [String Literal] [,or;] [Variable]
Displays the String Literal, if a semi colon follows the string literal, a question mark is displayed, and the users input until they hit return is entered into the variable. The variable can be a string or numeric. If a user attempts to enter a string for a numeric variable, the program will ask for the input again. The String Literal is option. If the string literal is used, a comma (,) or semicolon (;) is necessary.

====INPUT #====
 INPUT #n [String Literal] [,or;] [Variable]
Reads a string / value from the specified file stream (see also LINE INPUT #)
 INPUT #1, a$, b$, n, m
Reads 4 values from the file that is OPEN as #1. a$ is assigned all text until a ',' (comma) or end of line is reached, b$ the next segment of text, then two numeric values are interpreted and assigned to n and m.

Note that, within the file, numbers can be separated by 'anything' - so, if a number is not found (for 'n' or 'm') on the current 'line' of the file, the rest of the file will be searched until a number is found. Input is then left 'pointing' at the position in the file after the last number required to satisfy the input statement (see also 'seek #' command)

====INSTR====
 INSTR (start%, Search$, Find$)
Returns the character position of the start of the first occurrance of Find$ within Search$, starting at character position 'start%' in Search$. If Find$ is not found, 0 is returned. start% is optional (defaul = 1, the first character of Seach$)
 Pos = INSTR (&quot;abcdefghi&quot;, &quot;de&quot;)
returns 4

====LEFT$()====

 A$ = LEFT$(B$,N)

A$ is set to the left most characters of B$ ending at the Nth character.

 A$ =  LEFT$(&quot;Get the start only&quot;,4)

returns &quot;Get &quot;

See also RIGHT$(), MID$().

====LET====
 LET [variable] = [value]
Early versions of the QBasic.exe command interpreter required use of the 'LET' command to assign values to variables. Later versions did not.

 LET N = 227 / 99
 LET A$=&quot;a line of simple text&quot;

is equliavent to :-

 N = 227 / 99
 A$=&quot;a line of simple text&quot;

====LINE====
 LINE ([X], [Y]) - ([X], [Y]), [Colour Number]
Used for drawing lines in QBasic. The first X and Y are used as coordinates for the beginning of the line and the second set are used for coordinating were the end of the line is. You must put a SCREEN command at the beginning of the program to make it work.

Note. When in SCREEN 13, the Colour Number == the Palette number

====LINE INPUT #====
 LINE INPUT #1, a$
Reads a complete line as text characters from the file OPEN as stream #1 and places it in a$.

To find the 'end of line', the QBasic interpreter seaches for the 'Carriage Return' + 'Line Feed' (0x0D, 0x0A) characters. When reading text files created on UNIX/LINUX systems (where the 'Line feed' 0x0A is used on it's own to signify 'end of line'), LINE INPUT will not recognise the 'end of line' and will continue to input until the end of file is reached. For files exceeding 2k characters, the result is an &quot;Out of String Space&quot; Error as a$ 'overflows'. One solution is to use a text editor able to handle UNIX files to open and 'save as' before atempting to process the file using QBasic.

====LOADIMAGE====
_LOADIMAGE(&quot;image.jpg&quot;)

Shows an image. Must be used with the commands SCREEN, _NEWIMAGE and _PUTIMAGE.

Example: 

DIM rabbit AS LONG
SCREEN _NEWIMAGE(800, 600, 32)
rabbit = _LOADIMAGE(&quot;rabbit.jpg&quot;)
_PUTIMAGE (100,100), rabbit 

====LOOP====
 DO
 [Program]
 LOOP UNTIL [condition]
Used to create a loop in the program. This command checks the condition after the loop has started. This is used in conjunction with the DO command.

====LPRINT====
 LPRINT [statement or variable]
Prints out text to a printer.
The LPRINT command expects a printer to be connected to the LPT1(PRN) port. If a printer is not connected to LPT1, QBasic displays a &quot;Device fault&quot; error message.

If your printer is connected to a COM port instead, use the MS-DOS MODE command to redirect printing from LPT1 to COMx (for example, to redirect to COM1, use the following command:
    MODE LPT1=COM1

If you need to cancel the redirection when finished, use the following command:
    MODE LPT1

====MID$====
  a$=MID$(string$,start%[,length%])
  MID$(string$,start%[,length%])=b$

In the first use, a$ is set to the substring taken from string$ strating with character start% taking Length% characters. If length% is omitted, the rest of the line (i.e. start% and all the characters to the right) are taken.

In the second use, length% characters of string$ are replaced by b$ starting at start%. If length% is omitted, the rest of the line is replaced (i.e. start% and all the chracters to the right)

See also LEFT$ RIGHT$ LEN

====OPEN====
 OPEN &quot;[(path)\8.3 file name.ext]&quot; (FOR {INPUT/OUTPUT} AS #{n})
This opens a file. You have to give the DOS file name, for example:
 OPEN &quot;data.txt&quot; FOR INPUT AS #1
Opens the existing file data.txt for reading as data stream #1. Since no path is specified, the file must be in the same folder as the QBasic.exe - if not, processing halts with a 'file not found' error
 OPEN &quot;C:\TEMP\RUN.LOG&quot; FOR OUTPUT AS #2
Opens an empty file named RUN.LOG in the C:\TEMP folder for writing data stream #2. Any existing file of the same name is replaced.

====PALETTE====
 PALETTE[palette number, required colour]
For VGA (SCREEN mode 13) only, sets the Palette entry to a new RGB color. The palette number must be in the range 1-256. The required colour is a LONG integer created from the sum of (required Blue * 65536) + (required Green * 256) + required Red.

====READ====
 READ [Variable]
Used in conjunction with the DATA command, this command lets QBasic read data. This is mostly used when dealing with large quantities of data like bitmaps.
====REM or '====
 REM {comments}
 ' {comments}
When the interpreter encounters REM or &quot; ' &quot; (a single quote) at the start of a line, the rest of the line is ignored

====RETURN====
 RETURN
Signifies that it is the end of a subroutines
====PLAY====
 PLAY &quot;[string expression]&quot;
Used to play notes and a score in QBasic on the PC speaker. The tones are indicated by letters A through G. Accidentals are indicated with a &quot;+&quot; or &quot;#&quot; (for sharp) or &quot;-&quot; (for flat) immediately after the note letter. See this example:
 PLAY &quot;C C# C C#&quot;
Whitespaces are ignored inside the string expression. There are also codes that set the duration, octave and tempo. They are all case-insensitive. PLAY executes the commands or notes the order in which they appear in the string. Any indicators that change the properties are effective for the notes following that indicator.
 Ln     Sets the duration (length) of the notes. The variable n does not indicate an actual duration
        amount but rather a note type; L1 - whole note, L2 - half note, L4 - quarter note, etc.
        (L8, L16, L32, L64, ...). By default, n = 4.
        For triplets and quintets, use L3, L6, L12, ... and L5, L10, L20, ... series respectively.
        The shorthand notation of length is also provided for a note. For example, &quot;L4 CDE L8 FG L4 AB&quot;
        can be shortened to &quot;L4 CDE F8G8 AB&quot;. F and G play as eighth notes while others play as quarter notes.
 On     Sets the current octave. Valid values for n are 0 through 6. An octave begins with C and ends with B.
        Remember that C- is equivalent to B. 
 &lt; &gt;    Changes the current octave respectively down or up one level.
 Nn     Plays a specified note in the seven-octave range. Valid values are from 0 to 84. (0 is a pause.)
        Cannot use with sharp and flat. Cannot use with the shorthand notation neither.
 MN     Stand for Music Normal. Note duration is 7/8ths of the length indicated by Ln. It is the default mode.
 ML     Stand for Music Legato. Note duration is full length of that indicated by Ln.
 MS     Stand for Music Staccato. Note duration is 3/4ths of the length indicated by Ln.
 Pn     Causes a silence (pause) for the length of note indicated (same as Ln). 
 Tn     Sets the number of &quot;L4&quot;s per minute (tempo). Valid values are from 32 to 255. The default value is T120. 
 .      When placed after a note, it causes the duration of the note to be 3/2 of the set duration.
        This is how to get &quot;dotted&quot; notes. &quot;L4 C#.&quot; would play C sharp as a dotted quarter note.
        It can be used for a pause as well.
 MB MF  Stand for Music Background and Music Foreground. MB places a maximum of 32 notes in the music buffer
        and plays them while executing other statements. Works very well for games.
        MF switches the PLAY mode back to normal. Default is MF.

====PRINT====
 PRINT [Argument] [,or;] [Argument]...
Displays text to the screen. The Argument can be a string literal, a string variable, a numeric literal or a numeric variable. All arguments are optional.
 PRINT #[n] [,or;] [Argument]...
Saves data to the file that is 'OPEN FOR OUTPUT AS #[n]'

====PSET====
 PSET ([X coordinate],[Y coordinate]), [Pixel Colour]
This command displays pixels, either one at a time or a group of them at once. For the command to work, the program must have a SCREEN command in it.

====SCREEN====
 SCREEN [Screen Mode Number]
This command is used for displaying graphics on the screen. There are ten main types of screen modes that can be used in QBasic depending on the resolution that you want. Here is a list of what screen modes you can choose from:

SCREEN 0: Textmode, cannot be used for graphics. This the screen mode that text based programs run on.

SCREEN 1: 320 x 200 Resolution. Four Colours

SCREEN 2: 640 x 200 Resolution. Two Colours (Black and White)

SCREEN 7: 320 x 200 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 8: 640 x 200 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 9: 640 x 350 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 10: 640 x 350 Resolution. Two Colours (Black and White)

SCREEN 11: 640 x 480 Resolution. Two Colours

SCREEN 12: 640 x 480 Resolution. Sixteen Colours

SCREEN 13: 320 x 200 Resolution. 256 Colours. (Recommended)

Note. In SCREEN 13 you have a colour Palette of 256 colours. The PALETTE is pre-set by Windows however you can change the RGB values using the PALETTE command.

====SEEK====
 SEEK #[file number], 1
Repositions the 'input #' pointer to the beginning of the file.

====SGN====
 SGN(expression yielding a numeric value)

Yields the 'sign' of a value, -1 if &lt; 0, 0 if 0, 1 if &gt; 0


====SLEEP====
 SLEEP [n]
Execution is suspended for n seconds

====SOUND====
 SOUND [frequency], [duration]
Unlike the BEEP command, this produces a sound from the PC speakers that is of a variable frequency and duration. The frequency is measured in Hertz and has a range from 37 to 32767. Put in one of these numbers in the frequency section. The duration is clock ticks that is defaulted at 18.2 ticks per second.

====STR$====
Converts a numeric value into a text (string) character

 A$ = STR$(expression yielding a numeric value)

The numeric value is converted into text characters and placed into A$. Used to convert numbers into a text string.

WARNING. If the result is positive, a leading 'space' is added (STR$(123) = &quot; 123&quot; and not &quot;123&quot; as might be expected). If the result is negative, instead of a space you get a '-' (minus sign), i.e. STR$(-123) = &quot;-123&quot; and not &quot; -123&quot; as might be expected from the positive behaviour.

See also CHR$ for converting an ascii value into a string character.

See also LEFT$, MID$, RIGHT$ for extracting sub-strings from a line of text.

====SYSTEM====
 SYSTEM
The .bas exits, the QBasic.exe interpreter is closed and 'control' passes to the Command Window c:\ prompt (or next line of a calling .cmd script etc.).

====THEN====
 [Command] [variable] = [value] THEN GOTO [line command value]
Used in conjunction with the GOTO or IF condition commands. It tells the computer what to do if a certain condition has been met.

====TO====
 [Command] [Variable] = [Value] TO [Value]
Usually used to input a number of variables.
 FOR a = 400 TO 500
 PRINT a
 NEXT a
This example will print all numbers from 400 to 500. Instead of declaring all values separately, we can get them all declared in one go.

====USING====
 USING &quot;format&quot;;
Used to format the output of data from PRINT commands. Normally, the QBasic interpreter will print a number as 8 characters with as many leading spaces as necessary. To change this behavour, the USING command can be used to format the output. For example ..

 IF n &gt; 99 THEN PRINT #1, USING &quot;###&quot;; n; ELSE IF n &gt; 9 THEN PRINT #1, USING &quot;0##&quot;; n; ELSE PRINT #1, USING &quot;00#&quot;; n;

.. will output n from 0 to 999 with leading zeros. Note the ';' after the n. This means 'don't start a new line' and results in the next PRINT #1 adding data directly after the comma (',') Qbasic automatically inserts instead of a line line.

====VAL()====
 name=VAL([variable$])
Converts the [variable string] contents into a numeric value so it can be used in calculations. If (name) is an INTEGER type, the VAL is rounded down. See also STR$.
 A$ = &quot;2 + 3&quot;
 B = VAL(A$)
 PRINT A$ is B
2 + 3 is 5

====WHILE ... WEND====
 WHILE {NOT} [test condition is true]
 [program code to execute]
 WEND
The condition is tested and if true (or NOT true) the [program] code is executed until WEND is reached, at which point control passes back to the WHILE line.
 WHILE NOT (EOF(1))
 LINE INPUT #1, A$
 PRINT #2, A$
 WEND
While the end of file #1 has not been reached, read each complete line and write it to file #2.

Unlike FOR and DO, it is not possible to EXIT from a WHILE loop

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Group 2 Spanish== 
Spanish B Higher Level (HL) suits someone who has studied the language for 4-5 years. Spanish Standard Level (SL) is suited to someone who has 2-5 years experience. Beginners should opt for Spanish ''ab initio''. Native or bilingual speakers, if already doing English or French in Group 1, should take Spanish A2 in Group 2. This wikibook focuses on Spanish B HL and SL.

==Differences between HL and SL==
The structure of the course should be similar whether studying HL or SL. However, HL students should have more allocated teaching time and more homework. In addition, HL students should be exposed to more complex language, be introduced to a variety of literary styles and explore more culture. While a SL student would be expected to communicate orally and in writing in a variety of common situations and with a certain degree of fluency, a HL student would be expected to communicate orally and in writing in a wide variety of situations with clarity and fluency.
SL and HL are differentiated by the recommended number of teaching hours, the depth of syllabus coverage, the study of literature at HL, and the level of difficulty and demands of assessment and assessment criteria.
The core—with topics common to both levels—is divided into three areas and is a required area of study.
• Communication and media
• Global issues
• Social relationships
In addition, at both SL and HL, teachers select two from the following five options.
• Cultural diversity
• Customs and traditions
• Health
• Leisure
• Science and technology

Also, at HL, students read two works of literature.

==Syllabus==
There is one Language B Guide that covers all (30+) languages taught in Group 2. This means that it is the responsibility of the teacher to design a course suitable for the needs of the students. Despite this freedom, there are two main strands around which a teacher can base his own course: Text Type (or Communicative Purpose) and Topics. In addition, the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing should be interlinked throughout the course.

==Types of Text==
The IB Spanish course is intended to prepare students to be able to understand and write a variety of types of texts, including: brochures, diary entries, police statements, anecdotes or short stories,   informal letters and emails, formal letters and emails, letters to a newspaper, news articles, opinion articles (editorials/columns), essays, reports, book reviews and film reviews. Students should also learn to write “spoken” texts such as interviews, speeches and conference presentations. The more complex texts should be reserved for HL students, for example: interviews, conference presentations, essays and creative writing. 

==Topics==
Anything related to Hispanic culture, society and history can be studied, as well as issues relating to young people and the international community, for example:  

''El deporte, la salud, el ocio, la moda, el botellón, el papel de la mujer, el machismo, las relaciones personales, el amor, el turismo, el medio ambiente, la solidaridad, la globalización, la educación, la lectura, la tecnología, el internet, el espanglish, las comunidades indígenas, las fiestas, las tradiciones, la tauromáquia, el flamenco, los gauchos, el tango argentino, la gastronomía, el arte, el cine, el narcotráfico, la política, los conflictos internacionales, la inmigración.'' 

==Authentic Resources==
It is very easy to find authentic resources in Spanish on the internet. For the news and current affairs use high quality websites such as http://www.rtve.es (Radio y televisión española), http://www.elpais.es, http://www.elmundo.es. Don’t limit yourself to articles; search in the archives for videos and podcasts too. http://www.youtube.com is fantastic for music videos (with lyrics), interviews with famous people, publicity, and is a lively source of background information on almost any topic. Films are a must for any student wanting to explore issues of culture and society. Films made in Spain and Latin America are becoming increasingly mainstream in the UK and are equally accessible to SL and HL students, for example: ''Volver, María llena eres de gracia, Amores Perros, Y tu mamá también, El orfanato, El laberinto del fauno, La lengua de las mariposas''.

==Literature==
HL Students are required to read two &quot;works&quot; authentic literature, such as whole books or plays or collections of poems or short stories. Accessible authors to start with include Federico García Lorca (''La casa de Bernarda Alba, Bodas de Sangre''), Laura Esquivel (''Como agua para chocolate''), Carlos Fuentes (''Aura''). Extracts of lengthier works can be studied in order to gain an appreciation for different styles including Gabriel García Márquez (''Cien años de soledad'', ''Crónica de una muerte anunciada''), Miguel Delibes (''Cinco Horas con Mario''), Fernando Fernán Gómez (''Las bicicletas son para el verano''), Jorge Luis Borges (''Ficciones''), Miguel de Cervantes (''Novelas ejemplares''), Juan Rulfo (''Pedro Párramo''), Pablo Neruda (''Confieso que he vivido''), Mario Vargas Llosa (''La fiesta del chivo'') Roberto Bolaño (''Los detectives salvajes''), Mario Benedetti (''Aquí se respira bien''), Luisa Castro (''La segunda mujer'').        

==Assessment and grading== 
Students sit two written exams: Paper 1 and Paper 2, each lasting 1hr30. In addition, a written assignment is produced under teacher supervision during the school year. Internal Assessment comprises Interactive Orals and an Individual Oral. Students are assessed throughout on their Language, Interaction and Message. 

The grade boundaries shift slightly in every exam sessions, and remain to be established in the new program for initial testing in 2013.

Externally assessed written assignment: This paper, new to the curriculum for 2013, is written by students under teacher supervision, but submitted for external evaluation. For HL, the paper is based on the literature topics studied. For SL, it is based on a selection of three related non-literary readings which the student uses as a basis for the paper. 

==Paper 1 (Text Handling)   1hr30    25%==
'''Section A) Reading Comprehension''': 30-40 questions based on 4 texts (Texts A, B and C). Question types include true or false with a justification, looking for synonyms, inserting conjunctions, identifying which noun a pronoun refers to, matching titles with paragraphs, multiple choice, identifying the main purpose of the text. All answers should be exact words lifted from the text; do not try to explain or paraphrase. 1 mark is allocated to each question.

==Paper 2 (Writing in Registers)   1hr30    25%==
Students have a choice of 5 topics covering different areas of study and types of text. 
In addition, HL students have a second written item reacting to a short reading.

==Internal Assessment    30%''' == 
'''Interactive Oral''': At least 3 group orals should be assessed in the final year of the course and the best mark is put forward. Interactive Orals can take many forms, for example: a prepared presentation followed by questions, a formal debate, an informal discussion, a role-play, or a spontaneous response to a film-clip. Interactive orals are marked by the teacher. The more orals done in class, the less nerve-wrecking they become.     

'''Individual Oral''': The Individual Oral takes place in the final year and lasts 8-10 minutes. It is conducted and marked by the teacher and recorded for external moderation. The mark is added to the best Interactive Oral mark. Part 1 is a 3-4 minute presentation on a picture related to a curriculum theme. Part 2 involves 5-6 minutes of unprepared discussion with the teacher based on the picture's topic.      

==Extended Essay in Spanish== 
Students can choose to write their Extended Essay (''la monografía'') in Spanish as part of Group 2. The EE can be written either on aspects of Language, Culture &amp; Society, or Literature. Students should read carefully the Extended Essay Guide (2009) and the Group 2 Subject Specific criteria. Writing the EE in Spanish is excellent preparation for university study of the language.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== SHM Equations of Motion == 

=== Defining Equation of Motion (in terms of acceleration and displacement) ===

By definition, a particle performs '''simple harmonic motion (SHM)''' when
* the magnitude of its acceleration &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is ''proportional'' to the magnitude of its displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; from some fixed point, '''and'''
* its acceleration and displacement are in ''opposite'' directions.

More formally, SHM occurs whenever the equation of motion &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=-kx&lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a positive constant. By convention, we write &lt;math&gt;k=\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; (we will explain the significance of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; later) so the equation becomes &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=-\omega^2 x&lt;/math&gt;.

Simple harmonic oscillators are easy to find in the real world. The undamped oscillation of a mass attached to an elastic string or spring is just one example in the realm of mechanics. Before studying such examples, let us first examine the characteristics of SHM using the abstract model described below.

Consider the following oscillator with an ''oscillation amplitude'' of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denote its '''displacement''' from the origin, and &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt; its '''acceleration'''.

[[Image:shm1.png|400px]]

Let us restate the defining equation for SHM:

{| style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=-\omega^2 x \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

Recall that the algebraic variables representing displacement and its derivatives wrt time represent ''one-dimensional vector quantities'' (i.e. they all lie on a line). If the value of the variable is positive, then its vector points in the positive direction; if it is negative, its vector points in the other direction.

Observe that when the &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;. By '''Newton's Second Law''', the ''resultant force'' &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; acting on the oscillator is zero at this instance.

When &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. to the right of the origin), the resultant force points to the left, towards the origin. When &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the resultant force points to the right, towards the origin. Because the resultant force always points towards the origin whenever the oscillator is not at the origin, the resultant force can be termed a '''restoring force'''. The behaviour of the restoring force suggests that the speed of the oscillator is maximum at the origin and is zero at the two ends where it changes direction (i.e. &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt;).

=== Equation of Motion, in terms of velocity, amplitude and displacement===

Now, let us rewrite the defining SHM equation in terms of the '''velocity''' &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and '''displacement''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We make the following substitution: &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=\frac{dv}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}=v\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;v\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\int v \,dv&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 \int x \,dx&lt;/math&gt; (separating variables)
|-
|}

Using &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt; as one pair of limits for the integral, we get

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\int_0^v v \,dv&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 \int_{\pm a}^x x \,dx&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\left[ \frac{1}{2} v^2 \right]_0^v&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 \left[ \frac{1}{2} x^2 \right]_{\pm a}^x&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;|&lt;math&gt;v^2=\omega^2 (a^2 - x^2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}


Now, it is clear that the speed is maximum when &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; (in which case &lt;math&gt;v=\pm\omega a&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;x=\pm a&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Equation of Motion, in terms of displacement, amplitude and time ===

The significance of the constant &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; will become clear once we express the defining SHM equation in terms of the '''displacement''' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and '''time''' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\omega^2 x\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-|
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\omega^2 x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

This is just a ''second-order ordinary differential equation with constant
coefficients''. The ''characteristic equation'' (as a function of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) is given by:

&lt;math&gt; m^2 + \omega^2 =0 \Rightarrow m = \pm \sqrt{-\omega^2} \Rightarrow m = \pm \mathrm{i}\omega &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the general solution to the differential equation may be
written as:

&lt;math&gt;x=A_1\cos (\omega t) + A_2\sin (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently, &lt;math&gt;x=A_3\cos (\omega t + \varepsilon)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

To solve for the pairs of constants &lt;math&gt;\{A_1,A_2\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{A_3,\varepsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, we need a pair of ''initial conditions'' describing the SHM.

If the particle starts ''from rest'' at the maximum displacement &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt;, then we substitute &lt;math&gt;x=a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt}=0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; to get &lt;math&gt;A_1=a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_2=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_3=a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=0&lt;/math&gt;. The solution becomes &lt;math&gt;x=a \cos (\omega t)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, if the oscillation begins at minimium displacement, then we obtain &lt;math&gt;x=a \sin (\omega t)=a\cos\left(\omega t - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, we have

{| style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;x=a \cos(\omega t + \varepsilon) \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

where the constant &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; depends on the starting position of the oscillator. 

These equations show that &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is just the '''constant angular velocity''' (or angular frequency) associated with the SHM. The following figure illustrates this relationship between ''SHM'' and ''uniform circular motion'' (with an angular velocity of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;). The displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the simple harmonic oscillator is really just the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate of the particle performing uniform circular motion. We can therefore think of SHM as a projection of uniform circular motion onto the diameter of the circle.

The simple harmonic oscillator completes ''one oscillation'' whenever it traverses twice the end-to-end distance (i.e. a distance of &lt;math&gt;4a&lt;/math&gt;). This corresponds to ''one revolution'' around the circle in the case of uniform circular motion. Thus, the '''period of oscillation''' in SHM is given by

{| style=&quot;border:2px solid red&quot;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|}

== Example: Mass on an Elastic String ==

We wish to determine if a mass suspended on a light (i.e. massless) elastic string will demonstrate SHM.

Consider a light elastic string with ''natural length'' &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and ''modulus of elasticity'' &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; suspended vertically from a fixed point O. The other end of the string is attached to a particle of ''mass'' &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. 

[[Image:shm2.png|150px|left]]

Let the point E denote the '''equilibrium position''' of the particle. At E, the particle is at rest (i.e. the resultant force acting on it is zero). Let &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; denote the extension of the string when the particle is at E. Considering the vertical forces on the particle gives:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\lambda}{l}e = mg \Rightarrow e= \frac{mgl}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

The displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the mass is always measured from the equilibrium position E, since this is the point where &lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}=0&lt;/math&gt; and hence, the resultant force &lt;math&gt;F=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose the mass experiences a small displacement &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Applying '''Newton's Second Law''' produces

{|
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;mg-T&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;mg-\frac{\lambda}{l}(e+x)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;mg-\frac{\lambda}{l}e - \frac{\lambda}{l}x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;- \frac{\lambda}{l}x&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=m\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;mg=\frac{\lambda}{l}e&lt;/math&gt;) 
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;=-\frac{\lambda}{ml}x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

which is the defining equation of motion for SHM, with &lt;math&gt;\omega^2 = \frac{\lambda}{ml}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that the particle performs SHM only when the string remains taut, i.e. &lt;math&gt;a&lt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Conditional execution==
To choose between two or more sections of the program to execute, the IF statement can be used. It is also possible to use the WHILE, DO UNTIL and CASE statements. All of these control conditional execution by using a Boolean logic 'test', the result of which is either TRUE or FALSE. To repeat a section of code for a set number of times, the FOR statement is used.

The IF test can be executed in a single line, however it can also be used like the others to control a block of code.  

==True or False==
Boolean logic is a test that yields one of only two possible results, true or false. The tests are always mathematical in nature .. when two characters (or strings) are 'compared' it is their ASCII codes that are used (thus a &lt; b and b &lt; A).

The comparison operators used in qbasic are:
= true if two variables are equal
&lt; true if the first is less than the second
=&lt; true if the first is less than or equal to the second
&gt; true if the first is greater than the second
&gt;= true if the first is greater than or equal to the second
&lt;&gt; true if the two are unequal

Multiple tests can be linked together in the comparison, using the 'AND', 'OR' and 'NOT' operators. We will cover exactly what these mean later on, but you probably understand the first two already.

==IF==
One of the most useful statements in QBasic is the IF statement. It allows you to choose what your program will do depending on the conditions you give it. The next few programs will be taking a look at ways to use the IF statement.

 IF [conditional] THEN [do this]

The single line IF is the simplest example. To execute a block of code, the END IF is used

  IF [conditional] THEN
    [do this]
    [and do this]
     ...
    [and also do this]
  END IF

==IF...THEN...ELSE==

 IF [conditional] THEN [do this] ELSE [do that]

To choose between two different code blocks, the ELSE statement is used.

 IF [conditional] THEN
   [do this]
   ..
   [and do this]
 ELSE
   [do that]
   ..
   [and also that]
 END IF

==13 ELSEIF==
As an alternative to starting an entirely new IF THEN ELSE statement sequence.
You can follow the THEN statement(s) with ELSEIF [conditional] THEN.
This does not create a new level of nesting.

IF [conditional] THEN
  [do this]
  ..
  [and do this]
ELSEIF [conditoinal] THEN
  [do that]
  ..
  [and also that]
ELSEIF [conditoinal] THEN
  [do the other]
  ..
  [and also ...]
ELSE
  [do this final thing]
END IF

==FOR...NEXT==

 FOR &lt;variable name&gt; = &lt;start value&gt; TO &lt;end value&gt; [STEP &lt;increment&gt;]
  [do this]
  ...
  [and do this]
 NEXT

&lt;increment&gt; may be + or - and is optional. If omitted the default is +1. The code contained within the FOR loop will always be executed at least once because it is only at the 'NEXT' statement that the value of the variable is checked against the end value.

When the NEXT statement executes, the variable is modified by STEP value and compared against the end value. If the variable has not yet exceeded the end value, control is returned to the line following the FOR.

You can exit a FOR loop early with the '''EXIT FOR''' command.  

==14FOR.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 RANDOMIZE TIMER

 num = INT(RND * 20) + 1

 FOR count = 1 TO 5
  INPUT &quot;Pick a number between 1 and 20: &quot;, answer
  IF answer = num THEN PRINT &quot;You win after&quot;;count;&quot;guesses!&quot;: END
 NEXT
 PRINT &quot;You lose&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== WHILE...WEND ==

  WHILE &lt;condition is true&gt;
    [do this]
    ..
    [and this]
  WEND

If the condition is true, the code following the WHILE is executed. When the WEND command is executed, it returns control to the WHILE statement (where the condition is tested again). When the condition evaluates to FALSE, control is passed to the statement following the WEND.

== 15WHILE.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
PRINT &quot;Press any key to continue&quot;
WHILE INKEY$=&quot;&quot;
WEND
&lt;/source&gt;

In the example above, you see a press any key prompt that waits until the user presses a key.  (The INKEY$ feature will be described under [[QBasic/Advanced Input|Advanced Input]].)


== DO...LOOP ==

  DO
    [this]
    ..
    [and this]
  LOOP WHILE &lt;condition is true&gt; / LOOP UNTIL &lt;condition is true&gt;

The '''DO...LOOP''' construct is a more advanced of the WHILE loop - as with other flow control blocks, it is marked by '''DO''' and '''LOOP''' to denote the boundaries.

It relies on a conditional statement placed after either DO or LOOP:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
DO
  a$ = inkey$
LOOP WHILE a$=&quot;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As an alternative, you can instead replace '''WHILE''' with '''UNTIL''' have the loop continue until a specific condition is met:

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
DO
  x=x+1
LOOP UNTIL x &gt;= 10
&lt;/source&gt;

In some versions of BASIC the UNTIL or WHILE condition can follow the DO statement rather than the LOOP statement (pre-test) as apposed to the above shown (post-test).

==12IF.BAS==
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
 CLS
 RANDOMIZE TIMER

 num = INT(RND * 100) + 1
 DO 
      INPUT &quot;Pick a number between 1 and 100: &quot;, answer

      IF num = answer THEN PRINT &quot;You Got It!&quot;
      IF num &gt; answer THEN PRINT &quot;Too Small&quot;
      IF num &lt; answer THEN PRINT &quot;Too big&quot;
LOOP UNTIL num = answer
PRINT &quot;Game Over.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== SELECT CASE ==

  SELECT CASE &lt;variable expression&gt;
    CASE &lt;value&gt;
      [do this]
    CASE &lt;value 2&gt;
      [do instead]
    ...
    CASE ELSE
    ...
  END SELECT

The select statement is a substitute for repeated use of IF statements.  The &lt;variable expression&gt; is evaluated and compared against each CASE &lt;value&gt; in turn. When a CASE &lt;value&gt; is found to match, the [do this] code following is executed. If an EXIT CASE is executed, control passes to the line following the END SELECT, otherwise the next CASE &lt;value&gt; is checked. If no matches are found, the CASE ELSE is executed. Note that &lt;value&gt; may be a number, character or string or logical expression (eg '&gt;0', '&lt;&gt;1'). Note also that multiple CASE matches may be found and executed (so, for example, if two CASE &lt;values&gt; are 'CASE &gt;1' and 'CASE &gt;10', a &lt;variable expression&gt; that evaluates to 11 (or more) will result in both CASE &gt;1 and CASE &gt;10 being executed)

&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
CLS
PRINT &quot;WELCOME&quot;
PRINT &quot;I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS&quot;
input &quot;WRITE YOUR QUESTION AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN ANSWER &quot;, question$
10 RANDOMIZE TIMER
PRINT
answer=INT(RND*10+1)
SELECT CASE answer
  
 PRINT &quot;PLEASE REPHRASE YOUR QUESTION.&quot;
  CASE 2
    PRINT &quot;YOUR QUESTION IS MEANINGLESS.&quot;
  CASE 3
    PRINT &quot;DO YOU THINK I CAN ANSWER THIS?&quot;
  CASE 4 
    PRINT &quot;THIS QUESTION LOOKS FUNNY.&quot;
END SELECT
PRINT &quot;ENTER ANOTHER QUESTION&quot;, K$
GOTO 10
&lt;/source&gt;

If a parameter would be covered by more than one case statement, the first option will take priority.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sauce|Sauce]]

'''Barbecue Sauce''' is a [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] or [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]] based [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] used on [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]]. Kansas City-style barbecue sauce is the most common version used in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. It is tomato or ketchup based with sweet, sour and smoky elements. Barbecue sauce can be added to the meat before, during or after cooking. This version contains quite a bit of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], so it should be added near the end or after cooking the meat to avoid burning the sauce.

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (235 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Ketchup|ketchup]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (90 mL) [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]
*4 tablespoons (60 mL) [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
*3 tablespoons (45 mL) white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1 tablespoon (15 mL) plain prepared [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*3 tablespoons (45 mL) finely minced yellow [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (20 mL) bottled [[Cookbook:Liquid Smoke|liquid smoke]] flavor (hickory)
*1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) Louisiana-style [[Cookbook:Red Pepper|red pepper]] [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]
*1/2 cup (120 mL) [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]]
*1 tablespoon (15 mL) [[Cookbook:Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]
*1 teaspoon (5 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

Makes 2 cups (470 mL) of sauce.

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in a sauce pan.
#Mix well.
#[[Cookbook:Simmer|Simmer]] over low heat for 20-minutes, stirring occasionally.

==Notes, tips and variations==
This sauce tastes very close to commercial barbecue sauces such as Masterpiece and Bullseye.

==Warnings==
* Keep refrigerated
* Add to meat near end or after cooking to avoid burning sauce because of sugar content.

'''Yogurt''' or '''yoghurt''' is a pudding-like food made from milk fermented in a culture of (typically) ''Lactobacillus delbrueckii  bulgaricus'' and ''Streptococcus salivarius thermophilus''. At the end of the process, the yogurt is usually heated to kill the bacteria. &quot;Live active culture&quot; is a type of yogurt that has the live bacteria still in it. Some people believe that this &quot;live&quot; yogurt has special health benefits.

Lactic and other acids produced during fermentation give it a slightly sour taste. It is usually eaten with [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] or [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]].

Yogurt can also be used as a garnish for savoury food, particularly in the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] and [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asia]]. It is the basis for [[Cookbook:Raita|raita]]. 

Yogurt can also be substituted for [[Cookbook:Buttermilk|buttermilk]] when baking, as in the recipe for [[Cookbook:Corn Muffins|Corn Muffins]].

Fantasy author [[w:Tolkien|J. R. R. Tolkien]] invented many writing systems to be used by his [[w:Elves_(Middle-earth)|Elves]] and other races in his fictional world of [[w:Middle-earth|Middle-earth]].

This is a detailed account of the writing systems used by the Elves. The essay is concentrated on the process of time in the fictional history and the Ages of Middle-earth, and its purpose is to show how writing could have evolved by various races of the legendarium, as well as the interrelation between modes. The logical process behind evolution of each system from the other is speculated.

==Disclaimer==
The document doesn't include many explicit quotes from Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s writings for reference, but it is clear that many statements set forth are conclusions out of the authors' judgement from the sources and evidence. Words like &amp;ldquo;assume&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;speculate&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;reconstruct&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;must&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;perhaps&amp;rdquo; are used, and the reader must have in mind that these theories have not been ensured by examples or explicitly stated by Tolkien.

The same applies to the examples of some writing systems, like early Certhas, specimina of which Tolkien haven&amp;rsquo;t left to us at present. On the contrary, this essay provides all of known (elvish) Tengwar samples that have been written by Tolkien, leaving the final judgment to the reader.
===What this document is not===
*The document is by no means a tutorial for starters, or a guide of how to write Tengwar. Although it can be used as such, there are better and more practical tutorials and guides available. What can it be used for is a reference guide for all known systems (some of them hypothetical or reconstructed) and is recommended as a supplement for such a study by a starter. 
*The document does not try to describe every single system that came into Tolkien’s mind, but takes account only his &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo; elaborations that he must have considered &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; while writing '''Lord of the Rings''' and the later '''Silmarillion'''. So no description of the early Sarati, the &amp;ldquo;Valmaric script&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Runes of Pengolodh&amp;rdquo; will be found there.
*English and Old English modes for Tengwar devised by Tolkien won't be described either.

===Legal remarks===
The essay tries not to show anything that goes beyond Fair Use and doesn&amp;rsquo;t quote so extensively from Tolkien's work as to run afoul of it. All quotation is used for the purpose of supporting the analysis that forms the vast majority of the work.

== History ==
''Eldatencelion'' started as a timeline of all the changes that took place forming the Elvish writing systems according to the information given in '''Appendix E''' to '''The Lord of the Rings'''. An early form was hosted kindly in [http://elvish.org/gwaith Gwaith-i-Phethdain] in a portable document format, and was soon translated into Italian by [http://www.eldalie.it Eldalie.it]. It was ported to wiki format on January 2005 and has been improved and changed ever since.

== On reading this document ==
The reader must have the following way of formatting in mind:
* Names of published corpus are in bold: '''LotR, King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''', '''Moria Gate Inscription'''
* Words or sounds used as samples (usually elvish) are in italic: ''thúle, parma''
* Tengwar names are not in italic, but their first letter is capital: Thúle, Parma
* Minus &lt; and major &gt; are used to show etymological process or change in pronounciation: ''*áse &gt; áze &gt; áre''
* Non-attested hypothetical forms (usually archaic) are asterisked: ''alda &lt; *galadâ ''
* Wrong forms are asterisked twice: ''alda &lt; *galadâ'', not ''**aladâ''
* Primitive stems and etymological roots are always in capital: ''alda'' &lt; GALAD

FA, SA and TA mean First, Second and Third Age respectively.

'''Note:''' The document makes heavy use of certain fonts of Tengwar, Runes and, in a case, Sarati. The fonts that need to be installed in order to view this document properly are:
* [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/saratieldamar.htm Sarati Eldamar] and
* [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/parmaite.htm Tengwar Parmaite], both by Måns Björkman
* [http://www.acondia.com/fonts/cirth/ Cirth Erebor] by Dan Smith
* [http://www.tolkiendil.com/telechargements/polices/angerthas_et_runes#gondolin Gondolindic Runes] by Ronald Kyrmse

Some other compatible fonts will also work since most of the best-known tengwar fonts follow the layout proposed by Dan Smith. In some cases, Tengwar doesn&amp;rsquo;t render correctly in ''Internet Explorer'', so other browsers are recommended (the display is fine in ''Mozilla Firefox''). The problem can alternatively be overpassed by copying and pasting the text into a word processor such as ''MS Word''.

== Acknowledgements ==
The present form of the essay owes much to the contributions of knowledge by Helge Fauskanger, Måns Björkman, Daniel Adriës, Ryszard Derdzinski, Carl Hos and others, as well as the editors of Vinyar Tengwar.</text>

{{Template:Eldatencelion}}

= Sarati =
Rúmil of Tirion was a Noldorin scholar and the composer of Ainulindale. Before that he was the inventor of the first elvish writing system in the Valian Year 1179. It has been suggested that his system was based on an even more ancient, unrecorded writing system of the Noldor, but this is hardly probable. The Sarati (&amp;ldquo;significant marks&amp;rdquo;), as he called his letters, were ideal for writing both on stone and on paper, but we have only seen what seems to be their &amp;ldquo;calligraphic&amp;rdquo; versions.

Several different writing-directions were used with the script. Rúmilian texts were written in rows or in columns like Japanese, LTR like the western scripts, RTL like eastern scripts or boustrophedon (RTL&amp;ndash;LTR&amp;ndash;RTL etc.) like some ancient Greek inscriptions.

Rúmil decided that the vowels should be written with diacritics and not with independent letters, since, according to the linguistic perceptions of the Valinorean loremasters, vowels were considered as &amp;ldquo;colours&amp;rdquo; of the consonants.

Todate various interinconsistent modes of Sarati have been published, from various stages of Tolkien's youth and development. They are mostly used for English or early Qenya words and phrases. Unfortunately there is no definite, compatible to Lord of the Rings-Quenya mode of Sarati known.

= Early Tengwar =
Fëanáro Curufinwë (better known as Fëanor) invented the tengwar (&amp;ldquo;signs representing audible phonemes&amp;rdquo;), strongly influenced by the Sarati, in the Valian Year 1250. From that time on, the term Sarati, from the general notions of &amp;ldquo;letter&amp;rdquo;, only refers to the Rúmilian writing system.
==Rumilian Influence==
With the first sight one might observe the stylistic influence of the Sarati. Especially two of the sarati (namely ''P'' &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 3em;&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; and ''B'' &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 3em;&quot;&gt;b&lt;/em&gt;) are visually similar to the shape of a tengwa, since their morphology is consisted of a &amp;ldquo;line&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;curves&amp;rdquo;. The organization of the tengwar follows the aforementioned concept, where the form of the letter reflexes its sound. Fëanor decided that the doubling of a &amp;ldquo;curve&amp;rdquo; should add voice to the &amp;ldquo;basic&amp;rdquo; sound, and generally the way the &amp;ldquo;curves&amp;rdquo; are doubled is similar to the &amp;ldquo;p&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;b&amp;rdquo; sarati, so these two sarati must be his main inspiration.

Fëanor therefore, by reducing the number of variable elements, produced a simpler and more consistent set of characters. The two basic elements of the tengwar were a &amp;ldquo;stem&amp;rdquo; (telco) and a &amp;ldquo;bow&amp;rdquo; (lúva), which could be combined and modified in a number of different ways. Fëanor decided that the tengwar whose telcor and lúvar were organized in a particular way, represented a certain group of related sounds: The telcor determined how the sound was articulated, and the lúvar where in the mouth it was made.

The greatest difference between the systems was that the tengwar were written from left to right. 
=== Table  ===
It is more probable that the Tengwar system was not especially based on the needs of Quenya, Feanor's mother tongue; this is obvious when we compare the [[../Age of Starlight#Original Quenya mode|Quenya mode table]] with other, [[../Third_Age#&quot;General Use&quot;|later modes]], where the phonemes fit to the Tengwar table more consistently. It is therefore possible that the Tengwar started initially more like a generic phonological 'template', on which all later derived modes and spellings could be based. The dialects of Aman as well as ancient reconstructed words could then be written with an adaptation of that generic system.

The following table is based on a theory by Jim Allan, published in '''An Introduction to Elvish'''. It shows a reconstruction of the original theoretical 'template' of the Tengwar, perhaps never used in any language. 

The only mode known closest to the theoretical values would be the [[../Second Age#General_Use_mode|General Use mode]], of which we first hear millennia later.

Note that the second-to-last series represents voiceless consonants.

=Quanta Sarme=
Unlike Rúmil, Fëanor considered vowels as indepedent sounds and not just &amp;ldquo;colours&amp;rdquo; of the consonants, so he devised the &amp;ldquo;full writing&amp;rdquo; (Quanta Sarmë).

Quanta Sarme had distinct letters for vowels (ómëar or óma-tengwi), and was used by the Loremasters for special purposes only&lt;ref&gt;Appendix D to '''Quendi and Eldar'''&lt;/ref&gt;. No texts of this system are known to us, and its usage and characters are unknown, but Tolkien says that it was used in Middle-earth for other languages, like Sindarin, where the tehta-mode was inconvenient. 

This system is not heard much thereafter and it seems that its usage hasn't endured into the following Ages. However by the above information, we can easily assume that it was the predecessor of the [[../First_Age#Mode_of_Beleriand|Mode of Beleriand]], and the letter Osse &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;]&lt;/em&gt; is maybe the only remnant of that (otherwise extinct) system.

=Original Quenya mode=
Despite Fëanor is said to prefer the Quanta Sarme, he also used a more 'conservative' system which (judging by the majority of the subsequent samples) seem to have been proved far more popular. Fëanor held the idea of syllabic analysis of the words by the Sarati, and made also use of signs (tehtar) for vowels (instead of the full letters), placed over the preceding tengwar/consonants, indicating their &amp;ldquo;colour&amp;rdquo;. A consonant followed by a vowel was concidered as a &amp;ldquo;full letter&amp;rdquo; (ñávëa or ñáva-tengwë). The sarat &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 2em;&quot;&gt;&amp;lsquo;&lt;/em&gt; was imported from the previous system, and when a vowel had no preceding consonant, it was used as a carrier for convenience in writing. This system however was used by Fëanor mainly for tradition and brevity, favouring the Quanta Sarme instead.

Apart of the standard consistent characters, there were also additional tengwar which don't fit in the structure. These are usually modifications of the standard tengwar. Hyarmen is a modification of Charma, Úre is of Wilya, and Anna derived from an earlier sarat.

=== Table ===
According to '''Appendix E''' (mixed with other recently published sources) and our knowledge on Quenya phonology evolution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qevolution.pdf The Evolution of Primitive Elvish to Quenya]: Valinorean&lt;/ref&gt;, we can reconstruct a Tengwar table, hopefully as close to the original Feanor's concept as possible:

=== Notes ===
'''Tengwar names''': The names given in '''Appendix E''' were based on the 3rd Age table composed in Gondor. It is not known if this arrangement was given then or existed since Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s days. It is possible, however, that some of the known names may have replaced earlier, unrecorded forms. The best that can be done here is to give the oldest known names (e.g. Charma instead of Aha). This is our evidence:

'''Anna''' originally represented ''3'', a sound from primitive ''g'' (cf. ''*galadâ &gt; *galda &gt; *3alda &gt; alda''). The ''3'' sound was early lost, and Anna was used as an initial vowel carrier to indicate an assuming &amp;ldquo;vanished&amp;rdquo; initial consonant wherever words begun with a vowel (note that its &quot;ancestor&quot;, the sarat &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tirion Sarati'&quot;&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;, was also used for ''3'' before being used as a carrier. It was inherited as a carrier by Fëanor, and later it replaced initial Anna). This usage tried to explain the relation of words between Noldorin words starting with a vowel where Telerin had ''g-'' (cf. Quenya ''alda'' vs. Telerin ''galla''), but did not explain all the cases of words without an initial consonant (''alca'', according to this, should be spelled *&lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica',; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;hDjaE&lt;/em&gt; that time, although it had never been ''**galka'' before). The problem with the name is that Anna is given as derived from the root AN, and not *GAN (although there is some evidence that the latter root is the correct, and therefore its archaic form was ''*3anna'').

'''Halla''' represented an archaic breath ''h'', that survived from primitive H only in Amanye languages, while Charma represented ''ch'', that derived from Primitive KH. The problem is that the ''h'' of the word ''halla'' evolved from the latter sound: KHAL &gt; ''*khallâ &gt; halla'', therefore pronounced ''*challa'' in Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s time. We are lead to the conclusion that there must be another ancient unrecorded name for this letter that had the breath sound ''h''!

'''Óre''': Óre is given by Tolkien as /&amp;#633;/: &amp;ldquo;weak (untrilled) ''r'', originally occurring in Quenya&amp;rdquo; (Appendix E). This quote suggests that Quenya originally contrasted /&amp;#633;/ and /r/, since there would be no need for independent letters if the two sounds were merely [[:wikipedia:allophone|allophones]] of each other. In this case, however, the original distribution of the letters Óre and Rómen must have been different from the one we observe at the end of the Third Age, where both letters are in perfectly complementary distribution, no contrast being possible. If Óre is the original name of this letter, this could mean that it is one of the words with original /&amp;#633;/.

The problem about the sound of /&amp;#633;/ is that there is no other evidence apart from the mentioned quote.

'''Extended stems''': As we are told in '''Appendix E''', the original Fëanorean alphabet contained a Grade of &amp;ldquo;extended&amp;rdquo; stems, both raised and lowered. The usage of those tengwar (whose names, if they had, are of course unknown) was to represent spirant sounds. As we know, no Amanya language possessed spirant sounds, since the Primitive spirants ''th, ph'', and ''kh'' had already became ''th, f'' and ''ch'' in Quenya. It is possible that they were used for recording Valarin or maybe archaic forms.

'''Tyelpetéma''': '''Appendix E''' informs us that Quenya also made use of a palatal series, the Tyelpetéma. Christopher Tolkien, who made the names known, notes that the names are given in a number of different formulations, and he cannot determine which were the standard ones. The only difference from the Tincotéma was the underposed (for tengwar with raised stems) and overposed (for tengwar with lowered stems) dots. Those tengwar, not included in the table of the '''Appendix E''', must have been ommited from the standard letters.

'''Áze''': The /z/ sound later changed to /r/ only in the Noldorin dialect, and this letter took the name Áre.

'''Azya''': This tengwa is given as Arya, and is attested either as a Rómen or as an Óre with the overdots. Since the sound ''ry'' derives from original ''sy &gt; zy'' (still present in Vanyarin), the form of the letter should be Áze with the dots, changed after ''z'' merged with ''r''. But then this tengwa should be placed among the Additional Tengwar, for it is not consisted of a telco and a lúva.

'''Yanta''': Yanta's shape reminds of the Rúmilian letter for ''y''. It might have represented this sound too (Yanta probably written *&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lD4#&lt;/em&gt;, while this word should read **''ainta'' in 3rd Age spelling). In our attested examples of 3rd Age texts, it occurs only as the -''i'' of dipthongs (in &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lE&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lH&lt;/em&gt; ''ai'', ''oi'' etc.). Maybe e.g. ''tuilë'' was originally spelled *&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1UlUj$&lt;/em&gt; (''tuyulë'') like in Rúmilian orthography, before simplified to &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1lUj$&lt;/em&gt;. Cf. Úre.

'''Úrë''': Besides that in the attested examples of 3rd Age, Úre appeas as the -''u'' of the dipthongs (&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.D&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.F&lt;/em&gt; ''au'', ''eu'' etc.), its original use and etymological relation to the word ''úrë'' itself are unknown. Since it&amp;rsquo;s attested in diphthongs in our samples like Yanta is, we can suppose it was used for intervocalic ''w'', which later became ''v''. Maybe ''taurë'' was originally spelled *&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1D.D7R&lt;/em&gt; (''tawarë'') before simplified to &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1.D7R&lt;/em&gt;, while for initial ''w'', only Wilya was used. Jim Allan suggested that ''úre'' should be written as &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.J7R&lt;/em&gt;, a function that reminds of the Rúmilian spelling of long ''u''… &amp;ndash; or maybe it was used as ''u'' in Quanta Sarme, like in the Mode of Beleriand? Cf. Yanta.

'''Thúlë''': In Noldorin Quenya the sound ''th'' had merged with ''s'' since very early. The word thúlë thus became ''súlë''.

'''Ñoldo/Ñwalmë''': Those sounds were found only initially. Sometimes written ''ng-'' and ''ngw-'', but not to be confused with Anga/Ungwe, which are used only medially.

'''Nuquernë Tengwar''': The table of '''Appendix E''' gives us the inverted forms of Silmë and Ázë, which were used when followed by a vowel (since they were too tall to receive a tehta). It is not known if these forms were invented by Fëanor or by later users, but Silmë Nuquerna was used in the Mode of Beleriand (as a vocalic ''y''), which makes us think it was already present in Valinor. If we are to suppose that the original form of Arya was an Ázë with dots, there must also have been an inverted form of it (Arya Nuquerna).

=== Examples ===
Like the Sarati, the Amanya system of the tengwar is also unknown at this point. According to the theories mentioned above, they will be tentatively reconstructed, showing some tengwar transcriptions of various Quenya words as pronounced in Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s time. For better understanding the words and the connection between spelling and etymology, alongside are given the etymological roots or the better attested later Quenya forms:
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;dE6U&lt;/em&gt;, ''*cheru'' &lt; KHER
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1E.6R&lt;/em&gt;, ''taurë''
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1`C.D6R&lt;/em&gt;, ''*tawarë &gt; tavar''
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;`C.D,Fj&lt;/em&gt;, ''*awazel &gt; aurel''
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hEm#&lt;/em&gt;, ''*3alda &gt; alda
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1Ulj$&lt;/em&gt;, ''tuilë'' &lt; TUY

====Possible examples of Quanta Sarme==== 
We know absolutely nothing about the Quanta Sarme orthography and the following are '''purely conjectural''', based solely on what we know about 'classical' tengwar.
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;],Ö]&lt;/em&gt;, ''azya'' 
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;l]y]55]&lt;/em&gt;, ''Yavanna'' 
* &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;½]5.&lt;/em&gt;, ''hanu'' &lt; HAN

= An alternative mode =
For variant spellings, the general hypothetical 'template' above could have been implemented. For example, we have no clue on how the Vanyar and Teleri used the known Tengwar, since their dialect possessed sounds not found in Noldorin, like indepedent ''d'' and ''b''. The Vanyarin poem&amp;rsquo;s name, ''Aldudénie'', is known from the '''Silmarillion''', and the word ''ulban'', &amp;ldquo;blue&amp;rdquo;, is also adapted from Valarin by the Vanyar. They could probably write these words by modifying this flexible system according to their language (like the Noldor and the alien speakers did later in Middle-earth), but some sources state that the Vanyar kept the Sarati{{fact}}. Tolkien notes that the system of Fëanor provided the means of expressions for more sounds than those occuring in Quenya and Telerin, but he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention them or the reasons.

In '''Addenda et corrigenda to the Etymologies''', an old version of the tengwar by Tolkien appears. Some tengwar have different names and values. It is not known if this mode coexisted with the one presented above, or if one evolved after the other.

= Certhas =
During that time, the Sindar of Beleriand began developing an alphabet for their language. Its letters were entirely made for carving on wood, stone or metal, hence their angular forms and straight lines. These letters were named ''cirth'' (sing. ''certh'').

The assignment of values was unsystematic. The form of a certh was consisted of a stem and a branch. The branch was found usually on the right side of the stem, and sometimes on the left, but with no phonetic significance. Therefore &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;3&lt;/em&gt; would just be an alternative form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.

The following cirth were given by Tolkien as the most ancient of the later [[../Second_Age#Angerthas_Daeron|Angerthas]]. They had possibly different values at that time than the ones given below. Since we lack any other evidence though, we will use the known standard values of the letters to have a framework of discussion and make our comparisons; this is not so far-fetched as it seems: it's possible that at some later stage, some sound values were 'stuck' to some of the cirth, setting some stable basis for Daeron to make his final [[../Age of Starlight#Certhas Daeron|standardization]].

If we are to accept the known values to these old Cirth, we will observe that they don&amp;rsquo;t cover all the sounds of Sindarin, since we are missing ''rh'', ''lh'', ''mh'', ''v'', ''y'', ''œ''. The most possible explanation is that those early Cirth were used for the &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo; tongue, and many of the above mentioned sounds indeed didn&amp;rsquo;t exist in that language. However this doesn't explain the absence of sounds ''w'' and ''a''. This indicates that some ancient, unknown cirth could have existed, but didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the later systems and therefore aren't given by Tolkien; a fuller table therefore can't be reconstructed.

As for the vowel usage, perhaps the certh for ''u'' possibly was used for ''w'' (like in early latin orthography). The certh for ''a'' can&amp;rsquo;t be guessed, so maybe this sound was &amp;ldquo;meant&amp;rdquo; (like in some Quenya Tengwar Modes). More possibly it was one of the two cirth whose value can&amp;rsquo;t be determined, or it was one of some other cirth that did not survive till the later Angerthas.

Long vowels were evidently indicated by doubling (cf. the known certh for long ''o'', &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;, is a simplified form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;bb&lt;/em&gt;).

: '''''Note:''' The term &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo; is used hypothetically to facilitate understanding of Sindarin etymology, although we don&amp;rsquo;t know if it actually existed, and when. The term &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo; is not a term used by Tolkien, but the term, as well as the language, are based on &amp;ldquo;Old Noldorin&amp;rdquo; as known by him.''

=== Notes ===
&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;: The original value of this certh wasn&amp;rsquo;t given by Tolkien, but he mentions that in later Angerthas, it took the value ''hw'' after &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; became ''m'' (for reasons explained below) while he doesn't give us the early certh for M. We can infer that this was the certh for M judging by both its 'labial' shape, and the symmetrical shape used for nasals, like &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;@&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/em&gt;: As mentioned, this certh will have the value ''m'' in later Angerthas, for reasons explained below. Its original value can&amp;rsquo;t be guessed (maybe the certh for ''a''?), but judging from the  &amp;ldquo;labial&amp;rdquo; shape, it could be ''w''.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;%&lt;/em&gt;: As Tolkien mentioned, the reversal of the stem didn&amp;rsquo;t had any phonologic significance. These Cirth were interchangeable and used for ''h'' or ''s'' depending on when &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; was ''s'' or ''h''. This would perhaps apply to these early Cirth as well

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;: Similarly, this Certh was ''h'' when &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;%&lt;/em&gt; were ''s'' and vice versa.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;: This Certh will have the value ''ss'' in later Angerthas. It must had another unknown value before (maybe the certh for ''a''?).

=== Examples ===
As mentioned, it is probable that this primitive Certhas were used &amp;ldquo;Old Sindarin&amp;rdquo;, and we can try to see how some words could be written. The spelling exemplified here assumes that like in Latin, a single certh was used for ''w'' and ''u'', and similarly for ''k'', ''t'' and ''p'' for ''kh'', ''th'' and ''ph''. Since we can&amp;rsquo;t guess the form of ''a'', we will consider that it was actually ommited.
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g82Rb@&lt;/em&gt;, STBRON (''*st&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;abron''), &amp;ldquo;carpenter&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Sbbl&lt;/em&gt;, WÔI (''*wôia''), &amp;ldquo;envelope&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;bReaa&lt;/em&gt;, ORKLL (''*orkhalla''), &amp;ldquo;superior&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;ua52z&lt;/em&gt;, ÑLMBE (''*ñalambe''), &amp;ldquo;barbarous speech&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;lSRl@z&lt;/em&gt;, IURINE (''*yurine''), &amp;ldquo;I run&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Sz9&lt;/em&gt;, UED (''*weda''), &amp;ldquo;bond&amp;rdquo;

== Certhas Daeron ==
In the Valian Year 1350&lt;ref&gt;The Grey Annals&lt;/ref&gt;, Dairon (better known as Daeron), the Minstrel and Loremaster of Doriath, reorganised the cirth and added new ones, making the extension of the cirth known as Angerthas Daeron (&amp;ldquo;Long Runerow of Daeron&amp;rdquo;), used for inscribing names in Menegroth. The Dwarves working for Thingol liked them and adopted them, making them known also in the East, beyond the Mountains.

The nature and the timeframe of the standardization however are obscure; some point the similarities between &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; et &lt;em style=&quot;font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; as signs that Daeron was influenced by the Tengwar, therefore this mustn't had occurred before the return of the Noldor, which means during the [[History of Elven writing systems/First Age|First Age]]. Unlike the previous system, the reversal of the certh had a phonemic significance: reversed cirth were softer versions of their originals. This also gives us another information: perhaps lenited consonants must have started to occur in Sindarin around that time.

Tolkien mentions that at that time (or maybe later) a sound of ''mh'' was needed. The most appropriate solution was to revert the certh for ''m'' to indicate its softening, but &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; (we assume it was this certh) couldn&amp;rsquo;t be reverted, so ''m'' was given to &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; (which until then had a value unknown to us), and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; got the value of ''hw''. The same process took place with ''r'', ''l'' etc., and maybe at that time the distinct cirth for semivowels and umlauts, like ''w'', ''y'' and ''œ'', were employed.

=== Examples ===
There are no Angerthas Daeron texts by Tolkien either, so we cannot know how the text forms can look like. By some English specimina we see at least that words are separated by dots, phrases by colons and longer periods by 3 or 4 dots. We don&amp;rsquo;t know if Angerthas Daeron, like Tengwar, used other diacritics for modificators or combinations like ''nd'', ''mb'', ''dw'', ''gw'' or diphthongs. It seems, however, quite straightforward, and for now we use them in close correspodence to the latin letters. The following examples attempt to show words as would be in the Age of the Starlight (Daeron&amp;rsquo;s time), so the first and last examples should be ''Gelydh'' and ''Elvellon'' in the 3rd Age.
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;c@@b@IluIumaG!&lt;/em&gt;, ''Annon-iñ-ñGœlydh'', &amp;ldquo;Gate of the Noldor&amp;rdquo;
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;lItlR0I#l@&lt;/em&gt;, ''I-chirth hin'', &amp;ldquo;these runes&amp;rdquo;

* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;za7zaab@&lt;/em&gt;, ''Elmhellon'', &amp;ldquo;Elf-friend&amp;rdquo;

= Mode of Beleriand =
When the Noldor came to Middle-earth, they were forbidden by King Elu Thingol to use Quenya&lt;ref&gt;'''The Silmarillion''' Ch 15 &quot;the Exiles took the Sindarin tongue in all their daily uses&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;and were forced to adopt Sindarin. They adapted Tengwar to their new language, taking advantage of their inherent flexibility to other sounds, imitating maybe the way the Teleri of Aman represented the Telerin sounds that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist in Quenya. For some obscure reasons we do not know, they found the most usual tehta-mode inappropriate for Sindarin, and they took therefore also example of the original Fëanorian Quanta-Sarme, using distinct tengwar for vowels. 

The Mode of Beleriand seems to have been held &amp;ldquo;traditionally&amp;rdquo; by the Noldor who were established in Eregion during the 2nd Age, as seen on the Moria Gate Inscription written by Celebrimbor&lt;ref&gt;'''''The Fellowship of the Ring''''', Journey in the Dark&lt;/ref&gt;. After Eregion was destroyed in SA 1697, the Noldor migrated to Imladris&lt;ref&gt;The Tale of Years&lt;/ref&gt;, where the Mode of Beleriand was perhaps used even till the 3rd Age&lt;ref&gt;The Road goes ever on&lt;/ref&gt;. The only Beleriandic texts attested are the '''Moria Gate Inscription''' and '''A Elbereth Gilthoniel''', the hymn of Imladris. Many of the tengwar haven&amp;rsquo;t been attested in those texts, and it&amp;rsquo;s uncertain if they were used at all.

It seems that Sindarin speakers found use only for 3 of the 5 témar. Of the Quessetéma, only Wilya is attested, as a final -''u'' (spelled -''w'' by Tolkien, in ''tîw''). There is also an ''a''-tengwa, not corresponding with any of the older ones known from Quenya. We don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was a new invention or imported from a Quenya semivowel unknown to us, but more probably it is the ''a''-letter from Fëanor&amp;rsquo;s [[../Age of Starlight#Quanta Sarme|Quanta-Sarme]].

Since the vowels were separate letters, the carriers took vowel values too. The short carrier was for ''i'', while in the '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''', written in the later '[[../Third_Age#Sindarin &quot;Full Writing&quot; with &quot;General Use&quot; Consonants|General Use with full writing]]', used in Arnor, we see the long carrier for the semiconsonantal initial sound ''y-'' (spelled ''i-'' by Tolkien, as in ''Ioreth''). We don&amp;rsquo;t know if the latter was an Arnorian employment or was used even back in the original Beleriand Mode.

In the same text, we also find the ''w''-tehta used over consonants as well for labialisation (''edwen'', which would be written here as &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;l2èl6&lt;/em&gt;), since the Quessetéma was discarded. A tilde is used before stops for nasalisation, since Anto, Ampa etc. took different values.

Diphthongs were expressed by tehtar. Two overdots, maybe a remnant of the Tyelpetéma, used for -''i'' in the diphthongs ''ai'', ''ei'' and ''ui''. Similarly for ''au'' (spelled -''aw'' finally by Tolkien), we assume the ''w''-tehta was used (''caun'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;a]é6&lt;/em&gt;). ''ae'' is attested written with the separate letters for ''a'' and ''e'', and maybe the same applies to the diphthong ''oe'' too. Another tehta was used to indicate long vowels, an acute accent called Andaith (''á'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;]R&lt;/em&gt;)

A well-known tehta that indicates long consonants, the under-tilde, wasn&amp;rsquo;t used. Long ''m'' and ''n'' were written with Malta and Númen (i.e., doubling of the lúva), while in the '''Moria Gate Inscription''', other long consonants were written with two letters, so maybe this under-tilde wasn&amp;rsquo;t used earlier in Aman either, but is a later device.

In the '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''', the letter of lenited ''m (mh)'' appears, which is a &amp;ldquo;nasal variant of ''v''&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;spirant ''m''&amp;rdquo;, but we don&amp;rsquo;t know its form in this mode.

=== Notes ===
'''Tengwar Names''': Even if we assume the names we know from '''Appendix E''' were the original ones used back in Aman, it is sure that the Sindarin users of the Sindarin modes changed their names, like any other race did according to their system. However, since those names are unknown, their known Quenya names will be used for these annotations.

'''Malta/Númen''': Because of their doubled lúvar, those tengwar were considered as lenghtened forms of Vala and Órë, which had the values of ''m'' and ''n'', respectively.

'''Unque''': This letter is not attested in any Sindarin text, neither is the sound it theoretically represented, but we can theorize that this sound existed in very early Sindarin (''g'' dissappeared in the middle of words via this sound. Cf. early Quenya ''3''). If the Noldor came to Middle-earth when this sound still existed, it is likely that they represented it by this tengwa, before finally disappearing. See also Gasdil.

'''Gasdil''': The lenited ''g'' sound was indicated by a sign called Gasdil, which is an elaboration of the letter Halla. It is used like Tolkien uses the apostrophe, to indicate a missing ''g'': ''galadh'', &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo;, but ''i ‘aladh'', &amp;ldquo;the tree&amp;rdquo;.

'''Noldo''': This letter is neither attested, but it is easy to assume that it represented the sound ''ñ'', which Tolkien transcribed as ''ng''. This sound (that existed initially in Quenya) in Sindarin occurs only in nasal mutations and finally (like in ''ang''), and was different from medial ''ng'' (like in ''ungol''). So, if both weren&amp;rsquo;t written with a tilde over an Anga, Noldo was most likely used for the former, like it was in Quenya.

'''Wilya''': Maybe for prevocalic and final ''w'' (e.g., ''tawarwaith'', ''tiw''). Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used for the diphthong ''au'' (finally spelled -''aw'').

'''Arda/Alda''': Tolkien states that these letters were used for the initial soft sounds ''rh'' and ''lh'' (spelled ''hr'' and ''hl'' in Quenya).

'''Silmë Nuquerna''': It is not known if this tengwa existed in Aman or if it is a Beleriandic invention. In tehtar-modes, however, it was used when a tehta should be placed over Silme. In this mode, the sound it represents is the vowel ''y'' (not to be confused with the consonantal Quenya ''y'' in ''yulma'').

'''Essë''': This letter (previously Ázë) is found in the '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''' (and in 3rd Age Quenya texts) to have the value of ''ss''. But it is not known which took it from which. There are two probabilities:
* Sindarin didn&amp;rsquo;t possess the ''z'' sound, so the Noldor gave it the value of ''ss''. Quenya imitated this Sindarin mode and gave the value of ''ss'' to that letter, which had till that time the value of ''r''.
* The '''King&amp;rsquo;s Letter''' is a 4th Age Sindarin text. Maybe the value ''ss'' of this tengwa was an attribute borrowed from the Quenya mode of that time.

'''Essë Nuquerna''': We lack a letter for the umlaut sound ''œ'' found in early Sindarin (later becoming ''e''), but a wild guess is that perhaps Essë nuquerna was used, similarly like Silmë nuquerna was used for ''y''.

'''Hyarmen''': Sindarin didn&amp;rsquo;t possess palatalised sounds. ''hy'' had became ''h''. Hyarmen was employed for this soft sound, not to be confused with ''ch''.

'''Hwesta Sindarinwa''': This mysterious letter, said to have the value ''hw'', had never appeared in any of the Sindarin texts. It is unknown why was it employed instead of Hwesta and when. It was probably used much later by the mannish modes, where Hwesta was used for the sound ''ch'' or ''chw''.

=== Examples ===
The best known sample of the Mode of Beleriand is of course the '''Moria Gate Inscription''', written by Celebrimbor of Eregion, a Noldorin place where this Mode was preserved.

Tolkien has written the hymn of Imladris, '''A Elbereth Gilthoniel''', in this mode. Imladris, inhabited by the refugees of Eregion, is one of the places that might have kept the Mode of Beleriand, even in the 3rd Age.

= Runes of Gondolin =
This system was perhaps an invention of Pengolodh or other loremasters, and was employed obviously in Gondolin (or in Nevrast, at earliest).

Like the Tengwar and the Cirth, the forms of these runes show a relation between sound and shape. It is not known if the few similarities to the cirth are coincidental or not. Pengolodh, however, was not aware of the Cirth before he, with the survivors of destroyed Gondolin, migrated to the Mouths of Sirion.

It is not known if the values given by Tolkien (and presented here) are the original, or his own adaptation for writing English, Modern or Old. One reason against the former is that the sounds given are not found in the known elven languages of the First Age, but it may be that it was designed for notating a variety of languages. Glamdring and Orcrist, the famous swords, had probably inscriptions in that system, because Elrond (who it is stated to know of all types of runes) could read their inscriptions since he was born in Arvernien, while Gandalf was unable to.

The system of Gondolin was perhaps dropped out of use after its fall, but used for a while in Arvernien. It is mentioned that there Pengolodh was fascinated by the Certhas Daeron brought by the survivors of Doriath (perhaps it seemed to him a more perfected system), and adopted it for his works. They seem to have been obsoleted and forgotten by the Third Age, and this is supported by the abovementioned fact that only Elrond could read the swords&amp;rsquo; inscriptions.

This system has appeared only in an article of '''Mythlore''' issue 69, by Paul Nolan Hyde, publishing an early concept of Tolkien. Its existence is not explicitly stated in the known later texts, but the above story about Glamdring is evidence that indeed a different kind of runes was used in Gondolin.

=== Notes ===
&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;ñ&lt;/em&gt;: This rune seems to be used both for ''n'' and -''ng'' (''ñ'').

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Ö&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;UU&lt;/em&gt;: These runes were used for long ''œ'' and ''y'' respectively, but there are no such accented characters in typesetting, so they are displayed here as double. The sounds they represents are of those that appear in the alphabet, but not attested in any elvish tongue.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;: This rune is described as ''x'', however, this is an alternate spelling for the Sindarin sound ''ch'', not the English ''x'' (Quenya ''ks''). For ''x'', the letter &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;K&lt;/em&gt; was used.

=== Examples ===
If we accept the values of the runes above, maybe these were the inscriptions of the famous swords of '''The Hobbit''':
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;glamdriñ&lt;/em&gt;, ''Glamdring'' (Foe-hammer)
* &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: Gondolin; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;orkrist&lt;/em&gt;, ''Orcrist'' (Orc-cleaver)

I have no idea who the author is. However, if the guy whose name was put at the bottom is a real person and he had nothing to do with the article, then it's pretty unfair that his name was put there. If he isn't a real person, well, then it doesn't matter if I removed it. And if he really was the author, then he can go ahead and put his name back on it if he really wants to be associated with such rubbish. And if you're the author, well, go and put you're name back there - I won't remove it again.</text>

'''Allspice''', also ''Jamaica pepper'', sometimes ''pimento'', is the unripe berry of the ''Pimienta dioica'' tree; which is dried, ground, and used as a seasoning. Its name comes from its flavor, which is reminiscent of many spices, including [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]], and [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]], with a [[Cookbook:Pepper|peppery]] flavor. 

It is the primary spice in the [[Cookbook:Jamaican Jerk Spice|Jamaican Jerk Spice]] blend.

In this cookbook, '''half and half''' refers to a mixture of 50% [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] and 50% [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]. This is available as a pre-mixed product in the USA, so many American recipes specify it as an ingredient.

Elsewhere, half and half is a name often given to a mix of a light-coloured beer with a dark-coloured beer, or some other mix of alcoholic beverages.

[[Image:ARS_Durian.jpg|frame|right|Durian]]
'''Durian''' (''Durio'') is a green, spiny fruit from Southeast Asia. This &quot;King of Fruits&quot; has a complex, rich flavor and an intense odor which many find offensive. The fruit's stench has caused it to be banned from public places in some countries and has [http://www.durianpalace.com/newsmedia/DTA/durian_terror_alarm.htm caused evacuations]. Durians can sometimes be found in normal supermarkets in Western countries, frozen and thickly wrapped in plastic.

A durian is opened by splitting it along natural sections. You might be able to see them on the outside as places where the spines run parallel. A durian can be forced open with the hands. Though not needed, a sturdy knife can be helpful to get things started. A durian will start to open itself when it is really ripe. Once opened, a durian should be eaten quickly.

Durian fruit is used to flavour a wide variety of sweet edibles such as traditional Malay candy, ice kachang, rose biscuits, cakes, and, with a touch of modern innovation, ice cream, milkshakes, mooncakes and even cappuccino. Pulut Durian is glutinous rice steamed with coconut milk and served with ripened durian. In Sabah, red durian (''D. dulcis'') is fried with onions and chilli and served as a side dish. '''[[Cookbook:Tempoyak|Tempoyak]]''' refers to fermented durian, usually made from lower quality durian that is unsuitable for direct consumption.Tempoyak can be eaten either cooked or uncooked, is normally eaten with rice, and can also be used for making curry. Sambal Tempoyak is a Sumatran dish made from the fermented durian fruit, coconut milk, and a collection of spicy ingredients known as sambal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Central Sierra Miwok is a nearly extinct Native American language of central California, closely related to the other Miwok languages (spoken from Marin to Yosemite) and ultimately a member of the widespread Penutian family of the west coast of North America.

==Lesson 1==

Traditionally, Central Sierra Miwok was not a written language; however, it has been written by linguists using phonological notation and a few special symbols.

It has 6 vowels: 
* a, e, i, o, u are all pronounced as in Spanish - that is, ah, eh, ee, oh, oo
* ï (usually written y by linguists) is a sound not found in English, halfway between the vowels in the English words &quot;book&quot; and &quot;mitt&quot;. It sounds like Turkish ı or Russian ы.

Most of its consonants occur in English:
* ch (written č by linguists), h, k, l, m, n, ng (written ŋ by linguists), p, s, sh (written š by linguists), w, y (written j by linguists)

but a couple don't:
* In English there is only one t sound.  In Miwok there are two: an &quot;alveolar&quot; t, like English t (written ṭ by linguists) and a &quot;dental&quot; t, like Spanish or Italian t (written t by linguists).  Since the &quot;dental&quot; t sounds closer to English th, and there is no th sound in Miwok, it will be written &quot;th&quot; here.
* ^ (written ˀ by linguists) is called a glottal stop - it effectively means you don't combine the vowel before it together with the vowel after it, but stop between them instead.

If a t plus an h or an s plus an h is intended, instead of a th or sh sound, we will write s'h, t'h to remove ambiguity.

Both vowels and consonants can be doubled, like in Finnish; you pronounce aa longer than a, and tt longer than t.

==Lesson 2==

Let's start with a few simple nouns:

* person: miwwï
* acorn-bread: ïlee
* acorn soup: nïppa

and verbs:

* say: kachchï
* eat: ïwwï

English makes a difference between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;, or &quot;he&quot; and &quot;him&quot;: you say &quot;he&quot; if he is the one doing something (subject case), and &quot;him&quot; if something is being done to him (object case).  In Miwok, you have to make this distinction for all nouns: you add -^ at the end of the subject, and -y at the end of the object.  If you did this in English, you might say: &quot;I eat nïppay&quot;, but &quot;The nïppa^ spilled&quot;, for instance.

The order of words is different from English: instead of saying &quot;man bites dog&quot;, you would normally say &quot;man dog bites&quot;.

* The person eats acorn-bread: ''miwwï^ ïleey ïwwï''
* The person eats acorn soup: ''miwwï^ nïppay ïwwï''
* The person says &quot;ah&quot;: ''miwwï^ &quot;aa&quot; kachchï''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, this is a new one on me.  I had never heard of Wiki Books or the Wikiversity, and here's an entry for LIS.  What ideas do you have for this page?  Do you intend to offer a lot of info?  Where is all of this going?  I'm a young librarian with a passing interest in the wiki and just happened by here.

I'll check back and see who's around later.  Good luck!

== LIS program ==

I started the LIS program because I realized that much of what I learned in my MLIS program could be done at my own pace at home.  I'm hoping to pass on much of what I payed my hard-earned tuition for, so that others can perhaps learn some of this on their own.  The program is loosely structured on the LIS program I attended.  As time goes on, I hope to slowly develop each of the &quot;classes.&quot;

I of course welcome any additions that anyone can offer.[[User:Clifflandis|Clifflandis]] 23:48, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Wiki Research Skills?? ==

I'm teaching electronic media and research skills to high school freshman, and this seems like a really good place to develop a basic primer for such a course. My course covers internet beginnings and history, seach tools, surface web and deep web as resources, information evaluation, and basic library research skills. I'm interested in adding sections on blogging and the wiki-world of information, too. 

But here's the thing: These are amazing new ways of constructinig information - but I wonder about how they will develop. It seems it will be increasingly important and necessary to find ways to contextualize these forms of information, and that that needs to be taught to people, too. The wiki-world and the blogosphere need to be understood to be in relation to other more traditional forms of information. In fact, a great part of their value lies in just that fact that they are so free. But, that does not make them necessarily better, more correct, more reliable, less biased, less corrupted than other forms  of information. The freedom has value - and that requires a certain acceptance of responsibility on our parts. For young people, most people, really, all &quot;information&quot; is equal. THey jump into a see of words and accept it all. !here is no concern, much less understanding that there IS a context in which we are living, giving, receiving this information, and that that context has meaning, too. 

At any rate, getting back to the course, it seems that media skills modules that address some of these aspects of information organization, evaluation, retrieval, and meaning making, could be a great wiki-library tool, useful for all kinds of learners. 

What do you all think?

== Is this school still active? ==

Hi there,

I'm new to the WikiWorld and only came across WikiVersity on Friday (25/11). I got all excited and thought I'd build myself a LIS School only to find that this one was already here. 

Only thing is that there isn't a lot of content here and there hasn't been much activity recently either. This has got me wondering if the school is still active.

I'd really like to be involved in moving the school forward - It's just I dont want to offend anyone by doing too much and being accused of taking over or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_vandalism  worse things]

Is the school still being worked on?

Thanks

== Move from Wikiversity to Wikibooks ==

This page seems to be a Wikibook, not a school of Wikiversity. I suggest moving the six blue links here to a [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves|bookshelf]], or merging them into one book. That would fix the present naming-convention problem. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:23, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

== Introduction to Sashimi ==
'''Sashimi''' is raw meat, sliced very thin. It is typically served with [[Cookbook:Onigiri|onigiri]] or [[Cookbook:Sushi|sushi]]. Although the meat used is usually a kind of [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] can also be used.

== Making Sashimi ==
=== Ingredients ===
* Almost any type of fish
** Salmon
** Tuna
*

=== Procedure ===
Since the meat is raw, it is important that it be as fresh as possible. Slice as thinly as possible across the grain to keep it tender, like you would a steak.


=== Tips, Notes, and Variations ===
* Some people avoid freshwater fish (i.e., freshwater [[Cookbook:Eel|eel]] (''unagi''), [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]) entirely, because they may contain parasites that do not live in saltwater. (These parasites are killed during cooking.)

OsiriX is developed in collaboration by a core group of developers headed by Antoine Rosset.  To allow collaborative development the current source code is stored on a remote server at the sourceforge site.  Getting the code and merging changes is handled by the SVN version management system.

In order to build your own copy of OsiriX you must have Apple's developer tools (Xcode) v 3.1. For best results use the latest version of Xcode.  Currently (July 2008) Xcode v 3.1 is only available as part of the iPhone SDK. It can be downloaded from http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/. It is available for free though you will have to set up an account.

The next two sections describe how to get the source code and compile it once you have it.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jdl32579. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jdl32579~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

In order to check out (fetch an initial copy) of the OsiriX source code, you need to have [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion] installed.

== Anonymous Access ==
Anonymous access is simple if you don't plan to submit any changes to the project.  Open up Terminal.  '''cd''' to a root directory to check out your code.  Mine is /Users/spalte.  Then type: 
&lt;nowiki&gt;
svn co https://osirix.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osirix osirix
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This will then chunder for a while and you will end up with a directory called osirix containing the source ie for my setup /Users/spalte/osirix. Now you are ready to build the project.

When the download is complete open the project in x-code, then select the unzip binaries target and build this and then build the deveolpment target.

Now that you have the source code you are ready to build.

1) Open osiriX.xcodeproj

2) Choose '&quot;Unzip Binaries&quot; as the active target and then click Build.

3) Choose &quot;Development&quot; as the active target and then click Build.

You should now have an application that runs.  Before you run though if you already have a version of OsiriX installed on your system, BACKUP your OsiriX user data folder since this app will use the same version and there could be conflicts.

I have written (or more accurately pinched from the bibdesk website) a perl script to get the osirix source code called '''getosirixCVS.pl'''.  Download this onto your machine.  it is probably easiest to save it in your development directory.  Mine is /Users/jefferis/dev.  Go to the Terminal and run as follows:

gjg5:~/dev jefferis$ '''perl getosirixCVS.pl'''

Answer the questions and you will get a response that looks like this if you are using anonymous cvs

 After that open osirix/OsiriX.pbproj/ and commence the build.
 1) compile DCM.framework target FIRST. This will create the OsiriX.framework for OsiriXBurner application
 2) compile 'OsirixBurner.xcode' file
 3) compile all the PreferencePanes projects located in the 'Preference Panes' folder
 4) compile 'Osirix.pbproj' file with OsiriX target

or like this if you are using Developer access:

Huh?  Isn't the comma derivative the tensor quantity that is the normal partial derivative adjusted by a sum over the Christoffel symbols?  If the Christoffel symbols are zero, as they are in a flat space, the covariant derivative is the same as the normal derivative, but in general this is not the case.  Or am I missing something?


The tensor quantity that you're talking about is the covariant derivative and it's written as X&lt;sub&gt;;c&lt;/sub&gt; - Itzamna 2 Feb 2009</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You associate formatting instructions with a web page by defining CSS rules (whether in separate files, embedded, or inline see [[../Applying CSS to HTML and XHTML/]])

==Syntax==

Each rule has two parts: a selector and a group of one or more declarations surrounded by braces (curly brackets): 

::selector { declaration; declaration2; ...}

Each declaration is formed like this:

::property: value 

Remember that there can be several declarations in one rule. A common mistake is to mix up colons, which separate the property and value of a declaration, and semicolons, which separate declarations.
A selector chooses the elements for which the rule applies and
the declaration sets the value for the different properties of the elements that are chosen.

The property is one of many properties. [http://www.w3.org/ w3.org] has a list of all of the [http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/propidx.html CSS Properties].

==Basic Uses==
Here is an example of how you would make all &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; elements appear bold:

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
span {
	font-weight: bold;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;font-weight: bold;&lt;/code&gt; declaration has the property &lt;code&gt;font-weight&lt;/code&gt; and the value &lt;code&gt;bold&lt;/code&gt; which makes the font bold.

That would appear like this:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Bold Text&lt;/span&gt;}}

A slightly more complex example is

&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
span {
	font-weight: bold;
	color: yellow;
	background-color: black;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

That would appear like this:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold; color: yellow; background-color: black;&quot;&gt;Yellow Bold Text&lt;/span&gt;
}}

You can use many other properties, and values, but this is just a beginning as to how to use CSS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bambara''', or '''Bamanakan''' in the language itself, is a language in West Africa, mostly in Mali, where it is mother tongue of the ''Bambara'' people (30% of the population), and where 80% of the population can communicate in the language. Bambara will also be useful in Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, and Gambia. Together with Jula (French spelling ''Dioula''), Malinké, and Mandingo, it belongs to the Mandekan family of more or less mutually comprehensible languages, which itself part of the Mande group, which is a Niger-Congo language subgroup.the bambaran tribe were mostly Muslim.they took some of the luageguage

It is a Subject Object Verb language and it is a tonal language with two tones.
It uses seven vowels a, e, é, i, o, ó and u (a like in car, e like in echo, é similar
to the second e in echelon but more open, i like in India, o like in for, ó like the
final sound in gnaw, and u like in the name Honolulu).

==History, influences==
In the past and present Bambara has strongly been influenced by French. Any knowledge of French is of great use when learning Bambara. And during your first attempts of actually speaking the language you can try to use French words if you don't yet know the Bambara word for something. &lt;!-- haven't tried this yet, but sounds obvious :) If _you_ know better: please write about your experience --&gt;

==Sound==
It is a tonal language, with two different tones, high and low. Within a word the tone can only be rising. 

==Grammar==
Like Turkish and Japanese, it is an agglutinative language, meaning that morphemes are glued together to form a word.

The basic sentence structure is Subject Object Verb.  Take the phrase, &quot;n t'a don&quot; (I don't know [it]). &quot;n&quot; is the subject (me), &quot;a&quot; is the object (it), and &quot;[ka] don&quot; is the verb ([to] know). The &quot;t'&quot; is from the present tense marker &quot;té.&quot; &quot;té&quot; is the negative present tense marker and &quot;bé&quot; is the affirmative present tense marker. Therefore, &quot;n b'a don&quot; would mean &quot;I know it&quot;.  

==Contents==
* [[/Verbs|Verbs]]
* [[/Vocabulary|Vocabulary]]

===Particles===
There are no definite particle in Bambara.

===Gender===
Gender can explicitly be expressed by using the suffixes '''-muso''' for feminine and '''-kè''' for masculine. For instance

;jakuma
:cat

;den
:child

===Questions===
In Bambara there are three different ways for turning a sentence into a question. The first is simply using a question mark, or a change of expression, of tone, which is common in French, and the other two are like Japanese and Chinese where an interrogative particle is used to indicate that the sentence is a question:

# .. '''wa'''?  - at the end of a sentence
#¿'''yali''' ..  - at the beginning of a sentence

====Interrogatives====
;min? (at the end of the sentence)
:where?

;mun .. ?
:what?

;munna .. ?
:why

;jón .. ?
:who?


===Plural===
The plural is indicated with a '''w''' at the end of a word, and '''uu''' for words ending in '''u'''.

;musow
:women

===Pronouns===
;né : me, I, my, mine
;i : you, your, yours
;a : he, she, him, her, his, hers, it
;aw : you, your, yours (plural)
;an : us, our, ours
;u, alou : they, their, theirs

Note that Bambara doesn't have a special possessive pronoun. Possession is formed using the ''ka'' particle, e.g. ''ne ka mobili'' - my car.

= Quenya Mode =
Some changes occurred in Noldorin phonology, already in Valinor, that differentiated it from the dialect of the Vanyar: ''th'' merged with ''s'', initial ''ch'' with ''h'' and maybe later, but still before the Exile, ''z'' with ''r''. Those changes were inherited to Exilic Quenya which slowly evolved further.

There is not much known about the slow elvish evolution in 2nd Age, but certainly the sages of Númenor, as well as Elven sages of middle-Earth, were using the Quenya Tengwar and applied some changes and simplifications to them. It is not known when exactly those changes that brought us to the final form of the table in '''Appendix E''' took place, but if we consider some changes as “early” or “late”, we could attribute some intermediate stages to the 2nd Age. It still must be noted that some changes described here could not had happened then, but later.

Aldwin Lowdham wrote some Numenorian names with tengwar and Lisa Star believes this writing represents a Numenorean mode. This mode reminds of Sanskrit: since a was very frequent, its sign was sometimes left out, and the sound was just meant, giving the script therefore an [[Wikipedia:abugida|abugida]] flavour. An unutixë (underdot), which in this case was called Putta, was used to indicate that a consonant is not followed by any vowel (''Minyatur'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;t%5Ô1Y6Ê&lt;/em&gt;).

=== Notes ===
*'''Extended stems''': The Grade of extended stems was hardly usable by that time. Elvish had certainly lost aspirated sounds and Númenorians didn’t had much need to record Valarin. They should however have found a place in Adûnaic orthography, or in archaic elvish studies.
*'''Árë''': This letter was used for ''r'' (which previously had been a ''z'') for orthographic reasons. Since there was already Rómen for intervocalic ''r'', (''auzel'' and the later ''aurel'' should both be written &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;.D,Rj&lt;/em&gt;, but ''aurel'' could be written &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;.D7Rj&lt;/em&gt; as well) Árë was renamed Essë and took the value of long ''s''. Maybe the application of value ''ss'' was an influence from the earlier Mode of Beleriand.
*'''Tyelpetéma''': Some changes took place in Tyelpetéma: the archaic (and Vanyarin) word Quendya and Noldorin Quenya demonstrate a simplification ''ndy &gt; ny''. So Indyo must became *Inyo, making the letter useless and replaced by Nyellë. Similarly Istyar became Istar and shows a process ''sty &gt; st''. Maybe these reasons, and the change ''zy'' &gt; ''ry'', consisted Tyelpetéma obsoleted as a separate series. The palatalised sounds will be now shown with its remnant, the “following ''y''” underdots.
*'''Harma/Aha''': In the days of Aman, initial ''ch'' was softened and merged with ''h'', and Charma became Harma. Harma might still be used initially, but it seems (later?) it was replaced by Hyarmen. Harma was renamed Acha and was used now only medially where the sound ch remained unchanged.
*'''Súlë''': The sound ''th'' merged with ''s'' since very early in Noldorin. It is known that for orthographic reasons, Súlë was used for ''s'' in words that once were ''th'' (eg. ''thanga'' and later ''sanga'' would be written &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;3Ds#&lt;/em&gt;, not **&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;iEs#&lt;/em&gt;). One can wonder why it didn’t get another useful value, like Árë did, since Súlë was confused with Silmë.
*'''Anna''': The ''3'' sound had been dissappeared and the carrier was now solely used to carry the tehtar. But Anna was still used with the “following ''y''” dots to represend the ''y'' consonant since it seems Yanta was now used only to represent ''–i'' in diphtongs.
*'''Arya''': Noldorin z merged with ''r'', and ''zy'' became ''ry''. It seems that when Árë became Essë, the ''ry'' sound began to be indicated by Rómen/Órë and the “following ''y''” nuntixi (maybe after Tyelpetéma was disemployed).
*'''Rómen/Órë''': Maybe by that time, those two ''r''’s began to have the known from the later Tengwar texts functions: Rómen before vowels and Órë anywhere else (before consonants and finally).
*'''Hyarmen''': This letter was simplified to ''h'', maybe because of Sindarin influence, and by the 3rd Age displaced Halla completely (and maybe Harma). Its old ''hy'' value was restored when borrowing the “following ''y''” nuntixi.
*'''Halla''': This letter was replaced by Hyarmen, but it was still used before initial l and ''r'' to show that those consonants are to be pronounced softer (''hrívë'', &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;&amp;#189;7~ByR&lt;/em&gt;)

=General Use mode=
The Noldor founded Eregion in the year 750 of the Second Age. When this civilization reached its peak, it was already a cultural and financial crossroad of races: Noldor, Sindar, Dwarves and Men, Dúnedain or other. 

In [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS58 '''The Howlett Rivendell Inscriptions'''], Tolkien affirms that there was a &quot;general use (applicable to both S[indarin] and Q[uenya])&quot; around the end of the Third Age but there is some evidence that the same or similar concept must have been employed back to the Eregion times: The Third Age &quot;general use&quot; shown by Tolkien is consistent to the Second Age [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS7 the '''Ring-inscription'''], which, Isildur says, is &quot;fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''''Isildur's Scroll''''', read at the '''''Council of Elrond'''''&lt;/ref&gt;; this mode bore many similarities to the actual theoretical and unused [[History of Elven writing systems/Age of Starlight#Rumilian_Influence|values]] of the Tengwar.

A similar system is also used for the few late Second Age Adûnaic words in [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS50 '''Edwin Lowdham's Manuscript''', Text I], we may tentatively assume that the &quot;general use&quot; is of Númenorian influences. 

The origins of the General Use Mode are unclear; we can assume that it originated in Eregion that could satisfy the needs of non-Elvish languages and facilitate writing and communication in those multicultural circumstances; out of this contact Sauron could have inscribed the Ring. But it is also possible that this Mode originated in Númenor and spread with the use of Westron.

Since the '''Ring Inscription''' is the only Second Age source for this, and because the &quot;General Use&quot; is mentioned mostly in context to the Third Age, please see [[../Third Age#&quot;General Use&quot;|the relevant section]]

= Angerthas Daeron =
Similar to the &quot;General Use&quot; modes, the Cirth also saw universal usage. The Gelydh (Noldor) made use of the cirth and made a name for them in Quenya, ''Certar''. They even extended the Certhas and added several cirth. The adding of 2 whole new rows was attributed to the Ghelydh (CH-row and QU-row). It was considered an extention of Certhas Daeron, so it was named Angerthas Daeron (''and+certhas=long runerow).

Tolkien is not clear about when the name 'Angerthas Daeron' was used. '''An Introduction to Elvish''' interprets Tolkien as if the Angerthas was an earlier invention, while the authors use the custom name 'Angerthas Eregion' to refer to the system of the Second Age explained below.

Whatever this system was called, we see the innovations concerning the employment of the two new CH and QU-series, a new certh for ''h'' to replace the previous certh &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt; which became ''ch''. This certh was preferred for ''ch'' because its shape seemed to be between the shapes of the T and K cirth (&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; T + &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/em&gt; K &gt; &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt; CH), to represent how the ''ch'' sound also (phonologically) exist between ''t'' and ''c''. There was also a new certh for ''nd'', which as Tolkien notes, its form wasn’t much related to the dental cirth.

Some of the new letters were used for sounds of Quenya (and other tongues) not found in Sindarin. In that stage, the Angerthas reached its fullest extent, but for most forms of writing other than carving, the Tengwar were used.

=== Notes ===
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt;: This certh was used for ''h'', but was chosen for ''ch'', as it occurred phonologically between sounds ''t'' and ''c'', and its shape looked intermediate between the Cirth &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;. Not to be confused with Sindarin ''ch''!
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/em&gt;: Since it represents the labialised sound ''kw'' (also spelled ''qu''), its shape was maybe a mixture of the Cirth &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;1&lt;/em&gt;.
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;: Tolkien shows two distinct signs for ''s'' as indifferent. Their exact use can’t be guessed and isn’t obvious like the relation of the tengwar Silmë and Silmë Nuquerna.
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;: Tolkien gives the value ''z'' to that letter (in alien systems?), but notes it was ''ss'' when used in Quenya and Sindarin.
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;: Maybe near that time, this new certh was made for the value of ''h'', similar in shape to the former &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;#&lt;/em&gt; (and to the tengwa Hyarmen &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica';&quot;&gt;9&lt;/em&gt;).

=== Examples ===
The Angerthas was convenient for Quenya and alien languages, probably Mannish, and maybe the ancestor of the Common Speech. We can see how some archaic Mannish words that maybe were current, can be written.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;9Dec@&lt;/em&gt;	''Dûkan'' (Roh. dweller)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;ecf8S&lt;/em&gt;	''Kastu'' (treasure)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Rnrl@&lt;/em&gt;	''Rógin'' (Woses)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8Rc.ca9&lt;/em&gt;	''Trahald'' (Nor. Mannish: burrowing)

= Angerthas Moria =
During the 2nd Age, or maybe its beginning, the Dwarves got accustomed with Angerthas of the Noldor and they modified it to suit Khuzdul, their language. This alphabet was spread further wherever the Dwarves went, hence the name Angerthas Moria, which is exemplified on the '''Balin's Tomb Inscription'''.

The Dwarves introduced various new cirth and some unsystematic minor changes to the values. The greatest of those changes, which resulted in major reorder, was the switch of the cirth for ''s'' and ''h'' (&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;), and for unknown reasons, the abandonment of the cirth &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;$&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;q&lt;/em&gt; for which they substituted &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;. Subsequently they used &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;@&lt;/em&gt; for ''r'' and subsequently &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/em&gt; for ''n''! 

They used also &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;, which was a simplified form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;u&lt;/em&gt;. Following the relation of those two letters, they gave to &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;w&lt;/em&gt; the value ''z'' to relate better with &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;, which as mentioned had now the value ''s''.

Tolkien doesn’t mention any other cirth abandoned by the Dwarves but much must have been, as there are many that represent sounds not occurring in (at least our published words of) Khuzdul, like ''th, dh, hw'' etc. It is strange also to observe that some of the cirth they introduced represent sounds not occurring in their language, like ''nj, hy, ñ, y-, hy''! Of course, our corpus of Khuzdul is very limited to judge the necessity or not, of these sounds.

=== Notes ===
*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;: This certh is said to represent the clear or glottal beginning of a word with an initial vowel. It seems that it is used in words derived from a consonantal base whose first consonant is a glottal stop.

*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt;: These cirth where a halved form of &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;, used for vowels like those in English ''butter''. When weak they were reduced to a stroke without a stem (&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/em&gt; represented a schwa sound, an unstressed vowel, while &lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; a sound similar to the schwa, only in stressed syllables.

*&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;: This sign is to denote aspirate ''kh, th'' etc which were frequent in Khuzdul.

=== Examples ===
The only Angerthas Moria inscription by Tolkien is '''Balin’s Tomb'''.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;2calu&lt;br&gt;
3SdluSa&lt;br&gt;
Sw2c9eVcwc99D6S&lt;/em&gt;

''Balin Fundinul UzbadKhazadDûmu''

Let’s see also the Dwarf battle-cry written.

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;}2c@SeeVcwv9IeVcwv9cl6x,S}&lt;/em&gt;

''Baruk Khazâd. Khazâd ai-mênu!''

and some other words:

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;uSaSeeVlw9lu&lt;/em&gt;	''Nulukkhizdin'' (caves of Nargothrond)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;8Vc@eDu&lt;/em&gt;	''Tharkûn'' (Staff-man, a surname of ‘Gandalf’)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;lral%6xe&lt;/em&gt;	''iglishmêk'' (the gesture code of the Dwarves)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;eVzaz9wv@c6&lt;/em&gt;	''Kheled-zâram'' &lt; K&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;-L-D, Z-R-M ('Mirrormere')

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;eVcwv9&lt;/em&gt; ''Khazâd'' &lt; K&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;-Z-D (Dwarves)

&lt;em style=&quot;font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;gcwvu&lt;/em&gt;	''‘azân'' &lt; `-Z-N (dimness, shadow)

Hi Jamesday, I just noticed your comment on the revision history of [[IT bookshelf]] (Jan 16, 2005) (&quot;despam. THE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS ARTICLE BEFORE THIS SPAM ARE MISSING DUE TO HUMAN ERROR BY ME. Sorry for the inconvenience.&quot;). How could this happen? I mean.. technically. I thought no page history can be deleted by a common user - or did you touch the database directly? Just curious... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 07:37, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:As James isn't here very often, I thought I'd let you know that he's a [[m:developer|developer]], which lets him do strange things. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 08:08, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::Oh, then he might help me with a problem I just posted on [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Who is responsible for the print CSS%3F]]:
::&quot;I'd like to add a box to my project, that does not show up on print, just on screen. I looked at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/skins/common/commonPrint.css Wikibooks commonPrint.css] but didn't find any generic class &quot;.noPrint&quot; or something like this. I could just use a class &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;DIV class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to mimic this behavior, but it is not a clean solution, as top might in the future also have other stylistic properties that I don't want to inherit. Any idea, who could change the CSS file mentioned above? It would be a simple one line addition to the CSS file. (adding it to my private CSS file would not be of much help, since I want to use this property in a book for everybody).&quot; --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 09:47, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[[Alchemy]]==
*This book passes off medieval pseudo-science as fact, offers baseless, ambiguous and contradictory claims (e.g. &quot;''This is an exercise in operative alchemy. That is the practical means of refinement. Speculative alchemy is what you are reading. Alchemy is the integration of knowledge into the practice or art of living. In this sense science is speculative. Technology is operative. Alchemy is the craft that combines the truth of science with the technology to enable that truth.''&quot;). Ridiculous assertions and bald-faced lies are tossed off nonchalantly (e.g. &quot;''The agenda of alchemy has always been the furtherance of human knowledge and the integration and improvement of society. Alchemy has also been a technological system, interested in working operations and the preparation of material wealth, longevity and a big theory of everything now being attempted by modern physics.''&quot;).

*The book offers no prospect of being changed or improved to something of value (or even something not completely false).

*The book is not a science textbook (it's listed in the science section), nor even a textbook of any kind. I see no compelling argument for its existence on Wikipedia.--[[User:24.103.207.38|24.103.207.38]] 22:16, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)
**Extraordinary as it may seem you do not have the ability to predict the potential of something to evolve. There are few things that are more able to generate correction than that which is completely false. According to your interpretation the book merely needs to be factual. Operative alchemy is partly based on paradox and multi leveled symbols - what you refer to as ambiguety and contradiction. It also uses ridiculous assertions to test the 'metal' and response of those who are easily swayed by such techniques. The alchemical term for such people is 'puffers'. If you know what is required to refine this book then please do so. However it may be that you belong to those who have always had a tendency to burn and flame what is beyond their certainties. I gather this is not your intention? [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 21:10, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)
***Please speak in plain English - I can't follow what you are saying. Are you saying that it's perfectly ok to right something that is not factual into an article? because if you I'm afraid that you are going against the whole ethos of wikibooks ans the wikimedia foundation. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:59, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Well maybe it should be moved to media studies? Are you seriously suggesting there are no textbooks on operative alchemy of this kind. Clearly one is required. [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 21:10, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I agree it's not a science textbook, but that can be delt with by removing it from the science section. I'm not at all convinced that it needs to be delted outright though. The book needs serious amounts of work, but we since alchemy did lead to the science of chemistry we should have abook on this subject. '''Weak keep''' [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:59, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' As long as the textbook does not pass itself off as fact (so it should have a clear warning at the top), it seems like something that somebody may want to find out about.  Definitely needs quite a bit of work though.

*'''Keep''' Just because the topic of the book is not part of mainstream science doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to exist. I would be very interested in reading about the history of alchemy, myself. However, I would suggest that the language, which seems particularly obfuscatory and murky (as may be the nature of such a topic), be clarified. --[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 13:32, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Will start the History section for you Chuck [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 19:18, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)


*'''Keep'''- I think there could be a category for funny useless books, like Vandwelling, Time Travel Genius, and this.  But if those others go, this should too. -- [[User:Tormod|Tormod]] 04:56, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)


*'''Keep''' Alchemy is philosophy, and an ancient perspective on percieved manifested reality, identity and evolution WITHIN that context, using terms suited to the perspectives, and style of percieving, which have collectively formulated it.  Arguments about the usefulness of an alchemy treatise are moot.  Consider that calling water an amino acid comprised of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen is an conventional oversimplification for one who has learned to relate and identify with the subtle interactions of manifested reality, and an outright mistruth, a stunted truth, for one who percieves reality through the eyes of a physicist.  All these 'factual' entries are descriptions, not facts, behooving one to be true to topic.  Alchemy is philosophy, part of the rudiments of thought, of self-awareness.  It is only of use to one who would increase intimacy of self-awareness (including what one percieves and indentifies with as &quot;thing&quot;, a necessary component of &quot;self&quot;, being &quot;not identified as self&quot;).  It is of practical significance (as a text); the applications of an understanding of alchemy ARE what's happening all around us and in us, and it is useless other than as a pathway to wisdom, which I will personally define as understanding in operation.  This is a call for clarity (and editing out the spurious content,) not censorship.  

* '''Keep'''  Many things one person considers useless another finds of great value.  Let a thousand flowers bloom!! [[User:Simontzu|simontzu]]                 


BTW The sacred texts archive has excellent references in the public domain on alchemy.

      <comment>/* Dynamic multidimensional arrays */</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Networking in UNIX|Language extensions}}

With its extensive use, a number of common practices and conventions have evolved to help avoid errors in C programs. These are simultaneously a demonstration of the application of good software engineering principles to a language and an indication of the limitations of C. Although few are used universally, and some are controversial, each of these enjoys wide use.

== Dynamic multidimensional arrays ==

Although one-dimensional arrays are easy to create dynamically using malloc, and fixed-size multidimensional arrays are easy to create using the built-in language feature, dynamic multidimensional arrays are trickier. There are a number of different ways to create them, each with different tradeoffs. The two most popular ways to create them are:
* They can be allocated as a single block of memory, just like static multidimensional arrays. This requires that the array be ''rectangular'' (i.e. subarrays of lower dimensions are static and have the same size).  The disadvantage is that the syntax of declaration the pointer is a little tricky for programmers at first.  For example, if one wanted to create an array of ints of 3 columns and &lt;tt&gt;rows&lt;/tt&gt; rows, one would do
 int (*multi_array)[3] = malloc(rows * sizeof(int[3]));
:(Note that here &lt;tt&gt;multi_array&lt;/tt&gt; is a pointer to an array of 3 ints.)

:Because of array-pointer interchangeability, you can index this just like static multidimensional arrays, i.e. &lt;tt&gt;multi_array[5][2]&lt;/tt&gt; is the element at the 6th row and 3rd column.

* They can be allocated by first allocating an array of pointers, and then allocating subarrays and storing their addresses in the array of pointers (this approach is also known as an [[w:Iliffe vector|Iliffe vector]]). The syntax for accessing elements is the same as for multidimensional arrays described above (even though they are stored very differently).  This approach has the advantage of the ability to make ragged arrays (i.e. with subarrays of different sizes). However, it also uses more space and requires more levels of indirection to index into, and can have worse cache performance. It also requires many dynamic allocations, each of which can be expensive.


For more information, see the [http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/q6.16.html comp.lang.c FAQ, question 6.16].

In some cases, the use of multi-dimensional arrays can best be addressed as an array of structures.  Before user-defined data structures were available, a common technique was to define a multi-dimensional array, where each column contained different information about the row.  This approach is also frequently used by beginner programmers.  For example, columns of a two-dimensional character array might contain last name, first name, address, etc.

In cases like this, it is better to define a structure that contains the information that was stored in the columns, and then create an array of pointers to that structure.  This is especially true when the number of data points for a given record might vary, such as the tracks on an album.  In these cases, it is better to create a structure for the album that contains information about the album, along with a dynamic array for the list of songs on the album.  Then an array of pointers to the album structure can be used to store the collection.

* Another useful way to create a dynamic multi-dimensional array is to flatten the array and index manually. For example, a 2-dimensional array with sizes x and y has x*y elements, therefore can be created by
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int dynamic_multi_array[x*y];
&lt;/source&gt;
The index is slightly trickier than before, but can still be obtained by y*i+j. You then access the array with
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
static_multi_array[i][j];
dynamic_multi_array[y*i+j];
&lt;/source&gt;
Some more examples with higher dimensions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int dim1[w];
int dim2[w*x];
int dim3[w*x*y];
int dim4[w*x*y*z];

dim1[i]
dim2[w*j+i];
dim3[w*(x*i+j)+k] // index is k + w*j + w*x*i
dim4[w*(x*(y*i+j)+k)+l] // index is w*x*y*i + w*x*j + w*k + l
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that w*(x*(y*i+j)+k)+l is equal to w*x*y*i + w*x*j + w*k + l, but uses fewer operations (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method Horner's Method]). It uses the same number of operations as accessing a static array by dim4[i][j][k][l], so should not be any slower to use.

The advantage to using this method is that the array can be passed freely between functions without knowing the size of the array at compile time (since C sees it as a 1-dimensional array, although some way of passing the dimensions is still necessary), and the entire array is contiguous in memory, so accessing consecutive elements should be fast. The disadvantage is that it can be difficult at first to get used to how to index the elements.

== Constructors and destructors ==

In most object-oriented languages, objects cannot be created directly by a client that wishes to use them. Instead, the client must ask the class to build an instance of the object using a special routine called a constructor. Constructors are important because they allow an object to enforce invariants about its internal state throughout its lifetime. Destructors, called at the end of an object's lifetime, are important in systems where an object holds exclusive access to some resource, and it is desirable to ensure that it releases these resources for use by other objects.

Since C is not an object-oriented language, it has no built-in support for constructors or destructors. It is not uncommon for clients to explicitly allocate and initialize records and other objects. However, this leads to a potential for errors, since operations on the object may fail or behave unpredictably if the object is not properly initialized. A better approach is to have a function that creates an instance of the object, possibly taking initialization parameters, as in this example:

  struct string {
      size_t size;
      char *data;
  };

  struct string *create_string(const char *initial) {
      assert (initial != NULL);
      struct string *new_string = malloc(sizeof(*new_string));
      if (new_string != NULL) {
          new_string-&gt;size = strlen(initial);
          new_string-&gt;data = strdup(initial);
      }
      return new_string;
  }

Similarly, if it is left to the client to destroy objects correctly, they may fail to do so, causing resource leaks. It is better to have an explicit destructor which is always used, such as this one:

  void free_string(struct string *s) {
      assert (s != NULL);
      free(s-&gt;data);  ''/* free memory held by the structure */''
      free(s);        ''/* free the structure itself */''
  }

It is often useful to combine destructors with ''[[#Nulling freed pointers]]''.

Sometimes it is useful to hide the definition of the object to ensure that the client does not allocate it manually. To do this, the structure is defined in the source file (or a private header file not available to users) instead of the header file, and a forward declaration is put in the header file:

  struct string;
  struct string *create_string(const char *initial);
  void free_string(struct string *s);

== Nulling freed pointers ==

As discussed earlier, after &lt;code&gt;free()&lt;/code&gt; has been called on a pointer, it becomes a dangling pointer. Worse still, most modern platforms cannot detect when such a pointer is used before being reassigned.

One simple solution to this is to ensure that any pointer is set to a null pointer immediately after being freed:
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://c-faq.com/malloc/ptrafterfree.html comp.lang.c FAQ list: &quot;Why isn't a pointer null after calling free?&quot;] mentions that &quot;it is often useful to set [pointer variables] to NULL immediately after freeing them&quot;.
&lt;/ref&gt;
  free(p);
  p = NULL;
Unlike dangling pointers, a hardware exception will arise on many modern architectures when a null pointer is dereferenced. Also, programs can include error checks for the null value, but not for a dangling pointer value. To ensure it is done at all locations, a macro can be used:
  #define FREE(p)   do { free(p); (p) = NULL; } while(0)
(To see why the macro is written this way, see ''[[#Macro conventions]]''.) Also, when this technique is used, destructors should zero out the pointer that they are passed, and their argument must be passed by reference to allow this. For example, here's the destructor from ''[[#Constructors and destructors]]'' updated:
  void free_string(struct string **s) {
      assert(s != NULL  &amp;&amp;  *s != NULL);
      FREE((*s)-&gt;data);  ''/* free memory held by the structure */''
      FREE(*s);          ''/* free the structure itself */''
      *s=NULL;           ''/* zero the argument */''
  }

Unfortunately, this idiom will not do anything to any other pointers that may be pointing to the freed memory.  For this reason, some C experts regard this idiom as dangerous due to creating a false sense of security.

== Macro conventions ==

Because preprocessor macros in C work using simple token replacement, they are prone to a number of confusing errors, some of which can be avoided by following a simple set of conventions:
# Placing parentheses around macro arguments wherever possible. This ensures that, if they are expressions, the order of operations does not affect the behavior of the expression. For example:
#*Wrong: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   x*x&lt;/code&gt;
#*Better: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   (x)*(x)&lt;/code&gt;
# Placing parentheses around the entire expression if it is a single expression. Again, this avoids changes in meaning due to the order of operations.
#*Wrong: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   (x)*(x)&lt;/code&gt;
#*Better: &lt;code&gt;#define square(x)   ((x)*(x))&lt;/code&gt;
#*Dangerous, remember it replaces the text in verbatim. Suppose your code is &lt;code&gt;square (x++)&lt;/code&gt;, after the macro invocation will x be incremented by 2
# If a macro produces multiple statements, or declares variables, it can be wrapped in a '''do''' { ... } '''while'''(0) loop, with no terminating semicolon. This allows the macro to be used like a single statement in any location, such as the body of  an if statement, while still allowing a semicolon to be placed after the macro invocation without creating a null statement. Care must be taken that any new variables do not potentially mask portions of the macro's arguments.
#*Wrong: &lt;code&gt;#define FREE(p)   free(p); p = NULL;&lt;/code&gt;
#*Better: &lt;code&gt;#define FREE(p)   do { free(p); p = NULL; } while(0)&lt;/code&gt;
# Avoiding using a macro argument twice or more inside a macro, if possible; this causes problems with macro arguments that contain side effects, such as assignments.
# If a macro may be replaced by a function in the future, considering naming it like a function.

   type Body_Type is private;
   type Private_Type is access Body_Type;

This is equivalent to C ''opaque pointers''. I believed that it is used when in future versions the size of a data structure can grow, but I've only used it because is the sole rational approach to have real private types in C. Has someone used it? Is it interesting to add this info to the wikibook? - [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 12:12, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)

The following paragraph has been moved from the book to the discussion page since this feature alledged to Tucker Taft has been present in Ada since Ada 83.

&lt;quote&gt;These types are sometimes called &quot;Taft types&quot; &amp;mdash;named after Tucker Taft, the main designer of Ada 95&amp;mdash; because were introduced in the so-called Taft Amendment to Ada 83. In other programming languages, this technique is called &quot;[[w:opaque pointer|opaque pointer]]s&quot;.&lt;/quote&gt;

== Quirks ==

I assume the described problem is caused by a bug of a particular GNAT version and maybe on a particular Windows version. Doesn't make sense to clarify this and add a link to the corresponding bug report? --[[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 18:48, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

: It seems like &quot;delay 0.0&quot; has been in wide spread use for tasking related issues (to do with synchronization points); comp.lang.ada usenet has reports on &quot;delay 0.0&quot; from as early as 1992. However, there is a hint in these messages that the expression was/is used to trigger a task switch, at least with a number of compilers. So maybe declaring this particular quirk a bug is less than could be done to improve the subsection. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] ([[User talk:GeorgBauhaus|talk]]) 11:18, 11 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">War Driving (wôr dri'vin) v.
Driving around looking for wireless networks.
-term coined by Pete Shipley

The term wardriving generally covers the practice of discovering and mapping (with the help of GPS) the wireless networks available in a particular area. Useful statistics are gathered from this activity, including statistics on the encryption used in discovered networks. Wardriving does not include the unethical activity of unauthorised connection to wifi networks (encrypted or unencrypted).

'''WARNING: THE TECHNIQUES DESCRIBED ON THIS PAGE MAY BE ILLEGAL IN YOUR JURISDICTION.  THIS PAGE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR LAWYER FOR MORE INFORMATION'''

== Equipment ==
To 'wardrive', you need the following equipment:
*A computer (preferably a laptop or PocketPC, as they are far more portable)
*A wifi card.
*Transportation.
*Software (Such as [http://www.netstumbler.com/ Netstumbler] for Windows, [http://kismetwireless.net Kismet] for Linux, and [http://kismac.binaervarianz.de/ KisMAC] for Mac OS X)
*A [[w:GPS|GPS]] receiver (optional but necessary to create a map)
*External omnidirectional antenna, such as a [[../Cantenna/]] (optional) 
*External unidirectional antenna (optional)

== How to Wardrive ==
After you have installed and started your sniffing software and have activated your wireless card, you should configure your GPS adapter. After that, drive to the area that you wish to investigate and pick up signals of the active wifi networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Nomination'''
* Every user can nominate books of interest for voting and add them at the end of the voting page.
* A featured wikibook cannot be nominated again for one year.
* To nominate a book just add that book to the voting section of the [[Wikibooks:Book_of_the_month/{{nextmonth|{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}_voting|voting page]] using this Wiki code: &lt;nowiki&gt;===&amp;nbsp;[[Book&amp;nbsp;Name]]&amp;nbsp;===&lt;/nowiki&gt; where &quot;Book Name&quot; is the name of the book.  When you have done this add {{tl|Botm}} to the top of the front page of the Wikibook.
'''Voting'''
* Every registered Wikibooks user can vote for as many of the nominated candidates as they like.
* '''Only registered Wikibooks users should vote''' while they are logged in (check by history of page). This is because it is impossible to detect multiple votes by a user using different anon IPs.
* Due to previous voting irregularities, we now require a user to show they are intending to participate with Wikibooks by showing a minimum of 20 edits in your edit history.  This number may increase in the future if continued problems persist.
* The use of [[w:Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sock puppets]] as a way to pad votes is strongly discouraged.  While you are not restricted to only one user account on Wikibooks, please use just one account for any voting activities on Wikibooks including the Book of the Month voting.  Suspicious cases of duplicate voting may be reviewed using the [[m:CheckUser|CheckUser]] services of MediaWiki software.
* To enter your votes, simply edit the appropriate sections by just inserting a new line with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;# ~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to add your username and a time stamp in a new numbered list item.
* Please add only support votes. Opposing votes will not affect the result, as the winner is simply the one with the most support votes (see [[w:Approval voting]]).
* You may add short supporting or opposing comments to each candidate, signed with your name. These comments do not count in the voting process.
* Votes can be retracted by the voter until the voting closes.
'''Evaluation'''
* Voting ends 00:00UTC on the day specified.
* The winner is the candidate book with the most support votes.
* In case of a tie, the older book will be selected (by book history).
* Books with 3 or more votes will be automatically nominated for the following month.

* I am withdrawing my vote from this book 

: - firstly because I am not logged in and secondly because I helped to write it. Interestingly it was (when combined with the open source book - now a seperate book) voted for deletion, and is now up for an award - well no votes - but the thought is there. So let that be an inspiration to all wikibookians. :-) &lt;br&gt;
I would like to offer a sincere thanks to the community members who worked hard on putting everything into tables. It means the information can be added to, improved and updated. I would like to thank my agent and . . . (sorry got a little carried away there - Nurse - my injection if you please!)

: - the second reason for withdrawing my vote is a little Zen - I am withdrawing it because I never made it.

Good luck to Lucid Dreaming - which gets my vote even though I am not allowed to vote without logging in (which I have forgot my password for)

* I think this books has broken the back of the problem regarding raising sufficient content but its pretty
sparse on explanations (not definitions) and could quickly be polished a lot with some publicity  - [[User:Marknewlyn|Mark]]
*Excellent book - [[User:Charlie123|Charlie123]]
* this guide is good for students preparing for exams. for full impact it really needs a complimentary textbook... perhaps [[http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst/]] could provide that! (i hope i voted correctly... i just edited the page by hand)

When you render a scene in Blender, by default there will open a small window showing your image. If you want to publish your picture, you may want to render it a bit bigger. To do this, you have to open the Scene context (F10) and locate the Format sub-context (usually on the right).

You will see some settings there. Let's go through their meanings:
* SizeX: This parameter sets the width of the image in pixels.
* SizeY: This parameter sets the height of the image in pixels.
* AspX, AspY: These parameters specify the aspect ratio of the pixels. By default, this is 100:100, because a pixel on a computer screen has equal width and height. These settings can be used for screens whose pixels don't have equal width and height. For example, on a PAL system one pixel's width/height ratio is 54:51, which you can select there easily. Notice that these parameters don't change the size of the image.

There is one more thing changing the render size: In the Render sub-context (usually in the middle) there are 4 buttons: 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%. If you have chosen SizeX = 640, SizeY = 480 and you clicked 50%, your image will be 320 pixels wide and 240 pixels high.

'''WARNING''': I have encountered some crashes when I changed those parameters. If you have problems too, locate the Output sub-context (usually on the left) and select the option DispView instead of DispWin. This renders the image &quot;into&quot; Blender instead of making a new window.

== [[:Category:Recipe]] ==

Ah, that makes sense.  When I first found [[:Category:Recipe]], I just thought it was redundant with [[:Category:Recipes]] (much like [[:Category:Bread]] and [[:Category:Bread recipes]], but it is nicer to have a full list elsewhere from the tree listing.

This project definitely has a lot of different design considerations than wikipedia.  For instance, an index would be useless there, but necessary here (Say I want [[Cookbook:Jambalaya|Jambalaya]], which can be made with many meats. Do I look in [[:Category:Chicken recipes]], [[:Category:Seafood recipes]], or [[:Category:Southern recipes]] first?) 

You can tell I'm such a wikiholic.  Wikipedia is down to edits for a day and I go categorizing recipes like mad in wikibooks. --[[User:Laurascudder|Laurascudder]] 22:14, 27 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Problem:  Jewish Cooking ==

I want to add a category or categories for Jewish cooking.  My problem is that there are several different regional variations.  Northern and Eastern European Jews (Ashkenazim) have one way of cooking, Southern European Jews another.  Jews that trace their ancestry from the Mediaeval Jews of Iberia (Sfardim) have a third way. Then there are the Jews of Israel, and the Jews of North Africa.  Let alone the Jews of India, China, etc.

I could provide several Ashkenazik recipes, but where should I put them?  European Cuisine?  Northern or Eastern?  Where then would Sfardik or Israeli dishes go?  

Should Jewish cooking be split among Regional Cuisines, or should the regional varieties of Jewish cooking be subsumed under an over-all category of Jewish Cooking?  

Do you have any suggestions?  Can you help? [[User:Too Old|Too Old]] 02:27, 15 July 2005 (UTC)

==Thanks==
Now, if I got back to cooking, I could use my new camera to take pics of some of our recipes :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

==Suggestion==

Would it be possible to have some sort of link between some links so that adding one automatically inludes related links?  eg recently I added a Peruvian recipe. I inserted the appropriate 'Peruvian Recipes' category at page end. Then found that also there is a South American cat, A Peruvion Cuisine link on some Peruvian recipes, and a link to the Wikipedia Peruvian Food  section on another. It seems somewhat tedious if each has to be added individually when adding just the Peruvian foods could just trigger an alert for the other 
three or be programmed to do so.[[User:Conce|Conce]] 04:31, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:: You could create a template (to go at the bottom of the page), named perhaps ''Italic text''&quot;Template:Peruvian&quot;, which you would include by doing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{peruvian}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and which would have the contents: 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{wikipedia|Peruvian Food}}
[[Category:Peruvian recipes]]
[[Category:South American recipes]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
::That said, you should probably not include Peruvian recipes in ''both'' Cat:Peruvian and Cat:SouthAmerican since Cat:SouthAmerican is a supercategory of Cat:Peruvian. In the future, there will probably be a way to see all the pages in descending categories, which means that anything in peruvian food would show up nicely in south american food without a tagging it with both categories. Also be warned that including a category through a template requires extra work when the template changes -- you'll have to do edits on all the pages that include the template in order for their category listings to refresh. Gah. hope this is all clear. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:14, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I dearly hope that the template problem is a soon-to-be-fixed bug and not something considered unfixable. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:37, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

yes.thank you. usefull info. which I need to consider. [[User:Conce|Conce]] 05:32, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

==rhubarb pie picture==
I agree that a solution needs to be found.  But I do think that my own arrangement is more satisfactory than your latest one.  I won't revert yours, but I think some work should be done on this.  I suppose that either the box or the picture needs to be drastically moved.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 15:33, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
:Well, I'll try playing around with the Image and things, although I'm certainly not a guru at this.  And yes, I did indeed take the picture -- if you click on it, it gives you all sorts of info about it.... [[User:Hayford Peirce|Hayford Peirce]] 18:08, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Category unions ==

If you recall, we were previously discussing the possibility of creating a union of two existing categories. It seems there is a MediaWiki extension for this already, although it is presently only enabled on Wikinews. See [[m:DynamicPageList]] for details. Drop a request into bugzilla if you want it enabled for Wikibooks. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Emailuser/Aya|E]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:53, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:: Cool, thanks for the pointer, I'll probably request it tonight. This doesn't really solve the problem though as the lists must still be manipulated by hand and what I really want is automatic inclusion of pages further up the category tree (DAG) and ''dynamic user-controlled'' cross-category listings (instead of page-controlled). This is definitely a step in the right direction, though. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:12, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

''I kinda think the potato varieties should just be merged with the main potoato page, no?''
:They originally were, but someone deleted them so I gave them a home of their own. The page could get very very big if more people add other varieties, as I would hope. (Although no-one did before &lt;wry face emoticon&gt;) [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] 09:02, 21 August 2005 (UTC)

== Sweet Potatoes or Yams ==

Well, the two are different things, both starchies like the potato, but they're not the same.  So they really shouldn't be under yam. http://www.seedsofknowledge.com/yams.html [[User:Nmontague|Nmontague]] 02:59, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== cookwork ==

I agree with [[User:Duk]], [[Cookbook:Tahini Goddess Dressing]] should not be marked with the cookwork template. You've marked many, many pages this way. The pages that really do need work are now buried in a category full of fairly-decent pages. Probably all the Cookbook pages could use some work!

I have been thinking of going down that list and just removing the template from 90% of the pages it is on. The template is way overused. It's like the &quot;under construction&quot; signs that most web pages had around 1995.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 15:54, 17 September 2005 (UTC)

: I did not actually add most of the recipes in that category, but had [[User:Uncle G]] mark them when he transwikied recipes since their links would probably be broken and not have proper formatting. I use the template to denote pages that don't conform to the standard cookbook formatting or need categorization, but don't have time to fix up when I mark them. Perhaps a less invasive template would be more appropriate for those types of pages, but they do need some sort of attention.

== could use some help ==

We've been getting subtle and subversive vandalism by {{user|198.236.13.33}} recently. I'm sick and very tired this week. Please have a look. It's a mess. Some of the more-reasonable-looking edits have had non-revert edits afterward, making it difficult to undo things properly. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:49, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== Title Case ==

I wouldn't object to moving the pages back, and I'll refrain from writing new titles in sentence case.  I'll continue my practice of creating redirects with all case conventions not covered (except CamelCase, which would just be silly) when I have the time; this should simplify any eventual change in convention that may take place.  Thank you for your courtesy, and for cleaning up after me on so many occasions.--[[User:Polyparadigm|Polyparadigm]] 05:37, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[:Category:Chile recipes]] ==

The [[:Category:Chile recipes]] category is something that could cause trouble. Chile peppers are fruits of ''capsicum'' plants, and are commonly (not always) hot tasting. Chile is a dish normally containing beef, chili peppers, tomatoes, cumin, etc. (from [[User:AlbertCahalan]])

: We have:
:*[[:Category:Chile recipes]], which I was using for hot peppers.
:*[[:Category:Chili recipes]], which I was using for the dish.
:*[[:Category:Bell Pepper recipes]], which I was using for the larger, related, and non-spicy peppers.
: is there some better organization you can think of? This is pretty ad-hoc, so there's definitely room for improvement. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 03:39, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

::Well, Chile and Chili and Chilli are all valid ways to spell the various things. So you're using a very arbitrary distinction, no better than using uppercase or two spaces or a hyphen. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:34, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

::: Agreed. =) I chose those semi-arbitrarily.
::: A google test: &quot;(chile|chili|chilli) (beans|pepper)&quot; (&quot;beans&quot; to filter out non-dish pages to some minor degree):
:::*chili beans: 3,230,000
:::*chile beans: 1,900,000
:::*chilli beans: 631,000
:::*chili pepper: 2,920,000
:::*chile pepper: 1,790,000
:::*chilli pepper: 1,770,000
:::So &quot;chili&quot; wins out for both kinds. I think so long as they're consistent and the descriptions are clear, it'll be ok (since the words themselves are ambiguous). Any suggestion for a better kind of distinction?  [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:45, 21 October 2005 (UTC)

I think the [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures]] page would be an appropriate home, especially if you can relate the values to regular measurements.

== Re: the other wiki cookbook ==
Hi Kellen. Including its creator, there are currently only three people on cookiwiki. The creator didn't know about this wikibook, and either did I when i joined the cookiwiki! Both he and I are just getting acquainted to the Cookbook and are [http://www.cookiwiki.net/cookiwiki/index.php/CookiWiki:Community_Portal considering] contributing here instead. I've added a few things to the Cookbook already, and I have to admit, its been challenging to figure out how things work. Wikibooks has such a huge amount of info, that its difficult to figure out whether to consult pages on the overarching Wikibook, or on Cookbook specific pages. Over the weekend, I'm going to add an introduction page here to better orient new users to the organization of the site. The one major thing that isn't found here is a page to track changes specific to the entire Cookbook. That was initally a turn-off to the Cookbook, but some contributors have given me some alternative routes, and I plan to put those in the Intro page.

== You may just be onto something... ==

Hiya Kellen.  Thanks for your response to my discussion with UncleG on the category naming thingybob.  I think you may just be onto something very useful with your idea to do the recipes with a dietary indication in their name, rather than tagging them using my letter suggestions.  I have vested interest, since I am on 2 diets, Gluten and Dairy Free.  I would like to see recipes like that.  So your way would be like this: [[Cookbook:Dutch Apple Cake (Diabetic)]]?  That would work for me, definitely!  Thanks for your comment.  [[User:Tmalmjursson|Tmalmjursson]] 03:04, 12 February 2006 (UTC)  [[User_talk:Tmalmjursson|Thor's pet yack]]

== &quot;Subst:&quot; ==

Hi. On Wikipedia I have been encouraged to substitute templates as per [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SUBST]. The primary reason for doing so is that it speeds up the site since every time someone views a page, the server must get text from a separate page for every template used. However I am aware that some templates are inappropriate for this - I am going to revert my subst' back. --[[User:BorgQueen|BorgQueen]] 17:40, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

== Marking content for speedy deletes ==

It would be appreciated if you didn't remove the text prior to marking up for a speedy delete.  By leaving the offending text (unless you really think it is obscene and don't want to bother admins with it) you make it very obvious to get a second opinion on the topic, and one that with all of the markups you've given I have agreed with you.  Just to verify, I have had to go in and check the history (to avoid removing content that was marked up as an act of vandalism).

Anyway, thanks for helping to clean up and maintain Wikibooks.  Efforts like yours, even though small, are very much appreciated and make a huge difference.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:05, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

== Asking for items ==
=== 「___をください。」 ===
When you want to ask for an item, you say 「___をください。」

In some circumstances you may have to specify the amount of the item that you want. To do this, you would say the number of items and add the suffix counter for the type of item: 「___を___ください。」

*「タオルを三枚ください。」 &quot;Please give me three towels.&quot;

=== Please show me ___.「___を見せてください。」 ===
If you just want to see an item, you'd say 「___を見せてください。」 (___を　みせて　ください).
*見せて means &quot;show (it to me)&quot;

*You'll hear this at customs as you enter Japan, when the customs official requests to see your passport.

「パスポートを見せてください 」　(パスポート　を　みせて　ください).  Please, show me your passport.

There is plenty of choice when it comes to picking the building materials for your robot. However not every material is a good choice.

There are three groups of materials. Each of these three groups have their own characteristics, possibilities and difficulties.

'''Note:''' There is a fourth group of materials called ceramics. However this group is only marginally useful for robotics.

'''Note''' In this book robot sizes are mentioned as small, medium and large. With small I mean any robot that can maneuver on a table. Medium means any robot that's too large to move on a table but still is light enough to lift on your own. Large mean anything bigger and heavier than that. Also robots that'll have to operate in real life (rough) condition should be counted as either medium or large.

==Wood==
Wood is probably the best material to start with. It's light, pretty strong and easy to work on. Not to mention cheap and easily available.&lt;BR&gt;
Even if you intend to use metal or plastic, wood can be handy for various purposes like prototyping and building jigs and other aids in working on metal or plastic parts. &lt;BR&gt;
The main reason that you will not see many wooden robots is because wood doesn't seem to fit in the picture of high tech machines. Funny thing is that (synthetic) composite materials have a very high coolness-factor (e.g Kevlar&amp;reg; Yes, Kevlar is a brand name. It's made of Aramide), yet wood, a natural composite material, hasn't. 
*Useful for small or medium sized robots, prototyping and as construction aid.

==Metal==
There are 80 different pure metals each having different properties. However in the world of Robotics there are only a select few from the 80 that are useful. This list is increased by Alloying. Alloying is the process of combining either in solution or compound, two or more elements, at least one of which is a metal, and where the resulting material has metallic properties. The resulting metallic substance has different properties (sometimes significantly different) from those of its components.The properties of some metals and their alloys are below.

Some alloys are limited in supply in the market due to the limited demand for them. In order to obtain these materials it is often required to look further than the general consumer market.

===Aluminum===
Aluminium (or aluminum, both are correct) is commonly available in extruded forms in different shapes. It's pretty cheap, light, strong, resistant to corrosion and easy to work with. However welding aluminum isn't practical as it needs special welding equipment (MIG/MAG or TIG welding) and the bond isn't very strong. While soldering is possible, it doesn't make a strong bond. Rather use  nuts and bolts or rivets.
*Useful for small or medium sized robots.
*Useful for non-load bearing parts in large robots.
*Not very good for bearings.

There is an alloy of aluminium called ''Duraluminium'' it is almost as strong as soft steel but very light thus making it a natural choice for the construction of Aircraft. However as a trade off for the combination of being strong and light it is quite expensive (if you can find it at all). The best bet is to search aircraft wrecking yards.

===Steel===
Commonly available steel is an alloy of iron. It's stronger than aluminum, but it's also heavier and harder to work with - in particular, it blunts tools more easily and swarf is always razor sharp. Welding isn't much of a problem. However heating steel (at welding temperatures) changes its characteristics (strength, hardness, rust resistance).
Note that drilling steel requires cooling and a slow drill speed (both rotational and feeding). If you drill too fast, you'll see your drill heating up red hot. Drills that have been red hot lose their hardness and will be dull in no time. 
*Useful for small
 robots and robots intended to operate in rough conditions. Too heavy for small or medium sized robots.

===Bronze===
Heavy. Very good for bearings. Too expensive and heavy for most other purposes.

===Brass===
Heavier and more expensive than aluminum. Can be soldered.
*Useful for bearings.

===Copper===
Mostly available as wire or axles. Quite heavy, very good conductor.
*Useful for special parts and wires.

==Synthetic Materials==
Like steel, synthetic materials are a name for a very large group of materials. There are hundreds of different plastics each with different characteristics and uses. We'll be covering only a few of them, but many techniques work just as well with other synthetics.

Most synthetic materials can be bent into shape after they are heated. A hot air gun (used to remove paint) can be sufficient for this purpose. Drilling and sawing these materials requires low speeds or they have to be cooled with water so the material doesn't melt.
Soft plastics can be cut with an utility knife.

===PVC===
Polyvinyl chloride: Used for plastic tubes.

===Plexiglass===
Polymethyl methacrylate: Transparent material. Can be bent when heated to 200°C.

==Composite materials==

Polymer composite materials are materials consisting of a polymer matrix and a reinforcing material. (think of reinforced concrete: the polymer matrix is the steel grid and the reinforcing material is the concrete)&lt;BR&gt;
These materials are considerably stronger and stiffer than steel and aluminium alloys.&lt;BR&gt;

 Material           Specific strength        specific stiffness&lt;BR&gt;
 Steel              150*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg            20*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg&lt;BR&gt;
 E-fiberglass/epoxy 300*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg            10*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg&lt;BR&gt;
 Aramide/epoxy      500*10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg            25*10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Nm/kg

The reason why composite materials haven't replaced steel is because of cost. Composites are only used where weight is a more important factor than price, e.g., airplanes: less weight means less fuel consumption and/or more useful payload.

==Other Materials==

===Foamcore===
Foamcore is relatively weak, but it is very practical for making fast prototypes. (
[http://zero-waste.blogspot.com/2011/12/this-is-foamcore.html] [http://web.mit.edu/imoyer/www/portfolio/foamcore/] ).

===Cardboard===
Generally, it's weak and looks ugly{{fact}}, but it's very practical for making fast prototypes. Can be cut with a knife or scissors and put together with duct tape or glue gun. When dry, it's an insulator and can be used as a prototyping board for circuits.

With careful design, corrugated cardboard is strong enough to hold up full-sized humans ( [https://web.archive.org/web/20111213114135/http://www.arcspace.com/gehry_new/cardb/cardb.html a] [http://www.erb.co.il/en/cooperations.asp b] [http://www.dezeen.com/2012/11/12/cardboard-bicycle-by-izhar-gafni/ c] ).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a cardboard mockup is built to make sure the parts of the robot all fit together properly.

Sometimes cardboard is more than strong enough for many parts of a working robot ([http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/392540503/cardboard-robot-robotic-arm-and-smart-phone-camera a] [http://thecardboardrobot.com/ b]).

Bienvenue mes amis dans le monde magnifique des francophones !

=French B SL=

As of 2012 the IB Language B exam has changed in format and contents. This article is outdated. 

Pour faciliter la communication entre les étudiants de ce niveau, et puisque ceci est la section Anglaise de « Wikibooks », la plupart de cette section est en Anglais.  

To begin, French B is the second lowest difficulty of Group 2 Subjects. It is intended for students who have some background in French already, and wish to improve upon their reading and writing. There is no IB syllabus for French, so it really depends on your teacher to prepare you for your exams.

==The Exams==

Your French IB mark is determined primarily by external markers. The Oral Exam is internally marked, and externally moderated, whereas the Paper 1 &amp; 2 are externally marked.

===The Oral Exam===

You are expected to speak for 3 to 5 minutes on a subject of your choice. Following this, there is a question period between you and your teacher for 2-3 minutes. During this question period, their job is to show your breadth and depth in the French language.

Note: You have to do your oral via cassette tape recording or digitally via CD recorder.

Tips for the Oral:
:*It would be most beneficial to your mark if you chose something relating in some way to French culture. Talking about Ford cars really has nothing to do with French culture, and would not impress markers. Some examples that are sure to &quot;wow&quot; the marker would be
:***French Regions (i.e. Provence, Champagne, Franche-Comté)
:***French-speaking Countries (i.e. Cameroon, Haiti, Tahiti, Belgium, etc...)
:***French Cuisine
:***French Art
:***Basically, anything distinctly French or Francophone will do
:*Pick something you're interested in and can talk easily about
:*Read newspapers and magazines about recent events in France or French-speaking countries, and express your opinions. 
:*Watch French television. It is very helpful in picking up enunciation and pronunciation, as well as French expressions, which the markers love to hear.
:* Practise your speech and record yourself. It is very helpful to hear yourself on tape, and to recognize what common errors you make.

===Paper 1===
The Paper 1 exam is 1h 30 minutes. This exam is designed to test your reading comprehension. You will be given two packages:
:*Your readings
:*The exam itself 

The exam is composed of approximately 50 questions. They range from True/False to Fill in the Blanks to Finding Synonyms to Matching.

A strong grasp of French vocabulary is a must, as well as grammar.

===Paper 2===

The Paper 2 exam is also 1h 30 minutes. It is designed to test your writing skills. A list of choices will be given to you, upon which you must select ''ONE'' and write a minimum of 250 words on.

Some teachers recommend that you write at least double the minimum, but to be honest, go with quality over quantity. Aim for 350 words, but make those 350 words rife with idiomatic expressions, various verb tenses, and a clear presentation of your knowledge of the language. It is all a matter of personal preference in the end.

===Tips for Paper 2===

Il faut que vous sachiez comment écrire dans les formes suivantes:

- Discours

- Lettre à un ami

- Lettre formelle

- Page de journal intime / Blog

- Essai

- Guide (humoristique ou non)

- Interview / Dialogue / Conversation

- Editorial

- Brochure

- Compte-rendu

- Page d'accueil d'un site Internet

- Article de journal

- Critique (de livre ou de film)

- Fin d'un récit

Know the specific formats of each form, as these are easy marks to get. If you fail to write in the specific format, your points can go down by a lot. Format includes register, vocabulary, phrases, and physical appearance (for example if it is a newspaper article include columns). 

Les questions d'écriture vont exiger une de ces formes. Si vous n'écrivez pas dans la forme précisé, vous serez pénalisé.

[[Image:SPMcentral.jpg|thumb|Statistical Parametric Mapping]]
SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) refers to the construction and assessment of spatially extended statistical processes used to test hypotheses about functional imaging data. These ideas have been instantiated in software that is called SPM.

The SPM software package has been designed for the analysis of brain imaging data sequences. The sequences can be a series of images from different cohorts, or time-series from the same subject. The current release is designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG.

SPM is made freely available to the [neuro]imaging community, to promote collaboration and a common analysis scheme across laboratories. The software represents the implementation of the theoretical concepts of Statistical Parametric Mapping in a complete analysis package, as a suite of [[MATLAB|MATLAB]] ([http://www.mathworks.com/ The MathWorks, Inc]) functions and subroutines with some externally compiled [http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html C] routines.

My real name is Em. I'm a computer systems engineering student from Australia. I like playing the saxophone, video games, and loud music (in no particular order...)

[mailto:emcarter@ozemail.com.au My email]

=My Contributions=
I've started contributing to [[Electrical Engineering, Basic signals]], and once the [[computer engineering]] text gets going, I intend to contribute to that too.

I reckon I might contribute to some of the cs texts too. I'll just have to see how I go.

I also notice that the [[saxophone]] text is really barren... but that's kind of a difficult text to work on. Once again, I'll see how I go.

=My Usage=

I'm currently teaching myself [[Japanese]] from wikibooks, much to the amusement of my younger sister, who is studing Japanese in her final year of high school. I have used some the programming texts as a reference, and the same with markup lingos like [[XHTML_(XML)|XHTML]] and [[CSS_(XML)|CSS]].

=Final Words=
Wiki is great. Long live Wiki in all it's wonderous forms.

I'm adding this section now, and I'll do basic fingering sections tomorrow. I restructured the whole thing a little bit.

Hi there. I'd like to contribute to this book as well. Have we considered adding a section on reading music?

I've filled out the rest of the sharp and flat keys.  Might it not be worth removing the references to the key signatures as this is really a forward reference to a non-existent page as it currently stands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The saxophone is a family of woodwind musical instruments. Each type of saxophone has a different size, pitch and key. There are four types of saxophone commonly used, although more do exist, they are very rare and are not yet covered in this text.

==Soprano Saxophone==
One of the highest in pitch of the saxophones is the Bb Soprano Saxophone. A person who masters the soprano usually finds it easy to play the alto saxophone because of the mouthpiece size.  The soprano comes in three shapes.  The most common is the straight soprano, which looks like a brass clarinet, albeit with a conical shape, rather than a cylindrical one.  The next is the curved soprano which looks like a mini-alto sax.  The least common is the saxello, which looks like a straight soprano, but the bell faces front

There are two smaller varities of saxophone, the sopranino (in Eb, an octave above the alto, in both straight and curved versions), and newly developed, the soprillo saxophone in Bb, an octave above the soprano, straight version only.  The sopranino is sometimes used in saxophone chiors but the soprillo is almost never seen.  

==Alto Saxophone==
Lower in pitch than the soprano, and higher than the tenor, the alto sax is an E flat instrument.  The notes range from low Bb to a high F, not including altissimo.  It is the most popular member in the saxophone family simply because it is the easiest to play and master, especially among beginning students. 
 
There are straight versions of the alto as well. Both LA Sax and Keilwirth make straight varieties of this sax, but it is again, uncommon. One of the most influential alto sax players in the Bebop era of the jazz scene is Charlie Parker, who was known for introducing flurries of 8th and 16th notes into improvised solos.

==Tenor Saxophone==
This is probably the most famous and well known sounds in the music of today.  It ranges from low Bb on the treble cleff to high F, and even higher with altissimo notes.  Usually, the tenor is in the key of Bb, played by 80's musician, Eddie Money, and 1950's father of free jazz, John Coltrane. Sometimes they are placed in the key of C, which was most notably played by Lester Young.

The tenor sax is used in marching bands, concert bands, and jazz bands.  In marching bands, they play close to the same thing as trombones and baritones.  In concert bands, they act as a woodwind baritone if you will.  In jazz bands, they have the most significant role in a big band setting.  They are good instruments for improvisation and used in solo jazz settings.

==Baritone Saxophone==
One of the lowest saxophones, the baritone is an E flat instrument. It is the largest common saxophone, and it is characterised by its unusual curled neck. There is also a straight baritone saxophone, but it is extremely rare. 

There are lower pitched members of the saxophone family that do exist. The bass, contrabass, tubax, and subcontrabass tubax are members that plummet to the deepest pitches of the piano.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Counterpoint is a method of composing music. It is a set of &quot;rules&quot; that are traditionally followed in order to write music for two or more voices. It is organized into &quot;types&quot; of counterpoint known as ''species''. They go in order from most restrictive to the least. The more voices there are in a musical score, the more freedom the voices have (less rules to follow). It is important to know what [[Counterpoint/Consonant Intervals|Consonant Intervals]] and [[Counterpoint/Dissonant Intervals|Dissonant Intervals]] are.

==History==
Much of the credit for the formation and organization of the rules of counterpoint is given to a single man by the name of Joseph Fux. His classic and groundbreaking work on counterpoint, ''Gradus ad parnassum'', is regarded as the most important contribution to the advancement of the theories of counterpoint. It has been historically proven that great composers such as Haydn, Mozart, as well as Beethoven worked from the same book (giving much to say concerning the usefulness and importance of this method.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Second Species counterpoint, two tones are used against each note of the melody. It is important to note where one places the consonant and dissonant tones.

Accented beats on the counterpoint should create consonant intervals. The exceptions for this are that the perfect unison should only fall on unaccented beats until the last note of the song and the octave should be used sparingly on accented beats.

Dissonant tones can be used on the weak beats provided that it is used as a [[Counterpoint/Passing Tone|passing tone]].

A rest may be used in place of the first beat for the counterpoint. This is the only place a rest is allowed. In this case, the unaccented beat must have a perfect consonant interval. If the cantus firmus is above, this would refer only to the octave or the prime. If below, it refers to the octave, the prime, and the fifth.

It is often best to start by writing the cadence first.

== Cadences ==

When writing the cadence in second species counterpoint, you have to think about whether you are writing your counterpoint above or below the [[Counterpoint/Cantus Firmus|Cantus Firmus]].

=== Writing cadences above the Cantus Firmus ===

If your Cantus firmus ends in 2-1, then your counterpoint will end with (6-7)-8. Often the 5 will proceed the 6.

If your Cantus Firmus ends in 7-8, then your counterpoint will end with (2-5)-P

=== Writing cadences below the Cantus Firmus ===

If the cadence of the Cantus Firmus is 7-8 then the counterpoint will end with (5-2)-1.

If the cadence of the Cantus Firmus is 2-1 then the counterpoint will end with (

 NOTE: Numbers in () show that they are half the duration of the others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As well as being enjoyable in their own right, '''alcoholic drinks''' are frequently used as ingredients in recipes. This page lists the most common types of drink. See also [[Bartending/Cocktails|Cocktails]] for mixed drinks, and [[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]] in the [[Cookbook:Table of Contents|Cookbook]] for drink recipes not normally considered part of mixology.

==Alcoholic Beverage Ingredients==

Alcoholic beverages can be served '''straight''' (also called '''neat'''), meaning there is only one ingredient (a particular type of alcohol), or '''mixed'''. Most mixed drinks include other ingredients, or '''mixers''', besides the alcohol or blend of alcohols. Common mixers include carbonated beverages, sweeteners, bitters, flavorings, colorings, sauces, and salt. Ice is an important ingredient in many mixed drinks, whether the drink is poured over the ice or the ice is blended as part of the beverage. Mixed drinks also include non-alcoholic, or &quot;virgin&quot;, cocktails, which are generally made in the same manner, but leaving out the alcohol.

===Buying Basics===
In nearly every bartender's stock, you will find these basic ingredients, which are key to making a wide variety of drinks.

* '''Bourbon''' - Kentucky whiskey
* '''Gin''' - distilled spirit flavored with juniper berries and other botanicals
* '''Rum, Dark''' - flavorful distilled spirit from sugar cane
* '''Rum, White''' - lightly flavored distilled spirit from sugar cane
* '''Scotch''' - Scottish whisky, more smoky than other whisky.
* '''Tequila''' - flavorful distilled Mexican spirit from the agave plant
* '''Triple Sec''' or '''Cointreau''' - orange flavored liqueurs
* '''Vermouth, Dry''' - a common aromatized mixer wine
* '''Vermouth, Sweet''' - a common aromatized mixer wine
* '''Vodka''' - clear, nearly flavorless distilled spirit
* '''Wine, White''' - more delicately flavored than red wine

===Beyond the Basics===
After stocking a bar with the basics, it is time to grow in new directions. These common ingredients help to expand the variety and diversity of the drinks you can provide to your patrons.

* '''Beer, Lager'''
* '''Flavored Spirits/Liquors''' - the more flavors, the wider range of cocktails you can serve
* '''High-Proof Spirits''' - any spirit or liquor with a high alcohol content (e.g., Bacardi 151 or Everclear)
* '''Kahlua''' - coffee flavored liqueurs
* '''Local Variants''' and '''Locally Distilled Alcohols''' - regional differences highlight different alcohols (e.g., sake, pisco, ouzo)
* '''Pre-mixed Mixers''' - the ingredients for several popular mixed drinks (martinis, margaritas, mudslides, etc.) are available pre-mixed; all you do is add the alcohol 
* '''Schnapps''' - peach and peppermint are common flavors
* '''Whiskey, Rye''' - Tennessee whiskey
* '''Wine, Red''' - more robustly flavored than white wine

==Distilled Alcohols==
Mixed drinks where the primary ingredients by volume are one or more distilled alcohols are referred to as '''cocktails'''.

===Spirits===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Spirits}}
The term '''spirits''' includes brandy, rum, vodka and whiskey. These are made by distilling weaker drinks to concentrate the alcohol content to 35 per cent or more.
* Arak (Middle East)
*Arrack (South Asia and South-East Asia)
* Vodka (Northern Europe)
* Tequila - made from distillation of Mexican agave plant (not cactus)
* Calvados - French spirit made by distilling hard cider
* Shochu - Japanese spirit made from koji and starch / sugar based ingredients with ~30 to ~90 percent alcohol by volume.
*  Cachaça (pronounced [kuh.chah.'suh])  - Brazilian spirit made from sugar cane

===Liqueurs===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Liqueur}}

==Fermented Alcohols==
Fermented alcohols are most often served &quot;straight&quot;, without mixing. However, many enjoyable mixed drinks can be made by combining a fermented alcohol with other ingredients. Such drinks are usually referred to as '''mixes''' (''beer mix'', ''wine mix'', etc.) or '''punches''', rather than &quot;cocktails&quot;.

===Beer===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Beer}}
Beer is any variety of alcoholic drink produced by the brewing process: fermentation of starchy material derived from grains or other plant sources, such as malted barley or wheat. Beer typically has an alcoholic strength of from 3 to 8 per cent. The main categories of Beer are Ale and Lager.

===Cider and Perry===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Cider}}
Cider (known as 'hard cider' in the US) is made by fermenting apple juice; the less common perry is made by fermenting pear juice. Both can be made in a variety of styles, but the alcoholic strength is usually similar to that of beer.

===Mead===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Mead}}

===Wine===
{{main|Bartending/Alcohol/Wine}}
Wine usually has an alcohol content of between 10 and 15 percent, and is made by fermentation of grape juice. Fortified wine, such as Port,  Sherry and Madeira, is made by adding brandy to wine before the completion of the wine's fermentation process, increasing the strength to around 20 percent.

''These to-dos remained from before the project was reinvigorated, and rested for a brief period on the [[Talk:XML_-_Managing_Data_Exchange/To_do|Talk page]]. -- [[User:Runnerupnj|Runnerupnj]] 08:41, 29 January 2007 (UTC)''

The list is in no particular priority

#Convert all code examples to the format specified in [[Author guidelines (XML) | Author guidelines]]
#A print version to make reading easier
#Breaking chapters into shorter sections
#Hints for common problems (hint box)
##FAQs
##a &quot;Common Errors&quot; section near the exercise section. That way when future students run into problems in the exercises, especially the stylesheets, they can hopefully find a common error and fix their problem quickly
#Glossary with links from within the book
#Chapter 2 on XHTML (move later chapter and make complete)
#Exercises and answers on separate pages (tell people how to open a second copy and use it – end of chapter 1)
#Good XML editor
#Check all answers (also indicate who validated the answer with person’s email)
#Major league baseball exercise
##Develop an XML schema to show the organization of Major League Baseball. There are many teams within MLB and the teams are all composed of different athletes.
##Set up the XML Document with a Division of either the American League or the National League. Enter a representative data into the document to justify your answer.
##Organize the XML stylesheet to nicely display the data.
#Move all Java parsing to a separate chapter
#Write BlueJ as per database access for XML parsing
#Move exercise 4 from chapter 3 (one-to-many relationship) and place it in chapter 5 (many-to-many relationship). My reason for this is as follows:
#This problem asks you to create a personal library. As we learned earlier a library can have many books and books have many copies. There can be many different people who check out books, however, what they actually check out are copies of books making this a many-to-many relationship since a borrower can check out many copies of a book. I feel like this exercise is a little misleading and would be better off in ch. 5. Most people who have had any experience in data modeling and are trying to learn XML from this book would be confused by this exercise (i.e. myself). It's hard to do something that you haven't learned how to do yet.
#Comments in the code and not elsewhere
#Instead of giving a complete explanation for an example of an xml/xls/xsd after the problem, explain each piece of the code as you go through it. Or after a given solution, repeat the entire line of code that you are trying to explain. I've found this layout in other technology related books, and it has been easier to follow along. Also, when referring to a table or different section of the book, create a bookmark or link to that section. Could this be in the instructions for authors and what else could we add.

__NOTOC__
In traditional Japanese cuisine, miso soup is served for breakfast every day, and often served with meals as well.
[[File:Bowl of miso soup.JPG|thumb|miso soup]]

=Variant One=
==Ingredients==
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] of [[Cookbook:Sesame_Oil|sesame oil]]
* 3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] of water 
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbsp.]] of [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]]
* 2 green [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]], finely minced (optional)
* 1/2 cake [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], cut into 1/2 inch cubes (optional)
* 2-3 fresh [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], thinly sliced (optional)
* 5-6 shrimp, cubed or shredded (optional)
* Some pieces of seaweed (optional)

==Procedure==
# Heat oil in the bottom of a small pot
# Add green onion (if using)
# Cook for a few minutes while stirring frequently
# Add 2 1/2 cups of water
# Bring to a boil
# Dissolve miso in 1/2 cup of water and add to pot
# Lower heat and add mushrooms, seaweed &amp; tofu if desired
Enjoy!

=Variant Two=

==Ingredients==

* 90% to 94% [[Cookbook:Dashi|dashi]] (consider using instant dashi mix)
* 6% to 10% [[Cookbook:Miso|miso]]. It can be ''aka'' (red) or ''shiro'' (white), or a combination.
* odds and ends for garnish

The garnish would typically be two to three items that contrast in color, flavor, buoyancy, shape, texture, etc. [[Cookbook:Wakame|Wakame]] with [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] is a standard and popular combination, especially at restaurants. Some common items for garnish are:

* finely sliced and [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Fry|deep-fat fried]] [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] (Agedashi tofu)
* finely cubed raw (silky) [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] ('''recommended''')
* [[Cookbook:Wakame|wakame]] [[Cookbook:Seaweed|seaweed]] ('''recommended''')
* [[Cookbook:Konbu|konbu]] (kelp) seaweed, perhaps left over from making dashi
* [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]]
* chopped [[Cookbook:Scallion|scallion]] ('''recommended''')
* grated [[Cookbook:Daikon|daikon]] radish
* boiled and finely cubed [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]]
* [[Cookbook:Clam|clams]] (asari or shijimi)
* grated [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]]
* [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]]
* [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]]

==Procedure==
#Put dashi in a pot.
#Add any garnish that needs cooking.
#Heat the dashi, letting it simmer, cooking any garnish that needs cooking. Do not bring to a rolling boil, as this degrades the flavor.
#Add any garnish that does not need cooking, and remove from heat.
#Add the miso to the soup. Avoid boiling the miso; some nuances of the flavor will be lost.


=Modern Variant=

While certainly a traditional food, miso is also suited to modern interpretations. One non-traditional yet delicious way to make miso soup is as follows:

#Heat frying oil in a small pot
#Fry onions and cabbage in the oil over high heat until browned. A slight degree of burning is acceptable.
#Proceed with the traditional method listed above.

Using oil leftover from frying bacon and caramelizing the sugars in the onion and cabbage through high heat, this method produces a soup notably different from the traditional variety, and can add new interest to a classic dish. A small quantity of freshly ground black pepper added just before serving rounds out this method very well. 

=Simple Restaurant Miso=

This miso soup is a close approximation of what you get in most cheap western Japanese restaurants. All ingredients are to taste; the primary thing is the ratio of miso to dashi. 

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Dashi|Dashi]] (roughly 250ml or 1 cup per person for a typical restaurant portion)
*Wakame, 5 or so pieces per person (Wakame is a form of edible seaweed, sold in dry curls at most Asian markets)
*Traditional tofu (medium firmness), a few one centimeter cubes per person
*Miso paste, either white, red, or a mixture (many restaurants in western Canada use white miso, also called shiro miso) 

==Procedure==
#Heat the dashi to a light simmer
#While this is heating, lay out your bowls and place the wakame and tofu in the bottom
#When the dashi simmers, take a ladle or so of liquid aside and mix into it approximately 1 tablespoon (about 15ml) of miso paste per cup of dashi stock
#Remove the pot of dashi from the stove and stir the miso prepared above into it
#Ladle some of the prepared miso into the bowls and serve

==Notes== 
*Some prefer less miso, some prefer more. The quantity given results in the moderately-salty type popular in restaurants before meals.
*Do not permit the miso to boil; doing so alters the flavour

=Introduction=

The [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM] software is a suite of [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ MATLAB] functions to organise and interpret functional neuroimaging data.

[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM] is made freely available to the (neuro)imaging community, to promote collaboration and a common analysis scheme across laboratories. The software represents the implementation of the theoretical concepts of Statistical Parametric Mapping in a complete analysis package.

=Licence=

SPM (being the collection of files given in the manifest in the Contents.m file included with each distribution) is free but copyright software, distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence as published by the Free Software Foundation (either version 2, as given in file spm_LICENCE.man, or at your option, any later version). Further details on &quot;copyleft&quot; can be found at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/. In particular, SPM is supplied as is. No formal support or maintenance is provided or implied.

=SPM Version=

==SPM12==
SPM12 was released in October 2014 and represents a major update to the SPM software, containing substantial theoretical, algorithmic, structural and interface enhancements over previous versions:
*http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/

==Previous versions==
Previous versions are still available for download, however you should prefer the most recent one:
*SPM8: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/
*SPM5: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm5/
*SPM2: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm2/
*SPM99: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm99/
*SPM96: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm96/

=Prerequisites=

You need the following to run [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/ SPM] on your computer:
* [[SPM/MATLAB|MATLAB]]: MATLAB is a high level numerical mathematics environment developed  by [http://www.mathworks.com/ MathWorks], Inc. Natick, MA, USA. SPM requires only core MATLAB to run ('''no special toolboxes are required'''). See [[SPM/MATLAB|this page]] for more details.
* SPM also uses external C programs, linked to MATLAB as C-mex files, to perform some of the more computationally intensive operations. Pre-compiled binaries are provided with the distribution for Linux (''*.mexglx'', ''*.mexa64''), Windows (''*.mexw32'', ''*.mexw64'') and Mac (''*.mexmac'', ''*.mexmaci'', ''*.mexmaci64''). Hence, most of the time, SPM will work immediately using these binaries; in some instances, you might have to recompile them for your own architecture, details are provided [[SPM#Installation|here]] for each platform.
* SPM12 uses the [http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/ NIFTI-1] file format for the image data. All images are written as [http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/ NIFTI-1], but it will also read the old Analyze format used by SPM2. Tools are provided to import data from [http://medical.nema.org/dicom/2004.html DICOM], [http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/minc/minc.html MINC] and ECAT7. SPM12 also uses the [http://www.nitrc.org/projects/gifti/ GIfTI] file format for surface-based data.

=Download=
SPM is freely available, but you will be asked to complete a [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download/ registration form] prior to downloading. Having completed the form, you will be directed to the download location.

=Installation=
* On Unix/Linux, use ''unzip SPM.zip'' or ''tar xvfz SPM.tar.gz''
* On Windows, use [http://www.7-zip.org/ 7-Zip] (free and powerful file archiver) or any other archive software that you might already have installed.
* On Mac, double-click to unpack the archive

Then launch MATLAB and add SPM to MATLAB's path:
 &gt;&gt; addpath C:/software/matlab/spm
SPM is now ready to use:
 &gt;&gt; spm

==Managing your MATLAB path==

To ensure SPM is automatically on your MATLAB path in the future, you can either use the command
 &gt;&gt; pathtool
and save the path, or (better, if you have multiple MATLAB versions) you can edit your [http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/techdoc/ref/startup.html MATLAB startup file] to include the above ''addpath'' command. 

(Expert tip: since the startup file can be a general MATLAB script/function you could consider more elaborate things like bringing up a GUI window with a choice of SPM versions to add to the path.)

=Updates=
SPM updates are made from time to time and advertised on the SPM [[SPM/Learning SPM|mailing list]]. They can be downloaded from the following addresses:
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm12_updates/
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm8_updates/
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm5_updates/
* http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm2_updates/
On Unix systems (Linux, Mac), use this command line syntax to install the updates
 unzip -o spm12_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm12
On other platforms, just unpack the update archive over your SPM installation so that newer files overwrite existing files.

=Toolboxes=
A list of SPM toolboxes and extensions is available on the SPM website: http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ext/.

To install one of them, follow the instructions probably provided with the package.
It usually consists in simply copying the functions into a subdirectory of the ''toolbox'' directory of your SPM installation.

__NOTOC__

SPM requirements in terms or hardware are closely related to those of MATLAB, see:
* [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/ MATLAB System Requirements]
* [http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/choosing_hardware.html Choosing Hardware for Use with MATLAB]
* [http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-18C2A/?solution=1-18C2A Computer hardware which best optimizes the performance of MATLAB]

= Processor =

No particular requirements, apart from those for MATLAB. The faster the better but little memory or a slow hard disk can become a bottleneck so make sure to have a coherent hardware installation.

== Mono-/multi-processors ==

Recent MATLABs support implicit multiprocessing allowing to run multiple threads on a single machine without any change to the MATLAB code itself: this requires a multiple CPU (multiprocessor or multicore) system. The gain in compute time with SPM is not dramatic though.

See:
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/brdo29n-1.html
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/maxnumcompthreads.html

If you run many MATLAB sessions in parallel to manually distribute your SPM processings, it is recommended to set the number of computational threads to one.

Some effort is currently done to provide a parallel version of SPM that could automatically distribute tasks on a multicore/multiprocessor machine or a cluster.

== 32/64 bit ==

Major Operating Systems, MATLAB and SPM support 64bit architectures and are nowadays recommended.

= Memory =

The more RAM you have the better but SPM should accommodate with any amount of memory you have (provided there is enough for MATLAB itself). Remember that a 32 bit Operating System might not be able to make use of the full amount of memory.

For more information, see:
* http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1106.html
* http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1100/1107.html


= Hard Disk =

Neuroimaging datasets can be quite large so a slow [[w:Hard_disk_drive|hard disk]] can be a bottleneck for SPM processing. (I.e. if you've got the choice, choose the hard disk with the highest RPM.
For even more performance, use [[The Computer Revolution/Hardware/RAID | multiple hard drives in a RAID1]] or other RAID setup).
Concerning the capacity, it's also obviously the more the better.

== Reviews of hard disks ==

http://www.storagereview.com

== Network File System ==

It is certainly possible to store your datasets on an NFS server. If the server is located in another building or section of your building, make sure the entire connection to your SPM processing workstation is at least 100MB/s.


= Graphic Card =

At current time little use is made of the GPU in SPM so the graphic card should not have any impact in SPM processing.

== SPM Optimisation ==

=== Adjusting SPM settings ===

A defaults variable called ''maxmem'' indicates how much memory can be used at the same time during GLM estimation. If your computer has a large amount of RAM, you can increase that memory setting in spm_defaults.m:

 defaults.stats.maxmem   = 2^30;

* 2^32 = 4GB
* 2^31 = 2GB
* 2^30 = 1GB
* 2^29 = 512MB

In SPM12, there is another defaults variable called ''resmem'' governing whether temporary files during GLM estimation are stored on disk (''false'') or kept in memory (''true''). If you have enough available RAM, not writing the files to disk with fasten the estimation. 

 defaults.stats.resmem   = true;

=== Compiling the MEX files ===

The compiled MEX files provided with SPM are built in such a way to be compatible with most platforms and MATLAB versions but you might benefit from compiling them for your exact platform/MATLAB version - some C compilers might also produce better optimised binaries (such as [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers/ Intel Compilers]). See the installation pages for more details on how to recompile SPM MEX files.

== MATLAB Optimisation ==

=== General statements ===

[http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk_r13/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/ch7_perf.html Maximizing MATLAB Performance].

Note that it is not recommended to disable the JAVA Virtual Machine when launching MATLAB (matlab -nojvm). If you don't want to use the MATLAB desktop, you can preferably launch MATLAB with:
 matlab -nodesktop

When using Matlab in 'nodesktop' mode, initialise SPM in the following manner to prevent graphics windows from opening:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;
spm defaults fmri
spm_jobman initcfg
spm_get_defaults('cmdline',true)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

(Substituting 'fmri' for 'pet' or 'eeg' as appropriate.)

=== Multithreading ===

Recent MATLABs support implicit multiprocessing allowing to run multiple threads on a single machine without any change to the MATLAB code itself: this requires a multiple CPU (multiprocessor or multicore) system. The gain in compute time with SPM is not dramatic though.

See:
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/matlab_prog/brdo29n-1.html
* http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/maxnumcompthreads.html

If you run many MATLAB sessions in parallel to manually distribute your SPM processings, it is recommended to set the number of computational threads to one.

=== Updating BLAS/LAPACK ===

Install the latest Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS)/Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK) for your system, as MATLAB doesn't ship the latest version in its releases. 
* [http://www.netlib.org/blas/ BLAS]
* [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ LAPACK]
The main choices are between:
* [http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/ ATLAS] - Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software (open source)
* [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/ MKL] - Intel Math Kernel Library
* [http://developer.amd.com/cpu/libraries/acml/Pages/default.aspx ACML] - AMD Core Math Library
* [http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/#blas GotoBLAS] - GotoBLAS (Texas Advanced Computing Center)
For more information on how to upgrade your MATLAB libraries with ATLAS/MKL, see:
* http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-mkl-with-matlab/
* http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-math-kernel-library-intel-mkl-for-windows-using-intel-mkl-in-matlab-executable-mex-files/
* http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/SpmWithPentium4

== Parallel Computing ==

=== SPM toolboxes ===

See [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/parallelspm/ pSPM] for SPM2.

=== General tools ===

There is currently work in progress to provide an official parallel/distributed version of SPM.

== Using the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) ==

It is possible for MATLAB to take advantage of the GPU (the processor of the graphic card, by opposition to the CPU), to perform some operations, resulting in significant speed improvements. A number of toolboxes are available:

Most people will ignore the warnings here, as they do elsewhere, but perhaps a few lives might be saved. I kept things factual, avoiding words like &quot;idiot&quot; and &quot;moron&quot;. I have shown restraint, resisting the urge to make that warning into a template that goes on every page. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:As for the two specific items you mention: It is fact that it is safe for a baby to sleep next to an adult (not child; children have different sleep patterns), provided that the adult is not obese or under the influence of alcohol, sleeping pills, or other drugs. (the sleep surface must be appropriate, of course) Human combustion occurs via a candle-like wicking effect, nearly always to those that are obese and drunk. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:I don't see how you can argue with the point of view of dry facts. Were I to express an opinion on the wisdom of drinking alcohol, then you might have a legitimate argument over point of view. I can't help it that the harsh facts are unpleasant and may cause you to question your own point of view. The facts are what they are. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:03, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::Regardless of the evils of alcohol, I don't think a cookbook is the proper place to discuss all these possible effects drinking can have on your life. As I said, a warnings section is a good idea, but it should be brief: anybody wanting elaboration can go to the Wikipedia entries on Alcoholism, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, etc. That's exactly why I dispute the NPOV...while the facts may be true (I'm still having trouble with the spontaneous combustion), it is obviously biased against alcohol.From [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]]: &quot;While all facts might be presented fairly, the very selection (and omission) of facts can make an module biased.&quot; [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 19:23, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:::Being neither Muslim not Protestant, I didn't remember to mention the ''evils'' of alcohol. :-) The section does indeed direct readers wanting elaboration to Wikipedia. I agree that omission of facts can be considered bias, and would not be opposed to mentioning that small amounts of alcohol can be useful for cardiovascular reasons. Harvard says &quot;For men, a good balance point is 1 to 2 drinks a day. For women, it's at most one drink a day.&quot; The USDA agrees, while also mentioning hypertension and cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and stating that women of childbearing age who could become pregnant should completely abstain. In fact, I'll add this now, hopefully addressing your objections. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:12, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::::Thanks! I still think it's much too verbose, but that's more of a style issue. Do you have a source for the &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;? I'm not sure how controversial that is, but it sounds really bizarre? [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 21:03, 6 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::Wikipedia [[w:Spontaneous_human_combustion|covers it pretty well]]. The BBC has a [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/158853.stm good article on it]. Somebody at the BBC burned a pig corpse in a model house to prove how &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; happens. Victims tend to be female, obese, not young, smokers, drunk, and dehydrated. Alcohol obviously causes the drunkenness; it can also be a contributing factor to obesity and dehydration. To be clear, there is nothing spontaneous about &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot;. (the tabloids gave it that name, making for better headlines) It's very much like a candle burning, and is able to consume most of a human. The person smoulders for many hours, with barely any flame. Being drunk keeps the victim from reacting to the fire. Note that smokers are more at risk; presumably this is the typical ignition source. Strong alcoholic drinks can also burn; a spill would help to get things started. I certainly don't claim that &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; is a common problem, but it is: real, interesting, and related to the use of alcohol. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:24, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

Sorry - but you really need to have watched the actual programme aired by the BBC back in 1998. Through the course of the programme spontaneous combustion as described in this article is rubbished, and explains how bodies 'appear' to have spontaneously combusted in very specific conditions. This kind of non-factual material does not belong in this article. I would also add that this is not a soapbox, and I'm afraid this is how the article reads.
--Robins, 23:25, 05 July 2005 (BST)

I agree that the warnings is a bit over the top, perhaps putting a link to a special site.I mean, I know that I keep wanting to add &quot;Yes, but are there any negative effects?&quot; --[[User:Frontier|Frontier]] 13:07, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

I definitely agree that spontaneoous combustion topic needs to be carefully researched before putting it out under a topic for Cookbook Talk - Alcohol Drink. Apart from the evils of drinking alcohol there is some good news for people suffering from Rhematic diseases are likely to protect themselves (by having alcohol) from the disease by reducing the inflammation within the body like the way red wine helps in protecting the heart. But of course the amount of alcohol consumed should be on moderate levels and not on a high level.

I don't agree with the warnings. If we keep them we also should start to add warnings everywhere. In the Wikipedia's articles about barbiturates, in recipes containing fat foods and advice on Ferrari's article ''not to drive at maximum speed''. -- '''[[w:User:Zimbricchio|Zimbricchio]]'''
:Okay, I toned down the warnings, and removed the NPOV tag. Hopefully, everybody will be happy with this. --- [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 04:46, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

[[Wikibooks:Legal disclaimer]], [[Wikibooks:Medical disclaimer]]. I think thats fairly explicit that any warnings given here should be discarded by the reader so why go into so much depth. At most there should be inter-wiki links to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_the_body Effects of alcohol on the body] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage#Legal_considerations Legal considerations] and a brief sentence saying you may wish to consult your docter or lawyer [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 22:12, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

:I totally agree Discordance, most people are able to think and judge for themselves, on the same side of the coin, who has a doctor or lawyer sitting next to them, advising them as they surf the pages of Wikipedia?.[[User:TrumpyNZ|TrumpyNZ]] 07:40, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

==Spirits==
I reworded the section to say other drinks are not widely used in cooking but i cant think of many recipes that use whiskey or vodka. Anyway if anyone knows better please calrify the sentence, i was changing it in the first place because it seemed to suggest there were only 4 types of spirit which is far from true, and most glaringly it ommitted tequila and gin which are extremely important as cocktail bases i thought theyd probably been left out as this is a cookbook and not a cocktail recipe guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tentative outline for '''Arithmetic, Physics, and Mathematics; or the Units of Measurement'''
==Units of Measurement as Mathematical Constants==
#Physics and Mathematics begin with counting
#*1 apple, 2 apples, etc.
#*Thus an &quot;apple&quot; in our records is a '''unit of measurement''', the quantity in question being &quot;number of apples&quot;
#This evolves into simple arithmetic
#*1 apple added to 1 apple is 2 apples
#*10 apples subtracted from 30 apples is 20 apples
#Introduction of shorthand notation
#*&lt;math&gt;1\; apple + 1\; apple = 2\; apples&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;30\; apples - 10\; apples = 20\; apples&lt;/math&gt;
#Mathematics can discard the physical objects in question and has the luxury of concerning itself with abstract concepts
#*&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;(1 + 1) \times a = 2 \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;1 \times a + 1 \times a = 2 \times a&lt;/math&gt;
#Whereas in mathematics the constant &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; represents a numerical constant, in physics this constant can represent a ''physical'' constant, thereby allowing physical objects to behave as mathematical entities in mathematical equations
#*&lt;math&gt;1 \times apple + 1 \times apple = 2 \times apple&lt;/math&gt;
#Units of measurements are '''important''' in mathematical equations since they represent critical information and errors in calculations will result if these physical constants are neglected
#*&lt;math&gt;1 + 1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;is wrong in the sense that&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;1 \times apple + 1 \times orange = 1 \times apple + 1 \times orange&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;is the only answer allowed under the rules of mathematics
#Also, care must be taken when we perform mathematical operations
#*&lt;math&gt;(3 \times apples) \times (3 \times apples) = 9 \times apples^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;represents 9 apples arranged in a square
#*&lt;math&gt;(3 \times apples) \times (3 \times oranges) = 9 \times apples \times oranges&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;creates a new physical quantity apple(orange) that is neither apples nor oranges!  This is how new physical quantities, i.e. energy are created from lengths, times, and masses.

==Basic Units of Measurement==
#Time
#*Usually measured in seconds
#**Shorthand is s
#***10 seconds
#***10 s
#*Only unit of measurement not to be decimalized (although such a system does exist)
#Distance
#*Usually measured in meters
#**Shorthand is m
#***10 meters
#***10 m
#Mass
#*Base unit is the kilogram
#**Shorthand is kg
#***10 kilograms
#***10 kg
#*Sometimes measured in grams
#**Shorthand is g
#***10 grams
#***10 g

==Derived Units of Measurement==
#Area
#*Usually measured in meters squared
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; meters\times meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; square \ meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;
#Volume
#*Usually measured in meters cubed
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; meters\times meters\times meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; cubic \ meters&lt;/math&gt;
#**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{m}^3&lt;/math&gt;
#Density
##Linear density
##*Usually measured in kilograms per meter
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; kilograms \ per \ meter&lt;/math&gt;
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}&lt;/math&gt;
##Area density
##*Usually measured in kilograms per meter squared
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; kilograms \ per \ square \ meter&lt;/math&gt;
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}^2&lt;/math&gt;
##Volumetric density
##*Usually measured in kilograms per meters cubed
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; kilograms \ per \ cubic \ meter&lt;/math&gt;
##**&lt;math&gt;10\; \mbox{kg}/\mbox{m}^3&lt;/math&gt;

==Scientific Notation==
*Shorthand notation for large or tiny numbers based on powers of 10
#Large
#*&lt;math&gt;1,000,000 = 10^6 = 1 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;2,500,000 = 2.5 \times 10^6&lt;/math&gt;
#Small
#*&lt;math&gt;0.001 = 10^{-3} = 1 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;0.000234 = 2.34 \times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;
==Syst&amp;egrave;me International d'Unit&amp;eacute;s (International System of Units, aka SI)==
*Further simplification of written numbers
**&lt;math&gt;4,430 \mbox{ meters} = 4.43 \times 10^3 \mbox{ meters} = 4.43 \mbox{ kilometers}&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;4,430 \mbox{ m} = 4.43 \times 10^3 \mbox{ m} = 4.43 \mbox{ km}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Mathematics of Conversion Between Units==
#In mathematical equations, units of measurement behave as constants
#*&lt;math&gt;(1\mbox{ m} + 2\mbox{ m})\times 4\mbox{ m} = 12\mbox{ m}^2&lt;/math&gt;
#To convert from one unit of to another, we utilize an equation relating the two measurements
#*&lt;math&gt;1\mbox{ km} = 1000\mbox{ m} \,&lt;/math&gt;
#We can solve and substitute for the constant &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km} = \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\left[1\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) + 2\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)\right]\times 4\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) = 12 \left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;
#*&lt;math&gt;\left(1\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} + 2\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km}\right)\times 4\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} = 12\times 10^{-6}\mbox{ km}^2&lt;/math&gt;

The Mathematics of Conversion Between Units

   1. In mathematical equations, units of measurement behave as constants
          * (1\mbox{ m} + 2\mbox{ m})\times 4\mbox{ m} = 12\mbox{ m}^2
   2. To convert from one unit of to another, we utilize an equation relating the two measurements
          * 1\mbox{ km} = 1000\mbox{ m} \,
   3. We can solve and substitute for the constant m
          * \frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km} = \mbox{ m}
          * \left[1\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) + 2\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)\right]\times 4\left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right) = 12 \left(\frac{1}{1000}\mbox{ km}\right)^2
          * \left(1\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} + 2\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km}\right)\times 4\times 10^{-3}\mbox{ km} = 12\times 10^{-6}\mbox{ km}^2

==Quick searches and keywords==
[[Image:Adding_a_Keyword_Search_in_Firefox.png|right|thumb|300px|Select &quot;Add a Keyword for this Search&quot;.]]
[[Image:Defining_a_Quicksearch_Keyword_in_Firefox.png|right|thumb|300px|A Name and the Keyword ''w'' were just entered for this Quick Search.]]
Quick Searches allow you to define custom search keywords for entering in the Location Bar. After setup, just type your search keyword before your search terms. A wiki of popular quick searches is maintained [http://www.wormus.com/leakytap/Internet/CustomKeywords here]. The steps needed to make a new Quick Search are outlined below:

# Go to a web page that contains a search box.
# Right click in the search entry box.
# Select &quot;Add a Keyword for this Search&quot;.
# Give your quick search a keyword. For example, a Wikipedia search could be ''w''. Obviously, shorter keywords are more efficient than longer ones, such as ''wikipedia''.

An alternative method for older versions of Firefox or locations without search boxes is to:

# Go to a webpage that contains a search box.
# Search for something. In this case, ''oddball'' will be the search word.
# Note the term in the URL, and replace it with ''%s''. For example, searching on the Google search engine gives us the URL:
::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q='''oddball'''&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&lt;/tt&gt;
:Using our example, the new address would be:
::&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q='''%s'''&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&lt;/tt&gt;
# Copy the modified URL from the location bar.
# Go to ''Bookmarks'' &amp;rarr; ''Manage Bookmarks'' &amp;rarr; ''New Bookmark''.
# Paste your modified URL in the ''Location'' box.
# Give your quick search a name, e.g. Google Quick Search.
# Give your quick search a keyword. '''Note:''' This can be one character or more. For example, a Google search could be ''g''.

To use your new quick search all you need to do is type &lt;tt&gt;''keyword'' ''your search term''&lt;/tt&gt; in the address bar; for example, to search for the information regarding the history of Wikipedia in Google, you would type, &lt;tt&gt;g history of wikipedia&lt;/tt&gt;. You can also bookmark advanced searches using the same technique. Just try a search and replace your search term with ''%s''. Simple!

This functionality doesn't have to be limited to web searches; it can be used to quickly go to pages that have a certain structure. For example, one way to get more out of [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]] would be to create a bookmark to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%s&lt;/tt&gt; with keyword ''w''. Getting to Wikipedia articles now only requires typing in &lt;tt&gt;w ''article title''&lt;/tt&gt;.

Another example is currency conversions. To easily convert from US dollars to Euro, one could create a bookmark to &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;www.xe.com/ucc/convert.cgi?From=USD&amp;To=EUR&amp;Amount=%s&lt;/tt&gt; and give it the keyword ''$''. To convert a given amount (say $50), all one has to do now is enter &lt;tt&gt;$ 50&lt;/tt&gt; into the address bar (note the space, it's very important).

Once you start thinking about them, keywords can become quite useful.

You can also use the [http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=188 SmartSearch] extension to do all your quick searches from the context menu, by highlighting a word on a page, right-clicking it and search using any of your quick searches.

== Find Toolbar ==
[[Image:Firefox_FAYT.png|thumb|300px|right|Screenshot of performing &quot;Find as you type&quot;. &quot;ency&quot; was being typed and the first matched text was highlighted in green.]]
A new and innovative feature is the Find Toolbar. The Find Toolbar is used for searching for text within a page without being too obtrusive. When activated by pressing Ctrl+F, the Find Toolbar appears on the bottom of the Firefox browser ready to search the current web page. The Find Toolbar using incremental searching which means that it will look up your search term simultaneously as you type it. This is more robust than traditional find as finding is done immediately when typing starts. The Find Toolbar has the ability to find the next or previous result and select it, highlight all the matched results and match case. Firefox will search down until reaching the end of the document and &quot;wraparound&quot; to the beginning of the page. If there are no results matching your terms, Firefox will 'beep' to inform you of this. (If you want to disable this 'beep' go to &lt;tt&gt;about:config&lt;/tt&gt; and change the value &lt;tt&gt;accessibility.typeaheadfind.enablesound&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;.)
When you are done searching, simply press the Esc key and the Find Toolbar will hide.

=== Find As You Type ===
A very useful feature is Find As You Type, which lets you use the functionality of the Find Toolbar without having to open or close it with Ctrl+F or Cmd+F.

By default, Find As You Type will only begin after pressing the ''/'' key. Alternatively, to only search links, press the '' ' '' key (apostrophe). However, it is possible to have Find As You Type work without needing an additional key press. To do so, go to ''Tools'' &amp;rarr; ''Options'' &amp;rarr; ''Advanced'' &amp;rarr; ''General'' and check &quot;Begin finding when you begin typing&quot;.

From now on, when searching about some topic on a website, just start typing into the body of the page. You will instantly go to the first instance of the sequence of letters as you type. The Find Toolbar will temporarily appear at the bottom of the page, allowing you to highlight all the places the term occurs, or jump to the next one. More Find Toolbar shortcuts can be found in the [[../Keyboard shortcuts/]] section, and a complete description [http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/ here].

A useful tip to navigate around a web page is to use find as you type. You simply push the '' ' '' key (apostrophe) and begin typing the text of the link you wish to follow. Once Firefox highlights that link (whether you've only typed a few letters or the entire word), you hit the Enter key and Firefox will begin loading that page. For example, if on this same page, you quickly want to go to the Table of Contents. Notice that the link for the table of contents is ''&lt;&lt; To Contents''. Press the apostrophe key to activate the Find Toolbar for searching for links and then type &quot;to&quot;. Firefox will then highlight part of the link. Pressing enter will take you to the ''Using Firefox'' Table of Contents. One thing to note is that the apostrophe key does not necessarily have to be used for this tip to work; just using Find As You Type can accomplish the same thing, but since it searches all text, whether it's a link or not, it may not be as quick as beginning your search with the apostrophe key.

Extensions are small add-ons that add new functionality to Firefox. They can add anything from a toolbar button to a completely new feature. They allow the browser to be customized to fit the personal needs of each user if they need additional features, while keeping Firefox small to download.

There are over 1000 extensions available for Firefox. This may make it difficult for people to find what they want.  The links on this page are intended to help while also remaining current.  As such they will not generally point to specific extension but rather where to look for them.  To look at links by category [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/ this page] is a good start.  Additionally the headings below provide a link to mozilla.org pointing to the specific category - this means that the information will always be up to date.

A good place to start looking for extensions is [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/recommended/ here] for recommended extensions.

The most popular extensions are to be found [https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=E&amp;sort=downloads here].

There are many themes available at Mozilla Update which make Firefox more attractive. The most popular ones are [https://addons.mozilla.org/search.php?app=firefox&amp;appfilter=firefox&amp;type=T&amp;sort=downloads here].

In addition, Mozilla has recently launched [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fashionyourfirefox Fashion Your Firefox], a service for users who don't want to go through the entire library of addons to choose just a few good ones based on what they use Firefox for.

==What is a Plugin?==
Firefox requires ''plugins'' in order to read or display special content from the websites. Plugins are programs that are integrated into Firefox that allows websites to provide content to you. Such content includes flash videos, java games and streaming video from the Internet. Examples of plugins are [[#Macromedia Flash Player|Flash]], [[#RealPlayer|RealPlayer]], and [[#Java|Java]]. Plugins are a necessary component to truly access the Internet's interactive stuff.

A much more comprehensive list of plugins, with detailed installation instructions, is available at [http://pfs.mozilla.org/plugins/ Mozilla Update]. Another valuable resource is [http://plugindoc.mozdev.org Mozdev Plugins].

==What is Current Version Plugin?==
Firefox plugins should be updated to latest version. Firefox plugin check page will find the latest update of plugins. Having said that, There are few plugins will be given as unknown plugins if firefox is unable to recognize. These unknown plugins should be updated manually by finding the [http://www.firefoxcvp.com current version plugin] in search engine. Any plugin update can be found by prefixing keyword current version plugin in search engine.

==Before You Install==

===Close Firefox before installing plugins===
Firefox should be closed before running any plugin installation programs, as existing files may be overwritten during the installation process.

===Using XPInstall to install plugins===
Some plugins are available as XPInstall packages (XPIs), the same format as that for extensions. Where XPIs are available, it is recommended you use them as they often install the plugin automatically without you having to restart Firefox. After the XPI has finished installing, you should restart your browser.

===Checking which plugins you have installed===
To check what plugins you have installed, simply type ''about:plugins'' in the Location bar. This page will show which plugins are installed, what file types they are associated with and if the plugin is enabled or disabled.

==Available Plugins==

===Adobe PDF Reader===
In order to read .pdf files, you need to install a pdf reader. Adobe Reader, one of the more popular software, can do this. Simply go to Adobe's official [http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html site] and download Adobe Reader. With Firefox closed, install Adobe Reader and it will also install the plugin necessary for Firefox to view PDF files. No other steps are necessary. Firefox will now open all PDFs from within a Firefox tab.

If you install Adobe Reader after Firefox, Adobe Reader will automatically select the right plugin. If you already have the latest version of Adobe Reader installed then Firefox will automatically use the plugin. Some people have problems with the Adobe Reader plugin in Firefox. The explanation and solution is [http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Adobe_Reader here].

===Java===
The Java Plugin is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE, for short). The JRE installer will install the Java Plugin for Netscape 7.2 and Mozilla automatically.

To get the it simply go to [http://java.com/ java.com] and click the &quot;Download Now!&quot; button to download and install the latest JRE.

===Macromedia Flash Player===
When you encounter a site that makes use of Flash graphics, a yellow bar will appear at the top of the page telling you that there is a missing plugin preventing you from viewing all the content on the current page. Click on ''Install Missing Plugins'' button and the Mozilla Plugin Finder Service will appear automatically. After accepting the User Agreement from Macromedia, the necessary components to view Flash will be installed.

Alternately, you may install Macromedia Flash Player (without having to go to a site) by installing the plugin manually. Simply go [http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/windows.html#Flash here] and click on the Macromedia Flash Player 8.0 link.
&lt;!-- Image here of Plugin Finder! --&gt;

===Macromedia Shockwave Player===
Simply go to the Macromedia Shockwave [http://sdc.shockwave.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi? site] and download the plugin. When you are installing it, Firefox will appear in the list of browsers that you can install the plugin for. (Remember, Firefox should be closed when installing).

===Quicktime Player (Windows &amp;amp; Mac)===
Simply go to Apple's (the developer of Quicktime) website and download [http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/ Quicktime]. Installing Quicktime will install the appropriate plugin in order for Firefox to view .mov files. 

===RealPlayer===
Simply go to Real's (the developer of RealPlayer) website and download the [http://www.real.com/freeplayer/?rppr=rnwk program]. The RealPlayer installer will automatically detect your browser's plugins folder and install the plugin.

==Uninstalling Plugins==
A list of your installed plugins can be obtained from about:plugins. As a general rule, to remove a plugin, you remove the file listed in about:plugins for it. Typically a .dll file.

On a XP machine this can typically be found at c:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins

==about:config==
&lt;!--this is just a start there is more to come--&gt;
Type about:config into your address bar and you will be brought to the about:config settings. This is a powerful way to tweak your settings in ways that are not normally accessible through the Options menu. By simply double clicking one of the available options (after copying and pasting them into the filter bar to find them easily), changes can be made, including the following:

* browser.block.target_new_window &amp;mdash; if set to true, links that normally force a new window to open will open in the current window instead.

* browser.xul.error_pages.enabled &amp;mdash; if set to true, Firefox displays an error page similar to IE instead of a message box if loading a page fails.

* layout.frames.force_resizability &amp;mdash; if set to true, allows the user to resize frames on any web site that uses them.

The following changes can be made to speed up browsing. Normally the browser will make one request to a web page at a time. When you enable pipelining it will make several at once, which usually speeds up page loading. Make these changes to enable pipelining:

Set &quot;network.http.pipelining&quot; to &quot;true&quot;

Set &quot;network.http.proxy.pipelining&quot; to &quot;true&quot;

[Tip: If have your browser set to connect to an optional http proxy, you can leave &quot;network.http.pipelining&quot; setp to &quot;false&quot;, then add the domains of websites that don't work with pipelining (like images.google.com) to the proxy exclude list.]

Set &quot;network.http.pipelining.maxrequests&quot; to 8. This means it will make up to 8 requests at once rather than the default of 4. This is only an advantage if you have a reliable internet connection that isn't particularly slow.

Finally, right-click anywhere and select New-&gt; Integer. Name it &quot;nglayout.initialpaint.delay&quot; and set its value to &quot;0&quot;. This value is the amount of time the browser waits before it acts on information it receives, but it will increase the total time taken to render the page. This option is more suitable for a faster computer (&quot;250&quot; is the default). Try a value of &quot;100&quot; if &quot;0&quot; causes problems.

For broadband users:

Set &quot;network.http.max-connections-per-server&quot; to 14. Many guides recommend setting this figure to 100, but this can have undesirable effects upon webservers.

Set &quot;network.http.max-connections&quot; to 48


A much more complete list can be found [http://preferential.mozdev.org/preferences.html here], with descriptions and which values the preference will take (where applicable)

==Editing the userChrome.css File==

userChrome.css is a file that allows you to change the appearance of Firefox with CSS rules. The actual browser window (i.e., not the webpage, but everything else) is called the &quot;chrome&quot;. The file userChrome.css overrides default settings to allow for more customization.

userChrome.css is not created by default. It should be created in your profile folder, which can be found in the following places:

 '''Windows''':
  %appdata%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&lt;Profile name&gt;\
 '''Linux''':
  ~/.mozilla/firefox/&lt;Profile name&gt;/
 '''Mac OS X''':
  ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;Profile name&gt;/
 or
  ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;Profile name&gt;/

In all cases, the profile is randomly named, with 8 characters followed by ''.default''. Inside that folder is another named &quot;chrome&quot;. Inside the chrome folder is where userChrome.css needs to be created.

==Editing the userContent.css File==


==Tips==

* Allowing extension downloads from mozilla.org instead of www.mozilla.org will match all subdomains of mozilla.org, just as blocking cookies from doubleclick.net instead of www.doubleclick.net will allow blocking of all doubleclick.net subdomains. Allowing &quot;www.mozilla.org&quot; would not allow &quot;addons.mozilla.org&quot;. However, as a security measure, when whitelisting sites for extensions, the most specific domain available should be used (i.e., addons.mozilla.org instead of mozilla.org) to prevent potentially malicious installs from other subdomains on a site.

* To get Firefox on a computer without an internet connection or where internet downloads are blocked you can download the file as normal form another computer (usually you can do this at a public library) then put the *.exe file on some removable media and transfer it to the first computer.

&quot;pivot table&quot; or a &quot;crosstab report&quot;

(Note: this page needs to be wikified)

SQL Characteristic Functions: Do it without &quot;if&quot;, &quot;case&quot;, or &quot;GROUP_CONCAT&quot;.
Yes, there is use for this...&quot;if&quot; statements sometimes cause problems when used in combination.
 
The simple secret, and it's also why they work in almost all databases, is the following functions:
 
* sign (x) returns -1,0, +1 for values x &lt; 0, x = 0, x &gt; 0 respectively
* abs( sign( x) )  returns 0 if x = 0  else, 1 if  x &gt; 0 or x &lt; 0
* 1-abs( sign( x) ) complement of the above, since this returns 1 only if x = 0
 
    Quick example:   sign(-1) = -1,  abs( sign(-1) ) = 1,  1-abs( sign(-1) ) = 0
 
Data for full example:
 
       CREATE TABLE exams (
         pkey int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
         name varchar(15),
         exam int,
         score int,
         PRIMARY KEY  (pkey)
       );
 
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',1,75);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',2,77);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',3,78);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Bob',4,80);
 
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',1,90);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',2,97);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',3,98);
       insert into exams (name,exam,score) values ('Sue',4,99);
 
 mysql&gt; select * from exams;
 +------+------+------+-------+
 | pkey | name | exam | score |
 +------+------+------+-------+
 |    1 | Bob  |    1 |    75 |
 |    2 | Bob  |    2 |    77 |
 |    3 | Bob  |    3 |    78 |
 |    4 | Bob  |    4 |    80 |
 |    5 | Sue  |    1 |    90 |
 |    6 | Sue  |    2 |    97 |
 |    7 | Sue  |    3 |    98 |
 |    8 | Sue  |    4 |    99 |
 +------+------+------+-------+
 8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
 mysql&gt; select name,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-1)))) as exam1,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2)))) as exam2,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-3)))) as exam3,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-4)))) as exam4
 from exams group by name;
 
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |    77 |    78 |    80 |
 | Sue  |    90 |    97 |    98 |    99 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
Note, the above pivot table was created with one select statement.
 
Let's decompose to make the trick clearer, for the second exam:
 mysql&gt; select name, score, exam, exam-2, sign(exam-2), abs(sign(exam-2)), 1-abs(sign(exam-2)),
        score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2))) as exam2 from exams;
 +------+-------+------+--------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------+
 | name | score | exam | exam-2 | sign(exam-2) | abs(sign(exam-2)) | 1-abs(sign(exam-2)) | exam2 |
 +------+-------+------+--------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |    1 |     -1 |           -1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Bob  |    77 |    2 |      0 |            0 |                 0 |                   1 |    77 |
 | Bob  |    78 |    3 |      1 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Bob  |    80 |    4 |      2 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Sue  |    90 |    1 |     -1 |           -1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Sue  |    97 |    2 |      0 |            0 |                 0 |                   1 |    97 |
 | Sue  |    98 |    3 |      1 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 | Sue  |    99 |    4 |      2 |            1 |                 1 |                   0 |     0 |
 +------+-------+------+--------+--------------+-------------------+---------------------+-------+
 8 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
You may think IF's would be clean but WATCH OUT!
Look what the following gives (INCORRECT !!):
 
 mysql&gt; select name,
 if(exam=1,score,null) as exam1,
 if(exam=2,score,null) as exam2,
 if(exam=3,score,null) as exam3,
 if(exam=4,score,null) as exam4
 from exams group by name;
 
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |  NULL |  NULL |  NULL |
 | Sue  |    90 |  NULL |  NULL |  NULL |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
Note: the following does work - is all the maths necessary after all?
 mysql&gt; SELECT name,
        SUM(IF(exam=1,score,NULL)) AS exam1,
        SUM(IF(exam=2,score,NULL)) AS exam2,
        SUM(IF(exam=3,score,NULL)) AS exam3,
        SUM(IF(exam=4,score,0)) AS exam4
        FROM exams GROUP BY name;
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | name | exam1 | exam2 | exam3 | exam4 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 | Bob  |    75 |    77 |    78 |    80 |
 | Sue  |    90 |    97 |    98 |    99 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
 
 mysql&gt; select name,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-1)))) as exam1,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2)))) as exam2,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-3)))) as exam3,
        sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-4)))) as exam4,
          sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 2)))) -   sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 1)))) as delta_1_2,
          sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 3)))) -   sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 2)))) as delta_2_3,
          sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 4)))) -   sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam- 3)))) as delta_3_4
        from exams group by name;
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

 | Sue  |    90 |    97 |    98 |    99 |         7 |         1 |         1 |
 +------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
 
Above delta_1_2 shows the difference between the first and second exams, with the numbers
being positive because both Bob and Sue improved their score with each exam.  Calculating
the deltas here shows it's possible to compare two rows, not columns which is easily done
with the standard  SQL statements but  rows in the original table.
 
 mysql&gt;select name,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-1)))) as exam1,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-2)))) as exam2,
 sum(score*(1-abs(sign(exam-3)))) as exam3,

== Why not mention commercial software!?? ==
In the article, it says: &quot;''Given that WikiBooks is a publicly-available 'open' book, it would be inappropriate to include information about or links to any commercial SMIL tools.''&quot; - I don't see why this wikiBook should not mention commercial software! There are other books on wikibooks.org dedicated to commercial software such as the wikibook on [[Oracle]] or [[Microsoft_SQL_Server_2005]]

== Why Netbeans only ? ==

There are a lot of XML editors, but in this book Netbeans is a special case, letting the reader think that Netbeans would be better than any other XML Editor available. I guess this is wrong, any XML Editor, given that it provides comprehensive functionnality, would be equal to Netbeans in this regard.</text>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You are already familiar with expressions such as &lt;math&gt;3x+5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; and perhaps &lt;math&gt;x^3 + 2x - 2&lt;/math&gt;. The general word for an expression that can be written in this form is a '''polynomial'''. Excluding the constant term, every power of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in a polynomial is a positive integer. Expressions that have &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to a non-integer or negative power are not polynomials.

==Basics of polynomials==

All polynomials can be written in the form:

&lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + a_4x^4\dots a_nx^n&lt;/math&gt;.

The numbers &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\dots&lt;/math&gt; are known as the '''co-efficients''', and will often already be known. For example in &lt;math&gt;4x^2 + 3x + 9&lt;/math&gt; the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; is 4. The co-efficients may be 1 or even 0, for example &lt;math&gt;x^3 + x&lt;/math&gt; is still a polynomial.

===Degrees of polynomials===

The number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the highest power in the polynomial is known as the degree, or sometimes the order, of the polynomial. For example, &lt;math&gt;x^4 + 4x^2 + 9&lt;/math&gt; is a degree 4 polynomial. Certain degrees have names, and are often written using certain letters for the coefficients when they are unknown:

* Degree 0 - Constant - &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 1 - Linear - &lt;math&gt;ax + b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;mx + c&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 2 - Quadratic - &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 3 - Cubic - &lt;math&gt;ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d&lt;/math&gt;
* Degree 4 - Quartic &lt;math&gt;ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx +e&lt;/math&gt;

===Notation===

Most of the polynomials on this page are written in terms of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, for example, &lt;math&gt;4x^2 + 2x - 9&lt;/math&gt;, although polynomials can be written with other letters. &lt;math&gt;3z^2 + z - 2&lt;/math&gt;, for example, is called a '''polynomial in &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;'''.

It is conventional to write polynomials in descending powers for clarity, although a polynomial may have the powers in any order. By writing polynomials in descending powers it is possible to see what the degree of the polynomial is simply by looking at the first term. Performing operations with two or more polynomials are also much simpler when the powers are in order, since like powers are usually grouped during calculations.

Indeed, you may lose marks in your exam if you don't simplify things like &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 5x - 3x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 2x&lt;/math&gt;.

==Operations with polynomials==

===Addition===

To add polynomials you simply add the co-efficients of each term. If that sounds confusing don't worry as you will probably already know how to do this, it is basically the same as collecting like terms. You add the co-efficients of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; together, the co-efficients of &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; together, and so on. For example:

&lt;math&gt;\left(4x^2 + 2x + 9\right) + \left(6x^2 - 2\right) = 10x^2 + 2x + 7&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that &lt;math&gt;4+6=10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;9-2=7&lt;/math&gt;. Some find it helpful to write this out like numerical addition:
{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;4x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 9&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| +
| &lt;math&gt;6x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;- 2&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot; 
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;10x^2&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;+ 7&lt;/math&gt;
|}
When using this method it is essential that terms with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to the same power are lined up, leaving spaces if necessary as in the example above.

===Subtraction===

For subtraction of polynomials, it is possible to use the same method as above, except subtracting instead of adding. It may get confusing when there are negative terms involved, so it is preferred to reverse the signs in the second row and then add the two polynomials together.

This:

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;10x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 7&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| -
| &lt;math&gt;6x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;- 2&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot; 
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;4x^2&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 9&lt;/math&gt;
|}


Would become this:

{| cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;10x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;+ 7&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| +
| &lt;math&gt;-6x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| 
| &lt;math&gt;+ 2&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot; 
| style=&quot;padding-right:20px;&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;4x^2&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 2x&lt;/math&gt;
! style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000; border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000; padding-right:20px;&quot; | 
&lt;math&gt;+ 9&lt;/math&gt;
|}

This method is desirable in the exam because subtracting negative numbers may cause confusion, and mistakes may be overlooked in the pressure of the exam.

===Multiplication===

To multiply polynomials you simply multiply all the terms in one by all the terms in the other and then sum the results. This method is known as the FOIL Method. It stands for First Outer Inner Last. For example:

&lt;math&gt;\left(3x^2+2x\right) \times \left(2x^2 - 5\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be broken down into:&lt;p&gt;
Multiply the First terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x^2 \times 2x^2 = 6x^4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then multiply the Outer terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;3x^2 \times -5 = -15x^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then multiply the Inner terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x \times 2x^2 = 4x^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Then multiply the Last terms together.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;math&gt;2x \times -5 = -10x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Then we add the results together to give us &lt;math&gt;6x^4  + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;, written in descending powers.

As you become confident with the process, you'll be able to do the entire multiplication in one go without splitting it up, like this:

&lt;math&gt;\left(3x^2+2x\right) \times \left(2x^2 - 5\right) = 6x^4  + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;

====Multiplication table====

Some people find it helpful to show this in a table, with one polynomial as rows and the other as columns:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| '''&lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| 
| 
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;'''
| 
| 
|}
The headings are then multiplied to produce:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| 
| '''&lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- align=&quot;center&quot; valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;'''
| &lt;math&gt;6x^4&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| '''&lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;'''
| &lt;math&gt;-15x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;-10x&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The answer is the sum of all the cells:

&lt;math&gt;6x^4  + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;, as before. This method is particularly useful for multiplying longer polynomials where the answer might not fit on a single line and cause mistakes.

====Long multiplication====

The polynomials to be multiplied can also be laid out like regular long multiplication, like this:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
|
| 
|
| &lt;math&gt;3x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;
|
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
|
| &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;
|
| &lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;
|- valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| This is the 1st row multiplied by &lt;math&gt;-5&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;-15x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;-10x&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-top:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
|-valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| This is the 1st row multiplied by &lt;math&gt;2x^2&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;6x^4&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;| &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; ←solid #000000;&quot;|
| style=&quot;border-bottom:2px solid black; solid #000000;&quot;|
|-valign=&quot;bottom&quot;
| This is the sum of the two answers
!| &lt;math&gt;6x^4&lt;/math&gt;
!| &lt;math&gt;4x^3&lt;/math&gt;
!| &lt;math&gt;-15x^2&lt;/math&gt;
!| &lt;math&gt;-10x&lt;/math&gt;
|
|}

===Division===

Division of polynomials can be done just like regular long division. However, you will need to be quite adept at addition, subtraction and multiplication of polynomials to divide.

For example, to divide &lt;math&gt;x^3 - 12x^2 - 42&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;x-3&lt;/math&gt; you write it like this:


:&lt;math&gt;x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
1. Divide the first term of the dividend by the highest term of the divisor. Place the result above the bar (''x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;divide; x = x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'').	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
x^2\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
2. Multiply the divisor by the result you just obtained (the first term of the eventual quotient). Write the result under the first two terms of the dividend (''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; * (x-3) = x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'').	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
x^2\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\qquad\;\; x^3 - 3x^2	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
3. Subtract the product you just obtained from the appropriate terms of the original dividend, and write the result underneath. This can be tricky at times, because of the sign. ((''x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-12x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) - (x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = -12x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -9x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'') Then, &quot;pull down&quot; the next term from the dividend.	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
x^2\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\qquad\;\; \underline{x^3 - \quad3x^2}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\; -9x^2 + 0x	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
4. Repeat the last three steps, except this time use the two terms that you have just written as the dividend.	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
\; x^2 - 9x\\	 
\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\;\; \underline{\;\;x^3 - \;\;3x^2}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; -9x^2 + 0x\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; \underline{-9x^2 + 27x}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad -27x - 42	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
5. Repeat step 4. This time, there is nothing to &quot;pull down&quot;.	 
:&lt;math&gt;	 
\begin{matrix}	 
\qquad\quad\;\, x^2 \; - 9x \quad - 27\\	 
\qquad\quad x-3\overline{\vert x^3 - 12x^2 + 0x - 42}\\	 
\;\; \underline{\;\;x^3 - \;\;3x^2}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; -9x^2 + 0x\\	 
\qquad\qquad\quad\; \underline{-9x^2 + 27x}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad -27x - 42\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \underline{-27x + 81}\\	 
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\;\; -123	 
\end{matrix}	 
&lt;/math&gt;	 
	 
The polynomial above the bar is your answer, and the number left over ''(-123)'' is the remainder.	 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^3 - 12x^2 - 42}{x-3} = x^2 - 9x - 27&lt;/math&gt; remainder &lt;math&gt;-123&lt;/math&gt;

==Curves of polynomials==

It is possible to look at a polynomial and get an idea to the general shape of its curve. The most important factors are the degree of the polynomial, and the sign of the co-efficient of the highest power. For a more accurate sketch of the graph, you will need to know where the curve has '''turning points''' and where it intersects the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis. A sketch with this information will often be sufficiently detailed, and is usually much quicker and easier than plotting the curve point by point.

===Turning points===

A turning point is where a curve that is decreasing changes to increasing, or vice versa. On a graph, the curve simply changes direction, hence the name turning point. In &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt;, the turning point is at (0,0), the trough of the &quot;bucket&quot;. The turning point in &lt;math&gt;y=x^2&lt;/math&gt; is a '''minimum''' (plural '''minima'''), and a '''maximum''' (plural '''maxima''') is the same bucket shape, but upside down. For a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, its curve will have '''at most''' &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; turning points.

===Behaviour with extreme values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;===

What happens to a polynomial at large positive and negative values for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;?

If we say &lt;math&gt;1000&lt;/math&gt; is our large number, we can put it into &lt;math&gt;6x^4 + 4x^3 - 15x^2 - 10x&lt;/math&gt;, we can take a look at what happens:

First for &lt;math&gt;x=1000&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;6000000000000 + 4000000000 - 15000000 - 10000 = 6003970000000&lt;/math&gt;

Now for &lt;math&gt;x=-1000&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;6000000000000 - 4000000000 - 15000000 + 10000 = 5995985010000&lt;/math&gt;

The most change in the final answer is made by the &lt;math&gt;x^4&lt;/math&gt; term. This is the '''dominant term'''. For a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is the dominant term as &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Once you have investigated the behaviour of polynomials with extreme values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, you may notice that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even, it will share the same general shape as &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is odd it will share the same general shape as &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;.

If the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is positive, curves with an even value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will have a bucket shape, and curves with an odd value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will generally be negative when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and positive when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is positive (like &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;).

If the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;x^n&lt;/math&gt; is negative, curves with an even value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will have an upside down bucket shape, and curves with an odd value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will generally be positive when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is negative, and negative when &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is positive (similar to &lt;math&gt;y = -x&lt;/math&gt;).

===Intersections with axes===

To find where the curve crosses the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis, you can simply look at the constant term. &lt;math&gt;y = x^3 + 2x^2 - 9x - 18&lt;/math&gt;, for example, would cross the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis at &lt;math&gt;-18&lt;/math&gt;. If there is no constant term, the curve will go through the origin, (0,0), and would therefore cross the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; axis at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

In factorised form, you can find the points at which the curve crosses the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. &lt;math&gt;y = (x+3)(x+2)(x-3)&lt;/math&gt; would cross the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis at &lt;math&gt;-3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, because by making one of the brackets equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, it makes the whole polynomial equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; is of course the line of the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis. Each instance of the curve crossing the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis is a '''root''' of the equation. A polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; will have '''at most''' &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; roots.

To '''solve''' an equation means to find every root. Polynomials of degree 2 can be solved using the [[#The quadratic formula|quadratic formula]]. For higher degree polynomials you may need to factorise the equation like above, plot the graph point by point and look at where the curve crosses the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; axis, or use a [[../../C3/Numerical Methods|numerical method]]. You can check your answers by substituting them into the original equation and seeing if the result is &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quadratic expressions==

[[Image:Quadratic01.png|right]]
A quadratic is a polynomial of degree 2, in the form &lt;math&gt;f(x)=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;.

===Graph===
A quadratic graph is one that can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;y=ax^2+bx+c&lt;/math&gt;. The graph of &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; is shown on the right, and as you can see it has the same characteristic &quot;bucket&quot; shape that all quadratics have, called a '''parabola'''. The '''vertex''' is the maximum or minimum point. The line of symmetry is the line that divides the graph into two mirror halves. It can be found by the formula &lt;math&gt;\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, these properties can be more easily deduced from its '''completed square form''' ( &lt;math&gt;a(x + d)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt; ). In this form we know that, ''- d'' is the axis of symmetry, and that ''e'' is maximum or minimum point. If a is greater 0 then the vertex (-d,e) will be a minimum point. If a is less than 0 the vertex (-d,e) will be a maximum point.

===Completing the square===

Completing the square is the process of changing a quadratic from the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx +c&lt;/math&gt; to the equivalent form &lt;math&gt;a(x+d)^2 + e&lt;/math&gt;, where a, d and e are constants. For example, the quadratic &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x +2&lt;/math&gt; would become &lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 - 6&lt;/math&gt;.

Changing a quadratic to completed square form makes it easy to find several things, such as the roots of the quadratic and the vertex of the quadratic, without even requiring a sketch.

Here are the steps for completing the square. Don't worry, it's easier than it looks.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
! Step
! Action
! Example
! General case
|-
! 1.
| Ensure the quadratic is in the conventional form: &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;.
| &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2.
| Unless &lt;math&gt;a=1&lt;/math&gt;, &quot;pull/factor out a&quot;, that is, divide the entire quadratic by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and put it outside a bracket.
''Note: If the quadratic is part of an equation you can divide each side by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, for example &lt;math&gt;2x^2 + 8x + 2=0&lt;/math&gt; simply becomes &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 1=0&lt;/math&gt;.''
| &lt;math&gt;2\left(x^2 + 4x + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3.
| Replace the &lt;math&gt;x^2 + kx&lt;/math&gt; part with &lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;.
It is important to realise that &lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{k}{2}\right)^2=x^2 + kx + \frac{k^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt; which is close to what it was there before but not equal. This will be corrected in the next step. To prevent writing something that isn't actually equal it is a good idea to do both these steps at once in your working once you have got used to the method.
| &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4.
| Correct the error introduced in the previous step by inserting the subtraction of a suitable number. This suitable number can be found in two ways:
# By expanding the term inserted in the previous step and comparing it to the original; ''or''
# By remembering that the error is always &lt;math&gt;\frac{k^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
''This step is known as &quot;completing the square&quot; and gives the method its name.''
| 
# &lt;math&gt;(x+2)^2 = x^2 + 4x + 4&lt;/math&gt; which is 3 greater than &lt;math&gt;x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; -3&lt;/math&gt; is inserted: &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 - 3\right)&lt;/math&gt;; ''or''
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{4^2}{4} = 4&lt;/math&gt; so the error is 4: &lt;math&gt;2\left((x+2)^2 -4 +1\right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 2\left((x+2)^2 -3\right)&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a^2} + \frac{c}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 5.
| If step 2 was necessary then simplify the result a bit by expanding the outer bracket. Then you are finished.
|&lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 -6&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 6.
| Check that what you have obtained expands back to what you started with.
''Note: You may feel confident enough to skip this step.''
|&lt;math&gt;2\left(x^2 + 4x + 4\right) -6&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=2x^2 + 8x + 8 - 6&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;a\left(x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}\right)  -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=ax^2 + bx + \frac{b^2}{4a}  -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;=ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt;
|}

So the completed square form of &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2(x+2)^2 -6&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;-6&lt;/math&gt; tells us that the lowest point of the curve is at &lt;math&gt;y=-6&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;x+2&lt;/math&gt; tells us that the line of symmetry is at &lt;math&gt;x+2=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x = -2&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore the vertex is at &lt;math&gt;(-2,-6)&lt;/math&gt;, and if you look at the graph, you can see that is the case.

===The quadratic formula===
The quadratic formula is derived from the general case of completing the square:

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be used to find the roots of a quadratic by putting numbers directly into it. For example, for &lt;math&gt;y=2x^2 + 8x + 2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{64-16}}{4} = -2 \pm \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;

so &lt;math&gt; x = -2 + \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = -2 - \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;. The factors of the equation are &lt;math&gt; x + 2 - \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x + 2 + \sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here is the way that the quadratic formula is derived from the completing the square formula.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
! Step
! Action
! Example
! General case
|-
! 1.
| To solve an equation in the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c=0&lt;/math&gt; first complete the square using the method above.
| &lt;math&gt;2(x + 2)^2 - 6=0&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 -\frac{b^2}{4a} + c=0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 2.
| Isolate the &lt;math&gt;(x + k)^2&lt;/math&gt; term.
| &lt;math&gt;2(x + 2)^2=6&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(x + 2)^2=3&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 =\frac{b^2}{4a} - c&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 =\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 3.
| Square root each side, including a &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; as the bit inside the bracket might be negative or positive.
| &lt;math&gt;x + 2=\pm\sqrt{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|  &lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{c}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Then some simplification:''

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{4a^2} - \frac{4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{\sqrt{4a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x + \frac{b}{2a} =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! 4.
| Isolate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.
| &lt;math&gt;x = \pm\sqrt{3} - 2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \sqrt{3}-2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\sqrt{3}-2&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x \approx -0.268&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-3.73&lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt;x =\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} - \frac{b}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x =\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
====The discriminant====

Notice that the quadratic equation contains &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;/math&gt; inside a square root sign. This part is called '''the discriminant''' and can be considered on its own to determine the number of roots of the equation.

* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; then you will be unable to find the square roots as you don't know how to square root a negative number. The type of numbers you have encountered so far are known as real numbers and so it is said that the quadratic has '''no real roots'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac=0&lt;/math&gt; then changing the &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; sign in front of the square root won't make any difference, because it is zero either way. You will therefore get the same root twice, so it is said the quadratic has '''one repeated root'''.
* If &lt;math&gt;b^2 - 4ac&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; then the &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; will mean you get two answers, and so you can say the quadratic has '''two distinct''' (i.e. different) '''roots'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''When in Rome, do as American tourists do everywhere''' – American proverb

Sometimes etiquette is easily explained to the non-native in a clear set of rules that any decent member of the culture follows. For example, in Japan it is considered impolite to show the soles of one’s shoes toward another person. However, sometimes the rules are not clear, and the polite person has to improvise to figure out the most polite thing to do. An example of this might be when the elder President Bush ducked below the table before vomiting at a state dinner. No book about culture or etiquette would have prepared him for that one, although now all American presidents place a strategically sited bowl beneath their chair at official events.

That said, the following is a simple explanation of the basic points of American Business Etiquette. This is a tool aimed at helping you do as Americans do when working with them on their own soil, over the telephone or even by email. 


== Work comes first ==
Americans and businessmen and women in particular are very task-oriented. They get a goal in mind and work until achieving it. An American is likely to avoid chit-chat as idle chatter and in a business meeting want to talk about business and little else. “Let’s get our focus on the bottom line” is an Americanism that reflects this tendency. Therefore be careful to not distract the conversation from the business at hand. Direct your comments towards identifying, and especially, solving problems. The people will feel more confidence in you when they feel that you are putting your heart behind the project at hand, whatever it may be. A big part of Americans’ lives revolve closely around their work, and although they may politely complain about it, the truth is that they like it like that. Americans do love to have fun, but it has its place, and that place should not interfere with work or a man (or woman) earning his (or her) livelihood.

== Be very clear in what you say ==
Something that will madden your American partners is if they think that you beat around the bush in what you say. US culture values a person who says what he means and means what he says. &quot;Get to the point!&quot;, angry teammates may demand. Americans value clarity many times over what other cultures view as tact. It is better to lay everything out on the table, and not leave key points unmentioned for politeness’ sake. Not following this policy could be interpreted as rudeness or as gravely as dishonesty by your peers.

== Honesty is the best policy ==
Related to the previous point, you will do well to avoid any kind of dishonesty in word or deed with your American partners. Do not suggest bribes, kickbacks, any other kind of illegal or unlawful payoffs, or anything else that goes against the law of the US or wherever it is that you are. Play by the rules. In the US, people get ahead while respecting the rules of the game. It has been said many times that, unlike other places, in the US it is easier to make money following the law than by breaking it, although this does not necessarily apply to US corporations operating abroad. Americans realize that if you are dishonest with the government or with anyone else, you are a dishonest person and will probably be dishonest with everyone or anyone that you work with, and are not to be trusted. That is, unless you are in a completely powerless situation where your every move can be controlled and all risk can be eliminated. But you don’t want to be in that situation, do you?

== Logic rules over emotion ==
One of the worst things that you can do is appear emotional, or unable to make a cold, hard decision. It’s OK to get angry, and show it, about certain things, especially things that affect the bottom line. Don’t change your mind a lot of times if you don’t want to exasperate your coworkers.

== Respect the old guys ==
First off, don’t call them old guys. At least not to their faces. The senior partners at the firm have worked a long time to get there and although American entertainment may make fun of older citizens as worn-out or useless, the business world certainly does not treat them that way. They are to be respected as the wisest and most seasoned individuals on the team, which they likely are. When dealing with them, speak to them and otherwise treat them with respect. Depending on the culture of the corporation, this may mean not to speak with them at all. Allow them to speak to you if they want something, otherwise it may be a good idea to not speak to them at all. A special note: if the executive is concerned about his advancing age and wants to be seen as younger than he really is, it may be better to speak to him more casually. In most cases, avoid using slang because it magnifies the difference between the generations and it may make the exec feel old or out of place, or worse yet, he may not even understand you.   


== New values: women are equal players ==
In US law, women are granted equal rights with men.  Business women expect to be treated with the same respect as their male counterparts. They are considered to be equal to men in character and ability. Their gender is considered to be irrelevant in business settings.  

It is absolutely inappropriate to make any sexual advances, make suggestive comments, or try to get them to go out for personal time not related to work. Do not treat them like secretaries unless, in fact, they are a secretary.  Treat them with the same consideration as you would treat any co-worker. 

Unfortunately, gender equality has not yet been fulfilled in the workplace.  On average, women earn about twenty percent less than men for the same work, and are many are still held down in pay and position by an unofficial upper limit called the glass ceiling.  Women have been gradually breaking through this glass ceiling, and are increasingly holding senior management and board positions within corporations.

== Businessmen and sports ==
A lot of business persons were athletes in high school and college. There are many things that are similar between team sports and business activities, and both attract many of the same people. It is a good idea to become familiar with the basics of baseball, football, and basketball at least in order to make semi-intelligent sports-related small talk. Beyond small talk, business talk is filled with sports-related idioms. These are used so comfortably in American speech that the speaker probably will not even realize that he is using them. 


== Taboos: don’t go there ==
The two main subjects that Americans agree not to discuss much in polite conversation are 1: politics and 2: religion. That is because they are areas where people have deep-rooted beliefs that are not easily changed, and there is a great potential for misunderstanding or hurt feelings, besides the fact that outside of church or a political rally, many people view them as unrelated to the whatever task you have on your plate at the time. 

Besides this, avoid criticizing the US, US culture, Americans in general or US policy, unless they have recently invaded your country. Americans for the most part deeply love their country and may be offended and confused by comments that do not reflect a similar love and respect, and may take the comments personally. However, there is also a great diversity in their view of themselves; therefore do not expect them all to respond in the same way.

== Topics to talk about ==
There are certain topics that are common to talk about in casual business situations. Feel free to talk about the rich, sports, entertainment like movies, music, celebrities and books, and current events or business trends. Try to keep things general and not too personal. Nobody wants to know about your grandmother or problems with your spouse. When in doubt, talk business.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Lesson==
Schoolchildren, also called school kids, do homework. They do not like it. At least, they say that they do not like it. Homework is assignments that children do outside of class. However, sometimes students have time in class to do their homework. When a teacher gives an assignment to do during class it is called class work. Both homework and class work are types of schoolwork. 

Sometimes students answer questions in a textbook. 

: Teacher: Class, please turn your books to page seventy-one and do questions one through ten. If you don’t finish it is homework due tomorrow.
: Teacher: Open your books to chapter three and do every other question on page forty-five. Turn them in on my desk at the end of class. 

Other times, homework is doing research and writing a report about something.

: Teacher: Your assignment will be a report about the causes of the US Civil War. It should be ten pages long, typed and double-spaced. Please include a bibliography of at least ten cited works. You may use the Internet. Please look up information in at least three books from the school library. Do not make more than three references to encyclopedias. 

Students sometimes do homework together in groups. They call these groups study groups. This is part of the student’s sense of humor. This is because many American students prefer to socialize, or talk to their friends, than to do any work. Boys may tend to joke around while girls prefer to gossip about other girls. 

Students in all levels of school may have to do homework. However, younger students usually have to do less homework than older students. In high school, some students may have to do several hours of homework a night. 
Students may do their homework at home or in a library. Another place where kids can work on their homework is in study hall. Study hall is an open period of the day. Students can use study hall to read, do homework, maybe talk with their friends, or make trouble. 

Students sometimes complain that homework is boring. Other assignments are more interesting. Homework is hard if it makes you think a lot, and easy if it doesn’t make you think much. Americans call things that are easy “a piece of cake”. When a student finishes his or her homework he or she might like to relax for a while, go outside or watch some TV. 
	
Other homework assignments may be a reading, math problems, an art project, or filling in answers in a worksheet.

As SamSam said about his categorization and filtering suggestion, I have concerns about the cookbook's scalability. From my experience using public recipe sites, I have found that the more recipes they accumulate, the less useful they become. Even with a robust categorization system, the duplicate recipes make it very hard to research what you want to make. Although it may be some work, I suggest that we implement a rating and feedback system as I find this greatly increases a site's usefulness. This idea was inspired by VegWeb (http://vegweb.com), which is a public recipe site that is a pleasure to peruse as compared with other sites such as cooks.com that (http://www.cooks.com) seem sterile due to the lack of public feedback. An open feedback forum on the recipe page is vital for the testing of the recipes and for the opening of dialogue that is so much a part of the creative process of cooking. Variations of recipes can be posted here and a rating system can be implemented for the feedback entries to prioritize entries that people found most useful/informative and to highlight variations on recipes that are most popular. This system should be on the front end and easily accessible to the public, thus not in any way restricted to active builders of the book's content. This would be an excellent way of dealing with the philosophical issue raised by Snowspinner (above) about open-ended vs fixed recipes. I am an advocate for the open-ended approach, but a recipe can get too overwhelming with too much information at once. The original author of a recipe should still be allowed to put in as much extra information as they would like such as variations, cooking techniques, ingredient information, etc. However, a feedback system would be an indispensable way of building this extra information that everyone can learn from.

I've been navigating around Cookbook and I find it is not scalable.
Recipe lists will get (I expect) too long to display on a single page and navigating just by one category or alphabetically just wont do it. Mantaining these lists is just not a requisite and recipes could just be hanging there.

As a [http://sourceforge.net Sourceforge] and [http://freshmeat.net Freshmeat] user, I found their way of browsing much more easy.
A project has specific attributes and you can browse/filter by them. You don't have to add it to the different indexes, it is just there.

A recipe could have specific attributes like ingredients, time to cook, region, type of food, calories, etc.
With an automatic indexing system, it would be automatically linked on every category under the attribute specified.
This would avoid mantainance time of index pages and maximize search capabilities.

Searching would by as easy as browsing by region (for example, Asian --&gt; Chinese --&gt; Cantonese) and filtering by ingredient (for example, all that have the ingredient Rice and doesn't have Tuna) and by time to cook (for example, less than 30 minutes).

I don't know if wikimedia can do it, but it would be really cool.

: Its being worked on in the form of Metadata for not just the cookbook but for Mediawiki sites in general.  It was discussed at Wikimania 2005 but I'm not sure how far it has come.  For now, try to follow a standard way of identifing these attributes, as it will make the eventual conversion easier.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called TheTRUTH. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name TheTRUTH~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== About this Book ==

This wiki is in no way endorsed or a stem from the International Baccalaureate Organisation. It is, however, the result of particular lack of a solid textbook for the new 2014 course. These pages are, furthermore, derived from notes and knowledge of a student taking the course. This wiki will, hopefully, act as a course companion. You may find the [[/Definitions|Definitions]] page useful for revision.

=== Syllabus ===

The [http://www.eastiron.org/eistaff/Uploads/110/Computer_Science_-_1st_exams_2014.pdf syllabus] is an ideal document that should be referred to on a regular basis, whilst reading this wiki or not. It provides extensive details regarding what should be learnt rather than the content itself, as this wiki hopes to provide the end to that need. Therefore, each objective has been specified above the content that it is associated with. For example:

{{IB/Criterion|X.Y.Z|Assessment statement that the candidate must fulfil}}

The example aforementioned is self explanatory, however, the '''X.Y.Z''' refers to the topic, sub-topic and objective, respectively.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Jm51. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Jm51~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

After covering basic material of '''propositional logic''' and '''first-order logic''', the course presents the foundations of '''finite model theory''' and '''descriptive complexity'''. Other topics, including '''logic programming''', '''non-monotonic reasoning''', '''temporal logic''', and '''reasoning about knowledge and belief''', are surveyed as time allows. These notes were taken by student scribes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Propositional Logic==
Propositional logic is a good vehicle to introduce basic properties of logic. It does not provide means to determine the validity (truth or false) of atomic statements. Instead, it allows you to evaluate the validity of compound statements given the validity of its atomic components.

For example, consider the following:
:I like Pat or I like Joe.
:If I like Pat then I like Joe.
:Do I like Joe?
Accept as facts the first two statements, noting that the use of &quot;or&quot; here is not exclusive and thus could really be thought of as saying &quot;I like Pat, or I like Joe, or I like them both&quot;. Do these statements imply that &quot;I like Joe&quot; is true? Try to convince yourself that &quot;I like Joe&quot; is true, and consider another line of reasoning:
:Pigs can fly or fish can sing.
:If pigs can fly then fish can sing.
:Can fish sing?
We can see that the answer is ''yes'' in both cases. The above two sets of statements can be both abstracted as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;P \vee Q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q &lt;/math&gt;?
Here, we are concerned about the logical reasoning itself, and not the statements. Thus, instead of working with pigs or Pats, we simply write &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;s or &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;s. We begin our study first with the syntax of propositional logic: that is, we describe the elements in our language of logic and how they are written. We then describe the semantics of these symbols: that is, what the symbols mean.

===Syntax===
The syntax of propositional logic is composed of propositional symbols, logical connectives, and parenthesis. Rules govern how these elements can be written together. First, we treat propositional symbols merely as a set of some symbols, for our purposes we'll use letters of the Roman and Greek alphabets, and refer to the set of all symbols as &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt;:
:'''Propositional symbols''': A set &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt; of some symbols. For example &lt;math&gt;p, q, r, \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
Second, we have the logical connectives:
:'''Logical connectives''': &lt;math&gt;\wedge, \vee, \neg, \to&lt;/math&gt;
Note that these are not the minimal required set; they can be equivalently represented only using the single connective NOR (not-or) or NAND (not-and) as is used at the lowest level in computer hardware.
Finally, we use parenthesis to denote expressions (later on we make parenthesis optional):
:'''Parentheses''': &lt;math&gt;(, )&lt;/math&gt;
An '''expression''' is a string of propositional symbols, parenthesis, and logical connectives.

The expressions we consider are called '''formulas'''. The set &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt; of formulas is the smallest set of expressions such that:
#&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}\subseteq\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;
#If &lt;math&gt;\phi, \psi \in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt; then
##&lt;math&gt;(\phi \wedge \psi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;,
##&lt;math&gt;(\phi \vee \psi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;,
##&lt;math&gt;(\phi \to \psi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;, and
##&lt;math&gt;(\neg \phi)\in\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to define formulas is as the language defined by the
following context-free grammar (with start symbol &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form}&lt;/math&gt;):
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow \textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\textrm{Prop}&lt;/math&gt; stands for any propositional symbol
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\textrm{Form}\wedge \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\textrm{Form}\vee \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\textrm{Form}\to \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{Form} \Rightarrow (\neg \textrm{Form})&lt;/math&gt;

'''Fact 1 (Unique Readability)''': The above context free grammar is unambiguous.

===Semantics===
The function of a formula is to create meanings of statements given meanings of atomic statements. The semantics of a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; with propositional symbols &lt;math&gt;p_1,\ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping associating to each truth assignment &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;p_1,\ldots, p_n&lt;/math&gt; a truth value (0 or 1) for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. (The truth values ''true'' and ''false'' can be used instead of 1 or 0, respectively, as well as the abbreviations ''T'' and ''F''.)

The semantics are well defined due to Fact 1 (seen just above).

One way to specify semantics of a logical connective is via a truth table:
:{| border=&quot;1&quot;
!&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;p \wedge q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|0 || 0 || 0
|- 
|0 || 1 || 0
|-
|1 || 0 || 0
|-
|1 || 1 || 1
|}

Can one always find a formula that implements any given semantics? Yes, any truth table is realized by a formula. The formula can be found as follows. &quot;Represent&quot; the rows where &lt;math&gt;\phi=1&lt;/math&gt; with conjunctions of the true proposition symbols and negations of the false ones. Finally write the disjunction of the results.

For example,
:{| border=&quot;1&quot;
!&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; !! Conjunctions (true values only)
|-
|0 || 0 || 1 || &lt;math&gt;\neg p \wedge \neg q&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|0 || 1 || 0 ||
|- 
|1 || 0 || 1 || &lt;math&gt;p \wedge \neg q&lt;/math&gt;
|- 
|1 || 1 || 0 ||
|}

&lt;math&gt;\phi: (p \wedge \neg q)\vee (\neg p \wedge \neg q)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Corollary''': Every formula is equivalent to a disjunction of conjunctions of propositional symbols or negation of propositional symbols ([[w:Disjunctive_normal_form|DNF]]).

Dual of DNF is [[w:Conjunctive_normal_form|CNF]]. 

To get &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in CNF:
#Describe cases when &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is false.
#Note that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true when &lt;math&gt;\neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; is false. Hence, negate &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; using [[w:De_Morgan's_laws|DeMorgan's laws]].

There are cases when DNF (resp. CNF) is exponentially larger than the original formula. For example, for &lt;math&gt;(x_1\vee y_1)\wedge (x_2\vee y_2)\wedge ...\wedge (x_n\vee y_n)&lt;/math&gt; the equivalent DNF is exponential in size.

Does each truth table have a polynomial size formula implementing it? More precisely, does there exist &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that every truth table with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; propositional symbols has a form &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt;\leq n^k&lt;/math&gt;? Answer: no.

'''Proof''': Assume there exists such &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. The number of truth tables for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; propositional symbols is &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;.
The number of formulas of size &lt;math&gt;\leq n^k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(n+6)^{n^k}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; propositional symbols, 4 connectives and parentheses.) 
Clearly, &lt;math&gt;(n+6)^{n^k} &lt; 2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

[TODO: exposition to explain what these definitions are and provide their context]

* '''Satisfaction''': Satisfaction of a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; by a truth assignment &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Notation: &lt;math&gt;\tau \models \phi&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is true for &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;).
* '''Implication''': A set of formulas &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Notation: &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every truth assignment that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; also satisfies &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

===Formula Classes of Special Interest===
*&lt;math&gt;\textrm{VALID}&lt;/math&gt; - the set of formulas that are always true (also known as '''tautologies'''). For example, &lt;math&gt;(p \vee \neg p),(p \to p),(((p \vee q) \wedge (p \to q)) \to q) &lt;/math&gt; are valid formulas.
*&lt;math&gt;\textrm{UNSAT}&lt;/math&gt; - the set of formulas that are never true (unsatisfiable).
*In between: &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt; - the set of formulas for which there exists a satisfying assignment (not unsatisfiable).

Note. &lt;math&gt;\phi\in \textrm{VALID} \iff \neg \phi \in \textrm{UNSAT}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \phi \iff (\Sigma \cup \{\neg \phi\}) \in \textrm{UNSAT}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete.

'''Proof''':
*&lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT} \in \textrm{NP}&lt;/math&gt;: guess a satisfying assignment, then verify that the formula is true (a satisfying assignment is a certificate).
*Hardness.  graph 3-coloring &lt;math&gt;\in\textrm{NP}&lt;/math&gt; (there also exists a direct proof). We reduce 3-coloring to &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be a graph with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots, n\}&lt;/math&gt;. We use propositional variables &lt;math&gt;p_{i,g}, p_{i,r}, p_{i,b}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is colored with green, red, or blue. Construct &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \mathop{\bigwedge}_{i=1}^n ((p_{i,g} \wedge \neg p_{i,r} \wedge \neg p_{i,b})\vee (p_{i,r} \wedge \neg p_{i,g} \wedge \neg p_{i,b})\vee (p_{i,b} \wedge \neg p_{i,r} \wedge \neg p_{i,g}))&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;\wedge\mathop{\bigwedge}_{(i,j\in E)} \neg (p_{i,g} \wedge p_{j,g})\wedge \neg (p_{i,r} \wedge p_{j,r})\wedge \neg (p_{i,b} \wedge p_{j,b})&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;G\in \textrm{3-Coloring} \iff  \phi \in \textrm{SAT}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is also possible to prove that &lt;math&gt;\textrm{SAT} \in \textrm{NP}&lt;/math&gt; directly 

'''Claim''': &lt;math&gt;\textrm{VALID} \in \textrm{coNP}&lt;/math&gt;.

====Horn Clauses====
Special case for which SAT is in polynomial time. Example:

:&lt;math&gt;(p \vee \neg q \vee r) \wedge (\neg p \vee q \vee \neg r)&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Horn clause''' is a disjunction of literals of which at most one is positive. There are two kinds of possible Horn clauses:
#clause has 1 positive literal
##&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, or
##&lt;math&gt;p \vee \neg x_1 \vee\ldots \vee \neg x_k : x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k \rightarrow p&lt;/math&gt;
#no positive literal
##&lt;math&gt;\neg x_1 \vee ... \vee \neg x_k : \neg (x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k)&lt;/math&gt;
##&lt;math&gt;x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k \rightarrow false&lt;/math&gt;

'''Claim''': For every set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of Horn formulas, checking whether &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable is in &lt;math&gt;\textrm{P}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof Idea''': Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; be the subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; containing only clauses of type 1, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; the subset of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; containing clauses of type 2. Note first that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. To obtain a minimum satisfying assignment &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, start with literals from single-literal clauses and crank the rules. It now remains to check consistency of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; with the clauses in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, it is enough to check that for each clause &lt;math&gt;x_1 \wedge ... \wedge x_k \rightarrow false&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is not true for all of &lt;math&gt;x_1, \ldots, x_k&lt;/math&gt;.  

'''Example''': Consider the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of Horn clauses:
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg p \vee \neg q \vee s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg s \vee \neg r \vee t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\neg t&lt;/math&gt;
The set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; of clauses of type 1 consists of the first 5 clauses, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; consists of  the last clause. Note that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; can also be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p \wedge  q \rightarrow s&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s \wedge r \rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;
The minimum satisfying assignment for &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is obtained as follows:
# start with &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r\}&lt;/math&gt;
# use the first implication to infer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
# use the second implication to infer &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the minimum satisfying assignment makes &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,r,s,t\}&lt;/math&gt; true. This contradicts &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt;, which states that &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; must be false. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is not satisfiable.

===Deductive Systems===
A '''deductive''' system is a mechanism for proving new statements from given statements.

Let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; be a set of known valid statements (propositional formulas). In a deductive system, there are two components: inference rules and proofs.

;Inference rules
:An inference rule indicates that if certain set of statements (formulas) &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_k&lt;/math&gt; is true, then a given statement &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; must be true.  An inference rule &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is denoted as &lt;math&gt;H: \frac{\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_k}{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;.
:Example (modus ponens): &lt;math&gt;\frac{p,~~ p \rightarrow q}{q}&lt;/math&gt;
;Proofs : A proof of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is sequence of formulas &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, ..., \varphi_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n=\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;
:* Each formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i \in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, or
:* There are a subset of formulas &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{i_1}, ..., \varphi_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;i_1,\ldots,i_k&lt;i&lt;/math&gt;, such that, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi_{i_1},\ldots, \varphi_{i_k}}{\varphi_i}&lt;/math&gt; is an inference rule.
If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a proof from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; using inference rule &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; we write &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Properties'':
* '''Soundness''': If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., all provable sentences are true). This property is fundamental for the correctness of the deductive system.
* '''Completeness''': If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., all true sentences are provable). This is a desirable property in deductive systems.

===Natural Deduction===
Natural deduction is a collection of inference rules. Let &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; denote contradiction, falsity. The following are the inference rules of natural deduction:

# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi,\psi}{\varphi \wedge \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi \wedge \psi}{\varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi \wedge \psi}{\psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi,\varphi\rightarrow \psi}{\psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi,\neg \varphi}{\perp}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\neg \neg \varphi}{\varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\perp}{\varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi\rightarrow \psi,\psi\rightarrow \varphi}{\varphi\leftrightarrow \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi\leftrightarrow \psi}{\varphi\rightarrow \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi\leftrightarrow \psi}{\psi\rightarrow \varphi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\varphi}{\varphi\vee \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\psi}{\varphi\vee \psi}\right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \varphi \\ \vdots \\\psi\end{matrix}}{\varphi\rightarrow \psi} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \varphi \\ \vdots \\ \perp\end{matrix}}{\neg\varphi} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \neg\varphi \\ \vdots \\ \perp\end{matrix}}{\varphi} \right.&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\left\{\frac{\begin{matrix} \varphi \vee \psi  &amp; \varphi &amp; \psi \\ &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ &amp; \rho &amp; \rho\end{matrix}}{\rho} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

Rule (13) allows us to prove valid statements of the form &quot;If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;&quot; even if we don't know the truth value of the &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; statement (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is not in the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of known valid statements). Indeed, for this rule, we start assuming &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid. If we can conclude &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is valid in a world where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\cup\varphi&lt;/math&gt; are valid, then we conclude that the relation &lt;math&gt;\varphi \rightarrow \psi&lt;/math&gt; is true, and we &quot;release&quot; the assumption &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.

We now show how to apply the above inference rules.

Example: De Morgan's Law for negated or-expressions says:
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) \leftrightarrow (\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof''': By rule &lt;math&gt;(8)&lt;/math&gt; if we can prove &lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) \rightarrow (\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi) \rightarrow \neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt; we can infer the desired result.

To prove the first direction, we use rule 13 and assume the hypothesis &lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) &lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \vee \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 11)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp  &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
::&lt;math&gt;\psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \vee \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 11)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi &lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 1)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi) \rightarrow (\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi)&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''

We now prove the second direction. 
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \varphi&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 2)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 3)''
::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \vee \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;\varphi \psi&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;\perp \perp&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;''(by rule 16)''
:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
:&lt;math&gt;(\neg \varphi \wedge \neg \psi) \rightarrow \neg (\varphi \vee \psi)&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''

Proof of Pierce's Law:
:&lt;math&gt;((A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow A) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;(A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed) (1*)''
::&lt;math&gt;\neg A&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''(assumed)''
:::&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:::&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 7)''
::&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''
::&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''(by assumption (1*) and rule 4)''
::&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 5)''
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 14)''
:&lt;math&gt;( ( A \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow A ) \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; ''(by rule 13)''

'''Fact 2''': Natural deduction is sound.

To show that natural deduction is also complete we need to introduce propositional resolution.

===Propositional Resolution===
Resolution is another procedure for checking validity of statements. It involves '''clauses''', '''formulas''' and a single '''resolution''' rule.

Some terminology:
;Clause 
:A clause is a propositional formula composed by disjunction of literals. For example &lt;math&gt;p \lor q \lor \lnot r&lt;/math&gt;. It is usually denoted as the set of literals, e.g. &lt;math&gt;\{p,q,\lnot r\}&lt;/math&gt;.
:The empty clause, denoted as an open box &quot;&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, is the disjunction of no literals. It is always false.
;Formula 
:A set of clauses, each of them satisfiable. For example, &lt;math&gt;\{\{p,\lnot q\},\{r\},\{\lnot r, s\}\}&lt;/math&gt; represents the CNF formula &lt;math&gt;(p \lor\lnot q)\land (r)\land (\lnot r \lor s)&lt;/math&gt;.
:The empty formula, denoted as &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, is the set that contains no clauses. It is always true.
;Resolution Rule 
:It is a rule that, given two clauses &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; (containing some literal &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; (containing some literal &lt;math&gt;\lnot y&lt;/math&gt;), allows to infer a new clause, called the '''resolvent''' of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; (with respect to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;).

A proof system for resolution contains a single resolution rule, where the resolvent is defined as follows. Assume &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; are clauses such that &lt;math&gt;y\in C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot y\in C'&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;res_{y}(C,C') = (C-\{y\})\cup (C'-\{\lnot y\})&lt;/math&gt;.

The smallest set of clauses containing &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and closed under resolution is denoted &lt;math&gt;Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example''': If &lt;math&gt;C=\{p,y\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'=\{q,\lnot y\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;res_y(C,C') = \{p,q\}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is possible to show that the resolution rule, as defined, computes a clause that can be inferred using natural deduction.

'''Claim''': Let &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; be any two clauses such that &lt;math&gt;y\in C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot y\in C'&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;C\land C' \implies res_y(C,C')&lt;/math&gt;.

In order to prove the validity of a statement &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, we will prove the ''negated'' statement &lt;math&gt;\lnot \psi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable. To prove unsatisfiability of a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, we need to define the '''resolution refutation''' of the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;:

The resolution refutation tree of the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a tree rooted at the empty clause, where every leaf is a clause in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and each internal node is computed as the resolvent of the two corresponding children. 

Notice that clauses of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can appear repeated as leaves. From above claim we can conclude that:

'''Claim''': If there exists a resolution refutation tree for formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \Box&lt;/math&gt;, that is, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable.

'''Example''': The formula
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = (p\lor q)\land (\lnot q\lor r)\land (\lnot r)\land (\lnot p \lor \lnot s)\land (s\lor \lnot t) \land (t)&lt;/math&gt;
has the following resolution refutation tree:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:CompSciLogicRefTree1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The order in which clauses are selected to compute the resolvent matters when computing the resolution refutation tree, as the following example shows: Consider the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\psi = (p\lor q)\land (\lnot q\lor r)\land (\lnot p)\land (\lnot q)&lt;/math&gt;.
Even though a resolution refutation tree may exist for &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, order is important when trying to build the tree. Below are two different resolution refutation trees, but only one is successful:

[[Image:CompSciLogicUnsuccessfulTre.png|frame|none|Unsuccessful attempt of resolution refutation tree for &amp;psi;.]]
[[Image:CompSciLogicSuccessfulTree.png|frame|none|A successful resolution refutation tree for &amp;psi;.]]

===Properties of Propositional Resolution===
'''Soundness''': Propositional resolution is sound, that is, if there exists a resolution refutation tree for a given formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; must be unsatisfiable.

'''Theorem''': For any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \Box&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Completeness''': Propositional resolution is complete, that is, if a given formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable, then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a resolution refutation tree.

'''Theorem''': For any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi \implies \Box&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': By induction on the number of variables in &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Basis'': We have one variable, say &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. All possible clauses of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable then both clauses occur, and therefore &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Induction step'': Suppose the hypothesis is true for formulas with less than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Let &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; be a formula with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\Box \notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;; we will show &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. Let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be a variable of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. Then either &lt;math&gt;\{p\}\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; (if both hold then &lt;math&gt;\Box\in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; immediately).

Assume &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;. We define the formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; as containing all clauses that do not contain &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; and where the literal &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt; has been removed from each clause (in other words, &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the formula resulting from setting &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; true).

Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^p = \{C-\{\lnot p\} : C\in \varphi,\,p\notin C\}&lt;/math&gt;.
First, notice that
:&lt;math&gt;Res(\varphi^p) = \{C-\{\lnot p\} : C\in Res(\varphi),\,p\notin C\}&lt;/math&gt;
and thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\}\notin Res(\varphi^p)&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, since &lt;math&gt;\Box\notin Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; we have that &lt;math&gt;\Box\notin Res(\varphi^p)&lt;/math&gt;. By the induction hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable. Then &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is satisfiable by an extension of the satisfying assignment of &lt;math&gt;\varphi^p&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; equal true. The case &lt;math&gt;\{p\}\in Res(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is analogous.

===Completeness of Natural Deduction===
'''Theorem''': Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be the set of inference rules of Natural Deduction. If &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \models \varphi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\Sigma \vdash_H \varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

The idea behind the proof of completeness of natural deduction is as follows. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid (then &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable). We then show there exists a resolution refutation for &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and then by applying the contradiction rule (rule 15):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\begin{matrix}\neg \varphi\\\vdots\\\perp\end{matrix}}{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;
we conclude &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be inferred.

'''Proof''': (Sketch) Given a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; valid under &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, we perform the following steps:
#Prove that &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to some &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is in CNF.
#Prove that &lt;math&gt;\psi \implies Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;.
#By completeness of resolution, if &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is unsatisfiable then &lt;math&gt;\Box \in Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\lnot p\} \in Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; for some literal &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. This implies &lt;math&gt;Res(\psi)\implies \bot&lt;/math&gt;.
#Conclude that &lt;math&gt;\lnot \varphi \implies \bot&lt;/math&gt; and therefore &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is valid.
  
Step (1) can be easily done by repeated application of De Morgan's laws. Step (2) can be proven using natural deduction. Finally, step (3) can be proven by induction on the number of steps to obtain &lt;math&gt;Res(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, each step can be simulated using natural deduction.
 
It is very likely that any algorithm for propositional resolution will take very long on the worst case (recall that checking validity of a formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is co-NP complete).

===Linear Resolution and PROLOG===
Linear resolution is a particular resolution strategy that always resolves the most recent resolvent with a clause. The resolution refutation tree so obtained is therefore linear. It is possible to prove that, if the set of clauses are Horn clauses, there exists a linear resolution strategy for any formula. That is, linear resolution is complete for the set of Horn clauses.

The language PROLOG uses resolution on a set of Horn clauses. Each clause is called a '''program clause'''. Moreover, clauses composed by a single literal are called '''facts'''. 
A clause with a single negated literal is called a '''query'''. The table below shows a comparison of the different notations. In PROLOG, to query a statement &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, the idea is to negate the statement (&lt;math&gt;\lnot t&lt;/math&gt;) and to perform resolution with the set of known true statements. If a resolution refutation tree is found, the statement &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is implied by the program.

[[Image:CompSciLogicPrologTab.png]]

'''Example''': An example of linear resolution for the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = (p)\land (q)\land (r)\land (t\lor \lnot s \lor \lnot r)\land (s \lor \lnot p \lor \lnot q)\land (\lnot t)&lt;/math&gt;

Outdoor cooking takes many forms; from basic cooking over a simple camp-fire to gourmet meals prepared on equipment that rivals that found in modern kitchens.  Wood, charcoal, propane gas or piped in natural gas may fuel the cooking devices.  This is clearly a type of cooking with many variations.

*[[Cookbook:Camp Cooking|Camp Cooking]]

*[[Cookbook:Backyard Grilling|Backyard Grilling]]
*[[Cookbook:Backyard Deep-Fry|Backyard Deep-Fry]] (think deep-fried turkey.)

==General Rules for Outdoor Food Safety==

Plan ahead: decide what you are going to eat and how you are going to cook it; then plan what equipment you will need.

* Pack safely: use a cooler if car-camping or boating, or pack foods in the frozen state with a cold source if hiking or backpacking. Keep raw foods separate from other foods. Never bring meat or poultry products without a cold source to keep them safe.
* Bring disposable wipes or biodegradable soap for hand- and dishwashing.
* Plan on carrying bottled water for drinking. Otherwise, boil water or use water purification tablets.
* Do not leave trash in the wild or throw it off your boat.
* If using a cooler, leftover food is safe only if the cooler still has ice in it. Otherwise, discard leftover food.
* Whether in the wild or on the high seas, protect yourself and your family by washing your hands before and after handling food.</text>

      <comment>/* Pitch classification */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Japanese uses '''pitch accent''', where every mora can either be pronounced with a high or low pitch. Not all dictionaries will indicate this, but pitch accent is certainly important, because it can make the difference between different words. 

For example, using '''bold''' for high pitches:

'''い'''ま (今) - &quot;now&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
い'''ま''' (居間) - &quot;living room&quot;

Pitch is, however, to some extent a characteristic of regional accents, so a Kanto speaker may be using the opposite pitches to a Kansai speaker. Where pitch is taught, it will be standard Japanese (essentially the Tokyo dialect). Pitchless Japanese is easily understood by native speakers and incorrect pitch will at most sound somewhat odd. Studying pitch, therefore, isn't essential to the learning Japanese and is perhaps best picked up by conversing with native speakers.

Linguists, however, tend to classify Japanese as having a falling pitch following what is considered the stressed vowel.

== Pitch classification ==
When dictionaries give pitch accent, they'll usually indicate it with a number. The number tells you the mora where the '''last high pitch''' is. To figure out the pitch pattern, put a low onto the first mora (unless the last high pitch is on that mora), put high pitches onto all the mora that follows, until you hit the last high pitch. After that, put low pitches.

Even more helpful dictionaries will do all of this work for you, by telling you exactly where all the pitches rise or fall.

So, to give some examples.

Notice how と'''もだち''' (0) and お'''とうと''' (4) look as if they have the same pitch pattern even though they don't? The difference is clear if you add a grammatical pattern like -は after: then we get お'''とうと'''は and と'''もだちは'''.

__NOTOC__

{{Book Search}}

This is a guide to the '''LaTeX''' markup language. It is intended to form a useful resource for everybody from new users who wish to learn, to old hands who need a quick reference.

'''TeX and LaTeX'''

TeX is a computer program for typesetting documents, created by [[w:Donald Knuth|Donald Knuth]]. It takes a suitably prepared computer file and converts it to a form which may be printed on many kinds of printers, including dot-matrix printers, laser printers and high-resolution typesetting machines. LaTeX is a set of macros for TeX that aims at reducing the user's task to the sole role of writing the content, LaTeX taking care of all the formatting process. A number of well-established publishers now use TeX or LaTeX to typeset books and mathematical journals. It is also well appreciated by users caring about typography, consistent formatting, efficient collaborative writing and open formats.

This book is organized into different parts:

* ''Getting Started'' will provide you with the very first steps to print your first document: general  concepts (very important!), software installation, and basic syntax.

* ''Common Elements'' groups all common features you would expect from a document processor, covering fonts, layout, colors, lists, figures and others.

* ''Mechanics''  are some topics that are not really necessary to write a basic document, but could help you understand how some parts of the machinery work. These topics are required for fine tuning documents. Use them as support for various chapters, as they are often being referred to.

* ''Technical Texts'' focuses on different specialized matters, mostly for scientific work.

* ''Special Pages'' is for the structured pages usually put in appendices.

* ''Special Documents'': this part tackles other kind of documents different from the classic article style.

* ''Creating Graphics'' is for the process of ''writing'' graphics from a LaTeX document.

* ''Programming'' or how to create your own macros and packages.

* ''Miscellaneous'' contains everything that does not fit in the previous parts, like project management and other subjects related to LaTeX but not inherent to LaTeX itself.

* ''Help and Recommendations'' : the FAQ encompasses very common pitfalls and important recommendations for everyone, ''we urge you to read it''; the Tips and Tricks are much more specific matters.

* ''Appendices''.

This was a total mess.  After being on here for over 14 months, it was riddled with problems, many of which remain.
*Unit symbols not italicized.
*The units Joule and Newton were improperly capitalized, in situations where they should not be capitalized.
*It incorrectly claimed, not just once but at least twice, that the spring constant ''k'' is &quot;unitless&quot;.
*It included a conversion factor from joules to calories; I don't think there's any crying need to include calories at all, but if you do, give the conversion factor from calories to joules, not the other way.
*Of course, that's what you had--you just had the units screwed up and flipped around.  Actually, a calorie is about 4.18 to 4.19 joules, not a joule equal to 4.18 calories.
*I'm sure there were other things I fixed too, and others yet unfixed even on this short page, but I've vented all I need to now.  [[User:66.97.235.123|66.97.235.123]] 12:42, 19 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Work and Energy merging ==

I think we should merge two articles substantially rewriting the content.&lt;br /&gt;
When '''work''' is defined with '''energy''' while '''energy''' defined by '''work''', it will be better to compose a common  article where to introduce them somehow simultaneously.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pneumatic and hydraulic systems are actuators which provide linear movement. Hydraulic systems, especially, can produce extremely high forces.

===Pneumatic systems===
The Pneumatic Actuator is sometimes called a Pneumatic Ram. The basic Pnuematic Ram consists of 3 main parts. These 3 parts are the ''Cylinder'', ''Piston'' and ''Rod''.

[[Image:Cylinder.jpg|thumb|400px|Dual acting cylinder extending.]]

The ''Cylinder'', which is black in the diagram, is where the process takes place. Most of the cylinders in use for hobby robotics are constructed of stainless steel and depending on the type of ram it will either feature one or two ports for compressed air.

The ''Piston'', marked in green, is similar to one that you would find in a car engine. It essentially provides a surface for the compressed gas to act upon.

The ''Ram'' , marked in blue, is connected to the piston and transfers the force from the piston to the mechanism that needs moving. 

There are several different types of cylinders:
*Single acting cylinder: This cylinder has one input and has a spring. If the pressure is released from the cylinder the spring pushes the piston rod back to its starting position.
*Double acting cylinder. This type of cylinder is moved by pressurizing one side at a time of the piston. (see images below).

====Applications====

Pneumatics are useful for generating linear motion. 
* Movement of a lever in a walker robot design.
* Closing a gripper

====Design Considerations====

The use of Pnuematics requires a supply of compressed gas. For a stationary robot on a production line a compressor could be set up nearby to supply it however this isn't possible for a robot that is on the move. The solution is to have a container that holds compressed air. If lots of compressed air is required the addition of a compressor into the design may be required however bear in mind that a compressor will consume a large amount of power.

====Calculating Output Force====
[[Image:Cylinder_extending.jpg|thumb|300px|Dual acting cylinder extending.]]
[[Image:Cylinder_contracting.jpg|thumb|300px|Dual acting cylinder contracting.]]

The force a cylinder can be expressed as 

:&lt;math&gt; F = \ {p A_{Piston}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

*''F'': Force in Newtons
*''p'': Air pressure in cylinder in Pascals. Pressure can be obtained through use of a Pressure Gauge in the air circuit before the Ram. 
*''A'': Surface area of the piston in square meters.{{ref|Sam1}} This can be obtained from the manufacturers specifications.

=====Notes=====
# {{note|Sam1}} Note: the surface area of the rod side of the piston is smaller than the other side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I've adding some graphics to the robotics book. These are done with Inventor and (most of them) touched up with paintshop pro. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;

==placing graphics on wikipages:==

Since the help page of wikibooks isn't much help yet, here's how I placed those pictures: 

&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
[[Image:Robotics Logo.png|none|thumb|100px|&lt;center&gt;Robotics&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;


&lt;center&gt;
[[Image:Robotics Logo.png|none|thumb|100px|&lt;center&gt;Robotics&lt;/center&gt;]] 
&lt;/center&gt;


The center tags place the picture in the center of the page and prevent from text being placed next to them as this looks wrong.

&quot;robotics logo.png&quot; is the name of the drawing uploaded to wikibooks.

&quot;none&quot; is the orientation. Could be left or right. 

&quot;thumb&quot; I have no idea. I assume this means thumbnail?

&quot;288px&quot; how width the drawing has to be. height is automaticaly calculated to keep the aspected ratio correct.

The rest of the line is the text below the drawing, but still in the picturebox.

Another way is the gallery tag:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;
Image:Scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Flat Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;
Image:Raised scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Raised Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Flat Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Raised scoop.png|&lt;center&gt;Raised Scoop&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Watchlist acting unfair. ==

Watchlists seem to act a little unfair lately. Someone wrote a nice part on IDC connectors which showed up in my watchlist. However when I made a small change to it (changed 2 symbols ('?') that weren't drawn properly in '°' symbols, only my minor edit was left in the watchlist. I wonder if this is normal.

: Noticed this too, I think it's a Wiki mechanism to avoid flooding the watchlist with hundreds of minor edits (if wiki documents each minor edits). I know for one I sometimes had to go back to re-edit my work when I spotted a typo/ format issue, and the watchlist just takes the latest edit as a summary of all the edits in the time span.

== spell checking. ==

I admit I'm not always spell check what I contribute. The main cause is that I write a lot on other peoples computers (this I'm writing on my gf's) and those don't have a spell checker installed in mozilla. &lt;BR&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter focuses on creating and designing a web site using Adobe GoLive


==GoLive Site Wizard==
The GoLive Site Wizard can be used to create anything from empty to template structured to imported web sites.

===How it Works===
The Site Wizard creates a project folder, a project file and three organizational folders to contain the elements of the site.  These folders are the ''web-content'' folder, the ''web-data'' folder and the ''web-settings'' folder.  While these various parts are used to organize and create the site, only the web-content folder is uploaded onto the server when publishing.
:*''project file'' shares the name of your site and uses the .site file extension.  This file is used to manage your site's makeup.
:*''web-content folder'' contains pages, css, images and everything else needed for the published version of the site.
:*''web-data folder'' templates, components and other reusable elements.
:*''web-settings folder'' stores changes made in the Site Settings dialog box.

===Creating a Site=== 
The site creation process for the Mac or PC is identical and the resulting files are interchangeable across operating systems. 

:# File &gt; New Site  
:# Select Single User
:# Select
:#* Blank Site
:#* Import from Folder
:#* Import from Server
:#* Copy from Template
:# Name the site (if applicable)
:# Choose a location for the site files to reside
:# Click Finish

==Organizing a Site== 
Once your site has been created and populated with pages (see next chapter) you must link these pages and their elements together and to their sources to make a coherent and maintainable Web site.

===Linking Pages, Objects and Their Sources===
Once linked, objects will maintain their links even when their sources are moved or renamed so long as these changes occur within the site window.
There are three types of links which can be applied to objects, images, etc.

:* resource links (links in the HTML which locate the objects appearing on the page) 
:* navigational links (links that take a viewer from one page to another or between locations on a page)
:* external links (still technically navigational links, external links refer to any link which opens another page or email)

====resource links====
Do one of the following:
:* Drag the file from the site window and let GoLive create the resource link automatically
:* Manually specify the resource location:
:# Select an object
:# Navigate to the Inspector
:# Change the source file

====navigational links====
:# Select item to house the link
:# If linking an image or object, click the Link tab and then the Create Link button (looks like a chain)
:# Type the destination file in the URL text box.
:# Use the Target menu to select a location for the link to open if you wish it to open in a frame or another window.
:# Enter a title for the link.  The title will appear when the cursor is held over the link.  (This only works in some browsers.)
:# Use the Name/ID menu to select Name &amp; ID.
:# Type a link name on the Name/ID line.


====external links====
Follow steps 1 and 2 in the navigational links section.  When entering the destination file in part 3 include &quot;http://&quot; or &quot;mailto:&quot; before the destination to link to an external location.  Finish as a navigational link.

[[File:Mycomputer.jpg|150px|right]]
Building a computer can be a very rewarding experience. Since you’re reading this, you’re probably thinking about building your next computer instead of buying one pre-built. This is a very viable option these days and can bring many benefits; you can learn a lot about computer hardware by building one, you get a totally personalized computer, you can choose better components and you may be able to save some money and have fun.
   
Additionally, if you are the sort of person who wants to understand how things work, if you take broken stuff apart just to see how it all fits together, if you have a drawer somewhere full of “parts” you think may come in handy someday, then you just may be in the right place.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction - Welcome to the Japanese Wikibook===

Development of this Wikibook began on August 11, 2003. It is an ongoing project that will evolve as users contribute to the content and layout of pages. The end goal of this project is to create an online resource for those wishing to learn Japanese. We will attempt to encompass all aspects of the Japanese language, including pronunciation, reading, writing, and grammar. 

Many textbooks and travel guides make  use of 'rōmaji' (Romanisation of Japanese characters) to bypass the need for learning the Japanese characters. This Wikibook, however, aims to develop a well rounded student, and as such, will make minimal use of 'rōmaji' except in introducing pronunciation.

=== Current work ===

In the first five years, this Wikibook went through several rewrites. Seeing all too few contributors keen on picking up the torch where past editors left off, the book had amassed several layers of rewritten material that did little to provide a clear path through the material. Waking to that reality after [[Talk:Japanese#Wow._This_is_a_mess|considerable discussion]], we came up with the [[Talk:Japanese#Categorisation|categorisation]] scheme now present on the main page. The [[Japanese/Contents]] page does not conform with that scheme as it is more an inventory for editors looking for existing material to work with (be it merging, re-factoring, deleting, or rewriting), rather than an index for learners.

Since June 2008, a good deal of merges and rewrites have been done. As a result we've managed to delete over a hundred pages of unnecessary or duplicate material, navbars, printable versions, and templates. See [[Talk:Japanese#Removal Suggestions|Removal Suggestions]] for deletion proposals and discussions. For pages to be merged, see the [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Books_to_be_merged&amp;from=Japanese Books to be merged] category for a list of pages in this book that have been suggested be merged and [[:Category:Japanese todo]] for pages with specific work to be done.

There hasn't been much discussion lately on the actual content since active editors (currently [[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] and [[User:Swift|Swift]]) have been working on somewhat separate aspects of this book. We have a section on pages on [[Japanese/Contents#Structure/Lesson Plans/Syllabus|structure, lesson plans and syllabus]]. ''[[Talk:Japanese#How much to teach (was: what a mess...)|How much to teach]]'' and ''[[Talk:Japanese#Levels|Levels]]'' might also be of interest for those so inclined. For development of a consistent curriculum see [[User:Retropunk/Japanese Curriculum]] and [[Sugu ni Hajimemashō]].

Finally; every contributor seems to have a different take on the purpose of this book. In your work, remember that learners have vastly different learning styles and diverse approaches to lesson plans will benefit readers and contributors alike. Until we have fully functioning learning paths, the categorisation scheme on the front page will make the existing material accessible to readers while allowing users to contribute without having to conform to a predefined form.

That said; pick your path and be bold.

Hey Andreas, I think you've been doing great work. I just want to &quot;get to know you&quot; for a little bit longer before I cast my &quot;support&quot; vote. In the mean time, you can suggest changes for the main on the talk page; or we can try unprotecting it again. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 06:21, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Thanks! This sounds promising. If adminship can not be granted so quickly, I'd be perfectly happy, if the main page was unprotected again (for doing small changes). Anyway, for the &quot;big&quot; change (I want to reserve at least a quarter of the page for the &quot;book of the month&quot;) I should design this locally first, and if you guys like it, it could also be moved to the main page by one of you... Doesn't have to be me! In the meantime, increase the quality of the vote by [[Wikibooks:Book of the month voting for February 2005|voting]] by yourself! Thanks, --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 07:57, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Main Page ==

Oops, I guess I should have announce the main page isn't protected anymore.  I think the vandal we had has gone.  Hopefully, I'm right. :) [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:25, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: No problem, I already made the changes (see the &quot;Book of the month&quot;). If you like, please vote for your favorite book too. I guess you have far more experience and overview over the books around here than me... --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 00:28, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== he to they ==

Hey mate, great spotting. I should have been more careful with my edits. I guess we could move it to wikisource if you really wanted, but we shouldnt take it off wikibooks, cause the plan is that it will grow and become more the the out-of-copyright book that it is now. Large parts of wikipedia had thier base in a 1908 (?) version of britanica which is now out of copyright. The point was not to put the text of britanica online, but to have it as a starting point to create something bigger and better. [[User:The bellman|The bellman]] 06:50, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Message ==

I left a message on the [[Wikibooks_talk:Top_active/Listing_January_2005]] for you.
: And I just answered there --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 13:33, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Categories ==

How would I go about creating OR requesting categories? [[The Golden Bough]] has some, but those categories do not have any page associated with them. [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 21:36, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Your categories exist, all you had to do, was purge the cache of the Mediawiki software (so that the red links turn blue). I did this by manually entering: http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=The_Golden_Bough&amp;action=purge . By the way, it is not a good idea, to have all sub-pages in the Category as well. It is recommended, only to put the main page of the book into categories.

:: Only the main page will be there. Thanks [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 12:46, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::: OK, I wrote the above before checking. I only added Categories to the main page [[The GOlden Bough]] yet, all sub-pages appear in those categories. Did I miss something? [[User:Ojmorales0002|Ojmorales0002]] 12:48, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:::: No no, look at http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Religion, all pages that are listed here, have the Category link at the bottom of their page. (it is not on all subpages of your book, just on some!) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:03, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)
:::: Was not your fault, EuropracBHIT had added all those Categories, I wrote a note to his talk page. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 16:43, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Spaces in wikipage names ==

I had no idea that wikimedia supported spaces in the names, is there any way that I can add the spaces into the names without losing content or having to copy/paste the whole book? --[[User:Mrnoj|Mrnoj]] 17:25, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

: Hi Mrnoj. Yes, if you are logged in, you have a &quot;move&quot; command on top of each page. With this you can &quot;move&quot; the page to a new name and insert spaces. All history is automatically moved as well, and the old page will become a redirect to the new page. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:47, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)


== Book (of the month) change ==
:That's all right, Andreas. I can imagine you were very busy or didn't have much time, and you didn't do it yourself for that reason.
:Regarding the April award. So pleased that '''US History''' has got it, as of 0:00 UTC yesterday. When are we going to announce it, and who is going to draw/find a picture?
:It's really been close and competitive this month (with an element of tactical voting, if I do say so myself, but no nasty factions!). Imagine, the next three books got 4 each. The Unicyclopedia, How to Build a Computer and the Physics Study Guide, if I recall.

==Dichotomous Key Glossary==
Hey, I'm unsure about glossary formatting, so I thought I'd ask for a second opinion.  Take a look at [[Dichotomous Key:Mammalia]].  Do you think the glossary is better like that (i.e. next to the terms it applies to) or altogether in a box somewhere on the page? [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 21:50, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)
: I like the glossary right next to the terms, that is very useful! I added two formatting commands, to put all glossary to the right on a stack:
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; width:310px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{egg}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{birth}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;*Birth&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;**Eggs - [[Dichotomous Key:Monotremata|Monotremata]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;**Live birth - [[#2|2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
: The last &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br...&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; is needed so that the right floats won`t overlap with the next section. I hope it is not too ugly, some of it might be put into a template...
: Speaking of template, you might think of one template, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{dichotomous glossary|Egg|A zygote, resulting from fertilization of the ovum}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;, so that the glossary terms are also easily editable on the page (otherwise you have to create really a lot of templates, and the likelihood of overlap with other projects on Wikibooks increases..). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 03:43, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks, I'm terrible with wikisyntax!  Can you make the three boxes at the top of the page line-up neatly.  I tried randomly sticking stacks around and got it looking nicer on my monitor, but the righthand box (&quot;adjacent keys&quot;) is still lower than the others and way off to the right.  Regarding combining the glossary into one template, there are definite advantages, but using an individual template (e.g. [[Template:Egg]]) lets you use the same definition on multiple pages (and change it on all pages with only one edit).  It's probably possible to use templates within templates to get the best of both worlds, but that could get messy... [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 06:56, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::: For now, I inserted a break before the &quot;1&quot; section. About the layout of the three boxes... It looks a little bit disorganized with so many boxes floating around. What about having 1 large box on top that is subdivided into the necessary parts? Something along the lines as sketched below: --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 07:43, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)

::::Looks good with combined boxes! [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]]


==World History==
I finally got around to changing (what I hope is) ''every single link and page''.  I used the Book:Chaptertitle hierchy because of a specialized chapter page top which would look funny with the automatic used by Book/Chaptertitle.  Besides, the latter confuses new users anyway.  Hope it helps!--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]]|[[User talk:Naryathegreat|(talk)]] 00:25, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)
: Well done! Thanks a lot. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 12:56, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

I've expanded the page on [[SimCity]] quite dramatically, and given that you have contributed to it in the past, I'm wondering if you have any comments, suggestions, or anything else to contribute to it? [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 15:46, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

==What is TeX?==

'''[[TeX]]''' is a low-level markup and programming language created by [[w:Donald Knuth|Donald Knuth]] to typeset documents attractively and consistently. Knuth started writing the TeX typesetting engine in 1977 to explore the potential of the digital printing equipment that was beginning to infiltrate the publishing industry at that time, especially in the hope that he could reverse the trend of deteriorating typographical quality that he saw affecting his own books and articles. With the release of 8-bit 
character support in 1989, TeX development has been essentially frozen with only bug fixes released periodically. TeX is a programming language in the sense that it supports the if-else construct: you can make calculations with it (that are performed while compiling the document), etc., but you would find it very hard to do anything else but typesetting with it. The fine control TeX offers over document structure and formatting makes it a powerful—and formidable—tool. TeX is renowned for being extremely stable, for running on many different kinds of computers, and for being virtually bug free. The version numbers of TeX are converging toward &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, with a current version number of 3.1415926.  

The name TeX is intended by its developer to be {{IPA|/'tɛx/}}, with the final consonant of ''loch'' or ''Bach''. (Donald E. Knuth, ''The TeXbook'') The letters of the name are meant to represent the capital Greek letters tau, epsilon, and chi, as TeX is an abbreviation of ''τέχνη'' (ΤΕΧΝΗ – technē), Greek for both &quot;art&quot; and &quot;craft&quot;, which is also the root word of ''technical''. English speakers often pronounce it {{IPA|/'tɛk/}}, like the first syllable of ''technical''.

Programming in TeX generally progresses along a very gradual learning curve, requiring a significant investment of time to build custom macros for text formatting. Fortunately, document preparation systems based on TeX, consisting of collections of pre-built macros, do exist. These pre-built macros are time saving, and automate certain repetitive tasks and help reduce user introduced errors; however, this convenience comes at the cost of complete design flexibility. One of the most popular macro packages is called '''LaTeX'''.

==What is LaTeX?==

'''LaTeX''' (pronounced either &quot;Lah-tech&quot; or &quot;Lay-tech&quot;) is a macro package based on TeX created by [[w:Leslie Lamport|Leslie Lamport]]. Its purpose is to simplify TeX typesetting, especially for documents containing mathematical formulae. Within the typesetting system, its name is formatted as {{LaTeX}}.

Many later authors have contributed extensions, called ''packages'' or ''styles'', to LaTeX. Some of these are bundled with most TeX/LaTeX software distributions; more can be found in the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network ([http://www.ctan.org CTAN]).

Since LaTeX comprises a group of [[TeX]] commands, LaTeX document processing is essentially programming. You create a text file in LaTeX markup, which LaTeX reads to produce the final document.

This approach has some disadvantages in comparison with a [[w:WYSIWYG|WYSIWYG]] (What You See Is What You Get) program such as [[w:Openoffice.org|Openoffice.org]] Writer or [[w:Microsoft Word|Microsoft Word]].

In LaTeX:

* You don't (usually) see the final version of the document when editing it.
* You generally need to know the necessary commands for LaTeX markup.
* It can sometimes be difficult to obtain a certain look for the document.

On the other hand, there are certain advantages to the LaTeX approach:

* Document sources can be read with any text editor and understood, unlike the complex binary and [[w:XML|XML]] formats used with WYSIWYG programs.
* You can concentrate purely on the structure and contents of the document, not get caught up with superficial layout issues.
* You don't need to manually adjust fonts, text sizes, line heights, or text flow for readability, as LaTeX takes care of them automatically.
* In LaTeX the document structure is visible to the user, and can be easily copied to another document. In WYSIWYG applications it is often not obvious how a certain formatting was produced, and it might be impossible to copy it directly for use in another document.
* The layout, fonts, tables and so on are consistent throughout the document.
* Mathematical formulae can be easily typeset.
* Indexes, footnotes, citations and references are generated easily.
* Since the document source is plain text, tables, figures, equations, etc. can be generated programmatically with any language.
* You are forced to structure your documents correctly.

The LaTeX document is a plain text file containing the content of the document, with additional markup.  When the source file is processed by the macro package, it can produce documents in several formats. LaTeX natively supports [[w:DVI file format|DVI]] and PDF, but by using other software you can easily create PostScript, PNG, JPEG, etc.

==Philosophy of use==
===Flexibility and modularity===

One of the most frustrating things beginners and even advanced users might encounter using LaTeX is the lack of flexibility regarding the document design and layout. If you want to design your document in a very specific way, you may have trouble accomplishing this. Keep in mind that LaTeX ''does'' the formatting for you, and mostly the right way. If it is not exactly what you desired, then the LaTeX way is at least not worse, if not better. One way to look at it is that LaTeX is a bundle of macros for TeX that aims to carry out everything regarding document formatting, so that the writer only needs to care about content. If you really want flexibility, use plain TeX instead.

One solution to this dilemma is to make use of the modular possibilities of LaTeX. You can build your own macros, or use macros developed by others. You are likely not the first person to face some particular formatting problem, and someone who encountered a similar problem before may have published their solution as a package.

[http://www.ctan.org/ CTAN] is a good place to find many resources regarding TeX and derivative packages. It is the first place where you should begin searching.

===Questions and documentation===

Besides internet resources being plentiful, the best documentation source remains the official manual for
every specific package, and the reference documentation, i.e., the ''TeXbook'' by D.&amp;nbsp;Knuth and ''LaTeX: A document preparation system'' by L.&amp;nbsp;Lamport.

Therefore before rushing on your favorite web search engine, we really urge you to have a look at the package documentation that causes troubles. This official documentation is most commonly installed along your TeX distribution, or may be found on [http://www.ctan.org/ CTAN].

==Terms regarding TeX==

;Document preparation systems:
LaTeX is a document preparation system based on TeX. So the system is the combination of the language and the macros.

;Distributions:
TeX distributions are collections of packages and programs (compilers, fonts, and macro packages) that enable you to typeset without having to manually fetch files and configure things. 

;Engines:
An engine is an executable that can turn your source code into a printable output format. The engine by itself only handles the syntax, it also needs to load fonts and macros to fully understand the source code and generate output properly. The engine will determine what kind of source code it can read, and what format it can output (usually DVI or PDF).

All in all, distributions are an easy way to install what you need to use the engines and the systems you want. Distributions usually target specific operating systems. You can use different systems on different engines, but sometimes there are restrictions.
Code written for TeX, LaTeX or ConTeXt are (mostly) not compatible.
Additionally, engine-specific code (like font for XeTeX) may not be compiled by every engine.

When searching for information on LaTeX, you might also stumble upon [[w:XeTeX|XeTeX]], [[w:ConTeXt|ConTeXt]], [[w:LuaTeX|LuaTeX]] or other names with a -TeX suffix.
Let's recap most of the terms in this table.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Does anyone know which Guenther book this comes from: (my copy is flawed)

&quot;Kun-tu bzang-po, without ever having done the slightest good, has realized Buddhahood by recognizing the three facets of Being for what they are.  The sentient beings in the three realms, without ever having done any evil, roam about in Samsara by not having recognized the three facets for what they are.  They roam about in Samsara because they have failed to recognize reality to be open-dimensional, experience to be radiant, and responsiveness to be the unity of presence and openness.&quot;   MKha-gro snkying -thig    Translated by Herbert Guenther.

== Merger disccussion ==

Oppose. In Buddhism, particularly, practice and philosophy are distinguished. If someone wants to write a practice manual that is a great idea and we could bear several based upon different schools of thought in Buddhism. The same could be said for philosophy. We should not ever delude ourselves into thinking that any given topic can only support one single comprehensive wikibook when several would better match the variety of approaches and perspectives on a given topic. Let a thousand flowers bloom.[[User:Geofferybard|Geofferybard]] ([[User talk:Geofferybard|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Geofferybard|contribs]]) 23:43, 27 April 2011 (UTC)

== Small font makes this book unreadable ==

I can't read the font, I don't have glasses available and am not inclined to fiddle with my computer settings. Can we not have small font in any books on wikibooks? It is sure to drive our readers, and editors, away. IMO.

== Recent deletion. ==

Comparing revered spiritual figure to despised disease carrying pests? This should not be a controversial deletion. Imagine similar application to Abrahamic faiths....Would result in riots, etc. It is very POV to suggest that Buddhas are comparable in this manner I find it appalling that anyone would open the topic with that kind of rubbish. And it does not change things if one drums up some quote from some suitably &quot;foreign&quot; source...[[User:Policyharmonization|Policyharmonization]] ([[User talk:Policyharmonization|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Policyharmonization|contribs]]) 18:07, 6 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>simplify the error code and remove the deprecated extern int errno</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Procedures and functions|Preprocessor}}

C does not provide direct support for error handling (also known as exception handling).  By convention, the programmer is expected to prevent errors from occurring in the first place, and test return values from functions.  For example, -1 and NULL are used in several functions such as socket() (Unix socket programming) or malloc() respectively to indicate problems that the programmer should be aware about.  In a worst case scenario where there is an unavoidable error and no way to recover from it, a C programmer usually tries to log the error and &quot;gracefully&quot; terminate the program. 

There is an external variable called &quot;errno&quot;, accessible by the programs after including &lt;errno.h&gt; - that file comes from the definition of the possible errors that can occur in some Operating Systems (e.g. Linux - in this case, the definition is in include/asm-generic/errno.h) when programs ask for resources. Such variable indexes error descriptions accessible by the function 'strerror( errno )'. 

The following code tests the return value from the library function malloc to see if dynamic memory allocation completed properly:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;        /* perror */
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;        /* errno */
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;       /* malloc, free, exit */

int main(void)
{

    /* Pointer to char, requesting dynamic allocation of 2,000,000,000
     * storage elements (declared as an integer constant of type
     * unsigned long int). (If your system has less than 2 GB of memory
     * available, then this call to malloc will fail.)
     */
    char *ptr = malloc(2000000000UL);

    if (ptr == NULL) {
        perror(&quot;malloc failed&quot;);
        /* here you might want to exit the program or compensate
           for that you don't have 2GB available
         */
    } else {
        /* The rest of the code hereafter can assume that 2,000,000,000
         * chars were successfully allocated... 
         */
        free(ptr);
    }

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); /* exiting program */
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The code snippet above shows the use of the return value of the library function malloc to check for errors.  Many library functions have return values that flag errors, and thus should be checked by the astute programmer.  In the snippet above, a NULL pointer returned from malloc signals an error in allocation, so the program exits.  In more complicated implementations, the program might try to handle the error and try to recover from the failed memory allocation.

== Preventing divide by zero errors ==

A common pitfall made by C programmers is not checking if a divisor is zero before a division command. The following code will produce a runtime error and in most cases, exit.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int dividend = 50;
int divisor = 0;
int quotient;

quotient = (dividend/divisor); /* This will produce a runtime error! */
&lt;/source&gt;

For reasons beyond the scope of this document, you must check or make sure that a divisor is never zero. Alternatively, for *nix processes, you can stop the OS from terminating your process by blocking the SIGFPE signal. 

The code below fixes this by checking if the divisor is zero before dividing.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; /* for fprintf and stderr */
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; /* for exit */
int main( void )
{
    int dividend = 50;
    int divisor = 0;
    int quotient;

    if (divisor == 0) {
        /* Example handling of this error. Writing a message to stderr, and
         * exiting with failure.
         */
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Division by zero! Aborting...\n&quot;);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE); /* indicate failure.*/
    }

    quotient = dividend / divisor;
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); /* indicate success.*/
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Signals ==

In some cases, the environment may respond to a programming error in C by raising a signal. Signals are events raised by the host environment or operating system to indicate that a specific error or critical event has occurred (e.g. a division by zero, interrupt, and so on.) However, these signals are not meant to be used as a means of error catching; they usually indicate a critical event that will interfere with normal program flow.  

To handle signals, a program needs to use the &lt;tt&gt;signal.h&lt;/tt&gt; header file.  A signal handler will need to be defined, and  the signal() function is then called to allow the given signal to be handled.  Some signals that are raised to an exception within your code (e.g. a division by zero) are unlikely to allow your program to recover.  These signal handlers will be required to instead ensure that some resources are properly cleaned up before the program terminates.

This example creates a signal handler and raises the signal:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

static void catch_function(int signal) {
    puts(&quot;Interactive attention signal caught.&quot;);
}

int main(void) {
    if (signal(SIGINT, catch_function) == SIG_ERR) {
        fputs(&quot;An error occurred while setting a signal handler.\n&quot;, stderr);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    puts(&quot;Raising the interactive attention signal.&quot;);
    if (raise(SIGINT) != 0) {
        fputs(&quot;Error raising the signal.\n&quot;, stderr);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    puts(&quot;Exiting.&quot;);
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== setjmp ==
The [[C Programming/Coroutines#setjmp|setjmp]] function can be used to emulate the exception handling feature of other programming languages.  The first call to setjmp provides a reference point to returning to a given function, and is valid as long as the function containing setjmp() doesn't return or exit.  A call to longjmp causes the execution to return to the point of the associated setjmp call.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;setjmp.h&gt;

jmp_buf test1;

void tryjump()
{
    longjmp(test1, 3);
}

int main (void)
{
    if (setjmp(test1)==0) {
        printf (&quot;setjmp() returned 0.&quot;);
        tryjump();
    } else {
        printf (&quot;setjmp returned from a longjmp function call.&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The values of non-volatile variables may be corrupted when setjmp returns from a longjmp call. 

While setjmp() and longjmp() may be used for error handling, it is generally preferred to use the return value of a function to indicate an error, if possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Both reading and writing are important skills for anyone who wants to do business in English. Here is a list of suggested writing topics.

== Topics for Mini-Research Papers ==
*MBTI / Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator 
*The Campbell-Stone Restoration Movement [http://www.worldconvention.org/nationalprofiles.php World Convention National Profile Pages]
*Peter Drucker
*The de Vinci Code
*Stephen Covey and the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
*Moore’s Law
*Different styles of leadership and leaders
*Rasputin
*Wal-Mart
*Nonverbal communication
*The origins of English
*Today’s weather in (you choose the location)
*Choose your own topic! 


Use the Internet or traditional printed materials to find information about your chosen topic. Write like a reporter or historiographer and remember the six w’s: who, what, when, where, why, and how. The length of the paper should reflect the complexity of the issue, your English fluency, and your time available. One to two typewritten pages is typically an appropriate length.

Include a bibliography citing the Internet pages that you used as reference. 

Use ONLY your own words, except for short, cited quotations. It is usually better to read about the subject, but the material aside, and write from your own memory. That is, don’t read your source material and write your essay at the same time.

== English Language and Grammar Topics ==
*Correct use of adjectives
*Present simple vs. present progressive (continuous) tense
*Using articles (a, an, the, …)
*When to use “what” and when to use “that”

The directions are the same as above. Include examples whenever possible.

I saw an article in a newspaper of yesterday requesting for readers to put comments on the passage.

The whole group was against my sister for not turning up to a meeting which was very important to her.

We had an accident on our way to Zomba.

What happened to your sister who is now in prison?

When is the next meeting taking place?

That place is not good for your health.

== Suggested writing topics ==
* Describe your line of work and your responsibilities.
* Write a history of your family.
* Tell about a favorite memory, perhaps a childhood memory.
* Describe the office or facilities where you work.
* Describe a system or process that you are familiar with in your work.
* Write a plan and analysis describing your goals in studying English.
* Write up a business plan for a business that you might think about starting.
* Write about something that you are passionate about.
* Describe a visit to an English-speaking area.
* Choose a topic and write about it for this [[Business English]] book. 
* Write about your favorite music, group, or artist.
* What important things have you accomplished in your life?
* What would you like to do when you retire?
* What do you regret doing or not doing?
* Read an article from the [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]] or other source and write a summary of it.

== Reading ==
You can get practice reading at many places. Some websites that you might like to visit are the [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]], [http://www.nytimes.com/ New York Times] (free and painless registration required, really, it's worth it), [http://www.economist.com/ The Economist], (a British newsmagazine), and various English magazines that may be available where you live.

So what is a template, in the first place? For our purpose, a template is an HTML-like document that defines the ''presentation'' of a web page, while a PHP script supplies the ''content''. The separation of content and presentation is at the heart of any [[w:GUI|GUI]] paradigm. To see why this is desirable, consider the following hypothetical, yet realistic script. It's a script to retrieve a list of books from the database and display it as a table with alternate colours for each row, or &quot;No books found&quot; if the list is empty.
&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN&quot;
       &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;List of Books&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
$books = new Array();
$i = 0;

$database = open_database();
if (is_null($database)) {?&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Error opening database&lt;/h1&gt;
    Please contact the system administrator at alice@wonderland.com and report the problem.
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;

&lt;?php
    exit();
}

$result = $database-&gt;query(&quot;SELECT ISBN, title, author FROM book&quot;);
while ($row = $result-&gt;retrieveAssoc()) {
    $books[] = $row;
}?&gt; 

    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;?php
        if (count($books) == 0) {
            echo &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;No books found&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;;
        }
        else {
            foreach ($books as $book) {
                if ($i % 2 == 0) {
                    echo &quot;&lt;tr bgcolor='#EEEEEE'&gt;&quot;;
                } else {
                    echo &quot;&lt;tr bgcolor='#FFFFFF'&gt;&quot;;
                }
                $i++; ?&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $book['ISBN']; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $book['title']; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;?php echo $book['author']; ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;?php
            }
        }?&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You will find yourself writing this kind of script very soon. The problems with this script are obvious:

* This PHP page really is two pages, one for the error message and one for the normal display. Confusing.
* Even for the normal display part, the PHP script does two things: prepare the data and format it, e.g. alternate colour for each row.
* Look at how entangled the PHP and HTML codes are. Good indentation becomes practically impossible and that makes the code difficult to read.
* What if your boss now wants not a table, but a list instead? You will need to alter your PHP code for that.
* And now your boss wants a fancier error page that needs at least 300 lines of HTML, can you still tell where your first &quot;page&quot; ends and the second starts?
* You probably need to teach your graphics designer PHP if he wants to do any aesthetic make up to your page.

The list goes on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This chapter focuses on creating and formatting web pages using Adobe GoLive


==Adding and Formatting Pages==
Pages can be created from within GoLive or added from without.  Any time you choose to add a page, image or other object to your site, do so by dragging these files into the site window.  This allows you to use the file in your site without effecting the original files and allows GoLive to keep track of and maintain your files/links.

===Creating a New Page===
While it is possible to create a page by selecting New Page (Ctrl +N) from the File menu, it is often more efficient to create each page as part of the site.  There are several ways to do this.

:# Make sure that the site window is open and the Files or Extras tab is selected.
:# Site &gt; New &gt; Page

:# Select a page from the Files tab in the site window.
:# Edit &gt; Duplicate

:* Drag a page onto the Files or Extras tab from the Objects palette.
:* In navigational view, follow the instructions above dragging the page next to any other page.

===Formatting Pages===
Aspects like backgrounds, margins and keywords (used for searches) can be added before or after the creation of the rest of the page.

====Page Titles====
The page title appears at the top of most browsers.
:* Select the page in the site window, then open the Page tab in the inspector.  Enter a new title in the Title text box.

:* Open the document window and click on the &quot;Title&quot; label at the top of the window.  Enter a new title.

====Page Margins==== 
Page margins determine how close the contents of a Web page come to the browser window.
:# Special &gt; Page Properties
:# Click Page tab.
:# Change Margin Width and Height.

:* To quickly remove page margins right click on page.  Select Document &gt; Set Page Margins to Zero.

====Window Size==== 
You can choose to set the page layout to a certain size to help design your page to that size.  The following will not actually effect the size of the browser window.  Use [[Java Script]] to change the size of the browser window.
:* In document view select a size from the Layout Dimensions menu in the bottom right hand corner of the window.

:* To change the size for all document windows, follow the instructions above and then open the Settings window from the Layout and Dimensions menu.  Check the box labeled Markup Document Windows.

==A==
'''ADD,ADHD or ADD/h'''
Most of the 10 symptoms of ADHD are similar to the symptoms of lack of omega-3 fatty acids or your body's ability to process it.
*Take Omega-3 fatty acids fish body oils (GNC has a a Brown Bottle of 360 pills for $20)  
*Second option is Flaxseed (it comes as a seed, or oil or a pill).
*Ginko Biloba
*Boron
*Caffeine, a stimulant, will work for many cases of ADHD in the same way Ritalin does. Many people with mild ADHD symptoms self-medicate with coffee, soft   drinks, tea, and other caffeinated drinks.

'''Alzheimers Prevention'''
#Increase your intake of Niacin from food sources as this may reduce the risk of getting Alzheimers according to a report in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry. Good food sources are tomates, carrots, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, milk, chicken, broccoli, tuna and salmon. The recommended daily allowance is 14 mg a day for women and 16 mg a day for men.

==B==

'''Bad Breath'''

Some studies have shown eating yogurt, drinking green tea, or chewing cinnamon or sugarless cinnamon gum can also reduce bad breath.


Maintain water levels in the body by drinking several glasses of water a day. Adding lemon juice to your water is refreshing and also beneficial. Parsley is a natural breath freshener when chewed slowly, and is easy to grow at home.


Since a dry mouth can increase bacterial buildup and cause or worsen bad breath, chewing sugarless gum can help with the production of saliva, and thereby help to reduce bad breath.

Use Hydrogen Peroxide as your mouthwash. Use twice a day. Baking soda(gargle)and water with lemon juice(gargle)before bed.

==C==


'''Cough'''
#For a persistant cough use Hydrogen Peroxide as a mouthwash twice a day until symptom improves. Mix with equal amount of water, swish around in mouth for at least 1 minute, gargle and spit out. Use for up to 7 days. 

==D==

==E==

==F==

==G==

==H==

'''Hayfever'''
#Regularly eating ''local'' [[honey]] may reduce the symptoms of hayfever.
#Wear [[dark glasses]] outdoors.

'''Headaches'''
#Believe it or not, drinking a couple of cups (one big glass) of [[Gatorade]] helps cure headaches. Also, a cup of strong coffee with lemon juice added to it will expand your blood vessels. Drinking a large amount of water often helps, since it thins the blood and helps it pass through your body faster. Or, you could try crushing fresh thyme and inhaling the vapors.

'''Hiccups'''
#Take a teaspoon of white sugar.  Pour on lemon juice to soak it.  Eat it off the spoon.
#Take 3 deep breaths and on the last breath exhale until nothing at all comes out and at that time drink as much water as you can to the point where you feel like you are going to drown then keep going just a bit longer, its the drowning feeling the will rid you of the hiccups.
#Place a little bit of sugar on the back of your tongue. Hiccups.. gone. This works very well on kids and babies!

'''Headaches'''
#Peppermint-oil : drip one to 5 drops on the forehead while lying on your back, then run your fingers through your hair, starting from the place you dripped the oil and going up towards the top of the head, in a sort of gentle massage of the scalp. Doing this while closing your eyes and concentrating on the cold-warm effect of the oil on your skin will slowly &quot;evaporate&quot; the pain.

#Pressure: Place one thumb on your forehead between your eyes, place your other thumb on the indented spot at the back of your head, at the top your spine. Simultaniously apply pressure to both spots, holding for three seconds. Repeat this three times consecutively. This should activate pressure points to relieve the headache soon after.

===Stomach ache===
Many home remedy websites list remedies based on acid (such as lemon juice vinegar), but many stomach pain, especially when your stomach is empty, are caused by acid (http://www.mothernature.com/Library/Bookshelf/Books/48/193.cfm). Instead, taking bases such as calcium and baking soda will neutralize the acid.

Over-the-counter pain medication will dull the sensation of pain, but for stomachaches it is often faster, easier, and healthier to fix the cause of the problem.
===Sunburn===
quick relief from the symptoms of sunburn can be obtained through the application of shaving cream to the affected area.  in addition to a cooling sensation (best if the product used is methnolated) this remady also helps rehydrate the skin and promotes healing.

A good cure for sun burn is bio yogurt applied to the afflicted area. If the yogurt is taken straight from the fridge it also provides a cooling sensation.

Hydrogen Peroxide will take the sting out of the skin.

Add 1/4 spoon of freshly ground [[/pepper]], a pinch of [[/turmeric]] powder and 1 spoon of [[/sugar]] to a glass of [[/milk]]. Boil it well. Drink it when it is warm. This helps to subside cold, sore throat and heavy head.

==B==
Keep a [[peppermint]] [[toffee]] in mouth and ask your partner to have intercourse with you and let your partner be active. You will have immediate relief.

==C==
Drinking lots of [[water]] in the morning and then a [[green tea]] will subside the cold.

Chinese medicine has been relying on chicken soup to boost the immune system for a long time. Be sure to cook a soup from real chicken, though (not instant), because certain proteins from the chicken are only released into the soup if the chicken is really being boiled. Also, onions have an antibacterial effect, as well as garlic, so throw it in. Add carrots for taste and potatoes, noodles or rice for the more satisfying, stew-like thing. If you have digestive problems and suffering mild dehydration, drink slightly salty liquids like broth to rebalance your minerals.

==D==
Eat Every day a small leaf of [[Thulasi]] and you will be saying a Good bye for cold to run away from your life. It gives a permanent cure, try and enjoy the benefits.

==E==

==F==
FEVER
To reduce fever mix one part white vinegar with one part cool (not cold) water. Soak white cotton socks in solution, wring out and put on feet. Resoak when the socks warm up. Cools the blood at the point fartherest away from brain and heart.

Middle-Ear Infection

Chop a fresh onion, wrap the pieces in a piece of cloth and place the &quot;onion bag&quot; on the hurting ear. Maybe secure with a hat. It will give pain relief and the onion fumes will help drain the ear of mucus. Still, this is just a supplementary treatment to a doctor's attention, so please go see a doctor anyway. Untreated ear infections can cause severe scarring of the eardrums and lead to increasing deafness over time!

==N==

==O==
Four drops of Oil of Oregano under your tongue twice day will keep your cold away.  Great immune booster as well.

==T==
Sore throat / tonsil infection

Suck on ice cubes or popsicles, preferably with low sugar so that you don't give the bacteria anything to really feast on. Avoid milk products (no ice cream!) and chocolate with nuts, the combination seems to make staphillococcus bacteria expand their population extremely fast. Do not smoke, as it will further irritate the tissue and dry it out, which might cause tiny tissue tears. Again, a visit to the doctor is not negotiable, you might need antibiotics.

==V==

Shot of Vodka with red or black pepper, or with honey, then into bed and under the blankets to sweat the sickness out throught the night.

'''Bug bites and other skin irritations''':  
Go out an gather a good amount of plantain, which is a weed on most peoples' lawns.  Put it in a crockpot and set the pot on low.  Cover with a good quality oil--coconut oil is best. Leave the lid off, and cook for about 24 hours.  Strain out the plantain and add enough beeswax to make it &quot;set up&quot;.  You will need to experiment with this, because everyone I know likes it a bit different.  You're aiming for a sloppy lip balm consistency.  This heals all my bug bites better than prescription $150 stuff, and has worked on skin infections and brown recluse spider bites and bouts of exzema.


'''Banana skin''' - fleshy side down - taped to the wart overnight.   If you have more than one wart the first wart to appear is usually the largest and the most uncomfortable - this is the one to treat. Within four days all warts disappear - you won't even notice them go!!

==C==

==D==
Covering a '''wart''' with [[duct tape]] is a very effective treatment. After a shower, scrub the wart well to remove dead skin. Cover it with duct tape as soon as the skin is dry enough for the tape to stick. Leave the tape on until your next shower. Duct tape is thought to work by causing irritation, which get the immune system to pay attention. Also, the adhesive pulls off some of the wart each time you change the tape (though it must be left on for a longish time to have this effect). After two weeks to a month of ''persistent'' taping, the wart should be gone.

The duct tape also helps by suffocating the tissues. The skin in the ares can't &quot;breathe&quot; so it starts to turn white and die, helping rid you of the wart.

You can also get rid of a wart by painting it with clear nailpolish. You may have to re-apply a couple times during the day if it flakes off, but it suffocates it. It has the same effect as the duct tape but a lot quicker resolution.

==E==
To remove warts, rub Castor Oil on the wart a minimum of 2x/day. My great grandmother taught me this as a child and it worked for me several times. After about 2-3 weeks of daily applications, the wart is gone. No pain, and a good solution.

==F==

==G==

==H==

To '''fight infection in a bite, scratch, cut or wound''' (especially if it has already become infected), peel a layer off a raw [[Plant Families/Onion|onion]], lay it directly on the wound and wrap it or tape it securely so it stays in place. You can cut and shape the onion to fit the size and shape of wound if you like and just hold it in place with a bandaid or masking tape. If it is in an awkward place like your foot or ankle, you can place a piece of plastic wrap over it to prevent odor, then wrap securely with strips of cloth or an elastic bandage so that it stays securely in place. Or you can just use the plastic wrap to do the wrapping. Put it on at bedtime and go to sleep. By morning the infection will be gone. I've raise five children and this was my number one home remedy. It never failed.

==J==

==K==

==L==

==M==
To help clear up '''acne''' or outbreaks of '''herpes''' or '''cold sores''', use plants of the [[menthe]] family, those being [[mint]]s and [[lemon balm]]. Drinking them (lemon balm is best) as tea improves the immune system and weakens the virus's ability to infect cells. Topical application of the same tea (you could just put the cooling tea bag onto the skin) is also effective. While no medicine will ever truly remove herpes, the symptoms can be controlled. 

'''A few warnings''', mint is a volatile herb. While most people will not have a problem, drinking too much of the tea can cause problems.  If you start to become windy (it also has a &quot;positive&quot; impact on digestion) then mint may be to blame. However, mint will only cause this if your diet is causing colonic sluggishness already.

Both as a remedy and prophylactic, use homeopathic ''[[Rhus Tox]].''

Tobacco is good for wasp stings.  Just wet it and find a way to keep it on the spot on which you were stung.  It takes the stinging away and some of the swelling. Or, cut a piece off a fresh onion and hold it to the spot of the sting. Works with bee stings as well.

Plantain leaf, which comes from a common lawn weed, can be of help in removing poisons. This plant has oval shaped leaves with veins running the length of the leaf. It has spiked flowers.
To use, simply chew the leaf and use the resulting mush as a poultice for bee stings, spider bites and even snake bites. You may want to put a bandage over the poultice to hold it in place. Change it twice daily or more often as needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Concept + Medium''' ==


The notion of artistic or creative process has been the subject of much debate and research [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity] as that of the nature of art itself. Some insist that creativity is by nature spontaneous, while others argue that undirected spontaneity is a random mess and that creativity consists of the original use of accomplished technique. This article will suggest an approach to process which can yield practical results in a context of self-evaluation.

All art consists of a concept embedded in a medium. The concept is what the artist wants to show to the audience. It may be an emotion, information, or (most often) some combination of the two. Representational art, which alludes to some real phenomenon - that is, something which is identifiable by a majority of people - may be said to have a subject. Abstract art may have a subject in the mind of the artist, but if this subject is not readily apprehensible by most viewers, either from the artwork itself or its title, then any imputation of subject is in the mind of the audience and will vary between individuals.

The medium is the mode of expression or communication used by the artist to convey the concept at hand. It may be concrete, as in the case of a painting or sculpture, or ephemeral, as in the case of a sound recording, motion picture, or book. Although copies of these latter works exist in physical form, they are not meant to be appreciated for their physical manifestation. Such ephemeral artworks are meant to be appreciated in the dimension of time rather than all at once in space. Motion pictures are the medium that currently come closest to presenting art in a spatial and temporal context simultaneously. 

Regardless of the medium employed, the creative process is essentially the same. Gross differences between artists in their methods of realizing an art work can generally be ascribed to the differing technical requirements of the medium. Thus the sculptor must shape clay or use a hammer and chisel to hit a lump of rock, while a photographer arranges a camera in a certain relationship to the subject of the photograph. These differences are superficial. We will now examine the unifying factors which are common to all works of art and the process of creating art.

First is a technical understanding of the medium. This consists of knowledge of the materials that the artist is working with and knowledge of how it may be manipulated to fit the conception of the artist. In the case of painting, this might include a knowledge of the behavior of different types of paint and the degree to which they can be intermixed, an appreciation of how paint transfers from a bush or other applicator to a canvas or other surface, a knowledge of how to blend different colors of paint together to obtain a new color, and so forth. Understanding of the medium is measured by the degree to which an artist can produce an arbitrary result on demand - for example, an understanding of color in oil painting would allow an expert to match the color of any given object by blending others.

Complete understanding of a medium is not necessary for the creation of art. Indeed, a full understanding of a medium does not equate to a capacity for creation. Such a full understanding may be available to the scientist or critic, but this only allows them to define the bounds of possibility for expression within the medium. It should be noted that such bounds can only be defined negatively: we cannot say what is the full range of shapes and textures available to the sculptor, but we can assert with confidence that the techniques of sculpture are not applicable to choreography. 

Some understanding of a medium is necessary for the production of art. In the simplest case, we can say that no drawing is possible until the would-be artist has grasped the idea of using an object to make a mark upon a surface. At the other extreme is the understanding of how to render any given effect on demand, as noted above. Staying with drawing, such a skill allows the artist to produce accurate renditions of arbitrarily complex subjects - for example, it takes great mastery of technique to make a drawing of a hand which is indistinguishable from a photograph.

In general, technique can be highly admired. However, it is regarded as being of less importance since the invention of machines which embody nothing but technique, such as cameras or automated musical software. Art which relies heavily on expression at the expense of technique is called 'naive'. Naiveté may be the result of a lack of training (such as Outsider Art [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art]), however the contemporary artist may deliberately make a statement about the unimportance of technique or choose to mimic the style and characteristics of the untrained (often imitating the work of children). At the opposite extreme, and quite rare, are those individuals known as ''idiots savants'', who can produce highly accurate reproductions of things seen or heard, but are quite unable to produce anything original from their imagination.

While understanding of a medium gives the artist the knowledge of how to produce something, expression is the ability to decide ''what'' to produce, and make choices about the manner of production. We can say that expression consists of having something to say to the audience; this may be a declaration of beauty, a declaration of affinity between two apparently dissimilar objects or phenomena, or a desire to give form to an abstraction and make a commentary thereon. 

Communication is equally important as expression. While many of the traditional arts (drawing, painting, sculpture) are expressive and emotional, contemporary society a multimedia visual culture. Many artists such as graphic designers, storytellers, and illustrators use the elements and principles of visual design to effectively convey the intended information. 

The elements and principles of visual art have been studied for many years, resulting in rules or standards for composition. These rules can be strictly applied, used as loose guides, or intentionally broken. Their goal is often to achieve balance, optimize impact, or more thoroughly communicate or express the concept. 

Thus, we can summarize the creative process as the application of an individual's concept to a medium which they have some skill in manipulating. For the ambitious artist, the task is to first find a medium in which they want to represent something, develop some level of skill in shaping that medium to represent simple things, and finally to choose something for representation which can be realized without too many distracting refinements of technique. The surer one is about ''how'' to do something, the more concentration can be applied towards the question of ''what'' to do, and the more natural and unobtrusive the medium will be in conveying the intended impression.

==Ingredients==

*10 oz - Plain white flour;
*6 oz - Wholemeal flour;
*1 ¾ level tsp - Bread soda;
*2 heaped dessert spoons - Wheat germ;
*1 level tsp - Salt;
*⅞ pint - Buttermilk.

==Procedure==

# Grease and flour an 8 inch round baking tin.
# Sift the white flour into a large mixing bowl.
# Add the other dry ingredients and mix thoroughly.
''A simple tip: Sift the flour and baking soda five times through a sieve. This ensures even mixing of the ingredients and gives a better result.''
# Make a well in the centre of the bowl, pour in some of the buttermilk and, with a wooden spoon, gradually mix the flour into the buttermilk. Alternatively, make a volcano shape on a marble slab with the dry ingredients, add the buttermilk and mix with a knife.
# Add more buttermilk and mix in more flour.  Continue until the flour is completely absorbed into the mix.  The mix should not be over saturated, but have a slightly stretchy look.
''Handle it as little as possible. You can also ball it up into one or two balls, place them on a flat baking tray, and cut a cross in the top.''
# Turn the mix into the baking tin and place in a medium hot oven (180 degrees Centigrade, 350 degrees F) for 35 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown.  
# Leave to cool on a wire tray.

Mayonnaise is a smooth [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] made from [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] and the yolk of [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. It is an emulsion in which the oil is dispersed in tiny droplets.
Egg yolk contains lecithin which prevents the oil and water from separating out. [[Cookbook:Mustard|Mustard]] is also a good emulsifier and is frequently added. [[Cookbook:Vinegar|Vinegar]], usually wine vinegar, or [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] juice are added for flavour and because acidity is necessary for the emulsion to properly form. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] is a frequent addition.
The [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] used is normally a flavourless type such as [[Cookbook:Sunflower Oil|sunflower oil]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Oil|corn oil]], but you can substitute some for a stronger tasting oil such as [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]. 

Mayonnaise is notoriously difficult for the beginner, as it often curdles, but easy once you have the knack. 

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolk]]
*2 1/2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] (12.5 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and/or [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 teaspoons (2.5 mL) Dijon [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
*1/4 teaspoons (1 mL) [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (180mL) [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]]

==Procedure==
# In a large bowl, beat the egg yolk with a wire [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]] for about a minute. 
# Then add the mustard, salt, and half the lemon juice. Whisk for another minute - the mixture should thicken very slightly.
# Then, very slowly, add half the oil with one hand whilst whisking with the other. 
# Start drop by drop, incorporating each drop before adding the next, and build up to a trickle.
# Keep going until the oil is whisked in.
# Add the rest of the lemon juice, whisk to combine.
# Add the rest of the oil in the same manner as before.
# Keep going until all the oil is whisked in. 

You can now stir flavourings such as crushed garlic into the finished mayonnaise, or use the mayonnaise as a base for other sauces.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* One can make the whisking process easier by using a kitchen towel.  Wet a kitchen towel, or any small towel, until it is very wet and heavy, but not dripping.  Coil the towel on top of a flat surface, such as the kitchen countertop or a table. Place the bowl onto the circle.  This will provide a steady base for the bowl and allow you to whisk with one hand while adding ingredients with the other.

* If the mayonnaise should curdle, it can be recovered by slowly dripping the curdled mayonnaise into another egg yolk while whisking vigorously all the time.

* ½ teaspoons [[Cookbook:White sugar|white sugar]] can be added for those with a sweet tooth.  Add with the salt at the beginning.

* It's easier to just use an immersion blender for the whisking. In case the mix curdles, you can put the curdled mix away, start with a new attempt and once you get the emulsion going, add the curdled mix just as you were adding oil.

* For special occasion, you can spice up this recipe by making Juanz mayonnaise. Just add about a handfull of finely chopped Cilantro and about half a tooth of crushed garlic. This is also known as Banana's Mayonnaise.

In the Motion Picture industry, screenplays are usually presented in a standardized format. This format has been developed over the years in the Hollywood studio system in order to approximate a rule of thumb of one script page equaling one minute of movie screen time. This &quot;Hollywood Standard&quot; format has become widely adapted and accepted worldwide due to the proliferation of screenwriting software such as Final Draft and Movie Magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
The main characteristics of this standard are:
* 3 holed Letter size 8.5&quot;x11&quot; paper (US and Canada) or [[w:A4 paper size|A4 paper format]] (rest of the world)
* Character names and Dialogue should be formatted to appear centered (see below)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Writers submitting their work to US based production companies are strongly advised to follow this standard as any deviation from it is often regarded as a sign of an amateur screenwriter. Many in the industry say they refuse to accept non-standard scripts but stories abound of writers with &quot;stunt submissions&quot; such as the one in 2004 at Cannes. Supposedly someone took a chance and printed their screenplay up like a paperback novel (bound with a fancy cover and everything) and even though the screenplay was no good the size was very popular (being less bulky than a conventional screenplay) and lots of people took copies and read them.  So some may conclude that sometimes breaking the rules works. However, as it was pointed out, the screenplay in this case was no good, so it once again reinforced the commonly held preconception that fancy stunt submissions are usually done by amateurs, whereas professionals follow the standard format.


== Formats ==
=== Screenplay ===

Although some writers utilize their own modifications on the standard screenplay format, there is a basis upon which all feature film screenplays are formated. 

The standard screenplay format is devised for simplicity of reading by many different departments in addition to roughly timing out to one minute of screen time for one page of script. 

Screenplays should be written in &lt;u&gt;'''twelve point Courier font'''&lt;/u&gt;. Twelve point Courier is an important component of the standard format for two reasons.  One is nostalgic (Courier font resembles the look of a page written on a mechanical typewriter), but the other reason is highly practical: Courier is a monospaced font meaning every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the &quot;w&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are wider than most letters, and the &quot;i&quot; is narrower). With a monospaced font only a certain number of letters will fit on each row and each page, assuring uniformity of the format and achieving the one page per minute of screen time formula.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Final Draft, the popular screenwriting software has developed their own Courier font, Courier Final Draft. This font was designed to mimic a PC Courier font on Mac computers to achieve further uniformity between the platforms.  There are no differences between the glyphs of Courier and Courier Final Draft and the two fonts are interchangeable on those platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Utilizing any font other than twelve point Courier or Courier Final Draft will result in a screenplay that does not adhere to the standard format, does not approximate the one page per minute of screentime formula and therefore regarded as highly undesirable by producers. NOTE: The Courier New font alters the pitch of the typeface, taking up more space on the page and therefore altering the overall page count of a script document.  Courier New font is not recommended for screenwriters. 

Margins are generally set as such (spaces are assuming 12 point font at 72 spaces per line):
*Scene Number (if used) is 1.25 inches from the left edge or 13 &quot;spaces&quot; in
*Scene Heading 1.75 inches from the left edge or 19 spaces in 
*Action 1.75 inches from the left edge or 19 spaces in (cut off at 55 characters (including spaces) per line)
*Dialogue 2.75 inches from the left edge or 29 spaces in (cut off at 35 characters (including spaces) per line)
*Character name is centered on the page (about 43 spaces in)
*Parenthetical direction is 3.5 inches from the left or 36 spaces in (cut off at 16 characters (including spaces) per line)

==== Elements of the screenplay ====

Screenplays traditionally start with FADE IN in the upper left hand corner of the first page, immediately followed by the scene heading for the first location. 

'''SCENE HEADING (SLUG)'''
A scene heading always starts with a distinction whether the location of the scene is indoors or outdoors. INT. signifies an interior location whereas EXT. signifies an exterior location. These are always abbreviated and followed by a period and one blank space and then the name of the location where that scene takes place. Scene headings, also called slugs, are placed for each and every location in the screenplay, including all the various elements of a location. For example INT. OLD HOUSE LIVING ROOM might be followed by INT. OLD HOUSE KITCHEN if the characters or action moves to the kitchen.  It is not correct to have INT. OLD HOUSE and move characters from one room to the next within the same scene. Each room is treated as a separate location in the script because when the film is actually shot these sequences will most likely be shot out of order (all scenes in the kitchen will be shot together and all scenes in the living room will be shot together, possibly on different days) and, possibly, in completely different physical locations (the kitchen may be a practical location in an Old House, the living room might be built on a soundstage). Some writers like to put a hyphen between the main location and the sub location, IE: INT. OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM and INT. OLD HOUSE - KITCHEN, but this is not required. Following the location name is one or two hyphens (depending on writer's taste) and the time of day the scene takes place; DAY, NIGHT, DAWN, DUSK, EVENING or MOMENTS LATER, CONTINUOUS (if the scene is immediately after the following as in the characters walking from the living room to the kitchen in one conversation). After the Scene heading, there are two carriage returns (one blank space) and the ACTION begins. Scene headings are always in all capital letters.

'''ACTION'''
Action is the description of what is happening in the scene, IE: Mark walks into the living room from the kitchen and picks up his books. Action is always written in present tense (Mark walks, not Mark walked). Action is in non-indented paragraph/prose form and is the longest element on the page (spanning from the far left to the far right hand margins of the page). It is generally accepted that action should not be longer than 10 lines without a break. Action also describes the locations, as much as necessary. Action is always in traditional English upper/lowercase. There are two line breaks between the end of action and the name of a character speaking (one blank line between action and character name) or the beginning of a new scene (one blank line between the end of action and the scene heading for the next scene).

'''CHARACTER NAME'''
When dialogue is spoken, it is preceded by the name of the character speaking the dialogue. The Character Name is placed on its own line and centered on the page. It is always in capital letters. There are some modifiers that can be placed after the character name in parenthesis (separated by a single space). Voice Over (V.O.) IE: JOHN (V.O.) is dialogue that is presented on the film's audio track, but is not spoken by the character on screen. Voice Over can be a voice on a telephone or the sound of the character's own thoughts. Off Screen (O.S.) IE: JOHN (O.S.) is dialogue that is spoken by a character in or immediately near the physical location of the scene, but who is not visible on the screen in that shot or scene. This could be a character speaking from another room. There is only one line break after the character name before dialogue (no blank space).

'''DIALOGUE'''
Dialogue is the actual spoken words by the character. It is placed immediately under the centered character's name and indented considerably from the left hand side and slightly from the right to stand out on the page. Dialogue is presented in standard upper/lowercase text (ALL CAPS can signify extreme emphasis or SHOUTING). Underline and italics can be used for emphasis, but should be used sparingly. 

'''PARENTHETICAL DIRECTION'''
This is very brief (usually one or two words) of direction or clarification that is placed within a character's spoken dialogue. It is placed, indented from the dialogue, on a separate line and enclosed in parenthesis. Parenthetical direction is only specific to the speaking character (not to other characters in the scene) and should be extremely brief. It can indicate a parawr use, a direction of conversation to a different character in the scene, a notation on a specific emotion or intent in the following dialogue. Parentheticals are always in the middle of dialogue - dialogue never ends with a parenthetical direction. Parenthetical direction is usually written in all lowercase letters IE: (beat). After the dialogue ends, there are two line breaks (one blank space) between the next character name or action or a new scene heading.


Some standard format notes:
*The first time a character is introduced in action, their name is presented in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS to point out their introduction.
*Sound effects such as a phone RINGS or an alarm BEEPS are placed in all capital letters to point them out.
*Scene transitions such as DISSOLVE TO:, CUT TO:, FADE TO BLACK: are placed flush right, on their own line. They are placed at the end of a scene with one blank space before a new scene heading. Generally speaking, they should be used sparingly.

== Process ==
=== Draft Script ===
=== Locking the Script ===
As part of the pre-production process, the script is going to be accepted and locked. This provides the basis for keeping everyone on the same page. A locked script means that the page numbers do not change. Every copy of the script will have the same page 10 because it will never change. As new material is added, sub pages (&quot;a&quot; pages) are added (10a, 10b, 10c and so forth). If significant deletions are made as to eliminate all the material on a page, it remains in the script as a blank page merely with the word &quot;OMITTED&quot; on it. In addition to page numbers, scene numbers are also locked and treated the same. If a scene is cut from the script, its number remains and the slug reads &quot;OMITTED&quot;; added scenes are sometimes identified with capital letters 101A, 101B, 101C and so forth. Sometimes additional scenes are numbered as in 101-1, 101-2 or 101.1, 101.2. Numbering is somewhat preferred as the traditional system for identifying coverage on slates while shooting a movie is to designate each new shot with a letter. Scene 101 may be one page in the script, but the final scene may be made up of 15 different camera angles. On the set, these will be designated on the slate and in continuity notes as 101a, 101b, 101c and so forth, so it can be confusing to see scene 101Aa, 101Ab. Each assistant director or unit production manager has their own system for locking the script and each script supervisor has their own system for designating shots on set. It's up to that team to coordinate how these numbers will be implemented.

=== Rewrites ===
Throughout the production process the script may need to be modified or re-written. Scenes are added, moved, deleted, or changed. 

The location supervisor reports that the restaurant location will not be available. The director confers with the writers and decides that the scene can take place in a park instead. 

This means the casting director doesn't need to cast a waiter for the scene, but a hot dog vendor and a street entertainer will be required.

The scene has moved from indoors to outdoors, different lights/film may be required. The DoP will need to know this.

The costume designer no longer needs to dress 40 extras in evening dinner attire.

It's very important for everyone to be on the same page; changes are usually printed on different color pages. For example, if everyone else is carrying light-blue scripts, and you have a pink script, then you've got a problem.

'''AWS''' is a complete framework to develop [[w:Web application|Web based applications]]. The main part of the framework is the embedded [[w:Web server|web server]]. This small yet powerful Web server can be embedded into your application so your application will be able to talk with a standard Web browser like [[w:Internet Explorer|Microsoft Internet Explorer]] or [[w:Firefox|Firefox]] for example. Around this Web server a lot of services have been developed.

AWS supports '''SOAP''' [[w:Web service|Web Services]].

'''Ligers''' and '''tigons''' are hybrids, the offspring of the pairing of a lion and a tiger.  '''Ligers''' have [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Lion|lion]] fathers and [[Wikijunior Big Cats/Tiger|tiger]] mothers.  They usually grow much larger than their parents, and female ligers (sometimes called ''ligresses'') can sometimes have babies.  '''Tigons''' (also called '''tiglons''') all have tiger fathers and lion mothers.  They are usually smaller than their parents. Lions are very social animals while tigers tend to be lonely and to live by themselves.  The offspring of a lion-tiger share the conflicting instincts of both parents.  Sometimes they seek out interaction with other big cats, but other times they will attack them.  So, they can be a danger if they are raised with other big cats.  In general, however, ligers are gentle, even-tempered and tolerant.

==Wild Ligers and Tigons have recently been found==
Breeding offspring of a lion and tiger requires human intervention, since the two species do not live near each other in the wild.  In the past, some zoos experimented with breeding lions and tigers with one another.  Due to conservation efforts, hybridization on purpose is not allowed in most zoos.  However, it happens regularly by accident, and some private breeders try to breed ligers for the purposes of creating something new and unusual.

Recently a wild liger has allegedly been found in the far south of the Sahara Desert. Ligers were also allegedly found in the wild sometime between 1930's and the 1950s.  However, tigers have never evolved in Africa, and if true would have had to been the result of released captive tigresses.  Claims have been made for wild liger sightings in or near the Gir Forest in India in the past; today, there are no reliable reports of tigers within a hundred miles of the Gir Forest, making such a meeting extremely unlikely.

==Fascinating!==
[[Image:Tigon4.jpg|thumb|left]]Ligers are the largest of the Big Cats. They can weigh up to about 1500 pounds (680kg), and stand up to 13 feet (4 m) tall on their hind legs. Tigons are sometimes called dwarfs, tions and tilons; while they do not exhibit many signs of dwarfism, fully grown tigons of both sexes usually weigh less than 350 pounds (160 kg), which is small for male lions or tigers.

Both hybrids have a combination of lion and tiger physical characteristics.  However, the Ligers look more like their lion fathers with a hint of light striping on their backs and faces.  Tigons have more defined striping like their tiger fathers.  Like tigers, the striping pattern is unique to each individual animal.  Tigons can also have small manes or spots.

==Can they have offspring?==
It was originally assumed that ligers couldn't have babies, which is true for most hybrid species, such as the mule (a cross between a horse and a donkey).  However, females can have babies.  There are such things as li-ligers and li-tigons along with ti-ligers and ti-tigons &amp;mdash; these are mixes of ligers and tigons with lions and tigers.

==What is Gambas ?==

'''Gambas''' is a programming language for Linux which attempts to mimic the ease of use of Visual Basic while improving on its functionality. Although Gambas is not source code compatible with Visual Basic, it is a BASIC  Interpreter with object-oriented extensions. 
This makes Gambas a good choice for Linux users who want to use their VB knowledge on a GNU basis. 

Gambas makes it very easy to build Linux GUI programs (the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas itself.) using the Qt toolkit. There is a Windows version of Gambas which barely runs under the Cygwin environment. Graphical applications do not yet work under the Windows version.

Developed in Paris by Benoît Minisini since 1999, Gambas is released under the GNU General Public Licence, the current version (July 29th 2009) being 2.15.2  Gambas is included in the Linux Professional Distribution from Novell.

'Gambas' is a backronym for '''GAMBAS Almost Means BASic''' (''Gambas'' is also the Spanish word for shrimp.)

==Why Gambas ?==

With Gambas you can easily:

*Build solutions for any environment using &quot;graphical application&quot; when you start a new project. This mode takes care of which Desktop environment the end user is going to use, and the program will automatically adapt to Gnome, KDE, etc. depending on the '''Current running Desktop environment'''.
*Build KDE applications with DCOP
*Translate your programs into other languages
*Offer Visual Basic programs under Linux
*Build network solutions
*Quickly design your program GUI with QT or GTK+ 
*Use databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebird, ODBC and SQLite
*Create network applications easily
*Make 3D OpenGL applications
*Make CGI web applications, and so on...

==Citations==
*&quot;This project aims at making a graphical development environment based on a Basic interpreter, so that we have a language like Visual Basic under Linux.&quot;
*&quot;If you pass the responsibilty for the pc operating system only to one company , then this is just the same, as if you would sell the abc or the integers to this company.&quot;
*&quot;Still, this Qt-based software is one of the most advanced open source RAD tools available. It is nearly complete and very usable and stable. Benoit's goal is to avoid the development failures of Microsoft Visual Basic. The modern concept of Gambas is available as a graphic at the Web site http://gambas.sourceforge.net/en/main.html. Gambas is translated into many languages. To run Gambas applications you need the Gambas interpreter component installed on the user machine.&quot;
*Slashdot: Gambas 1.0 Release Candidate Available raindog2 writes &quot;After two and a half years of development, Gambas has become the first Visual Basic-style environment for Linux to enter release candidate status. Anyone who has been frustrated by a lack of production-quality free RAD environments should give it a try.&quot;

==The Cross Sum Program ==

This miniprogram calculates the cross sum of an integer. 
You need 2 textboxes and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 

Please beware of the signs / and \ . In this program the sign \ is used for a division without a remainder. 

The Code 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
     DIM z AS Integer
     DIM crosssum AS Integer
     z = Val(TextBox1.Text)
     DO WHILE z &lt;&gt; 0 
       crosssum = crosssum + z MOD 10
       z= z \ 10 
     LOOP 
     TextBox2.Text = Str$(crosssum)
 END
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Addy The Sum Program ==

This miniprogram calculates the sum of a row of integers. 
You need 1 textarea, 1 textbox and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 
You can also add negative integers. 
Very helpful is the Split command and the String array String[] 

'''The Code''' 
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM text AS String
 DIM summe AS Float
 DIM Elt AS String[]
 DIM Sb AS String
 text = textarea1.Text
 Elt = Split(text,Chr(10))
 FOR EACH Sb IN Elt
  summe = summe + Val(sb)
 NEXT
 textbox1.Text = summe
 END

==The Average Program ==

This miniprogram calculates the average of a row of integers. 
You need 1.textarea, 2 textboxes and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 

The Code 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
   DIM text AS String
   DIM summe AS Float
   DIM mw AS Float
   DIM varianz AS Float
   DIM sigma AS Float
   DIM Liste AS String[]
   DIM Einzelwert AS String
   text = textarea1.Text
   Liste = Split(text,Chr(10))
   FOR EACH Einzelwert IN Liste
      summe = summe + Val(Einzelwert)
   NEXT
   mw = summe / Liste.Length
   textbox1.Text = mw
   varianz = 0
   FOR EACH Einzelwert IN Liste
      varianz = varianz + ((Val(Einzelwert) - mw)^2)
      PRINT Einzelwert,mw,((Val(Einzelwert) - mw)^2)
      PRINT varianz
   NEXT
   varianz = varianz / (Liste.Length - 1)
   PRINT varianz
   sigma = Sqr(varianz)
   textbox2.Text = sigma
 END
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==The Median ==

The Median of a list of values lies between two equal parts of the list. 50 % of the values ar greater or equal to the median. 50 % are smaler or equal to the median. In contrary to the average the median is not influenced that much by extreme values. 

If you want to program the median, you have to 
*1.sort your list of values
*2.check if the list has an even or an odd number of values.
*3.chooes the right formula for the median.
**for an odd number of values 
 xmedian = x[(n+1)/2]
**for an even number of values 
 xmedian = 1/2*(x[n/2] + x[n/2+1])

example 1: 

sorted list of values:
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15    
The number of values is odd. n = 5 
 (n+1)/2 =  6/2 = 3 
xmedian = x[3] = 13

example 2.

sorted list of values:
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
The number of values is even , n = 6 
 n/2 =  6/2 = 3 
 x[3] = 13
 x[4] = 14
 xmedian = 1/2*(13+14) = 13,5

You can take the list from above and copy it into the Gambas median program. Use the clipboard of your computer for that.  Ctrl+C = Copy , Ctrl + V = Paste 

example program

You need 2 textareas , 3 commandbuttons and 1 textbox, to get the program going:

 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;

If you want to produce some graphics in gambas you should get used to the drawingarea control.

==Draw a Line==
This little program will draw a line.
You have to start a new graphics project. You take a form as your start form. 
You need a drawingarea and a commandbutton on the form to get it going.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Line(1, 130, 500, 400)
 Draw.End
 END

When you want to draw some more lines, then try this example:

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
 DIM B AS Integer 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 FOR B = 1 TO 200 STEP 10 
  Draw.Line(1, B, 500, B)
 NEXT 
 Draw.End
 END

Some other lines are drawn here:

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM B AS Integer 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 ' Draws a line horizontally across the centre of the form
 Draw.Line (0, ME.Height / 2, ME.Width, ME.Height / 2)
 ' Draws a line vertically down the centre of the form
 Draw.Line (ME.Width / 2, 0,ME.Width / 2, ME.Height)
 ' Draws a line from the top left, to the bottom right
 Draw.Line (0, 0,ME.Width, ME.Height)
 ' Draws a line from the top right, to the bottom left
 Draw.Line (ME.Width, 0,0, ME.Height)
 Draw.End
 END

When you want to manipulate the '''width of your line''' , then try this example:

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
 DIM B AS Integer 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Line(10,100, 20, 100)
      FOR B = 1 TO 100 STEP 10 
       Draw.LineWidth=B 
       Draw.Line(10+B,100, 20+B, 100)
      NEXT 
 Draw.End
 END

If you want to change '''the color of your line''' to white, then try this example:

 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.ForeColor = &amp;HFFFFFF
 Draw.Line(1, 130, 500, 400)
 Draw.End

The next small example will draw a box and '''fill it''' with white color.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
  Draw.FillColor = &amp;HFFFFFF
  draw.FillStyle = 1
  'draw.ForeColor = &amp;HFFFFFF the outline will be white also
  Draw.Rect (100, 100,200,200)
 Draw.End
 END

==The Spiral Program== 

This program shows you a nice spiral. 
There is no scale command in Gambas (at least, not yet). Therefore the x and y coordinates are transformed in the program. The coordinate system ranges from xmin = - 2 to xmax = 2 and ymin = - 2 to ymax = 2. 

You need a Drawingarea and a Commandbutton to get the example going. 

How does this look ? See [http://www.madeasy.de/7/prgspir.htm] 

The code: 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM dymax AS Integer
 DIM dymin AS Integer 
 DIM ymax AS Integer
 DIM ymin AS Integer
 DIM y AS Float
 DIM dy AS Float
 DIM dyi AS Integer
 DIM dxmax AS Integer
 DIM dxmin AS Integer 
 DIM xmax AS Integer
 DIM xmin AS Integer
 DIM x AS Float
 DIM dx AS Float
 DIM dxi AS Integer
 DIM k AS Float 
 DIM a AS Float 
 DIM w AS Float
 dymax = DrawingArea1.Height
 dymin = 0 
 ymax = 2
 ymin = -2
 dxmax = DrawingArea1.Width
 dxmin = 0 
 xmax = 2
 xmin = -2 
 'x-axis is drawn 
 FOR x = xmin TO xmax STEP 0.005
 y = 0 
 dy = CFloat(y - ymin) / (ymax - ymin ) * (dymax - dymin) + dymin 
 dx = CFloat(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin ) * (dxmax - dxmin) + dxmin 
 dyi = Fix(dy)
 dxi = Fix(dx) 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Point(dxi,DrawingArea1.Height- dyi)
 Draw.End
 NEXT 
 'y - Axis is drawn
 FOR y = ymin TO ymax STEP 0.005
 x = 0 
 dy = CFloat(y - ymin) / (ymax - ymin ) * (dymax - dymin) + dymin 
 dx = CFloat(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin ) * (dxmax - dxmin) + dxmin 
 dyi = Fix(dy)
 dxi = Fix(dx) 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Point(dxi,DrawingArea1.Height- dyi)
 Draw.End
 NEXT 
 'Here the spiral starts
 FOR k = -100 TO 150 STEP 0.5
 a = 0.97
 'Distance from 0,0 to the point 
 w = 0.15
 'Angle under whiche the point is seen from the origin
 a = a ^k 
 w = w * k 
 x = a * Cos(w)
 'x coordinate of each point
 y = a * Sin(w)
 'y coordinate of each point
 dy = CFloat(y - ymin) / (ymax - ymin ) * (dymax - dymin) + dymin 
 dx = CFloat(x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin ) * (dxmax - dxmin) + dxmin 
 dyi = Fix(dy)
 dxi = Fix(dx) 
 Draw.Begin(DrawingArea1)
 Draw.Point(dxi,DrawingArea1.Height- dyi)
 Draw.End
 NEXT
 END

When I first started to program on a computer I used the Basic interpreter on the C64. Then I moved to MS Dos and GWBasic/Qbasic. The next step was Visual Basic 3. At the same time the Internet came into use. So I put all my mini VB programs on the Internet. This was very helpful for me and others.
After lots of bluescreens the divorce from MS was done in 2002. Linux and KDE were my new favourites and they still are.

But what I always missed was VB for Linux and KDE. My old brain could not get used to C++ or Java. 
At Christmas time in 2003 I discovered Gambas built by Mr. Minisini and friends. It was a hit from the beginning. 
So I started converting all my mini VB programs to Gambas. ( So called Minisinis) 

I think Gambas will be very successful. To promote it, I will put all my mini programs here under GNU as a wikibook.

Everyone is invited to improve my bad English and to improve this Wikibook.

==The Key Code Program ==

With this simple miniprogram you can check out the keycode of a button you have pressed. 
You only need a Form to get the program going. 
Once you started the program and you use a button on your keyboard, the keycode is printed in the terminal window. 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB Form_KeyRelease()
 PRINT key.code
 END 

==The Key Release Program ==

With this miniprogram you can check the arrow keys. When they are used and released a new information is shown. 

You need a textbox to get the program going. 

Once you started the program and you use an arrow key in the textbox, the content of the textbox will change. 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB TextBox1_KeyRelease()
 SELECT Key.code
  CASE Key.left
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Left&quot;
  CASE Key.right
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Right&quot;
  CASE Key.up
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Up&quot;
  CASE Key.down
   Textbox1.Text =&quot;Down&quot;
 END SELECT
 END

==Input Restrictions==

If you want a textbox to accept  only digits you should use the command '''STOP EVENT'''.

Example 

You need a textbox on your form to get it going. 

 PUBLIC SUB MyTextBox_KeyPress()
   IF Instr(&quot;0123456789&quot;, Key.Text) = 0 THEN
    STOP EVENT
  ENDIF
 END SUB

Example2 

You can reach nearly  the same with the following code:

 PUBLIC SUB TextBox1_KeyPress()
    IF key.Code &gt;= 48 AND key.Code &lt;= 57 THEN 
    ELSE IF key.Code = key.BackSpace THEN 
    ELSE IF key.Code = key.Delete THEN 
    ELSE 
      STOP EVENT 
  ENDIF 
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
  ME.Text = &quot;Only digits accepted !&quot;
 END

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Mouse Coordinate Program ==

This program will show the coordinates of the mousepointer continuously in two textboxes, when the left mousebutton is pressed. 
You need a form with a drawingarea and two textboxes to get the program going. 
See how it looks like here: 
http://www.madeasy.de/7/prgmausxy1.htm

The upper left corner of the drawing area has the coordinates (0,0). The right lower corner has the coordinates (drawingArea1.width, drawingarea1.height ) 

The Code 

 PUBLIC SUB DrawingArea1_MouseMove()
 Textbox1.text = Mouse.X 
 Textbox2.text = Mouse.Y 
 END

You can simplify the program, when you work without the drawingarea. The code should look like this. 

 PUBLIC SUB Form1_MouseMove()
 Textbox1.text = Mouse.X 
 Textbox2.text = Mouse.Y 
 END

Try it out !

We can even get rid of the textboxes using the print command instead. Then the coordinates appear in the terminal window. 

The code should look like this. 

 PUBLIC SUB Form1_MouseMove()
 PRINT mouse.X 
 PRINT Mouse.Y 
 END

Try it out !

Be aware that the DrawingArea is the only control in Gambas ( at current version 2.n) that tracks mouse movement.
Other controls will only provide Mouse coordenates on the Mouse down event.
Additionally they have ENTER and LEAVE functions which provide the 'Mouse Over' functionality.

==The Clipboard Program ==
This program shows you the use of the clipboard in Gambas. 
You need 2 commandbuttons and 2 textareas to get the program going. 

The Code: 

 ' Gambas class file
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Clipboard.Copy (Textarea1.Text)
 'Copy Text into the Clipboard 
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button2_Click()
 Textarea2.Text  = Clipboard.Paste ()
 'get the text out of the clipboard

==Ingredients==
* 1 pint shucked large [[Cookbook:Oyster|oysters]], cleaned and dried
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* &amp;frac14; cup [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]]
* 2 cups fine [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]] or [[Cookbook:Cracker|cracker]] crumbs
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Pepper|Black pepper]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|Cayenne pepper]], to taste
* [[Cookbook:Vegetable oil|Vegetable oil]], to fry
Serves 4 as an entrée, or 8 as an appetizer

==Procedure==
# Take the cleaned oysters and place them on a clean towel and dry.
# Beat the eggs and cream together, and place in a shallow bowl. 
# Combine the bread or cracker crumbs with the salt, pepper, and cayenne. Place in a shallow bowl or on a plate
# With a fork dip each oyster individually in the egg and lay them on the cracker, and with the back of a spoon pat the cracker close to the oyster; lay them an a dish, and so continue until are done. 
# Heat the oil in a frying-pan, the amount of oil will vary with the cooking method used. [[Cookbook:Deep frying|Deep fry]], [[Cookbook:Pan frying|pan fry]], or [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] the oysters in the pan, but do not crowd them; cook in batches if needed. Fry quickly a light brown on both sides; a 1 or 2 minutes a side should be enough.  Serve hot.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== C89 vs C99 ==

It's reasonable to mention single-line comments, which are supported by the C99 standard, but there isn't, as far as I know, a single compiler around that fully supports C99 yet. The majority of compilers in use are C89 and the C++ one-line comment is not part of that standard. Compilers that allow single-line comments through without warning usually do so as a courtesy, and if strict ANSI is enforced they will not be allowed (e.g. my gcc compiler will not allow them with the &lt;code&gt;-ansi&lt;/code&gt; flag). I would prefer the tutorial to adhere to one standard or another, say which one it is, and stick to it. If it's going to be C89 then I'd outlaw single-line comments in an effort ot encourage good practice. I would also not use &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt; to indicate no arguments to main. C89 mandates the use of &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt; for that. -- [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] 23:29, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

::As of 2013 the majority of compiler implements C99, and virtually all of them implement single-line comments. Maybe that should be mentioned in the article, since C99 is not a &quot;very recent addition&quot; any more. Moreover I was quite surprised to see that for loop initial declarations are not used in this page, which is also a C99 feature available on many compilers and is in my opinion a lot better than the C89 style. (even Visual Studio 2013 will implement that). Is it okay if I modify the page with 
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
1  for(int i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
&lt;/code&gt;

instead of
 
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;
1  int i;&lt;br /&gt;
2  for(i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
&lt;/code&gt;

? Or do you want to let it in a C89 style (but then why mention C99 comments?)? --[[User:Asteba|Asteba]] ([[User talk:Asteba|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Asteba|contribs]]) 22:11, 4 November 2013 (UTC)

== Indentation Wars ==

To indent with spaces or with tabs seems to be one of those issues that cause programmers to go to war with one another - much like the emacs vs vi battles or the OS battles.  I don't want to fan that fire, but having been a programmer for some 25 years now, I have adopted an indentation style that I believe strikes a fair compromise.  

The reason people support tabs is because then they can change the indentation from 4 to 2, or from 2 to 3, or to whatever they like.  The problem with tabs is that in a ''lot'' of cases, unless they have the same setting that the original programmer used, things go all whacky and nothing lines up.

The reason people support spaces over tabs is because it doesn't matter what the tab stops are set to, the code always looks the same.  I was in this camp for a long time.  The problem with spaces is that the person reading the code cannot easily change it to the way he likes it, and it makes for bigger files (though the latter argument is pretty weak in these days of terabyte hard drives).

Here's what I do.  I use tabs to indent to the level that the code needs to be indented, and then I use spaces to line things up.  Start with tabs, followed by lining up with spaces.  An example would be this chunk-o-code:
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;

  1  void foo(void)
  2  {
  3    int i;
  4
  5    for(i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
  6    {
  7      printf(&quot;This is a very long line of stuff to print out, because I'm printing a variable: 0x%x\n&quot;,
  8             some_struct[i].with.sub_elements;    
  9    }
 10  }
&lt;/code&gt;
Here, lines 3, 5, 6, and 9 would have a single leading tab, because they are indented one level.  Lines 7 and 8 would have two leading tabs, but line 8 would have 7 spaces following the two leading tabs.  The spaces are there to line up the second argument to the printf with the opening parenthesis of the printf.  If tabs were used for this, then the alignment would be dependent on the tab settings.  Here's the same code again, but I'm representing tabs with \t and spaces with @ signs:
&lt;code lang=&quot;C&quot;&gt;

  1  void foo(void)
  2  {
  3  \tint i;
  4
  5  \tfor(i=0; i&lt;12; i++)
  6  \t{
  7  \t\tprintf(&quot;This is a very long line of stuff to print out, because I'm printing a variable: 0x%x\n&quot;,
  8  \t\t@@@@@@@some_struct[i].with.sub_elements;    
  9  \t}
 10  }
&lt;/code&gt;
No matter what the tabs stops are set to, line 8 will always align the arguments of the printf as desired.  In case anyone cares.  The problem with adding any indentation approach (including this one) ito a book like this is that it tends to excite religious pogroms.  Pogroms from programs so to speak. So I don't necessarily think this should be added to the chapter.  I just like to put it out there.

:: I'm not sure that the inability for a programmer to change the code indentation to the way he (or she) likes it is a reason to mix tabs and spaces. In-house styles are usually adopted so that code is easy to read and maintain. If a coder wants to change that to a personal preference that really is an issue s/he has to address. Tabs do not work. Try printing out code for review and prefixing each line with a line number, and see what happens to your tabbed code. Remember that editors that insert line numbers can separate the number from the code with a tab. Our company has forbidden the use of tabs ''unless'' the IDE is set to 4 spaces and 'insert spaces instead of tabs' is activated. This is not a whim. Far too much code was affected by tabs and experience has shown all coders abide by the rule because it works. [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] ([[User talk:Mickraus|talk]]) 18:15, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
::: Mixing tabs and spaces are acceptable within that context.  The main issue is that IDEs form their own context on whether or not a tab should exist, and make it difficult to switch between the two; if you want to see an example where incorrect tabbing can prevent compilation or proper execution, see either [[Python]] or Whitespace.  Also, if prefixing lines with line numbers messed up printing, then there's a problem with how you are adding line numbers.  These line numbers should be located within the margin, and should not disrupt the tabbing within the program.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 21:38, 2 October 2009 (UTC)
:::: The notion of a margin does not exist when printing source code as plain text. My coders simply tick a box 'Display line numbers' then print out the file. I'm not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;within that context&quot;. Within which context? [[User:Mickraus|Mickraus]] ([[User talk:Mickraus|talk]]) 22:49, 3 October 2009 (UTC)
::::: If you're printing as plaintext, then you're using default margins as decided by the printer, print driver or operating system. If the editor you are using prepends line numbers without manually managing either margins or tabs, you code will experience indentation issues. My IDE handles it perfectly, regardless of tab size and inclusion of line numbers; there may still be a setting that needs to be applies before printing (or a filter you could use that auto-converts tabs into the correct number of spaces.)  
::::: The context I was referring to was the example that showed mixing tabs and spaces for a person's in-house style to align parameters within a multi-line function call. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 23:35, 3 October 2009 (UTC)</text>

This low-fat cake recipe is very common with unique variations.  The cake is simple to make and does not require you to start from scratch.  All the ingredients can be found at your local grocery stores.  

==Cake==
*  One box of yellow cake mix (approximately 1 lb. &amp; 2.25 ounces or 500 grams)
*  One 11 ounce (312 grams) can of mandarin oranges
*  Three medium size eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degree Fahrenheit (180°C).  If using non-stick baking pans, still need to grease sides and bottom with shortening and cover surface lightly with flour.  Pour yellow cake mix into mixing bowl.  Add eggs and mandarin oranges (including its juice).  Do not need to add oil, margarine, or butter.  Blend until moistened and beat for approximately 2 minutes at medium speed.  Pour mix evenly into baking pans.  Bake approximately 30 minutes or per cake mix instruction (inserted toothpick into center comes out clean).  Remove from oven and let the cakes cool.

==Icing==
*  One box of '''instant''' vanilla pudding mix (5.1 ounces or 144 grams)
*  One 20 ounce (567 grams) can of crushed pineapples
*  One 12 ounce (340 grams) container of CoolWhip, found in the frozen section

Scoop CoolWhip into a clean mixing bowl.  Add the instant vanilla pudding mix.  Drain all the pineapple juice from the can of crushed pineapples and fold into CoolWhip.  Mix all the ingredients evenly, do not use a blender.  For better results, chill icing for about 30 minutes.

After the cake cools, frost each layer with your icing.  Each serving is approximately 275 calories with about 4 to 5 grams of fat.  Like everything else, moderation is always best.

{{Embedded Systems/Page}}

Manufactured by Microchip, the PIC (&quot;Programmable Intelligent Computer&quot; or &quot;Peripheral Interface Controller&quot; ) microcontroller is popular among engineers and hobbyists alike. PIC microcontrollers come in a variety of &quot;flavors&quot;, each with different components and capabilities.

Many types of electronic projects can be constructed easily with the PIC family of microprocessors, among them clocks, very simple video games, robots, servo controllers, and many more. The PIC is a very general purpose microcontroller that can come with many different options, for very reasonable prices.

Other microprocessors in this family include the [[w:Parallax SX|Parallax SX]], the [http://www.holtek.com/ Holtek HT48FxxE Series], and some &quot;PIC-on-a-FPGA&quot; implementations.

== History ==

General Instruments produced a chip called the PIC1650, described as a Programmable Intelligent Computer. This chip is the mother of all PIC chips&lt;s&gt;, functionally close to the current 16C54&lt;/s&gt;. It was intended as a peripheral for their CP1600 microprocessor. Maybe that is why most people think PIC stands for Peripheral Interface Controller. Microchip has never used PIC as an abbreviation, just as PIC. And recently Microchip has started calling its PICs microcontrollers PICmicro MCU's.

== Which PIC to Use==

How do you find a PIC that is right for you out of nearly 2000 different models of PIC microcontrollers?

The Microchip website has an excellent [http://www.microchip.com/productselector/MCUProductSelector.html Product Selector Tool].  You simply enter your minimum requirements and optionally desired requirements, and the resulting part numbers are displayed with the basic features listed.

You can buy your PIC processors directly from [http://www.microchipdirect.com/ Microchip Direct], Microchip's online store.  Pricing is the same or sometimes better than many distributors.

Rule Number 1: only pick a microprocessor you can actually obtain. PICs are all similar, and therefore you don't need to be too picky about which model to use.

If there is only 1 kind of PIC available in your school storeroom, use it.
If you order from a company such as [http://www.newark.com Newark] or [http://digikey.com DigiKey] , ignore any part that is &quot;out of stock&quot; -- only order parts that are &quot;in stock&quot;. This will save you lots of time in creating your project.

=== Recommended &quot;first PIC&quot; ===

At one time, the PIC16F84 was far and away the best PIC for hobbyists.
But Microchip, Parallax, and Holtek are now manufacturing many chips that are even better and often even cheaper, because of the higher level of production.


#''I'd like a list of the top 4 or so PIC recommendations, and *why* they were recommended, so that when better/cheaper chips become available, it's easy to confirm and add them to the list.''



(Summarizing [http://techref.massmind.org/techref/piclist/begin.htm  PICList Beginners checklist for PIC Microcontrollers], [http://amqrp.org/elmer160/lessons/index.html PIC Elmer 160: Appendix &quot;A&quot;:  &quot;Other PICs&quot; 2003], and [http://www.voti.nl/swp/n_index.html Wouter van Ooijen] :)

PIC: Select a chip and [http://techref.massmind.org/techref/supplies.htm buy one].

Many people recommend the following PICs as a good choice for the &quot;first PIC&quot; for a hobbyist, take in count the revision numbers (like the A in 16F628A):

* '''PIC18F4620''': it has 13 analog inputs -- Wouter van Ooijen recommends that hobbyists use the largest and most capable chip available[http://www.voti.nl/swp/n_index.html], and this is it (as of 2006-01). ~$9
* &lt;s&gt;'''PIC16F877A''' -- the largest chip of the 16F87x family; has 8 analog inputs -- recommended by Wouter (#2); AmQRP; PICList. ~$8&lt;/s&gt;
*'''PIC16F877A''' , this is probably the most popular PIC used by the hobbyist community that is still under production. This is the best PIC of its family and used to be &quot;the PIC&quot; for bigger hobbyist projects, along with the PIC16F84 for smaller ones. Features 14KB of program memory, 368 bytes of RAM, a 40 pin package, 2 CPP modules, 8 ADC channels capable of 10-bit each. It also counts with the UART and MSSP, which is a SSP capable of being  ''master'', controlling any devices connected to the I2c and SPI busses. The lack of internal oscillator, as opposed to the other PICs mentioned until now, is something to be aware of. Also, this PIC is relatively expensive for the features included. This may be caused by Microchip to force the migration to better chips. --recommended by Ivaneduardo747; Wouter (#2); AmQRP --[http://www.sparkfun.com/products/226]. ~$9
* &lt;s&gt;'''PIC16F88''' -- has 7 analog inputs -- recommended by AmQRP; [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=PIC%20Boot%20Loader SparkFun]. ~$5&lt;/s&gt;
*'''PIC16F88''', this is enhanced version of the PIC16F628A. It has all the features of the 16F628, plus twice the program memory, 7KB; seven 10-bit ADCs, a SSP (Synchronous Serial Port), capable of receiving messages sent over I2C and SPI busses. It also supports self-programming, a feature used by some development boards to avoid the need of using a programmer, saving the cost of buying a programmer.  --recommended by Ivaneduardo747; AmQRP -- [http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/present.php?p=PIC%20Boot%20Loader SparkFun]. ~$5
* &lt;s&gt;'''PIC16F628''' -- Cheaper than the PIC16F84A, with a built-in 4MHz clock and a UART, but lacks any analog inputs -- recommended by Wouter (#3); AmQRP  --  ~$4&lt;/s&gt;
*'''PIC16F628A''', this is a good starter PIC because of its compatibility with what used to be one of the hobbyist's favorite PICs: the PIC16F84. This way, the beginner can select from a vast catalog of projects and programs, specially when created in low level languages like the PIC Assembler. It features a 18 pin package, 3.5KB of Flash Memory, can execute up to 5 million instructions per second (MIPS) using a 20MHZ crystal. The lack of an Analog-Digital Converter (ADC) is something to point out. As opposed to the PIC16F84A it has an UART, which is capable of generating and receiving RS-232 signals, which is very useful for debugging. Some people use to find ironic that this chip is cheaper than the less-featured PIC16F84A. -- recommended by Ivaneduardo747; Wouter (#3) AmQRP -- ~$5
* '''PIC16F1936''', a powerful mid-range PIC, comes with an 11 channel, 10-bit ADC; two indirect pointer registers; XLP (extreme low power) for low power consumption on battery powered devices. -- recommended by some people on the PIClist as a faster, better, cheaper replacement for the 16F877. -- ~$3
*'''PIC12F683''', a small 8-pin microcontroller. It is a good microcontroller for small applications due to its small size and relatively high power and diverse features, like 4 ADC channels and internal 4MHZ oscillator. --recommended by Ivaneduardo747; [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/215]. ~$2.50

''Of the many new parts Microchip has introduced since 2003, are any of them significantly better for hobbyists in some way than these chips ?''
''Todo: Does [http://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/442/starting-out-pic-programming &quot;Starting out PIC Programming: What would be a good PIC chip to start out with?&quot;] have any useful recommendations to add to the above?''

There are several different &quot;families&quot;:

=== More selection tips ===

* The &quot;F&quot; Suffix implies that the chip has reprogrammable Flash memory.
  PIC10F -- in super-tiny 6 pin packages
  PIC12F -- in tiny 8-pin packages
  PIC14F
  PIC16F 
  PIC18F
  PIC24F
  PIC24E
  PIC24H
  dsPIC30F
  dsPIC33F
  dsPIC33E
 
* The &quot;C&quot; suffix implies that the chip uses EPROM memory. A few of these chips used to be erased with a very expensive Ultra-Violet eraser. This method was primarily used by companies. But most of these chips are specifically made so that once you write it you can't change it: it's OTP (one-time programmable). People used to check their programs minutely before programming them into such chips.   Recently, this chips are becoming less used as the cost of Flash memory decreases, but some of them are still used because of their reliability or reduced costs.
  PIC12C
  PIC16C
  PIC17C
  PIC18C

Each family has one &quot;full&quot; member with all the goodies and a subset of variant members that lack one thing or another. For example, on the 16F84 family, the 16F84 was the fully featured PIC, with Flash memory and twice the program space of the 16F83. The family was also composed by the 16C84 and 16C83, one of the few reprogrammable C suffix PICs.
For prototyping, we generally use the &quot;full&quot; version to make sure we can get the prototype working ''at all''.
During prototyping we want to tweak code, reprogram, and test, over and over until it works. So we use one of the above &quot;Flash&quot; families, not the &quot;OTP&quot; families, unless required. For short production, the C parts are recommended. For very long production lines some PICs with mask-programmed ROMs where used. Now in-factory preprogramming is available from Microchip.

Each member of each family generally comes in several different packages. Hobbyists generally use the plastic dual inline package (often called DIP or PDIP) because it's the easiest to stick in a [[Practical Electronics/Breadboard | solderless breadboard]] and tinker with. (The &quot;wide-DIP&quot; works just as well). They avoid using ceramic dual inline package (CDIP), not because ceramic is bad (it's just as easy to plug into a solderless breadboard), but because the plastic parts work just as well and are much cheaper.

(Later, for mass production, we may figure out which is the cheapest cut-down version that just barely has enough goodies to work, and comes in the cheapest package that has just barely enough pins for this particular application &lt;s&gt;... perhaps even a OTP chip&lt;/s&gt;).

And then each different package, for each member of each family, comes in both a &quot;commercial temperature range&quot; and a &quot;industrial temperature range&quot;.

=== PIC 16x ===

The PIC 16 family is considered to be a good, general purpose family of PICs. PIC 16s generally have 3 output ports to work with. Here are some models in this family that were once common:
&lt;s&gt;
#PIC 16C54 - The original PIC model, the 'C54 is available in an 18 pin DIP, with 12 I/O pins.
#PIC 16C55 - available in a 28-pin DIP package, with 20 available I/O pins
#PIC 16C56 - Same form-factor as the 'C54, but more features
#PIC 16C57 - same form-factor as the 'C55, but more features
#PIC 16C71 - has 4 available ADC, which are mapped to the same pins as Port A (dual-use pins).
#PIC 16C84 - has the ability to erase and reprogram in-circuit EEPROMs
&lt;/s&gt;
Many programs written for the PIC16x family are available for free on the Internet.

Flash-based chips such as the PIC16F88 are far more convenient to develop on, and can run code written for the above chips with little or no changes.

=== PIC 12x ===

The PIC12x series is the smallest series with 8 pins and up to 6 available I/O pins. These are used when space and/or cost is a factor.

=== PIC 18x ===

The PIC 18x series are available in a 28 and 40-pin DIP package. They have more ports, more ADC, etc... PIC 18s are generally considered to be very high-end microcontrollers, and are even sometimes called full-fledged CPUs.

Microchip is currently (as of 2007) producing 6 Flash microcontrollers with a USB interface. All are in the PIC18Fx family. (The 28 pin PIC18F2450, PIC18F2455, PIC18F2550; and the 40/44 pin PIC18F4450, PIC18F4455, PIC18F4550 ).

== The PIC Stack ==

The PIC stack is a dedicated bank of registers (separate from programmer-accessible registers) that can only be used to store return addresses during a function call (or interrupt).

* 12 bit: A PIC microcontroller with a 12 bit core (the first generation of PIC microcontrollers) ( including most PIC10, some PIC12, a few PIC16 ) only has 2 registers in its hardware stack. Subroutines in a 12-bit PIC program may only be nested ''2 deep'', before the stack overflows, and data is lost. People who program 12 bit PICs spend a lot of effort working around this limitation. (These people are forced to rely heavily on techniques that avoid using the hardware stack. For example, macros, state machines, and software stacks).

* 14 bit: A PIC microcontroller with a 14 bit core (most PIC16) has 8 registers in the hardware stack. This makes function calls much easier to use, even though people who program them should be aware of some remaining gotchas [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/pages.htm].

* 16 bit: A PIC microcontroller with a 16 bit core (all PIC18) has a &quot;31-level deep&quot; hardware stack depth. This is more than deep enough for most programs people write.

Many algorithms involving pushing data to, then later pulling data from, some sort of stack.
People who program such algorithms on the PIC must use a separate software stack for data (reminiscent of [[Forth]]). (People who use other microprocessors often share a single stack for both subroutine return addresses and this &quot;stack data&quot;).

Call-tree analysis can be used to find the deepest possible subroutine nesting used by a program. (Unless the program uses [[w:recursion]]).
As long as the deepest possible nesting of the &quot;main&quot; program, plus the deepest possible nesting of the interrupt routines, give a total sum less than the size of the stack of the microcontroller it runs on, then everything works fine.
Some compilers automatically do such call-tree analysis, and if the hardware stack is insufficient, the compiler automatically switches over to using a &quot;software stack&quot;.
Assembly-language programmers are forced to do such analysis by hand.

== What else do you need ==

=== Compilers, Assemblers ===

Versions of BASIC, C, Forth, and a few other programming languages are available for PICmicros.
See [[Embedded Systems/PIC Programming]].

=== downloaders ===

You need a device called a &quot;downloader&quot; to transfer compiled programs from your PC and burn them into the microcontroller.
(Unfortunately &quot;programming&quot; has 2 meanings -- see [[Embedded_Systems/Terminology#programming]]).)

There are 2 styles of downloaders.
If you have your PIC in your system and you want to change the software,
* with a &quot;IC programmer&quot; style device, you must pull out the PIC, plug it into the &quot;IC programmer&quot;, reprogram, then put the PIC back in your system.
* with a &quot;in circuit programmer&quot; style device (ICSP), you don't touch the PIC itself -- you plug a cable from the programmer directly into a header that you have (hopefully) placed next to the PIC, reprogram, then unplug the cable.

An (incomplete) list of programmers includes:

* Many other programmers are listed at [http://massmind.org/techref/microchip/devprogs.htm MassMind].

Many people prefer to use a &quot;bootloader&quot; for programming whenever possible.
Bootloaders are covered in detail in chapter
[[../Bootloaders and Bootsectors/]]
.

=== Power Supply ===

The most important part of any electronic circuit is the power supply. The PIC programmer requires a +5 volt and a +13 volt regulated power supply. The need for two power supplies is due to the different programming algorithms:
* High Power Programming Mode - In this mode, we enter the programming mode of the PIC by driving the RB7(Data) and RB6(CLOCK) pins of the PIC low while driving the MCLR pin from 0 to VCC(+13v).
* Low Power Programming Mode - This alogrithm requires only +5v for the programming operation. In this algorithm, we drive RB3(PGM) from VDD to GND to enter the programming mode and then set MCLR to VDD(+5v).

This is already taken care of inside the PIC burner hardware.
If you are curious as to how this is done, you might want to look at the various PIC burner hardware schematics online.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pin Diagrams ===

=== Oscillator Circuits ===

Not all the PIC microcontrollers have built-in RC oscillator circuits available, although they are slow, and have high granularity. External oscillator circuits may be applied as well, up to a maximum frequency of 20MHz. PIC instructions require 4 clock cycles for each machine instruction cycle, and therefore can run at a maximum effective rate of 5MHz.
However, certain PICs have a PLL (phase locked loop) multiplier built in. The user can enable the Times 4 multiplier, thus yielding a virtual oscillator frequency of 4 X External Oscillator. For example, with a maximum allowable oscillator of 16MHz, the virtual oscillator runs at 64MHz. Thus, the PIC will perform 64 / 4 = 16 MIPS (million instructions per second).
Certain pics also have built-in oscillators, usually 4Mhz for precisely 1MIPS, or a low-power imprecise 48kHz.  This frees up to two I/O pins for other purposes.  The pins can also be used to produce a frequency if you want to synchronize other hardware to the same clock as one PIC's internal one.

This is my private sandbox, and a window to possible future improvements of Wikibooks. Not all the things are working yet, but they will be released gradually when the time is right.

===Main page design===
[[User:Andreas Ipp/Main_Page_suggestion]]
{{CURRENTDAYNAME}}, {{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, {{CURRENTTIME}} UTC 

month:{{CURRENTMONTH}} 

week: {{CURRENTWEEK}}

===Book of the month===
Have a book of the month with vote, like the German Wikipedia version.

* Subpages for voting - template for main page with month

===Most active Wikibooks===
* Database query for Top 5: [[m:Database queries on MediaWiki]]

===The standard Wikibook===
Book idea: Take all existing Wikibooks and choose the best parts of each (structural, navigational..), then write a standard Wikibook, which might help others to get ideas for their own books.
Topics:
* Printer friendly version, screen reading version
* Navigation: Next / Previous, as well as a table of contents
* Link to good existing books, as well as bad existing books.
* Introduction: Is Wikibooks the right place for me? Other Wikis, TravelWiki, etc.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Lipids are a structuraly diverse class of biological molecules whose defining properties are hydrophobicity and solubility in organic solvents. Lipids have several roles including energy storage and cell signalling and are the major constituent of cell membranes.


===Fatty Acids===
A fatty acid is simple a linear carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group at one end.

Fatty acids usually have between 10 and 24 carbon atoms and may have one or more double bonds. These double bonds are almost always in the cis configuration. 

Fatty acids have both common names and systematic names. The systematic name is based on the alkane or alkene with the same number of carbon atoms, with the final ''e'' of the hydrocarbon replaced with ''oic acid''.  For example Laurate (Figure x) [[Image:Laurate.png]] is a fatty acid with 12 carbon atoms and no double bonds, so the systematic name is dodecanoic acid, and the ionized form is dodecanoate. 
(saturated fatty acid table)
If there are double bonds, the location is marked with the symbol &amp;Delta; with a superscript number indicating the location of the double bond and preceded by ''cis'' or ''trans'' to indicate configuration (but almost invariably ''cis''). Carbon atoms are counted from the carboxyl end, as in Figure x, so a dodecenoate acid with a cis double bond between carbon atoms 9 and 10 would be: ''cis''-&amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-dodecenoate.

The number 2, 3 and last carbon atom are called the &amp;alpha;, &amp;beta; and &amp;omega; atoms, respectively.

===Phosphoglycerides And Sphingolipids===
Fatty acids can be linked to glycerol to form monoacylglycerols, diacylglycerides and triacylglycerides.

One class of phospholipids are the phosphoglycerides, which are made from diacylglycerides linked to a phosphate group. Phosphoglycerides usually have the following arrangement:
* Hydroxyl #1 of glycerol is usually esterified to a saturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #2 of glycerol is usually esterified to an unsaturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #3 of glycerol is esterified to a phosphate group
[[Image:Phospholipid.svg]] 
There are four common phosphate groups. Serine, ethanolamine and choline are structuraly similar, while inositol is different:
[[Image:Cholinemet.png]]
[[File:Inositol monochrome.svg]]

'''Sphingolipids''', have the same overall shape as phosphoglycerides but have different chemistry, using sphingosine in place of glycerol. Sphingosine has a long hydrocarbon tail similar to fatty acids attached to a structure that is similar to the amino acid serine. A fatty acid can attach to the amine group, and a &quot;head&quot; group can attach to a hydroxyl (see Figure x). Sphingolipids are named according to this head group:
* If there is no head group it is called a ceramide
* If the head group is phosphate and choline, it is called sphingomyelin
* If the head group is a sugar, it is called a glycosphingolipid (or a glycolipid)

The majority of sphingolipids are of the third type, glycosphingolipids. It is thought they have functions in cell recognition and protection in addition to there structural role in the membrane.

When mixed in water, phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids will form two chararistics structures. '''Micelles''' are spheres constructed from these lipids, with the hydrophobic tails interacting with one another inside the sphere and the polar head groups interacting with water at the surface of the sphere. These lipids will also for whats known as a '''lipid bilayers''. These are sheets composed of two layers of lipids where the hydrophobic tails stick into the center and the polar head groups are on the surface interacting with water. Cell membranes are composed of lipid bilayers.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">I recommend developing this book as a high school (American ages 14-18) geometry text. To aid in doing so, I have developed an outline of topics reflecting the [http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ California curriculum content standards], as the [[Wikibooks:Textbook_Standards|wikibooks &quot;standards&quot; link]] suggests. I have placed that outline in the &quot;outline&quot; link below. I hope to start developing this table of contents to reflect that outline. The remainder of the table of contents (starting with &quot;Part I- Euclidean Geometry:&quot;) is a year old or more (though some of its content is newer). I think it will be difficult to develop that table of contents into a textbook, first because it covers topics from elementary school to graduate school and beyond, second because it seems to lack the logical structure necessary to produce a systematic development of the subject (but perhaps I'm simply too ignorant of geometry to see the structure the previous editor had in mind). Of course part of the point of wiki is that you can do whatever you like with these suggestions, so feel free to ignore me.

[[User:271828|271828]] 20:46, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've put in a short list of chapters (1-5) below following the scheme of the outline in the outline link below and divided from the earlier chapter/subject markings. I hope to begin filling in those chapters soon.

[[User:271828|271828]] 18:43, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've expanded the introduction below to reflect the content of the outline. If you are kind enough to consider contributing to this text, I hope you will glance at the introduction to see the scheme I have laid out for this book. Of course you do not have to honor it, but every book needs an organizational principle; and I think mine is at least plausible, if not nearly perfect.

Also I suggest a modification of the standard wiki naming convention for the internal links in this text. I propose the hierarchy be literally as follows:

*Geometry:
*Geometry: Chapter 1
*Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 1
*Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 2
*...
*Geometry: Chapter 2
*Geometry: Chapter 2: Section 1
*etc.

The point is that this makes it easy to link each section to the next and each chapter to the next. You can write a link &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Geometry: Chapter 1: Section 2]],&lt;/nowiki&gt; without having to worry that the link name will change, even though the content may change dramatically. At the very least, please remember that every page must start with Geometry: so that pages in this text don't replace pages in other texts.

[[Image:Teaspoon.jpg|right|thumb|120px|A teaspoon for eating]]

A '''teaspoon''' is a unit of volume measure equal to 1/3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]]. It is exactly equal to 5 mL. In the USA there are 16 teaspoons in 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], and there are 6 teaspoons in 1 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounce]].

&quot;'''Teaspoon'''&quot; may be abbreviated as '''t''' (note: lowercase letter t) or '''tsp'''.

A small spoon, as might be used for eating yogurt from a small container or adding sugar to tea, is about 1 teaspoon in size.

A '''tablespoon''' is a unit of measure equal to 1/16 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], 3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]], or 1/2 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounce]] in the USA. It is either approximately or (in some countries) exactly equal to 15 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]].

&quot;'''Tablespoon'''&quot; may be abbreviated as '''T''' (note: uppercase letter), '''tbl''', '''tbs''' or '''tbsp'''.

A typical large dinner spoon is about 1 tablespoon in size. It is not often the case, but some might consider the dinner spoon as the one used towards a normal bowl of soup or cereal. At any rate, it is not to be confused with a regular spoon for the amount of 1 tablespoon is a bit larger than a regular one.

The seldom-used imperial (post-1824 British) tablespoon is defined to be 18 mL, which is 20% larger than the Queen Anne tablespoon used in the USA. Thus, the Queen Anne (USA) tablespoon is 5/6 the size of the British one. The Australian (metric) tablespoon is even bigger, at 20 mL, while the teaspoon remains at 5 mL to give 4 teaspoons per tablespoon instead of the 3 teaspoons used elsewhere.

[[Image:Simple Measuring Cup.jpg|thumb|A simple measuring cup]]
A '''cup''' is a unit of volume measurement of volume equal to 16 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]], ½ [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]], ¼ [[Cookbook:Quart|quart]], or 8 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]].

A US cup is about 237 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]. Rougher equivalents are 240 mL and 250 mL, where the latter fits nicely with a US pint of 500 mL and a pound of 500 g.

A '''metric cup''' is '''250 mL''' in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]] and the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|UK]]. These countries previously used the imperial system, in which a cup would be 284 mL or 6/5 US cups.

A [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japanese]] rice cup is 180 ml. A measuring cup of this size is sometimes included with rice cookers.

A '''teacup''', often seen as a unit of measurement in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] recipes, is about 190 mL, or ⅔ of an imperial (UK) cup.

[[Image:Cell membrane drawing-en.svg|center]]


==Membranes And Lipids==
All cells, from simple prokaryotic bacteria to complex multicellular organisms are surrounded by a '''membrane'''. The membrane acts as a selective barrier, letting some substances into the cell and preventing other substances from entering. The membrane also actively transports substances between the inside and outside of the cell, using cellular energy to do so. This is important in regulating the concentration of many substances which must be maintained within strict limits. The cell also contains membrane bound compartments, where the membrane acts as a barrier for the separation of different environments, like lysosomes which have a high pH that would be toxic to the rest of the cell. This chapter is about the chemical composition of the membrane and how this creates the functionality of the membrane.

==The Lipid Bilayer==
The first person to link lipids with the cell membrane may have been Charles Ernest Overton, who was studying heredity in plants. Part of his studies involved studying which substances absorbed into plant cells most quickly. After characterizing a large number of substances, he came up with the idea that cell membranes were composed of something similar to the lipids found in vegetable oils, and that substances are absorbed into the cells by dissolving through the membrane.

The next big step came when Gorter and Grendel extracted the lipids from red blood cells and compared the surface area of the lipids spread out on water compared to the surface area of the red blood cells. They found the lipid surface area was twice that of the red blood cells, and concluded that the lipids must be arranged in a layer two lipid molecules thick. This is what biologists now call the '''lipid bilayer''', and to understand the construction of the bilayer, we need to understand the lipids themselves.



===Fatty Acids===
A fatty acid is simply a linear carbon chain with a carboxylic acid group at one end.

Fatty acids usually have between 14 and 24 carbon atoms and may have one or more double bonds. These double bonds are almost always in the cis configuration. 
[[Image:Arachidonate.png]]
Fatty acids have both common names and systematic names. The systematic name is based on the alkane or alkene with the same number of carbon atoms, with the final ''e'' of the hydrocarbon replaced with ''oic acid''.  For example Laurate (Figure x) [[Image:Laurate.png]] is a fatty acid with 12 carbon atoms and no double bonds, so the systematic name is dodecanoic acid, and the ionized form is dodecanoate. 
(saturated fatty acid table)
If there are double bonds, the location is marked with the symbol &amp;Delta; with a superscript number indicating the location of the double bond and preceded by ''cis'' or ''trans'' to indicate configuration (but almost invariably ''cis'' in natural fatty acids). Carbon atoms are counted from the carboxyl end, as in Figure x, so a dodecenoate acid with a cis double bond between carbon atoms 9 and 10 would be: ''cis''-&amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-dodecenoate.

The number 2, 3 and last carbon atom are called the &amp;alpha;, &amp;beta; and &amp;omega; atoms, respectively. 


One common shorthand for describing fatty acids is based on the fact that multiple double bonds are placed three bonds apart. This allows the acid to be described by the length of its carbon chain, number of double bonds, and location of the final double bond, relative to the &amp;omega; carbon.
Under this system, for instance, Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA),a very important constituent of membranes in the brain and eyes, can by listed as 22:6 &amp;omega;-3.
This corresponds to:
22 carbons and 6 double bonds,of which the final double bond is at &amp;omega;-3.
This is equivalent to 22:6 &amp;Delta;&lt;sup&gt;4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19&lt;/sup&gt;, or, in its full IUPAC form, cis-docosa - 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 - hexaenoic acid.

===Phosphoglycerides===
Phosphoglycerides are composed of a glycerol back bone with substituents in the following arrangements:
* Hydroxyl #1 of glycerol is usually esterified to a saturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #2 of glycerol is usually esterified to an unsaturated fatty acid
* Hydroxyl #3 of glycerol is esterified to a phosphate group
[[Image:Phospholipid.svg]] 
The simplest phosphoglyceride is phosphatidate (picture). Other phosphoglycerides can be made when a group with a hydroxyl is esterified to the phosphate group of phosphatidate. There are four common substituents for phosphatidate. Serine, ethanolamine and choline are structurally similar, while inositol is different:
[[Image:Cholinemet.png]]
[[File:Inositol monochrome.svg]]

When the fatty acid esterified to hydroxyl #2 is a cis- configured polyunsaturated fatty acid (i.e. one with more than one double bond), it tends to curl, and thus prevents the molecules from packing so closely together in a membrane. This makes the membrane more flexible.

===Sphingolipids===
''Sphingolipids''', have the same overall shape as phosphoglycerides but have different chemistry, using sphingosine in place of glycerol. Sphingosine has a long hydrocarbon tail similar to fatty acids attached to a structure that is similar to the amino acid serine. A fatty acid can attach to the amine group, and a &quot;head&quot; group can attach to a hydroxyl (see Figure x). Sphingolipids are named according to this head group:
* If there is no head group it is called a ceramide
* If the head group is phosphate and choline, it is called sphingomyelin
* If the head group is a sugar, it is called a glycosphingolipid (or a glycolipid)

The majority of sphingolipids are of the third type, glycosphingolipids. It is thought they have functions in cell recognition and protection in addition to their structural role in the membrane.


Sphingolipids are known to regulate activity in cells, such as immune responses, production of cells, and development of specialized cells. Although these are under the spatial and temporal control, it was recently discovered that sphingosine kinases will be focused on therapeutic effects on enzymes for people with cancer and other conditions.
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Sphingolipids general structures.png|General structures of sphingolipids
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Formation Of The Bilayer===
If we compare the structures of phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids, we see that they are very similar compounds. Each lipid has two long hydrophobic hydrocarbon &quot;tails&quot; and a single polar &quot;head&quot;. Since the molecule has both polar and nonpolar moieties, it is said to be '''amphipathic'''.  It is the amphipathic nature of these molecules that causes them to form bilayers, mediated by four forces:
* The hydrophobic effect- this causes the hydrophobic tails to come together. This is the strongest force driving the formation of the bilayer. It is a consequence of the increased entropy in water molecules when non polar substances are aggregated in water.
* Van der Walls forces between the hydrophobic tails.
* Electrostatic forces of the head groups. 
* Hydrogen bonds between the head groups.

One possible structure that satisfies the above forces is called a '''micelle''' (pictures). This is common with free fatty acids, but not with most phosphoglycerides and sphingolipids because these groups have twice as many acyl chains per head than the fatty acid (picture), and it is difficult to pack them all into the center of the micelle. Phospholipids and sphingolipids more often form a bilayer in a sheet or a sphere (picture). This is the so called lipid bilayer.

===Lipid Motion===
====Studying Motion====
NMR, ESR, X-Ray, Differential scanning calorimetry

FRAP is a good way to measure diffusion of receptors through a lipid membrane after tagging the protein of interest with a GFP construct

====Intramolecular Motion====
There are three basic kinds of motion within the lipid molecules: stretching between bonds, rotating between bonds, and wagging between bonds (?). [picture] 99% of motion within liquid crystal is due to rotation about carbon-carbon bonds. Unsaturated fatty acids of membrane lipids rotate more often. This is because of the packed arrangement of the lipid bilayer. When there is rotation about one bond, an adjacent bond rotates to compensate for steric clashes [pictures]. Since double bonds in fatty acids are nearly always cis, they introduce kinks in the fatty acid. When a bond adjacent to a double bond rotates, the other bond adjacent to the double bond also rotates, and the whole thing moves like an old fashioned bit and brace [pictures]. It takes more energy to rotate the double bonds closer to the head groups due to [angle thing picture]. Double bonds react with O2 readily and create poisons [more] bacteria have [cyclopropane picture].

====Types of Membrane Protein Diffusion====
Rotational

Lateral

Liquid crystal

Flip Flop

==Plasma Membrane Function==
===Barrier===
Interior of cell is separated from surrounding environment.
to keep undesirable substances out
keep desirable substances in 
intracellulat membranes:act to compartmentalize functions within eukaryotic cells(ex:mitochondria,chloroplast)

===Transport Regulation===
The lipid membrane is impermeable to many essential nutrients to the cell, such as glucose. In order to get the proper nutrients into the cell protein transporters are constantly moving through the membrane. For the example of glucose, there are several isoforms of the glucose transporter, some of which are specific for only certain types of cells. One of the more interesting transporter is the water transporter: aquaporins. Even though water can get through the membrane, at times the cells needs more water then can be provided through diffusion.

===Cell Communication===
Gap junctions are channels found between cells that allow for the cytoplasm to exchange between the cells. This is how very fast signalling can occur by cells close together.

=== Cell Adhesion===
Several classes of proteins are responsible for cells sticking together: Cadherins

== size in bits ==

This page is dreadful for teaching C. Beginning programmers can and will make awful assumptions if they are not told which assumptions are reasonable. While a C compiler with a 42-bit char could be standards conforming, such a compiler would be a very sick joke. Instead of leaving newbies to make awful assumptions like &quot;long is always 32 bits&quot;, we can say that &quot;long is 32 bits or 64 bits, equal in size to a pointer on non-Windows systems, and always 32 bits on Windows systems&quot;. We need not mention anything related to ones-complement or sign-magnitude integers. We need not mention that signed integer wrap-around can cause program termination. (but unsigned won't!) No beginner is going to give a damn about a system that doesn't have a 16-bit short, 32-bit int, and 64-bit long long. Long before even considering the topic of largely theoretical screwball systems, one should discuss the concepts of endianness and natural alignment. This is required for sharing data structures between different systems. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:17, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

: I agree that this page is dreadful and needs many improvements.
: However, I don't think telling newbies or anyone else that &quot;long&quot; is &quot;equal in size to a pointer&quot; is ever a good idea.

== increment and decrement ==

Regarding (pre|post)(inc|dec)rement, (++ and --), are they really on the same level whether pre or post?  K&amp;R1 (1=1st ed.) shows ++ and -- in its
operator precedence chart on the same level, but does not state whether they are pre or post.  But what makes most sense to me is that post++ would
be RIGHT-TO-LEFT associativity and --pre would be LEFT-TO-RIGHT associativity.  I wonder if there was a change between K&amp;R1, or if K&amp;R1 is in error,
and what effect ANSI-C had.  I don't have K&amp;R2 (why buy the same book twice?), so I don't know whether there was a change to the precedence chart.
K&amp;R1 also didn't have unary minus, but most compilers nowadays do it anyway--another ANSIism? --[[User:Snt|Snt]] ([[User talk:Snt|talk]]) 01:52, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

: I don't understand. Could you give an example line of code where changing the associativity of predecrement would make any difference? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:41, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

==GB Components==

Components are Gambas plug-ins that add new functionality to your applications (by adding new classes to the interpreter).

A Gambas project has a list of components to be loaded at startup; you can find and modify this list by selecting Project &gt; Properties from the Project window, and clicking the Components tab.

A Gambas project without any components is a simple text-only application. To become a true graphical application, a project must use at least the gb.qt component. To access a database, use the gb.db component. And so forth... 

*gb - Gambas internal native classes 
*gb.compress - Compression library 
*gb.db - Database access component 
*gb.debug - Gambas application debugger helper 
*gb.eval - Gambas expression evaluator 
*gb.gtk - Graphical GTK+ toolkit component 
*gb.net - Networking component 
*gb.net.curl - Network high-level protocols management 
*gb.pcre - Perl-compatible Regular Expression Matching 
*gb.qt - Graphical QT toolkit component 
*gb.qt.editor - Gambas editor with syntax highlighting 
*gb.qt.ext - Graphical QT toolkit extension component 
*gb.qt.kde - KDE integration and scripting 
*gb.qt.kde.html - KDE web browser 
*gb.sdl - Library based on SDL 
*gb.sdl.image - 2D Library based on SDL 
*gb.sdl.sound - Sound library based on SDL 
*gb.vb - Visual Basic compatibility 
*gb.xml.libxml - XML tools based on libxml 
*gb.xml.libxml.rpc - XML-RPC client based on libxml and libcurl 
*gb.xml.libxml.xslt - XSLT tools based on libxslt 

===Add some new components===
You can load new components using by going to the main Project window and selecting Project &gt; Properties.

Now, choosing the Components tab, you'll find a selectable list of the Gambas components. 
Tick the ones you want, untick the ones you don't.

You'll also be shown a hint with the name of the additional controls e.g.: QT when you load gb.qt.ext.

==Introduction==

A grid has rows and columns. They have width and height. 
You can fill a grid with text, numbers or even a picture.

==Example 1==

You need a new form to get the program going. On this form you place a gridview , which you can find in your toolbox.
There should be a picture x.png in your directory. Otherwise it wont be shown. There wont be an error message, when it is not found.

 STATIC PUBLIC SUB Main()
  hForm AS Fmain
  hForm = NEW Fmain
  hForm.show
 END
 PUBLIC SUB _new()
  GridView1.Columns.Count = 4
  GridView1.Rows.Count = 3
  GridView1.Columns.Width = 52
  GridView1.Rows[1].Height = 52
  GridView1[0,0].Text = &quot;0,0&quot;
  GridView1[0,0].Alignment = 4
  GridView1[1,1].Text = &quot;1,1&quot;
  GridView1[0,1].Text = &quot;0,1&quot;
  GridView1[1,0].Picture = Picture[&quot;x.png&quot;]
 END

==Create a Grid without the Toolbox ==

The grid ist creatable. How it is done shows the little example.

 g AS Gridview 
 PUBLIC SUB _New()
 g = NEW Gridview(ME) AS &quot;Gridview1&quot;
 g.show
 g.Columns.Count = 4
 g.Rows.Count = 3
 g.Columns.Width = 52
 g.Rows[1].Height = 52
 END

You just need a empty form to get the program going.

Properties of the grid

 Menu  MouseDown  MouseMove  MouseUp  MouseWheel  Scroll 

==Fill the grid with some values==

You have a list of values and you want to have them in a grid.
The example shows you a solution. Still not very nice and with some German words in it.

You need the following controls:
*1 Textarea
*1 Gridview
*2 Commandbuttons

The code 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 textarea1.Text = &quot;114&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;135&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;104&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;118&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;125&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;121&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;122&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;96&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;118&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;120&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;112&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;127&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;122&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;128&quot;
 textarea1.Text = textarea1.Text &amp; Chr(10) &amp; &quot;120&quot;
 END
 PUBLIC SUB _new()
  GridView1.Columns.Count = 2
  GridView1.Rows.Count = 15
  GridView1.Columns.Width = 72
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button2_Click()
 DIM text AS String
 DIM Liste AS String[]
 DIM Einzelwert AS String
 DIM x AS Integer
 x = 0
 text = textarea1.Text
 Liste = Split(text,Chr(10))
 FOR EACH Einzelwert IN Liste
  GridView1[x,1].Text = Einzelwert
  GridView1[x,0].Text = x
  x = x + 1
 NEXT
 PRINT liste.Length
 END

When you push button1, then the textarea is filled with values.
When you push button2, they will be placed in the grid.

You can improve this program if you want. It looks a little newbee like.

==Standard Dialogs==

They make your coding easier.

In the following example you will use standard dialogues choosing  Standarddialoge für die Wahl 
*the font
*the colour 
*the file name 
*the file path

You need 1 textarea and 3 commandbuttons, to get the program going.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
  IF Dialog.SelectFont() THEN RETURN
  Textarea1.Font = Dialog.Font
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button2_Click()
  IF Dialog.SelectColor() THEN RETURN
  Textarea1.Background = Dialog.Color
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button3_Click()
 Dialog.SaveFile() 
 File.Save(Dialog.Path, TextArea1.Text)
 CATCH 
 IF ERROR THEN RETURN
 END

==Theory==

===Properties ===

 Color  Filter  Font  Path  Title  
 
===Methods===
 
 OpenFile  SaveFile  SelectColor  SelectDirectory  SelectFont

how do you mix the two? The recipe must be incomplete without an explanation how these two conflicting, chemically reacting ingredients can ever be used at one time. --[[User:Tar-ba-gan|Tar-ba-gan]] ([[User talk:Tar-ba-gan|talk]]) 23:05, 24 August 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Overclocking AND UNDERCLOCKING? ==
I noticed that there was nothing about Underclocking in the Overclocking section - not everybody wants to overclock, as some of you should know. I think it would be appropiate to add some stuff about underclocking (which, if I'm correct, is basically overclocking with a few different steps in - nevertheless, someone might get confused, etc.) 

Also, if we do decide to put more information about underclocking a CPU in the same section as Overclocking, should we change the title of that section to &quot;Overclocking/Underclocking&quot;? --[[User:Aurora98|Aurora98]] ([[User talk:Aurora98|talk]]) 03:00, 12 February 2009 (UTC)

== About the merge ==

Ok, but why the book main page threatens with merge suggestion message? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 16:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

: The [[Computer Hardware]] book may have a bit more to offer than the [[How To Assemble A Desktop PC]] for computer harware but How To Assemble A Desktop PC is better overall.  The merger is to move Computer Hardware into this book and not the other way round. [[User:Klingoncowboy4|Klingoncowboy4]] 19:05, 6 November 2006 (UTC)
:: It makes no sense to merge this article with computer hardware. The two subjects are completely different. Building a desktop computer deals with only internal hardware, not external hardware. It would cause confusion to put a subject completely about internal hardware and assembly into an article that deals with both internal and external hardware.
::: I don't think that they should put computer hardware into this because it is not really about learning all about hardware, it is about learning how to build a computer and it might get you off track and thinking about something else. &lt;u&gt;Studyfreak101&lt;/u&gt;
:::: The merge proposal is from August 2006, nearly coming on 3 years ago now. If hasn't happened yet I think its safe to say it isn't going to happen now. Besides it makes zero sense, there scopes and audiences are entirely different. I'm going to remove the merger tags now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:23, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

== Image copyrights ==
Should we ask Mark Headrick for permission to copy his pictures and instructions ?
Mark Headrick
http://www.abbeyclock.com/computer.html

:I'm not sure what contry he is in, but in America, anything is copyrighted once it is made. So we must ask him if we want to use it.

:Those pictures would make a nice addition to this guide, so I don't see why it would hurt to ask him. Howerver, when I make a computer this summer, I plan on talking plenty of pictures. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 06:28, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

== Featured book ==
This is almost featured book!--[[User:Kozuch|Kozuch]] ([[User talk:Kozuch|talk]]) 23:24, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

:Only if you want to hold it up as an example of bad writing and bad editing. I examined a few sections on component selection and made some edits.  The style, syntax, punctuation and grammar are just plain awful.  There are serious errors in terminology and unexplained use of jargon and acronyms.  Some topics are poorly covered, if at all.  One only sees publications of this low quality in the self-published genre, not from reputable publishing houses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;[[User:Hydrargyrum|Quicksilver]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Hydrargyrum|T]] [[Special:Emailuser/Hydrargyrum|@]]&lt;/sup&gt; 07:26, 20 January 2012 (UTC)

== ESD ==

should add more detail &lt;sup&gt;(and be more specific)&lt;/sup&gt; about what components can be damaged &lt;sup&gt;(MB, CPU, RAM, GPU, etc...)&lt;/sup&gt; and the ones that can't be damaged &lt;sup&gt;(ODD, HDD, PSU, LCD, etc...)&lt;/sup&gt;

should also add info about Static &quot;Prone&quot; Clothing and what &quot;Discrete Electronic Components&quot; are - normal people &lt;sup&gt;(like me)&lt;/sup&gt; don't know this kind of stuff &lt;sup&gt;(the reason why I am writing all of this)&lt;/sup&gt; AND DON'T LEAVE OPEN-ENDED ANSWERS! you aren't liable for the information as long as you provide references &lt;sup&gt;(yeah, I hate talking to techies because they ALWAYS do that - just because they don't actually ''know'' anything)&lt;/sup&gt;

the one thing I hate about this WikiBook, is that it's way too ''&quot;hollow&quot;'' - need some ''&quot;solid&quot;'' information here

'''PCBs &amp; ICs''' &lt;sup&gt;(MB, CPU, RAM, GPU, etc...)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
about how if they are enclosed &lt;sup&gt;(Electro Static Discharge safe)&lt;/sup&gt;, they are protected - and if they are exposed &lt;sup&gt;(Electrostatic Sensitive Device)&lt;/sup&gt;, they are not protected

and that the correct method/technique for handling PCBs and ICs is to hold them by the edges/sides

:also how, many manufacturers of RAM are now making them encased in what appears &lt;sup&gt;(atleast to me)&lt;/sup&gt; to be some kind of ESD protection - it's actually a heatsink/cooling-system

:Graphics Cards &lt;sup&gt;(GPU)&lt;/sup&gt; are also sold with their own cooling system - this provides ESD protection to one side of it &lt;sup&gt;(lower side to bring cool air up - hot air rises)&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Monocots''' and '''dicots''' are the two broad groups of flowering plants ('''Division Magnoliophyta'''). While it is generally easy to distinguish most dicots and monocots from one another, the basis for the split in classification is a characteristic of the developing embryo, a feature that is no longer observable on the adult plant unless one can access the internal structure of a seed. Therefore, the following characteristics can be applied in the absence of knowledge about the '''''cotyledon'''''. However, be mindful that no 'single' characteristic will absolutely distinguish a dicot from a monocot, other than by definition monocots have one ''cotyledon'' and dicots have two. In general, monocots are simpler in structure than dicots, although monocots evolved from dicots. 

== Stem ==
In monocot stems, the vascular tissues &amp;mdash; the phloem and xylem &amp;mdash; are in bundles scattered throughout the stem, and they typically lack a vascular cambium. In dicot stems, the phloem and xylem are in rings around each other. They nearly always have cambium. Despite a pine's stem structure resemblance to dicots, it is neither a dicot nor a monocot. A pine is a conifer, which is not a flowering plant at all. 

Partly as a consequence of the arrangement of the vascular tissue, in monocots, there is very little new phloem and xylem added to the stem. Thus, monocot stems do not grow significantly thicker each year. Any change in thickness is due to the cells getting slightly larger. For this reason there are very few monocot trees (palms being an important exception). On the other hand, dicot stems can add new vascular tissue and thus grow thicker with time. Most flowering trees are dicots.

== Root ==
In monocot roots, the phloem and xylem alternate like the spokes of a wheel. In dicot roots, there is a single, X-shaped mass of xylem at the centre, with phloem between the arms of the X. Throughout the whole plant, monocots have more vascular tissue than dicots of similar size. Monocot roots grow from nodules on the stem, forming prop roots if close to the surface. 
In dicots, root growth is from the apical meristem, and often centered around a '''tap root'''.

== Leaf ==
The veins in monocot leaves are usually parallel, although palmate (arising from a common point at the base of the leaf) vein patterns are common. Dicot leaves have a branching pinnate vein network, rather like a feather, but can also be palmate.

== Flower ==
Monocot flowers have flower parts in multiples of three. Dicot flower parts are in multiples of four or five. Monocot pollen has a single pore on the outer layer. This means it is '''''monosulcate'''''. Dicot pollen is '''''triporate'''''. In other words, it has three pores on the stem..</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the late 19th century, when Cantor proved his theorem and mathematicians' understanding of infinity developed, set theory was not the rigorously axiomatised subject it is today. It relied upon woolly intuitions about what sets were and their relationship with their members. This lack of rigour led to several paradoxes.

In Naive Set Theory, something is a ''set'' if and only if it is a well-defined collection of objects. Sets count as objects. A ''member'' is anything contained in a set. Any two sets containing precisely the same members are the same set (''Principle of Extensionality'').

== Russell's Paradox ==

One of the most celebrated paradoxes is Russell's. Bertrand Russell, the English philosopher and logician, discovered this paradox in 1901. It centres on the set containing all and only those sets that do not contain themselves. It is impossible to answer the question 'does this set contain itself?' without running into a contradiction. If it contains itself, it is by definition a set that does not contain itself - contradiction. If it does not contain itself, it is a set that does not contain itself and so should contain itself - contradiction. A parallel semantic paradox is the Barber's paradox. The Barber shaves everyone in town who does not shave himself and only those people. Does the Barber shave himself? If so, he is not someone who does not shave himself. If he does not, he should. In this case, the Barber's contract is inconsistent and so, by analogy, is the Naive Set Theory upon which Russell's paradox is constructed.


== Cantor's Paradox ==

The explanation of this paradox is somewhat technical but brief and some readers may therefore prefer to return to it later.

A set A is a ''subset'' of another set B if all the members of A are members of B. Hence, all sets are subsets of themselves. Also, the ''empty set'', Ø or {},  the set containing no members, is a subset of any set, since all of its members are also members of any other set (since it has no members). A ''proper subset'' of a set is a subset that is not the set itself. The ''Powerset'' of a set is the set of all the subsets of that set. For example, the Powerset of the empty set is the set containing the empty set, {Ø}. Note that this set is different from the empty set: {Ø} has a member (Ø); Ø has none.

In 1873, Cantor proved that the Powerset of any set is larger than that set (Cantor's Theorem). This may seem obvious for finite sets, but the matter is less perspicuous when infinite sets are considered. For the time being, an infinite set will be said to be a set that has the same size as one of its proper subsets, and two sets are said to be the same size or ''equinumerous'' if and only if there exists a bijection between them (there is a unique member of the first for every member of the second and a unique member of the second for every member of the first). The set of natural numbers {1,2,3,...}, for example, is infinite. It has a proper subset {2,4,6,...}, the even numbers, but ''for every member of the set of natural numbers (i.e. for every natural number) there is a member of the set of even numbers and vice versa''. This is because every natural number can be doubled, resulting in an even number (i.e. every natural number can be assigned some unique member of the set of even numbers) and every even number can be halved, assigning to it a unique member of the set of natural numbers. If two sets are equinumerous, there is a means of pairing each member of the first with the second such that every member of the first set appears in the first position of precisely one pair and every member of the second set appears in the second position of precisely one pair (''ordered pairs'' are not subject to the principle of extensionality: &lt;a,b&gt; does not equal &lt;c,d&gt; if a does not equal c). So, for {1,2,3...} and {2,4,6...} there are the pairs &lt;1,2&gt;, &lt;2,4&gt;, &lt;3,6&gt;, etc. The set of all such pairs is a ''function'' (and a ''bijection'').

Proof of Cantor's Theorem rests upon the notions thus described. The proof described here is ''reductio ad absurdum'', i.e. the negation of what is to be proved is assumed true; the proof shows that such an assumption is inconsistent.

Suppose that a set A is equinumerous with its Powerset PA. Hence there is a bijection g ''from A to PA''. Let g(x) be the member of PA (i.e. a subset of A) associated with a member x of A. Since A is assumed to be equinumerous with PA, for every member y of PA there is a member x of A such that y = g(x). Let B be the subset of A such that any member x of B is not a member of g(x) (remember g(x) will be some subset of A). Hence there is no x that is a member of A and g(x) = B. If there was, either it would be a member of B or not. If x was a member of B, it would be a member of g(x) and so would not be a member of B - contradiction. If it was not, it would not be a member of g(x) and so would be a member of B - contradiction (note the similarity with Russell's paradox used to show this contradiction). However, B is a member of PA (since B is a subset of A) and so there should be some x such that g(x) = B. This contradiction completes the proof. For any set, there is always some subset that cannot be assigned uniquely one of the members of that set.

The paradox follows as an extension of the theorem. Consider the set containing everything, all sets, trees, people, planets, stalagmites, numbers, calculators and so on. According to the theorem, the Powerset of this set is larger than it. However, if this is so, the set of everything must have missed something out, since there is a set which is larger than it and so contains something else besides.

== Richard's and Berry's Paradoxes ==

Consider the set containing all natural numbers that are definable in English in fewer than twenty syllables. It will contain twenty-six (only three syllables), the two-millionth prime number (only seven syllables) and ten raised to the ten raised to the ten raised to the ten raised to the ten plus fourteen (nineteen syllables). Since there are only a finite number of syllables and a definition must be finite in length, this set must be finite in size. It will be a proper subset of the set containing all arrangements of nineteen or fewer syllables; in particular, it is the set containing those arrangements that define a natural number. Since this set has only a finite number of members, it must have a largest member (but observe that ''infinite'' sets need not, e.g. the set of natural numbers). 

Consider the number defined by: the least number not definable in English in twenty syllables. This number is the smallest number not in the set; yet it is definable in fewer than twenty syllables, for it has just been defined in eighteen! This is Berry's paradox, proposed by Berry in 1906 as a simplified version of Richard's paradox, which is as below.

Consider all the numbers between 0 and 1 that can be designated in a finite number of words. For example, 0.33333333... is designated by 'a third'. 'The ratio between the lengths of the side and the diagonal of a square', is another example. Arranging all such numbers lexicographically shows that it comprises a ''denumerable'' set. Listing all such numbers in some order is hence possible. However, there is a number p that differs in its kth place to every kth number in the listing. Hence it appears nowhere in the listing, yet it should, for it has just been described in a finite number of words.

Richard's and Berry's paradoxes arise through sloppy use of terms such as definability and designatability and the inclusion of self-reference. No such carelessness is possible in Axiomatic Set Theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[How-tos bookshelf]] | [[Sword construction]]
----
The [[w:Sword#Parts_of_the_Western_sword|parts of the sword]] must be made to match and enhance the function of the type of sword.  

All parts of a sword have a style; whether intentional decoration, traditional forms, or unintended artifacts of the production process.

If the target will be chopped or slashed, the mass of the sword will be more forward.  As the weight increases, it becomes more difficult and time consuming to change the direction the sword is traveling. Only one edge can be readily used, so only one edge is sharpened. Chopping and slashing are enhanced by a curved blade; so the style of swordsmanship will determine how much of the blade is curved and to what degree. If the target is on the ground with the sword wielder on horseback, or the other way around, then the blade or handle (or both) will be longer. If the weight or length of the sword becomes unwieldy, then two hands are needed.

A blade must be flexible and tough enough to absorb the shocks of use.  At the same time it must be hard enough to retain a sharp edge through many cuts.  Historically, several methods were developed to enhance these attributes. The &quot;simplest&quot; of these consisted in heat treating the steel blade to create an acceptable compromise between hardness and toughness. Some consisted of inserting or layering harder alloys within or between softer alloys ([[w:damascus steel|damascus steel]]), and [[w:differential hardening|differential hardening]] of the edge and body of the blade. The latter is a type of heat treatment made legendary among sword fans by the Japanese [[Wikipedia:katana|katana]]. However, the edge-hardened katana was predated by edge-hardened Chinese [[w:jian|jian]] and [[w:dao (sword)|dao]], Nepalese [[w:khukuri|khukuri]], and others.

The [[w:sword making#Sharpening|sharpened edge]] will be configured differently depending on:

#The [[w:heat treatment|hardness and toughness]] of the metal,
#What degree of chopping, slashing, slicing, and thrusting is expected,
#Character of the expected target.

==Handle construction==
The handle ([[w:hilt|hilt]]) of a single-edged chopping sword is usually angled to enhance the chopping action and to give the user tactile feedback of the orientation of the sharpened edge. The handles of double-edged straight swords are in-line with the blade and point for thrusting, and again designed to give tactile feedback of orientation; in this case, of both sharpened edges by the flattened or oval shape of the grip.

*The grip must be the appropriate size for the hand holding it. And the material on the surface of the grip must enhance the hand's grip upon it.
*It must also be durable to withstand the stresses of its mounting.
*The grip must be attached to the sword in a dependable, durable manner. 

A guard between the grip and blade might serve several purposes:  

#Prevent hand from sliding forward,
#Registering the hand on the grip,
#Prevent opposing blade from reaching the hand,
#Trapping the opposing blade,
#Covering the mouth of the scabbard to prevent water and dirt from entering.

The pommel serves three principal purposes.

#Add weight to counter-balance the blade at the appropriate point,
#A fastening point for the tang of the blade,
#A weapon in and of itself, usually for smashing an opponent in the face, neck, etc.

==Fastening the handle to the sword==
In straight swords, the pommel can also serve as a secondary weapon — a knob-like protrusion used for striking when the blade points in the wrong direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Note on Style ==
I think the current module is too low-level. First, templates (or typing the structures) isn't really important in telling the story. (When implementing the code, it's obvious that in, say, C you need to specialize the structure to suit only one data type (or use preprocessor hacks), while it's obvious in C++ that you can use templates, and finally it's obvious in a language like Scheme you don't even need to type anything.) The approach should follow the Introduction chapter, which ignores these issues: [[Data_Structures/Introduction#The_Node]].

Instead of code that messes with pointers, it should be using the Node ADT functions. Instead of trying to make the Data-Structures OO, it should be more functional/procedural: when done properly, it will be obvious how the code can be made OO. That is, we should follow an OO style, but not actually use a pseudocode language that is itself OO. We are using abstraction heavily, but we aren't concerned with say polymorphism or inheritence, which has very little relevance to introductory data structures.

[[Media:[[Media:[[Media:[[Media:[[Media:{{}}]]]]]]]]]]==get-size==
If we have a '''get-size''' function we might as well keep a counter in the main stack/queue structure that holds the integer field along with head and tail node references. Any objections if I do that? Also, are there any objections if I deCamelCase the function names to use the hyphen instead? (The Algorithms book uses this policy.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:20, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)
: I've deCamelCased the function names. I generally think that keeping track of the size belongs in the list if anywhere. Really, there are very few stack or queue algorithms that ever need to get the size of the structure, so my feeling is that it shouldn't even be in the interface. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 17:50, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Content clarity ==
There seems to be a mixing up of data structure and data type concepts, or at least a lack of distinction that should be addressed.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:46, 8 November 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Angocentric time line ==

The proposed timeline is typically anglocentric and fails utterly to capture the global perspective of the second world war.

The Pacific War did not begin in 1941. That was only when whitey got involved ( and I say that as a white guy). The timeline on wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Two) should be used.</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the UK]]

Serve it with buttered bread and HP sauce!

==Ingredients==
* 4-5 [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
* 1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Corned Beef|corned beef]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] (optional)
* water
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste
* white [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste
* 1 pinch [[Cookbook:Tarragon|tarragon]] (optional)
* 1 pinch [[Cookbook:Oregano|oregano]] (optional)
* Lea &amp; Perrins (optional)
* small [[Cookbook:Bay Leaf|bay leaf]] (optional)

==Procedure==
#Put the ingredients in a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] (yes a wok is perfect though not traditional!) or some other large pan.
#Add water until almost covering the ingredients. 
#Cover, bring to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]].
#Lower heat, [[Cookbook:Simmer|simmer]] for 30 mins or until the potatoes soften.
#If too wet, strain off some water. 
#Add the broken-up corned beef and stir in gently.
#Bring almost to the boil.
#Switch off the heat and let it sit for 15 minutes.

Heat again or serve as it is.

==Alternative method (pressure cooker)==
It's easy to make hash in a pressure cooker, just follow the pressure cooker instructions to cook the potatoes &amp; onions on the hob.

#Put all the ingredients ''apart from the corned beef'' into the pressure cooker. You do not need much water, perhaps 1 or 2 cm of cold water.
#Bring the pressure cooker up to pressure and cook for approx 4 minutes.
#Meanwhile chop up the corned beef. When the other ingredients are cooked, open the pressure cooker and mix the corned beef in. Then serve.

'''Oil-dumpling''' (in Dutch: Oliebol, oliebollen)

Oliebollen are often called Dutch apple fritters, and are served at Dutch festivals in the United States, such as Oak Harbor, Washington's Holland Happening Festival.

Makes: 50 doughnuts, or 1 roaster pan full

== Ingredients ==
* 2 tbsp [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 pkg [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 5 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Scalding|scalded]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], softened
* 10 cups [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 1½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 3 cups [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 1 cup [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]] (optional)
* 3 diced Granny Smith [[Cookbook:Apple|apples]] (optional)
* [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|ground cinnamon]] to taste
* [[Cookbook:Canola Oil|canola oil]] for frying

== Procedure ==
# Dissolve 2 tbsp sugar in 1 cup warm water. Sprinkle yeast on top. Let stand while preparing dough.
# In a LARGE mixing bowl, beat eggs until mixed. Add scalded milk, 1½ cups warm water, yeast mixture and margarine and beat well. Add flour, 1 cup sugar and salt, mix well. Add diced apple.
# Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size. (I use a lobster pot for this)
# In a separate bowl, mix 3 C. sugar and cinnamon to taste. (I like a LOT)
# Fill a fryer pot 4 inches with canola oil or melted Crisco. Heat to 375°F (190°C) and scoop large spoonfuls of dough into the pot, turning them to ensure even browning. (Golden brown is the goal) Play the shape game while you're at it.  Dipping the spoons in the hot oil before scooping the dough keeps the spoons from getting too sticky.
# Drain on paper towels on paper bags, roll in cinnamon sugar mixture and serve warm.

== Taste seems off ==

I made this recipe tonight and I'm fairly certain it could use either more sugar or more butter. I'm going to consult with some people about proportions and probably update the recipe later this month. --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 08:29, 19 October 2013 (UTC)

'''Couscous''' (from [[w:Maghreb Arabic|Maghreb Arabic]] ''kuskusu'', which is from [[w:Tamazight|Tamazight]] ''seksu'') is a [[w:food|food]] which consists of grains made from [[Cookbook:Semolina|semolina]] which are about 1mm or 1/16th inch in diameter (after cooking).  In the [[w:United States|United States]] couscous is known as a [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]], however in most other countries it is treated more like a [[Cookbook:grain|grain]] in its own right.

Couscous is traditionally served under a meat or vegetable [[Cookbook:stew|stew]].  The dish is the primary staple food throughout the [[w:Maghreb|Maghreb]]; in much of Algeria and eastern [[w:Morocco|Morocco]] it is simply known as ''ta`aam'' &amp;#1591;&amp;#1593;&amp;#1575;&amp;#1605;, &quot;food&quot;.  It is popular in the Maghreb the West African [[w:Sahel|Sahel]], in [[w:France|France]], and parts of the [[w:Middle East|Middle East]], it's also very popular among [[w:Jew|Jew]]s of [[w:North African|North African]] descent. But this speciality is from a [[w:Berber|Berber]] origin.

==Cooking==

When cooked couscous has a texture somewhere between American [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]] and [[w:Italy|Italian]] [[Cookbook:Risotto|risotto]].  Couscous has to be steamed rather than boiled to prevent the grains sticking together; the couscous available to buy in most western supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried. It is quick and easy to prepare by pouring the couscous grains into boiling water or stock, adding some vegetable oil and stirring.  The couscous swells and within a few minutes is ready to serve.  Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than dried pasta or grains such as [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

The traditional North African method is to use a steamer called a ''couscoussière'' in [[w:French language|French]].  The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked in a stew.  On top of the base a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew.  The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so that steam can escape.

In [[w:Morocco|Morocco]], [[w:Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[w:Algeria|Algeria]], couscous is generally served with vegetables (carrots, turnips, etc.) cooked in a spicy broth, and some meat (generally, [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] or [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]]). Such a dish is now popular in former [[w:colony|colonial]] power France, where this particular preparation is generally implied by the word &quot;couscous&quot;. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French grocery stores and supermarkets.

There are recipes from [[w:Brazil|Brazil]] that use boiled couscous molded into [[w:timbale (food)|timbale]] with other ingredients.  Couscous can also be combined with meat or vegetables during cooking, and is often highly flavoured with aromatic spices.

==Manufacturing==

The couscous grains are made from semolina (coarsely ground [[Cookbook:Durum wheat|durum wheat]]) or, in some regions, from coarsely ground [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]] or [[Cookbook:millet|millet]].  The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry semolina to keep the pellets separate, and then sieved.  The pellets which are small enough to be finished grains of couscous fall through the sieve, the rest are again sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into smaller pellets.  This process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny grains of couscous.

This process is very labour-intensive.  Traditionally, groups of women would come together and make a large batch of couscous grains over several days.  These would then be dried in the sun and used for several months.  Nowadays couscous is normally produced in factories, and is sold pre-made in markets around the world.

[[Cookbook:Berkoukes|Berkoukes]] are pasta bullets made by the same process, but are larger than the grains of couscous.</text>

== SPM12 ==

SPM12 is not supported on Mac PowerPC.

== SPM8 ==

SPM8 is not officially supported on Mac PowerPC, as this platform is about to be phased out (see [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html MATLAB Platform Roadmap]). This means that precompiled MEX files (*.mexmac) are not included in the SPM distribution. It should however be relatively straightforward to compile them by yourself.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm8.zip] and its updates [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8_updates/ spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login
unzip spm8.zip
unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation === 

You need to have Apple's development environment [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ Xcode] installed. It should be available on your Mac OS X installation DVD.

You also need to have the ''mex'' executable in your system path. To do so, type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MATLAB/bin
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
with the appropriate path where MATLAB is installed.

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM8 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login/spm8/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
make toolbox-distclean
make toolbox &amp;&amp; make toolbox-install
make external-distclean
make external &amp;&amp; make external-install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM5 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Mac PowerPC (*.mexmac) are available in the latest update.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login
unzip spm5.zip
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation === 

If you want to compile SPM5 MEX files by yourself, you need to have Xcode installed and ''mex'' in your system path (see SPM8 for details).

Then, in a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM5 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /Users/login/spm5/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM2 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Mac PowerPC (*.mexmac) are available in the latest update.

=== Compilation ===

NB. Some of the following commands require that you log in as root or use the &quot;sudo&quot; mode.

Assuming that your Matlab and SPM2 folders (say, &quot;MATLAB&quot; and &quot;spm2&quot;) are in your Applications folder: 

(1) make sure you use a version of gcc earlier than 3.3 (compiling spm2 with gcc3.3 fails when mex is invoked; there apparently is a conflict of library):

    (sudo) gcc_select 3

(2) put a symbolic link to the &quot;mex&quot; file found in MATLAB/bin into /usr/sbin/ (!!! not in usr/local/bin):

    (sudo) ln -s /.../Applications/MATLAB/bin/mex   /usr/sbin/mex

(3) recompile SPM2:

    cd /.../Applications/spm2
    make MAC

You should see something like the following lines:

    make all SUF=mexmac RANLIB=&quot;ranlib spm_vol_utils.mexmac.a&quot;
    _________________________________________________
    Unix compile for MacOS X
    _________________________________________________
    mex -O -c spm_mapping.c

    spm_make_lookup.mexmac.o spm_getdata.mexmac.o spm_vol_access.mexmac.o 
    spm_mapping.mexmac.o 
    a - utils_uchar.mexmac.o
    a - utils_short.mexmac.o
    ... (a long long list of files)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Robotics spans multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, so when you want to design a better robot you should get some basic knowledge in these fields. How much you should learn depends on how complex you want to make your robot. To give an example: A small tethered tabletop robot would only require some basic knowledge in electronics and programming, a shoe box sized robot would require some additional knowledge on mechanics (mostly about balance) and a large robot might even require some knowledge on solid mechanics.

This page covers the fields that are very much used in robotics. You don't need to know everything about all of these subjects, however knowing the basics of each of these fields can help in building better robots and prevent you from making (some of the) beginner's mistakes.

==Mechanics==
Mechanics is about:
*how forces are transferred between the different parts of a construction.
*where the center of gravity lies.
*friction
*position, speed, acceleration
*Newton's laws
*inertia
*material properties

Mechanics helps keeping a robot in balance. Although you could build a robot without knowing anything about mechanics, it'll help in preventing your robot from tipping over when turning, or when picking up something.

Another point where mechanics pays off are axles. On small robots you can attach the wheels directly to the output shaft of the motor. However this doesn't work well for larger robots as this puts a lot of stress on the internals of the motor. A better way is to attach the wheel to an axle, and use gears to connect the motor to the axle. Knowledge of mechanics allows you to build such constructs.

If your robot is a small line follower almost any building material will work. However if your robot weighs a few kilos, something sturdier than cardboard and soda sippers is appropriate. And if your robot is human size you should consider metal and/or composite construction.

See [[Theoretical Mechanics]] for an introduction in this field.

''the &quot;Theoretical Mechanics&quot; is just started, so there isn't much to read just yet.''

==Electronics==
Electronics is about:
*Electronic Components
*Analog Circuits
*Digital Logic
*MicroControllers

Electronics is something you can't go without (unless you want to build a complete mechanical robot or use pneumatics for control). Today there are plenty of books covering basic electronics (See [[Electronics]]).

==Programming==
Computer programming is about:
*Control structures (sequence, selection, iteration)
*Data types (constants, variables, integer, real, string,...)
*Algorithms
*Hardware control (setting and reading registers, interrupts,...)
*logic

Anyone who has had an introductory course on programming (as they are given in American high schools) would be familiar with the first three points. The fourth point is rarely addressed in introductory courses, but is essential when programming microcontrollers. Although it might sound difficult, it can be very easy in practice (for most purposes). Much of this comes down to setting bits in a byte using simple Boolean logic, and writing this value into some register or memory location. Higher level languages like Bascom provide hardware addressing as special variables, which can be treated just like any other variable.

Microcontrollers (and processor boards) are one of the areas where using Assembly is still very valid. Memory (both RAM and program space) is very limited in these, although each new generation of microcontroller has more memory for about the same price. Many microcontrollers provide between 2K and 30K, and processor boards tend to have up to 256K.  These numbers vary wildly, but are still significantly less than PCs have. However if you don't know an assembly language, most microcontroller and processor boards have high level language compilers available in many flavors (C, C++, Basic, Pascal, Fortran, etc.)

Robot programming is also about:
*The Event Loop.  Most microcontrollers do not have the resources for threading. You will need to look at your robot's task a fraction of a second at a time, and choose which small action to take.  What can the program do in that moment to get a little bit closer to its goal?
*Interpreting sensor data. Sensors have many ways of providing noisy or misleading information; how many types of error can you accept? Dirt in a rheostat, a broken switch, and a venetian blind flickering on a photodiode are obvious faults. How about temperature drift, non-linear response curves, or your robot seeing its own shadow?  
*Decision making, or '''Artificial Intelligence''' is the art of making the right decision given the constraints of the current system.
* Motors and motion.  Making motion on a robot often involves moving several motors at once, often with feedback from sensors.

==Solid Mechanics==
Solid mechanics is about how forces distribute inside solid materials. Knowledge about this subject is useful because it explains how materials respond to loads. This helps to prevent using too thick or too thin materials. This isn't required for small or medium robots, but it allows to be more efficient with building materials and gives insight to why and how materials fail (break and/or deform). See [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Solid_Mechanics this wikibook]] for a start on solid mechanics. Be warned: heavy math ahead.

Even if you have a mortal fear of math, bite through this as it gives valuable insights on how materials break and deform. No need to memorize the math, as long as you get the idea behind it.

==A.I.==
Artificial Intelligence (in Robotics) is about:
*Finding the shortest way between 2,3 (or more) points
*Dealing with obstacles
*Handling new situations (machine learning)

There are many [[Artificial Intelligence| books]] available on AI on many different levels. This area has had a short but already fruitful history, but still has a very long way to go. AI isn't just about getting a computer to think and reason. It's more about ordering, sorting and organizing knowledge in a machine and constructing algorithms for extracting real world conclusions from these databases. A search engine like [http://www.google.com Google] or [http://www.yahoo.com Yahoo] are examples of real uses of AI.

Other than pure AI books, books on how the brain works and such can provide interesting angles to AI on robots. Concepts like attention and concentration can have interesting uses in some form for integrating sensor data.

==Math==
Although math is generally seen as the ultimate theoretical science, it can be one of the most important skills in many of the more advanced domains of robotics. e.g. Mechanics uses a lot of math. For simple constructs you won't need much more than high school level math, for more complicated shapes it becomes necessary to use more complex math tools like integrals. But since robotics is a very practical craft many things can be done with approximations. Math however can be very helpful in making the right approximation.

If you're a fanatic about building computers and want to know what types of parts to get, this page is for you. I'm sure that you will find this page interesting and you may just want to go out, get the parts from a store, or salvage them from the junkyard. Feel free to add information on new products (especially CPUs), and don't be biased towards one brand unless you have actual evidence or personal experience, and if you have that, please mention it.

Note to the reader: this book supplements one other Wikibook titled &quot;[[How To Build A Computer]]&quot;.

== Building a computer ==

This supplement is designed to help readers understand the methods on what is needed in order to build a computer. I will break down each part definition and then talk about ways to pick each part that all relate to the target of what the machine is being built for.

=== Why build? ===

Why build vs. buy?
*Hobby
*Unique
*Cost

What do you want to use it for?

*Extreme Gaming
*Business / Office / Technical use
*Video / Photo / Music Editing
*Multimedia / Home Theater / DVR
*Server

=== Background and planning ===

When building a computer there are many things to consider. Budget, quality, brand warranty and support, value, needs VS wants, performance, expandability, types of software that will run on the computer and many other things. When designing a system it is important to look at each part of the decision making process as noted above. Let us look at each area of focus:

=== Budget ===

When determining the budget of what is needed, when picking computer parts, it is very important to set the expectation upfront. Costs can exceed planned budgets very quickly so I would suggest being careful and realistic on what you plan to spend. Good references to understanding costs would be to use resources such as computer shopper magazine or visit a local computer parts store website to get a general idea. Even visit a local store to window shop. What might be easier is assume that an already assembled machine would be about 2/3 the cost starting, on a system that you build yourself. This is assuming that you are able to find an off the shelf product that has your requirements, but want to take it further by building one from scratch.

=== Quality ===

The subject of quality is very difficult since everything more or less is made outside the USA, usually at factories in China. What it comes down to is the track record overall of the company. Then follows the purpose of the product and product features. A big issue that occurs with trying to define quality electronics is having no knowledge of what a quality part is supposed to look like. People tend to rely on stuff they read on forums, but what is difficult is forums are anonymous so anyone who likes to talk whether accurate or not will post their comments and make it sound like they are an expert. The other side of the coin is you can review the Manufacturer’s website, but the problem you generally run into is the bias perspective of a company who is marketing its own products. The other issue is you cannot necessarily look at the parts and know, since most of you might be unaware of what you are looking at. Your best bet is to take in as many resources as possible. Try using the power of the web and see if you can get a broad overview of reviews and perspectives from consumers and hopefully experts. It is not always easy to do. Sometimes you have to take a shot at a company that seems to be very popular for the type of equipment you are buying, and hope that the quality standards are there. Consumer reports are options as well since they are right to the point on trying to find good products. Overall, quality has too different levels: consumer and business. Parts that are rated for business needs are generally more expensive and in some cases higher quality since they require a better record of accomplishment on life expectancy and reliability. 

Overall, you need to educate yourself on brands as much as possible before you start picking parts. No brand is a perfect match, but generally, you have a handful of various brands within a given part.  Many products will be very similar in design and quality as mentioned before. It will really come down to support, warranty, product features, and so on, which I will talk about in later sections.

=== Brand warranty and support ===

This topic is a big part of making choices on certain parts and brands that go hand and hand with quality. What you will notice real fast is parts might have all the features you need and the quality is good, but when you go to obtain service via phone, the web or email, you find out real quick how difficult it is. 
What is important is being able to access a website, not hosted in China, which allows you to download software drivers and bios support as well as manuals and other important information without any hassle.  If you have a question, can you easily make a phone call and talk to someone who can assist you with quality customer service. Especially if a problem arises like the part is not working correctly or the part fails. A difference in purchasing one brand VS another is mostly premised on the service quality. It does not matter how great something is, if there is no service to back it up. For example; waiting a month for a replacement part as well as paying shipping both ways. Can you download drivers on the website easily or do you have to register a product and create a user account just to get support or answers to questions. Again, how easy is it to get service? Do I have good software support for current technology and Operating System versions?

=== Limited support ===

One short statement that everyone needs to be conscious of; When building your own computer you are not getting total system support for the first year, that normally a new off the shelve system would come with. Each part has it owns warranty for different durations with separate support guidelines. Please save all paperwork and packaging. DO NOT DISPOSE OF ANYTHING. If there is ever a problem, you can easily exchange the part with the store you purchased it at or send it in to the MFR for replacement. You have limited troubleshooting support since when you call a Manufacturer; they always point the finger at the other brand as being the problem. If they do determine that the part might be bad, since again they are not 100% sure, you have to send them the part first so they can review it and then mail you out a replacement. You seem to go around in circles when troubleshooting issues with your newly built machine. Certain companies might allow a part to be sent out first, but you will have to pay for the part first and when the old part is returned, you will get a credit. What is frustrating about this process is that you may be wrong on the bad part or there might be more than one part that is bad.

You have to be ready to support the machine yourself, and troubleshoot yourself with the assistance of the manufacturers, but they can only do so much since all they really care about is their specific brand and there is not much that can be done over the phone. What needs to be done in certain cases if you decide to build on your own then you are responsible for what you build. In other cases, you can buy the parts from a retailer and in most cases, they offer build services. Going out to third party building companies can sometimes be very costly so use care. If you do use a company to build your machine, I recommend adding additional service and support so that if something does come up you are not left hanging. This is very important if your computer is used for business, so use care when acquiring additional service. Make sure you are clear on the terms and that it is conducive to your needs.

=== Value, features, and performance ===

The next topic we move onto is the question of value. Am I getting my money’s worth for the features and Performance I want? A big factor in making a decision is determining if you are getting value for your money and making sure you do not become caught up in the marketing and pretty cosmetics. Many parts available will suit your needs. What you need to understand is does the part have the performance and features needed, in combination of other part choices, that suits the goal I am building the system for? Performance is a very inflated term since almost anything you try to shop for in computers refers to performance everything. You have to focus more on the design and the specifications rather than the inflated use of big marketing words. Words such as ultra, super, high performance, heavy duty, etc.  You will tend to notice most of the designs are similar since many concepts are duplicated from one manufacturer to another. The best way to determine which option is best is review the main specifications and compare. At least you will have an “apples to apples” comparison. Specifications are printed either on the packaging or on the product website.

=== Expandability ===

Another important factor is expansion over time. Can I upgrade to newer equipment or add additional components as time goes on. The biggest problem with all technology is the fast changing industry that is constantly updating. After 3 months, your computer technology is dated, since new products are already hitting the shelves. Realistically there is no way you can keep up. What you buy today might be dated tomorrow. All you can do is purchase the best bang for your buck now, and allow for expansion over time. Some suggestions I can make are choose a bigger case with more standardized setups so that installing newer parts later down the line does not become an issue.  Regardless, of what you choose there is a general rule of thumb, which is think one-step above what your current needs are. Look for ways to add later.

=== Operating systems and other software ===
 
Software plays a mission critical part in which components you choose for the computer. Options are limited based on the software that is installed on the new machine. For example: Linux, UNIX, and other open source flavors have strong support in the hardware world, but not everything is supported. You must use care when picking parts if you plan to choose an open source route to operating systems. The driver support and technical support is usually on the assumption you are using a Microsoft Operating system. The other options for operating systems include Microsoft Windows as well as Microsoft Windows Server. There are also options such as Novell and Sun, but those Operating Systems are out of the scope of a build your own system. There are big differences in part selection when choosing a product, which truly depends on its support with the software you are using.

To explain the differences, we must understand the fact that companies pay money for hardware support through operating system companies. Everything has a cost, and the hardware company has the choice whether or not they want to pay for it. Open source options, since open source are generally free, takes a longer time to provide support for new hardware. Unless there is mention of the support on the packaging or product literature then do not assume. I would call the company to be sure. If you are looking at building a server, be aware that many manufacturers do not offer windows server support from a driver and tech support standpoint. Various consumer brands only have either Linux/Unix or Desktop Windows support. Windows Server versions are supported on parts that are classified for use in a server environment. The design and features will vary completely from the consumer features with specifications focused on high heat and heavy user traffic with long powered on durations VS consumer systems that tend to be turned off regularly and the average user is not stressing the machine to extreme unless it is a gamer, but again it is only one user. My suggestion is look closely on the product specifications when making part selections to make sure you do not run into a snag with an unsupported part.

== Buying the right parts ==

The next topic of discussion is about part choices. Here we will describe each part and how it works with a computer system. A person cannot shop for parts if they do not know what parts they need or how the parts work. Every part has a purpose and each part works together with other parts to satisfy an ultimate goal.

You can buy virtually everything listed below online, if you are patient enough to wait for a good deal. You can use [http://www.pricewatch.com price watch] to look up prices on parts through various vendors. Double-check the advertisements to ensure that the item you have found is what you really want. A search for a &quot;DVD burner&quot; may find results such as &quot;external enclosure for DVD burner&quot; or &quot;DVD burner software.&quot;

=== Core components ===

==== CPU and sockets ====

The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is the brain that is responsible for processing information from any piece of hardware. It runs the programs and commands that the system attempts execute. It is important to check with the Motherboard manufacturer for CPU compatibility before purchasing a supporting board and additional components. Rather than go into a strong opinionated discussion on what processor will work best, my suggestion is review the manufacturers suggestions on processor selection as noted on the below websites. Realistically three big factors are how many applications are you running at one time, the types of applications you are running, and how many users are accessing the system. The system that is built based on these three topics. My suggestion is reading up on recommendations from the software companies for best overall performance and consistency to assist in your decision making process. There is never a perfect option, but you always want to shoot for something right in the middle rather than over or under estimate the need. Once you have found the middle ground as mentioned before, go when step higher so at least you have some cushion for possible changes in the future.

“The Central Processing Unit (CPU) or the processor is the portion of a computer system that carries out the instructions of a computer program, and is the primary element carrying out the computer's functions. This term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s [1]. The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the earliest examples, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.”

There are various processors to choose. My suggestion is to understand what type of processor is needed to support the applications you will be running. Any processor above will support all the various Operating Systems available. Some will obviously perform better than others will, but what it comes down to are the applications within the operating system you will be running, how many applications will be running at one time, and how many users will be accessing the machine at any given time. That is what will place you in a certain class of processor choices. 

Also take note that some of the new processors have integrated video processing right on the CPU, so certain processors that you purchase might require a video card rather than using on board video that some motherboards might have. Again, it is important to check the manual.

===== Sockets =====

Sockets are very important when deciding which boards to choose to support your system. Once you pick the processor you want you build the system around it. Sockets are located on the motherboard of every computer. It is the interface between the CPU and the rest of the system. The CPU is locked in place into the socket and then a heat sink is placed over the CPU for cooling. When choosing a processor the socket choice must match and in turn this limits your choices for other supporting parts. That is why I recommend choosing the processor to start with and build the system around it.

==== Motherboards ====

“A motherboard is the central printed circuit board (PCB) in many modern computers and holds many of the crucial components of the system, while providing connectors for other peripherals. The motherboard is sometimes alternatively known as the main board, system board, or, on Apple computers, the logic board.[1] It is also sometimes casually shortened to mobo.”

Most motherboards today are over engineered to some extent and there are various choices ranging from 30 dollars all the way up to 500 plus dollars. Everything is linked to the features and additional component support. How much do you want to spend before you realize you may not need all the bells and whistles?
The real important thing is that everything must be compatible with the motherboard. Buy an expansion card for each function that is not included with the motherboard. Be sure to check compatibility and the number of expansion card slots on the motherboard. If you want to be able to adjust clock settings or have more control over your partnering electronics, make sure the motherboard can support it. 

Be sure to compare features and specifications of boards you have selected. Keep in mind that it must support the socket and processor you have chosen. If you are like some people and choose the board first, the board you choose dictates the processor. Regardless either one limits the other. Review the product manuals, which in most cases are downloadable online by visiting the manufacturer’s website. If you are very new to computer hardware, my suggestion is be patient and understand what features you are looking for that are important. 

Some features that you need to look at are the following:

*CPU support and socket – What processor are you looking to use and does the board have the socket and the actual support to run the processor.

*Integrated Peripherals – Depending on use of the motherboard, the question you need to ask is what does the board have built onto it and what is necessary to purchase extra? Most boards come with onboard sound, video, network card as well as various USB ports and in certain cases PS2.

*Peripheral Card Slots – Depending on the use of the computer and future expansion determines how many and what type of card slots you actually need. Common slots to see are PCI-E and PCI. PCI-E comes in slot sizes from 1x to 16x depending on the type of interface card you are plugging into the motherboard.

*Ports and Channels – Ports can include USB, SATA, FireWire, IDE/EIDE, IRDA, or Floppy. SCSI is not common to see on a consumer system. You would normally see SCSI on some server based boards.

For more information on the differences: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing) BUS]

*Temperature, Reliability, and cooling system – “Motherboards are generally air cooled with heat sinks often mounted on larger chips, such as the Northbridge, in modern motherboards. If the motherboard is not cooled properly, it can cause the computer to crash. Passive cooling, or a single fan mounted on the power supply, was sufficient for many desktop computer CPUs until the late 1990s; since then, most have required CPU fans mounted on their heat sinks, due to rising clock speeds and power consumption. Most motherboards have connectors for additional case fans as well. Newer motherboards have integrated temperature sensors to detect motherboard and CPU temperatures, and controllable fan connectors, which the BIOS or operating system can use to regulate fan speed. Some computers (which typically have high-performance microprocessors, large amounts of RAM, and high-performance video cards) use a water-cooling system instead of many fans.”

*Form Factor (size of the board relative to the case size) – “Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called computer form factor, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible commodity computers were standardized to fit various case sizes. As of 2007, most desktop computer motherboards use one of these standard form factors—even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not traditionally been built from commodity components. The current desktop PC form factor of choice is ATX. A case's, motherboard and PSU form factor must all match, though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a microATX motherboard.”

Note: More and more motherboards are coming with Non Legacy technology meaning that support for older interfaces have become obsolete. Such things like PS2, IDE, Floppy, and PCI are being seen less and less. Keep this in mind when buying parts so that your system does not become obsolete faster than expected.

==== RAM (Random Access Memory) ====

“Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage. Today, it takes the form of integrated circuits that allow stored data to be accessed in any order (i.e., at random). &quot;Random&quot; refers to the idea that any piece of data can be returned in a constant time, regardless of its physical location and whether or not it is related to the previous piece of data.”

It is very tempting to buy generic brands of memory. Generally, the savings are incredible, and large amounts of fast memory will improve your performance. However, cheaper memory tends to be less reliable than higher-end memory, since the quality control measures for generic brands is often less stringent. When RAM is unreliable, it can contribute to crashes. On the other side of the coin, all memory is made overseas and there are only a small handful of actual manufacturers. My suggestion is to focus on a company who is well known for quality memory at a reasonable price. 

Performance is the next factor when choosing, but at that point, all you need to do is review the basic specifications. Latency and Frequency as does the ram have any heat sinks or are the chips exposed freely. Everything is relative to the type of memory you are purchasing. Again, check your motherboard manual for compatibility. Regardless of what anyone says that ram is universal, is not an accurate statement. Various brands are usually compatible with most motherboards, but it is important to review the compatibility list on the website or in the manual. If for whatever reason you ram is not compatible it may only partially work as well as cause numerous intermittent problems. Do not assume; check and be certain.

Your processor can calculate all it wants, but how quickly it is given the information and how quickly it is retrieved will be controlled by the memory. You have to balance the need for performance and your budget. If you are buying for performance, you want low CAS latency and the fastest speed your motherboard can take. (PC2100 memory is greater than PC1600, for example.) Be aware that if your motherboard supports dual channel you should try to buy the ram in a pair of two. The technology allows the computer to access memory at a much higher speed than if you had just bought one module (if your motherboard and the two modules support it when working together). Check the voltage of the memory as well and match it to what your motherboard supports. Adjusting voltages are sometimes required as well as frequency when installing memory into a new machine. The motherboard does not always adjust to the correct frequency and voltage. It will usually adjust to the minimum in order to post the system, but once you push the memory under normal and extreme conditions you might have an issue. Usually these specifications are printed on a label on the side of the memory. If all else fails, check the website.

==== Graphics card ====

Graphic cards have always been a tough choice as one of the final pieces of hardware that is most crucial to the overall system performance. Choosing a video card is very difficult since so many manufacturers make video cards, but what you will find is the chipsets and GPU’s (similar to CPU for video cards) only have a few chipsets available. Realistically, the quality of the card is what your final decision becomes after you know what chipset and GPU brand you want. My best recommendation is understanding what the purpose of the machine is. If the machine is for video editing or graphic design, you will tend to use more of a professional series card rather than a gaming card. If you are doing gaming, you will choose the highest performing one you can find. My recommendation is pick one with a proven record of accomplishment. Stay away from new releases since in most cases bugs, stability, heat issues and various other problems have not all been worked out yet. Let others be the beta testers so that you can enjoy a solid, consistent performing machine.

*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PC_hardware_manufacturers#Graphics_processing_units_.28GPUs.29 LIST OF ALL HARDWARE MANUFACTURES]


Application: Multimedia / Video Editing / Gaming / Extreme Gaming / Technical (Engineering / CAD)

Chipset Brand: 

Graphics processing units (GPUs)

*Advanced Micro Devices|AMD (ATI Technologies|ATI division)
*Matrox Graphics
*Nvidia
*VIA Technologies|Via (S3 Graphics division)
*Intel
*Silicon Integrated Systems|SiS
*PowerVR


The two biggest giants here are ATI and nVidia. Intel is also commonly found, but not competitive on the video aspect since the other companies focus on just video. Intel still does make a reliable chipset, but in the professional and gaming realm, they are not commonly found. Each company will tend to release &quot;families&quot; with similar new technology that usually consist of cheap and lower quality, moderate, and expensive with higher quality. Check your motherboard to see what expansion slots it has for these cards. The video included on the motherboard is usually sufficient for most tasks except gaming and video-related work. PCI Express runs at 16x. Whatever you are doing with your computer will determine how much video memory you need. Try to go a bit heavy on that. Reviews are available at http://www.tomshardware.com about graphics cards as well. Some families of cards from either company are better than others. Video cards not from a well-known company may or may not be easy to research as far as how well they function, and are more likely to lack features like a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit, which takes some load off of the CPU and only does graphics). This product should be heavily researched for information and reviews. If someone gives you a recommendation whether online or in person, I suggest having support facts to derive the same conclusion. 

Note to reader: We have recommended ATI and nVidia, because the lack of speed and performance of an Intel based Graphics Card (ex. Extreme Graphics, Extreme Graphics 2 etc.) I still recommend reading reviews and specifications of card choices and deriving your own decision based on available material. Bottom line, know your need and buy the card that supports the need. Keep in mind that if your focus is a data server then video card performance is not mission critical, but if you are doing video editing on the machine, then the video card in combination with the processor and board all have a strong bearing on system performance.

Side note is video cards that process a numerous amount of information at any given time can generally become hot, so a recommendation is a good cooling system on the card and the main case to allow the card to perform correctly. An overheating card will crash the system in a heartbeat.

=== Additional components ===

==== Sound card and speakers ====

There are a small handful of brands to choose from when deciding if you need a separate sound card. Most motherboards come with integrated sound. Basic boards have analog only all the way up to digital, optical and pure surround sound outputs built on. Most of the time these integrated sound devices are plenty for the average or even the above average user that is looking for quality sound without adding additional expense. If you determine the need is there for a higher quality card or a card that has more inputs and outputs then you can look at options to add one to your system.  Necessary needs would be higher gaming quality or for example sound recording and editing. Even instances with using your computer as a media center and you might be looking for the best quality output for your High Definition TV or Home Sound System. Everything is relative to the quality of the speakers you are outputting too with the type of cabling. If you are using 10-dollar speakers, you will get 10-dollar sound quality.

For speakers I am going to leave it simple with saying that until you hear the quality, there is nothing written that can make your decision. My suggestion is read up on reviews and perspectives of what others have used for the type of sound you are outputting and go to a local store and listen to some speakers. It is the only way to make a true decision. Be aware that sound is better as you get better equipment, but the sound card, the wires and the speakers all play a part. Sometimes sound capabilities included on your motherboard are more than adequate, but I would listen to it before determining you need more.

Some common brands to look at:
*AdLib
*C-Media
*Creative Labs (A3D)
*Realtek
*Sensaura
*Turtle Beach
*USB
*VIA Envy
*Video Games

==== Dialup modems ====

“A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information, and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals, from driven diodes to radio.”

If you are using a broadband Internet connection, and have no interest in using your computer for voicemail, faxing, or dial-up communications (like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system BBSing]), then you do not need a modem. Some servers still use dialup for updates and maintenance, but you very rarely see one installed on a new machine.

Today, almost all modem users are using them for dial-up Internet access. Most modems are 56k speed modems. It is advisable to get a 56k card to experience the fastest connection speeds your ISP (Internet Service Provider) can provide using dialup. Two predominant standards exist: v.90 and v.92. The difference is that v.92 has some extra features that allow you to stop your Internet connection temporarily and receive a call. However, you need call waiting and an ISP that supports this. 

Motherboards do not have an integrated modem built-in. Most already built machines do not come with a modem installed anymore. Again, unless you have a specific need for a modem, there is no reason to purchase one.

=== Drives ===

==== Hard drive ====

“A hard disk drive[2] (hard disk,[3] hard drive,[4] HDD) is a non-volatile storage device for digital data. It features one or more rotating rigid platters on a motor-driven spindle within a metal case. Data is encoded magnetically by read/write heads that float on a cushion of air above the platters, with modern storage capacity measured in gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB).
Hard disk manufacturers quote disk capacity in SI-standard powers of 1000, wherein a terabyte is 1000 gigabytes and a gigabyte is 1000 megabytes. With file systems that measure capacity in powers of 1024, available space appears somewhat less than advertised capacity.”

“The technological resources and know-how required for modern drive development and production mean that as of 2010, virtually all of the world's HDDs are manufactured by just five large companies: Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung, and Toshiba.”

There are few main types of hard drives, which include IDE hard drives, SATA drives, and SCSI drives. The drives can either be in the form of Solid State or Motor Driven. Currently SATA is the standard type of drive sold on the market in the form of motor driven operating between 5900 to 10000 RPMs. Depending on the need and budget common drives are usually motor driven 7200 RPM SATA drives. The larger the size of the drive, the speed drops down. Solid-state drives, meaning no moving parts, have become very popular, but the cost is still extremely high relative to the cost of standard drives. The capacity is small in comparison to standard motor driven drives. Solid state will give you the fastest read and write speeds with an assumed long-term life expectancy, but at the same time, it will cost you 3 times as much. 

Everything is based on need, and it would make sense to determine which option works best for the price you are willing to pay, and have the storage amount you need.  The main purpose of this drive is too store data on a permanent medium to be accessed any time. The data can be erased and re-written endless amount of times, but a hard drive is a place to park data.  My suggestion would be to determine what will be stored on the drive and how sensitive your access speed is to the software you are running, and determine what drive or drives would work best.

==== CD/DVD drives ====

“An optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves near the light spectrum as part of the process of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from discs, but recent drives are commonly both readers and recorders. Recorders are sometimes called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives.”

It is possible to get an inexpensive drive of good quality rather easily. As far as speed goes, 1x is the speed of the first-generation CD devices. It is generally agreed upon at around 150kBps.  A 48x CD-ROM drive would then be 7200kbps. DVD-ROM drives use the same measure, except that a 1x DVD-ROM can read around 1,250kBps. The media for each of the drives usually contain different amount of space.

*CD/R: 700 MB
*CD/RW:650 MB
*Formatted Audio CD/R: Approx. 48 Minutes
*DVD: 4.3 GB
*DVD/RW: 4.4 GB (And Sometimes Less)

If you want a burner, be aware of the types of media it can write. CD-R's are usually only recordable once. Using multi-session technology, you can write to a CD-R multiple times, but you cannot erase data already on a disc. CD-RWs can be erased and rewritten. DVD-Rs and DVD+Rs are two different standards, but neither can be erased. DVD-RWs and DVD+RW's are also two different standards but can be erased. Some DVD players may only support DVD+R/RW or DVD-R/RW, or maybe neither. Dual-layer discs follow DVD-R/RW or DVD+R/RW standards, but require special burners to be used. They can store about twice as much because it literally has two writable layers. If the drive says it works for &quot;RW&quot; discs, it will also work with &quot;R&quot; discs. The software needed to operate the drive normally comes with your operating system, but I strongly recommend obtaining third party software that includes more features.  All drives come with the software necessary to operate the part fully.

You might also see a DVD-RAM drive. DVD-RAM is a very uncommon format, but it is technically superior. They use concentric tracks on the disc, instead of one long spiral, and they usually come in cartridges (which protects the disc.) These discs can be re-written more times than a DVD+RW or DVD-RW, and can operate similar to a hard disk drive.


For more information, see the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-RAM Wikipedia article on DVD-RAM].

==== Floppy drives ====

These days, a floppy drive is not entirely necessary. Many new computers are manufactured without a floppy drive. However, being able to boot off a floppy disk for diagnostic purposes can be more convenient in some ways than booting off a CD. Also certain bios flash utilities as well certain OS installations sometimes require a floppy drive for certain parts of the software installation. Floppy Drives are legacy and only certain boards still come with the controller to interface with this kind of drive. If you need to purchase a floppy drive, my suggestion is make sure the motherboard supports it as well as mounting in the case for it.

“A floppy disk is a data storage medium that is composed of a disk of thin, flexible (&quot;floppy&quot;) magnetic storage medium encased in a square or rectangular plastic shell. Originally announced as the &quot;Type 1 Diskette&quot; by IBM in 1973, the industry then adopted the terms &quot;floppy disk&quot; or &quot;floppy.&quot;

=== Chassis (case), power supply and cooling ===

The case and power supply are selected based on your other component choices being made prior. The final touch is the case or shell the holds everything now and future upgrades. Choose wisely.

==== Power supply ====

A cheap power supply will work fine for many purposes, but it may not be as reliable as a more expensive one. A good power supply means that your components receive steady, even power, and a good cooling system means your components do not overheat. This tends to prolong the life of your system.  If you want to buy your power supply separately, you may want to visit an actual storefront. Your power supply must be compatible with the motherboard you are purchasing. Generally, your motherboard and power supply will conform to the ATX standard, unless it is a MICRO. A prime consideration for your power supply is the wattage output. A 500 watt power supply can provide electricity to more components, (and more power-hungry components) than a 250 watt power supply. 

Keep in mind that your power supply must have a connector for each device you intend to connect, including the motherboard! Review the amperage since Watts is only one part of the power equation. It is important to have good available amperage on all your power rails so that as power consumption increases, the power flow stays consistent and steady, in addition to the wattage draw. Make sure that the wiring is long enough to reach your parts in the case and that you have more connectors then you have components. Do not get stuck buying adapters or extensions.

Factor in going one notch up above your requirements just in case you might have a future need as well as a higher output power supply will work less to supply the needed power and in turn last longer. Whatever your total required power consumption need is plus the connectors needed to power everything, you choose the unit that will work best. Depending on the case you have chosen, will also determine the length of the wiring that extends from the power supply. Always make sure that you have enough slack to reach your components.

==== Cases and cooling ====

NOTE: When you buy a chassis, it might come with a Power Supply, but in most situations, you are purchasing just the case. All cases have some basic to complex cooling system depending on the case you choose. You can always add more cooling or a bigger power supply.

Decide whether you want your case to look attractive. Vendors now sell a variety of cases in aesthetically pleasing designs and colors. Aside from appearance, there is no benefit from a silver case with an acrylic window compared to a plain beige case.  Keep in mind that cases for higher-end gaming systems tend to have the more advanced cooling system. Retail stores whether online or brick and mortar will generally have many cases to choose from, which can range in price from $30 to $1000 dollars. Keep in mind that cooling is one of the most important factors when building a computer. Cooling in most situations is not the number one concern of the manufacturer designing the case, more over then the way it looks. Looks sell.  I would shop in person if possible for a case that looks good, but with the cooling system portion top notch.

If you feel compelled to buy a case on-line, make sure you are 100% clear on the design, size and look. You do not want to be stuck with a poor case that looked great in a picture. In some cases, you may not need to upgrade the cooling system for the case itself, but only for the computer's CPU. Still, anything that lowers the total heat will probably help the lifetime of the components. Know that you may regret your case if it has sharp edges or if it makes it difficult to get to a part you plan on frequently upgrading. The best option is to see it in person, even if you are going to buy it online, try to see it up close.

The expandability of future upgrades is important. Always choose a case one size larger with the assumption of future expansion. If the cooling system is poor then upgrade it. Fans are cheap. Just add a few more. It would be different with liquid cooled since the case realistically should cool well on air and liquid, just in case the liquid fails as well as it is good to have fresh air circulation around parts regardless how good the cooling system is. It is difference between a computer lasting two years rather than six or more. 

The main thing that you want to see is good air intake in the front with exhaust out the back of the case and top if possible. The goal is to pull air in and out quickly so that hot air is replaced with cool air. The air moving across the motherboard, video card, and hard drives becomes very important. If there is no air moving over these crucial parts then short-term failures occur. Another part you need to look at is quality. Is the mounting hardware and assembly solid? Are features such as tool-less mounting brackets sturdy and lock into place correctly? You need to make sure that everything is spaced well, and the parts are made well and there is plenty of breathing room in the case.

Lastly, I always greatly recommend upgrading the heat sink for the CPU. In normal situations, the stock heat sink is fine, but having additional cooling always helps. Especially, in stressful operating conditions such as gaming and video editing a good solid cooling system is crucial. Look for a copper sink that sits on the processor with aluminum fins with plenty of cooling surface and a good fan. The more surface that heat can disperse over at a faster rate and then cool quickly is a better system overall.

=== External output devices ===

==== Monitor ====

A good LCD screen will be crisp and clear, and may be easier on your eyes. CRT’s have become obsolete and not commonly found as far as a new purchase. LCD’s have significantly dropped in price. You have to buy according to your needs. If you have a small amount of space, choose a smaller flat panel and decide on a reason screen size. Screens are measured by a diagonal viewing area, similar to how TV’s are measured. Average sizes range from 17 to 24.  Anything larger than that becomes costly and unless you have a specific need for a large screen, such as graphic design work then I would stay with something in-between. 

Flat panel displays are not always visible from certain angles, or look odd from others. Realize that flat panel and flat screen are different things. Flat-screen only means the surface of the viewing area is flat, as opposed to flat panel screens, which are only an inch or so thick. LCD’s would be flat panel screens, not flat-screen. 

One of the big factors will be cost. The choice of screens can be mat or gloss finish. Depending on the quality of the picture you need would determine which screen is best. Mat finish does not create a glair, but the colors are not as bright and flowing as a gloss screen. The big issue with gloss is a richer color, but you need to be in an environment that will not create glare or a bad reflection. Again, regardless of the quality of the video card you have the final output is the screen. Same thing applies if you obtain a high quality monitor, but purchase a poor graphics card, all you will receive is poor quality graphics. You need to find a middle ground for both quality and price. 

“A monitor or display (sometimes called a visual display unit) is an electronic visual display for computers. The monitor comprises the display device, circuitry, and an enclosure. The display device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), while older monitors use a cathode ray tube (CRT).”

=== Peripherals ===

==== Keyboard and mouse ====

If you are building an inexpensive computer for general office use or basic home computing, a generic mouse and keyboard may be fine. Optical mice, trackball, and ball mice are your options. Optical mice do not need to be cleaned VS a ball mouse, which accumulates lint on the inside of the housing. Be aware that laser-based optical mice are available, and are generally more accurate.  Always build the computer to the purpose. When shopping for a mouse mainly what you are looking for is comfort and resolution. Resolution refers to how precise the movement of the mouse is.

Keyboards come in many sizes and shapes. My suggestion is various keyboards will suit your needs, but what it comes down to is comfort, style, and how many additional functions it might have. For example would be a keyboard with audio controls built on. My suggestion is visit a local store and experience the feel and comfort of different models. It is not something I would recommend to purchase online. Regardless of how nice it looks and how many functions it has, it comes down to comfort.  Especially for something that you will be using for long durations, comfort is important.

“In computing, a mouse is a pointing device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. Physically, a mouse consists of an object held under one of the user's hands, with one or more buttons. (Although traditionally a button is typically round or square, modern mice have spring-loaded regions of their top surface that operate switches when pressed down lightly.) It sometimes features other elements, such as &quot;wheels&quot;, which allow the user to perform various system-dependent operations, or extra buttons or features that can add more control or dimensional input. The mouse's motion typically translates into the motion of a cursor on a display, which allows for fine control of a graphical user interface.”

“In computing, a keyboard is an input device, partially modeled after the typewriter keyboard, which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.”

==== Operating systems ====

Since the focus of this page is to talk about choosing the parts needed to build a system there is some strong weight on the type of operating system you choose. I have already mentioned details about how relevant the OS is when picking parts in the beginning of the page, so I will recommend visiting the following links for more information:

== Safety and precaution ==

=== ESD precautions ===

*ESD: Electro Static Discharge
*Have a reliable ground point available near the work site
*Connect your body to the ground point with a wrist strap
*Keep all components in anti-static containers until required
*Handle PC components only on a grounded anti-static work surface
*Do not wear clothing or handle objects which generate ESD


=== ACPI power ===

*In an ACPI enabled motherboard, the system is never really “off”  unless unplugged, or the master power switch is turned off  
*There is the risk of damaging not only the component being installed/removed, but the motherboard as well, if power is not completely off
*Many motherboard manufacturers have installed an LED on the board itself to remind the user of the power state

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic MUMPS Syntax - Lines, Spaces, WhiteSpace, Comments ==

MUMPS syntax was designed to be concise in a time of scarce memory. This serves a purpose now in that programs are cognitively concise: a lot more fits in view on a screen or on a page of paper.

*The basic language structure is &lt;font color=red&gt;command&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;command-separator&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=orange&gt;argument&lt;/font&gt;. 
** The &lt;font color=red&gt;command&lt;/font&gt; may be one of the MUMPS commands, like &quot;SET&quot; or &quot;WRITE&quot;
** The &lt;font color=blue&gt;command-separator&lt;/font&gt; is written as a single space (or blank) between command (SET) and the arguments.
** The &lt;font color=orange&gt;argument&lt;/font&gt; depends on the command.
*** The &lt;font color=orange&gt;argument&lt;/font&gt; can be a list of &lt;font color=green&gt;single-arguments&lt;/font&gt; (separated by commas) or a &lt;font color=green&gt;single-argument&lt;/font&gt;.
*** Each &lt;font color=green&gt;single-argument&lt;/font&gt; usually is in the form of an &lt;font color=pink&gt;expression&lt;/font&gt; or group of &lt;font color=pink&gt;expression&lt;/font&gt;, separated by colons. 
*separating each command may be multiple spaces for readability. 
*Another command may follow a space on the same line.
         SET X=1    SET Y=2
*Whitespace - eol is NOT treated as equivalent to space. Each has different role in MUMPS. 
*Tabs are also NOT equivalent to a space, but are sometimes treated like space to delineate a label. Traditional MUMPS editors (IDEs) sometimes treat tabs specially, but do not put the tab character into the MUMPS routine.
*Lines are significant to the syntax as each line starts with a tag(line label) and a space or a space when there is no label.
*Comments start with semicolon (;) and go to the end of the line. A line may start with ; and is all comment.
*There is no command termination character (like ; in java or Perl) other than the eol or a space following the argument.
*Assignment requires the explicit command SET or S
         SET X=1,Y=2  ;   either form full or [[MUMPS Programming/OneLetterCommands|abbreviated command]] S
         S X=1,Y=2    ;  
*There is no syntactic role for braces {}
*Expressions are grouped by parenthesis

*Programs ('routines' in traditional MUMPS terminology) have a unique name and consist of a linear sequence of lines.

== Logical operator ==

=== Boolean operator ===

 X : Boolean := A &lt; 10 {{Ada/kw|or}} A &gt; 20;

=== Boolean shortcut operator ===

In the below example the function &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; is only called when &lt;tt&gt;F(X)&lt;/tt&gt; returns the value ''False''.

 {{Ada/kw|if}} F(X) {{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}} G(Y) {{Ada/kw|then}}
 
     Walk_The_Dog;
  
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};

This shortcut operator is sometimes used to speed up the evaluation of boolean expressions, but the Ada Style Guide recommends to compare the performance of both forms before switching one to the other. In general, it is good idea to use {{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}}  in sake of performance only when the second expression involves a function call.

The {{Ada/kw|or}} {{Ada/kw|else}} form is also used when the second expression is known to raise an exception unless the first expression is ''False''.

Unlike C/C++, Ada short-cut operators are not the standard way to evaluate boolean expressions. This is because Ada is designed to do by default what is generally safer, but lets the programmer request a different behaviour.

=== Boolean operator on arrays ===

The or operator is applied to each pair of boolean elements from the left and right arrays. The result has the same bounds as the left operand.

 {{Ada/kw|type}} Day_Of_Month {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|range}} 1 .. 31;            
 {{Ada/kw|type}} Month_Array {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|array}} (Day_Of_Month) {{Ada/kw|of}} Boolean;
 
 X : Month_Array := Function_1;
 Y : Month_Array := Function_2;
 Z : Month_Array := X {{Ada/kw|or}} Y;

=== Bitwise operator ===

The operator '''or''' could be used with [[Ada Programming/Types/mod|modular types]] to perform bitwise operations.

== Select statement ==

=== alternative ===
''See [[Ada Programming/Tasking#Selective_waiting]]''.

=== delay ===
''See [[Ada Programming/Tasking#Timeout]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think this page should focus on the Sequence ADT, of which vector, linked list, and [http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/nautilus/cut-n-paste-code/gsequence/ GSequence] are instances.
:GSequence has been put in the Advanced book.
Then Vector and Linked List can be presented with their efficiency tradeoffs. I'm thinking of Vector as distinct from [[Data_Structures/Arrays|Array]] because Vector supports resizing and the full Sequence interface. Thoughts? --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 20:11, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:I think the chapter should introduce first an abstract ADT that represents ordered collections of objects, i.e. &quot;list&quot; in the most general sense. Then, the array and linked-list representations can implement that ADT, both of which include a very, very simple iterator data type (with '''has-next''' and '''get-next''' for example, and nothing else). The array implementation of the abstract list ADT can then include the extra resizing (i.e., array copying) operations to ''be'' a vector. A final section could then show the tradeoffs and how, for example, inserting an item in the middle of a large vector is impractical, and how indexing the ''n''th element of a long linked-list is impractical.
:Note that the introduction has already covered chains of nodes, so conceptually introducing a linked-list won't be hard: it's just a wrapper, really, around node chains: in a node chain, an empty list is represented by a null pointer, and thus you cannot send messages to it. In a linked-list (if it implements the list ADT), you can always send messages, like get-size, even when there are no elements. (I think people get too caught up with &quot;linked-lists&quot; and miss the point that abstraction can insulate you from these details.) Overall, I'd rather the point about abstraction be the key message of the chapter (and the critical role that iterators play in isolating us from array or chains of nodes representations) than about the nifty but not as insightful point about efficiency. (It of course should be mentioned, but need not consume more than a couple of paragraphs.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:38, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::The page goes in this general direction now. Unless you have some further comments/change suggestions, I'll refactor this discussion in a few days to something like the following, except more coherent because I'll do it when I'm awake:
:::This page should focus on the benefits of abstraction. The tradeoffs involved in choosing between linked lists and vectors are an important side note, but should remain a side note and not distract from the main message, that when you do things through an ADT, it's easier to write your code generally and not have to change it later. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 07:06, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Side note: the array chapter needs to be simplified as well.
::I think the arrays chapter covers the information it needs to, even if it's not in the best form. I'm going to treat its simplification as low priority until the rest of the chapters at least have an overview. --[[User:Jyasskin|jyasskin]] 07:06, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== WikiBook pseudocode ==

When writing  [[Data_Structures/Introduction]] I noticed that in [[Data_Structures/Introduction]] you use &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; ... &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; and here  &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; ...  &lt;code&gt;end while &lt;/code&gt; - Would be nice if you could make your mind up and which should I use for above article?

*3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] tomato juice or V8
*3 beef bouillon cubes
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:Black Pepper|black pepper]] to taste

*Garnish - [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] wedges and [[Cookbook:Sour Cream|sour cream]]

Makes 6 cups of chili.

==Procedure==
#Cut chuck roast into bite-size pieces or form ground beef into small meatballs (1 inch - 25mm in size).
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] beef in cooking oil until outside is browned.
#Add minced garlic and cook for two minutes.
#Combine chili powder, flour, oregano and cumin in bowl and mix well. Sprinkle mixture over cooking beef and stir until beef is well coated with spice mixture. Cook for 1 minute.
#Add tomato juice and bullion cubes. Stir for about 15 seconds.
#[[Cookbook:Simmering|Simmer]] for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
#Remove from heat and add salt and black pepper to taste.

==Notes, tips and variations==

#Cool and refrigerate overnight to develop flavors (if you can wait; if not, enjoy).
#Heat and serve in bowls with 1 tablespoon of lime juice and 1 tablespoon of sour cream added to top.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Corn Bread|cornbread]] or [[Cookbook:Sourdough Bread|sourdough bread]].
#For a cool treat, spoon a tablespoon of Ranch Dressing on top of your chili, along with some cheese!

The term Design Patterns can confuse you at first, or it can seem like something incredibly difficult. In fact it is nothing more than convenient ways of identifying, labelling and coding general solutions to recurring design problems.

So design patterns are nothing more than commonly occurring patterns in design that are repeatable and generalist enough to be written down and named as software design constructs that all can commonly identify and apply. Note however that a design pattern refers to the logical structure of the code, what it does and how it addresses the issues, not on direct code portability across projects, but in the portability of the way design issues can be addressed.

Imagine yourself working in a project team and someone just wrote a class and is trying to explain to you that only one instance is allowed. Instead the person could simply say &quot;The class I just wrote is a Singleton&quot;.

Patterns can be classified in different categories, of which the main categories are: Creational Patterns, Structural Patterns and Behavioral Patterns.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This is an overview of the major features that are available in '''Ada 2005''', the version of the Ada standard that was accepted by ISO in January 2007 (to differentiate it from its predecessors [[Ada Programming/Ada 83|Ada 83]] and [[Ada Programming/Ada 95|Ada 95]], the informal name Ada 2005 is generally agreed on). For the rationale and a more detailed (and very technical) description, see the [http://www.ada-auth.org/AI-XREF.HTML#Amend_Doc Amendment] to the Ada Reference Manual following the links to the last version of every Ada Issue document (AI).

Although the standard is now published, not all compilers will be able to handle it. Many of these additions are already implemented by the following [[w:Free Software|Free Software]] compilers:
* [http://libre.adacore.com/ GNAT GPL Edition]
* [http://gcc.gnu.org/ GCC 4.1]
* [http://www.adacore.com/home/gnatpro/ GNAT Pro 6.0.2] (the AdaCore supported version) is a complete implementation.
After downloading and installing any of them, remember to use the &lt;code&gt;-gnat05&lt;/code&gt; switch when compiling Ada 2005 code. Note that Ada 2005 is the default mode in GNAT GPL 2007 Edition.

== Language features ==

=== Character set ===

Not only does Ada 2005 now support a new 32-bit character type &amp;mdash; called &lt;tt&gt;Wide_Wide_Character&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; but the source code itself may be of this extended character set as well. Thus Russians and Indians, for example, will be able to use their native language in identifiers and comments. And mathematicians will rejoice: The whole Greek and fractur character sets are available for identifiers. For example, [[Ada Programming/Libraries/Ada.Numerics|Ada.Numerics]] will be extended with a new constant:

 &amp;pi; : {{Ada/kw|constant}} := Pi;

This is not a new idea &amp;mdash; [[w:GNAT|GNAT]] always had the &lt;tt&gt;-gnati''c''&lt;/tt&gt; compiler option to specify the character set [http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/Character-Set-Control.html]. But now this idea has become standard, so all Ada compilers will need to support [[w:Unicode|Unicode 4.0]] for identifiers &amp;mdash; as the new standard requires.

See also:

* {{Ada/95/AI|285|Support for 16-bit and 32-bit characters}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|388|Add Greek pi to Ada.Numerics}}

=== Interfaces ===

Interfaces allow for a limited form of multiple inheritance similar to Java and C#.

You find a full description here: [[Ada Programming/Object Orientation#Interfaces|Ada Programming/OO]].

See also:
* {{Ada/95/AI|251|Abstract Interfaces to provide multiple inheritance}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|345|Protected and task interfaces}}

=== Union ===

In addition to Ada's safe variant record an unchecked C style union is now available.

You can find a full description here: [[Ada Programming/Types/record#Union]].

See also: 

* {{Ada/95/AI|216|Unchecked unions -- variant records with no run-time discriminant}}
* {{Ada/2005/RMA3|B|3|3|Pragma Unchecked_Union}}

=== With ===

The with statement got a massive upgrade. First there is the new [[Ada Programming/Packages#Limited_with|limited with]] which allows two packages to ''with'' each other. Then there is [[Ada Programming/Packages#Private_with|private with]] to make a package only visible inside the private part of the specification.

See also: 
* {{Ada/95/AI|217|Limited With Clauses|alt=6}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|262|Access to private units in the private part}}

=== Access types ===

==== Not null access ====

An access type definition can specify that the access type can never be null.

See [[Ada Programming/Types/access#Null exclusions]].

See also: {{Ada/95/AI|231|Access-to-constant parameters and null-excluding access subtypes}}

==== Anonymous access ====

The possible uses of anonymous access types are extended. They are allowed virtually in every type or object definition, including access to subprogram parameters. Anonymous access types may point to constant objects as well. Also, they could be declared to be not null.

With the addition of the following operations in package {{Ada/package|Standard}}, it is possible to test the equality of anonymous access types.

    {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;=&quot; (Left, Right : ''universal_access'') {{Ada/kw|return}} Boolean;
    {{Ada/kw|function}} &quot;/=&quot;(Left, Right : ''universal_access'') {{Ada/kw|return}} Boolean;

See [[Ada Programming/Types/access#Anonymous access]].

See also:
* {{Ada/95/AI|230|Generalized use of anonymous access types}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|385|Stand-alone objects of anonymous access types}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|318|Limited and anonymous access return types|alt=2}}

== Language library ==

=== Containers ===

A major addition to the language library is the generic packages for containers. If you are familiar with the C++ STL,
you will likely feel very much at home using {{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}}.
One thing, though: Ada is a block structured language. Many ideas of how to use the STL 
employ this feature of the language. For example, local subprograms can be supplied to iteration schemes.

The original Ada Issue text {{Ada/95/AI|302| Container library|alt=3}} has now been transformed into
{{Ada/2005/RM2|A|18|Containers}}.

If you know how to write Ada programs, and have a need for vectors, lists, sets, or maps (tables), please have a look
at the {{Ada/95/AI|302|AI Text|alt=3}} mentioned above. There is an ''!example'' section in the text explaining the
use of the containers in some detail.
Matthew Heaney provides a number of demonstration programs
with his reference implementation of AI-302
({{Ada/package|Ada|Containers}}) which you can find at
[http://charles.tigris.org tigris].

In [[Ada Programming/Containers]] you will find a demo using containers.

'''Historical side note''': The C++ STL draws upon the work of
David R. Musser
and
Alexander A. Stepanov.
For some of their studies of generic programming, they had been using Ada 83.
The [http://www.stepanovpapers.com/ Stepanov Papers Collection] has a few publications available.

=== Scan Filesystem Directories and Environment Variables ===

* {{Ada/95/AI|248|Directory Operations}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|370|Environment variables}}

=== Numerics ===

Besides the new constant of package {{Ada/package|Ada.Numerics}} (see [[Ada Programming/Ada 2005#Character Set|Character Set]] above), the most important addition are the packages to operate with vectors and matrices.

See also:
* {{Ada/95/AI|388|Add Greek pi (π) to Ada.Numerics}}
* {{Ada/95/AI|296|Vector and matrix operations}}

(Related note on Ada programming tools:
AI-388 contains an interesting assessment of how compiler writers are bound
to perpetuate the lack of handling of international characters in programming support tools for now.
As an author of Ada programs, be aware that your tools provider or Ada consultant
could recommend that the program text be 7bit ASCII only.)

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.59}}

In this module, you will create a new material called &quot;Green Ooze&quot;.  Along the way, you will learn how to alter the diffuse, specular, and mirror colors of a material.

== Your First Material ==
[[Image:Blender-2.5_materials.png|thumb|180px|'''Figure 1:''' The Materials context in the Properties window.]]

The cube in the default scene (which you get from ''File &amp;rarr; Load Factory Settings'') has a simple grey color. Now click on the Materials context [[File:materials_button.png]] in the Properties [[File:Blender269PropertiesIcon.png]] window.

The materials context contains various menus, but for now you only need diffuse, specular and mirror.
The material is named and linked in the panel above the preview window.  ({{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|Linking}} is a feature that allows materials to be shared between multiple objects (or datablocks).  Changing a material affects the appearance of everything it is linked to.)

The first row of the window above the preview window indicates that:               
* there is one material assigned to this object and its name is &quot;Material&quot;.

The second row of controls indicates that:                                        
* The current selected material's name is &quot;Material&quot;.
* This material will only be saved if it's in use.
* It is not a &quot;Nodes&quot; material.
* Instead of being linked directly to an object, the current material is linked to a datablock.

To rename the material, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the name and enter the name you want.

To unlink the material, click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the '''X''' button to the right of the material name (&quot;Material&quot;).  This deletes the link to the datablock, removing the material from the mesh.  As a side-effect, most of the panels in the Material context disappear. You will see in a moment, however, that the material still exists. It hasn't been deleted; it is simply no longer in use.


At this point, you could click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the &quot;New&quot; button to create a new material, but instead we are going to reapply the old material:
# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the [[File:Next new button.png]] button to the left of the &quot;New&quot; button.
# You'll see a nifty drop-down list containing all materials you've created so far.  Choose ''0 Material''.

Materials whose names are preceded by &quot;0&quot; in this list are not in use.  By default, Blender doesn't save such materials when it saves the scene.  Thus, you can delete a material from the list by saving the scene and then reopening it.  You can override this behavior by toggling the &quot;F&quot; button &quot;on&quot; for unused materials you want saved.


Your materials will be much easier to find and manage if you give them brief, descriptive names you can recognize at a glance.  Change this one's name to &quot;Green Ooze&quot;. In addition, naming of your materials and other objects in your scene is useful when such components of your scene will be appended in another scene of a different Blender file. Naming your materials and other stuff in the scene will enable you to choose the right objects and materials you need whenever you wish to append just a portion of a whole bunch of work you did. For instance, you're working on a new Blender project, but felt the material you used in this Blender file is worth it. Instead of going through the pain of creating a new material (of course you guessed in the initial one in getting the right material appearance), you just append the material to your new work. Pretty simple! Make naming a habit, as it's much used in a production environment.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==Specifying Colors==
Since changing the name of the material doesn't change its properties, you still have some work to do.


Simple materials are specified by three colors: diffuse, specular and mirror. Rectangular patches (''swatches'') of the colour in their own panel in the Material context allow you to see and change each of these. Diffuse color is the basic underlying color of the material, rendered by the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|diffuse shader}}. Specular color is for highlights (small bright spots on a shiny surface) as rendered by the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|specular shader}}. Mirror color is for true reflections rendered using ray-tracing.

There are many ways to define colours. Blender supports three:

* RGB: By specifying relative amounts of red, green and blue ''primary colours'', by giving a number from 0.0 to 1.0 for each component. For example, (R, G, B) = (0, 0, 0) specifies black (no colour at all); (0, 1, 0) is full green; (1, 1, 0) (full red + full green) is yellow; (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) is 50% grey, and (1, 1, 1) is full white (maximum intensity of all components). Note that this is ''additive mixing'' of colours, which is what happens when you shine lights of different colours onto a white screen, not the ''subtractive mixing'' that takes place when you mix different-coloured paints or inks on paper or canvas.
* HSV: By specifying a ''hue'' (colour position on the rainbow) together with a ''saturation'' (strength of colour, from garish down to pastel, with zero giving shades of grey) and ''value'' (brightness). This is generally considered to be easier to use than RGB notation when you are trying to create new colours (as opposed to copying a colour spec from somewhere else), since it is easier to predict what the likely result will be. HSV is commonly represented on a ''colour wheel'', where the hue is the angle around the circle, saturation the distance from the centre, and value controlled by a separate brightness slider (as shown below).
* By specifying a 6-digit hexadecimal number. This is just an alternative form of RGB notation, commonly used for colour specifications in Web pages.

[[File:Color wheel numbered.png|framed|Blender’s colour picker popup]] 
If you click on any colour swatch, the colour picker will pop up, allowing you to change the values. This is the most intuitive way. The window that appears will look like this and will include the following (Figure 2):
# A color wheel to change the color as you want. In HSV mode, H corresponds to angle around this wheel, while S corresponds to distance from the centre.
# Three color sliders that will change if you change the color in the colorwheel. You can also change the values with the sliders.
# A slider that controls the intensity of the color. This corresponds to the V in HSV.
# A pipette capable of sampling colors from any Blender window or render window.
# Buttons that can change it to &quot;HSV&quot; or &quot;HEX&quot; mode.

* Alternatively you can specify hue, saturation and value components by clicking  {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}  on the &quot;HSV&quot; button and pushing the sliders around accordingly.

* You can also press the last button and enter the hexadecimal (or HEX) code. This is simply a different representation for RGB, where the hex digits represent ''rrggbb''.

HSV is probably the most easily understandable way of specifying and experimenting with colours. However, as is common with most computer systems, all colours in Blender are represented internally as RGB.

If you want to get rid of the window just click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} anywhere else.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Duplicate intensity sliders?'''
There are two ways to control the intensity of the colour: there is the vertical intensity slider at the right of the colour picker popup, and there are also the intensity fields at the bottom of the Diffuse and Specular panels (above), the final intensity being the combination of both values. Why two different ways?

Partly this is to allow a quick way to moderate or intensify the diffuse or specular components, without having to change the actual colour specification. But more importantly, this is to ensure that ''intensities are never set to 100%''. The reason is that this can cause rendering calculation problems, leading to total light intensities accumulating to infinity instead of converging to a finite value. This is probably not a big issue with the Blender Internal renderer, but can become a problem with [[../Advanced Tutorials/Advanced Rendering|more advanced renderers]].
}}

{{Clear}}

The most used method of creating a color of your own is using the color wheel, but because we want to be sure you will get the exact same color as us we will use the sliders. Use the above methods to set the diffuse color to R=0.149, G=1.000, B=0.446 (or use the HEX code: 6CFFB2). If you look in the &quot;Preview&quot; panel, you will see that the material is now bright green.

Most real-life materials (other than metals) don't alter the color of specular light. For this reason, Specular and Mirror are usually left at their default values (white). For green ooze, however, you'll disregard this rule-of-thumb:

# Click {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} the sample rectangle below the Specular window.
# Use the color selection dialog to adjust the specular color and watch the Preview panel to see how this color affects the sample sphere's highlight.
# Set the specular color to R=0.640, G=0.990, B=0.566 (or use the HEX code: D1FEC6). 

With these values for Color and Specular, you should be able to get a good ooze later on. The Preview, Diffuse and Specular panel should now look like this:

[[File:Green ooze.png]]
[[File:Green ooze props.png]]

As you can see, there are many other material buttons.  Many of these will be explained in later modules.  Suggestions for creating specific materials may be found in {{B3D:N2P/Module|Every Material Known to Man}}.

Save this scene before proceeding.  You will need it for {{B3D:N2P/Module|Quickie Texture}}, in which you will perfect your ooze.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|'''Copying/Pasting Colours:''' Quite often, you will want to duplicate or move a colour specified in one place to another. If the two colour swatches are simultaneously visible, you can use the eyedropper button in the colour picker. But if they are not, then the easiest way is to bring up the colour picker for the colour you want to copy, switch to the hex display, select the 6 hex digits, and copy them with {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|C}}. Then go to the colour you want to make the same, bring up its picker in hex mode, select the hex digits, and replace them with what you copied using {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|V}}.}}

==What is a resource book and why a resource book for investigations?==
It may be useful first to start by considering what a resource book is not.
You can't open a resource book and expect to find the answers to every question on
every topic covered in the resource book because it is not an encyclopaedia. You can't
open a resource book and expect to find every definition of every term and concept
because a resource book is not a dictionary. You can't unfold a resource book and find
the exact route between this idea and that one because it is not an atlas. You can't
open a resource book and expect to find an exhaustive list of quick and easy methods
for performing every activity on every topic because a resource book is not a recipe
book. And you can't expect to find a detailed explanation of every important concept
and how to grasp and understand it because a resource book is not a textbook. So if a
resource book is none of these things it begs two questions: what exactly is it? And, if it
is to be of any use at all, what must it do?
Â·
*A resource book might be called a &quot;starter pack&quot;. It could contain elements of each
feature mentioned above and could look like an encyclopaedia, or a dictionary, or an
atlas, or a recipe book, or a textbook. But it won't contain enough of any one
feature to call it that thing alone.
Â·
*What resource books do contain are: ideas that start us on a critical re-think of areas
we may have taken for granted. They also contain:
**hints, suggestions and ideas that start us thinking in new directions;
**leads that start us developing completely new ideas;
**some useful information on specific topics;
**directions to other sources containing yet more useful information;
**examples that illustrate ideas or plans e.g. lesson worksheets;
**suggestions for actions that we can take to achieve certain goals.

'''This resource book is about investigations''', mainly in science, somewhat in
mathematics, to a small degree in technology and occasionally a combination of all
three. Examples show how the investigation of some science topics involve a lot of
good mathematics learning, and vice versa. When we do an investigation we make use
of whatever tools and methods we can to find answers and increase our knowledge on a
topic. We may even invent methods that help us, as Sir Isaac Newton did to help him
develop his theory of gravity, discussed in the next section.

Some resource books are more comprehensive than others, but none is ever complete.
The primary aim of this resource book is to put you on the right road and get you started
on a journey. The journey is one of discovery therefore it cannot be mapped out
perfectly ahead of time It may not give you all the answers to your every question but it
will give you enough support and encouragement to get you going again Â­ in this case
on how to use investigations in your science and mathematics teaching.

===Why a resource book for investigations?===
South Africa and South Africans have performed a social and political miracle over the
past decade. But no society or nation prospers on warm, fuzzy feelings of political self-
satisfaction. To perform the next stage of our miracle, South Africa's economy must
grow. Economies need raw materials like minerals and agricultural products to do so.
But as we say, while raw materials are necessary, they are not sufficient. Real economic
growth only comes about when we have people with the skills to make our natural
resources work for us. It's a simple equation, really:

'''Raw materials  +  well-educated, skilled people = high quality products  +  economic growth.'''

A growing economy means more people with jobs, better prospects and more fulfilling
lives. That is the payoff for anyone backing either of the terms in the left hand side of
our equation! The prospector for raw materials and those who promote good education
in important areas of the curriculum are performing similar services for the country. As
we peel away the layers of the growth equation, we find that certain disciplines are
critically important in growing a modern economy, notably mathematics, language and
science. Close on their heels are technology and entrepreneurship.

This resource book aims, through investigations in science, mathematics and
technology, to teach the following skills critical to economic growth:

*Learning to &lt;u&gt;look&lt;/u&gt; rather than just seeing

*&lt;u&gt;Understanding concepts&lt;/u&gt; in science and mathematics by working with them in
relevant, practical situations, not merely studying them theoretically.

*&lt;u&gt;Collecting evidence&lt;/u&gt; (data) from real-life situations and using mathematical tools to
make sense of it.

*&lt;u&gt;Designing and making devices&lt;/u&gt; and apparatus to help in the collection of data (e.g.
making measurements) during the investigation.

*&lt;u&gt;Developing and using creativity, ingenuity and insight&lt;/u&gt; in investigations.

*&lt;u&gt;Taking initiative&lt;/u&gt; in the solving of problems.

Our hope is that by encouraging learner independence in the new curriculum, we will aid
the development of critical, economic skills. The connection may seem slight but those
skills are absolutely necessary to set South Africa on its economic renaissance.
Although it is a cliche, it really is true that every journey begins with the first step! This
resource book on investigations is intended to be that first step, or at least to help it.

==MESSAGE FROM MARK SHUTTLEWORTH==
It has been an honour to meet educators around South Africa who create, in their pupils, a sense of wonder about the worlds of science, technology and entrepreneurship. South Africa, sitting as it does at the intersection of cultures and economies, is an unexpectedly good place to think about technology and science. We have a track record of achieving remarkable results in science and engineering, much of that thanks to the educators who have inspired children to take an interest in the world in which they live. I hope this resource book helps to spread that sense of wonder while also recognising the work of a few out of the many who make such a difference.

==PREFACE BY SIPHO DLAMINI==
It is a little surprising that only now, after more than a decade of curriculum innovation in South Africa and with increasing emphasis on Curriculum 2005, we are starting to provide resource books for GET and FET mathematics and science teachers. The Shuttleworth Foundation is taking the initiative in producing a series of resource books that encourage teachers and curriculum developers to rethink and re-engineer how we should teach science and mathematics in schools. We cannot forget that teachers must also be curriculum developers for the process of curriculum innovation to prosper. 

Mathematics and science curriculum development has three domains: the cognitive, the so-called conative and the affective. Cognitive development is concerned with knowledge and understanding. In mathematics and science this means key concepts and factual knowledge and these are identified and described in the Revise National Curriculum Statements as Learning Outcomes . Conative development is concerned with the practical and procedural knowledge found in science process skills and mathematical problem solving abilities, also described in the RNCS. Affective development is concerned with emotional, social, cultural and moral development. This is an important, although often forgotten, aspect of learning - and hence teaching. Its importance is recognized by the learning outcomes in various Department of Education policy documents and, importantly, the critical and developmental outcomes that underpin our whole education effort. 

What, in the new curriculum, should be taught and learnt in school mathematics and science? Here are some answers to the question, in one possible direction. The kind of mathematics and science that needs to be taught in schools must give learners a confident grasp of content knowledge and understanding  the procedural skills to know how mathematicians and scientists work  and appropriate attitudes to mathematics and science and their value and use in society and economy. This resource book illustrates the curricular relevance of independent investigation in achieving these teaching and learning goals. 

Peter Glover has been active mainly in the science education world. He has taught, lectured and researched curriculum development. He has been director of an innovative curriculum organization, the Primary Science Programme, and has managed reform projects such as the Thlatloga Project, from which much material in this book emanates. He has developed and written science, technology and mathematics materials for Tlhatloga and elsewhere, including textbooks. Through his work he has always insisted on learner-directed, activity based approaches  on the total immersion of teachers in their professional development activities  and in the creation of communities of professionals, especially through the formation of effective, mutual-support clusters of schools. In this resource book, he gives a sense of the best practice with which educators could enthuse learners to genuinely participate in mathematics and science, even in our many schools which still have the barest minimum of basic resources. It is therefore heart-warming to note that some of the materials in the book have been developed and used by the successful educators who were selected in the Maths and Science Teacher of the Year (MSTotY) competition. They share with us some very useful ideas on assessment practice and implementation. 

I hope that this resource book and the series that will follow will help many educators to develop themselves into innovative mathematics and science educators in ways that are both satisfying to them and stimulating to their learners.

==ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF SOURCES OF MATERIALS==
Some of the material in this book is the work of individual winners or runners up in the Maths and Science Teacher of the Year (MSTotY) 2003 competition e.g. materials they developed and presented as part of their portfolios for adjudication in Chapter 7. Individuals whose work is reproduced here are acknowledged in the book. The contents of Chapter 3, The wisdom of the winners: hints and ideas for science and mathematics educators   Chapter 4, Ideas for investigations and Chapter 8, Clusters, support networks and communities of practice is largely the product of a workshop held over three days when the MSTotY 2003 winners came together in Johannesburg in March 2004. The examples in Chapter 6 were written for the Tlhatloga Project, a development project for Intermediate Phase educators by the University of Montana Western from 2000 2003. Chapter 5 is based on material developed by Maryna de Lange, winner of the 2002 MSTotY award. Many of the ideas for investigation topics in Chapter 4 also came from Maryna whose classes at Saldanha Bay Primary are doing regular investigations. Finally, Chapters 1, 2, 9 and 10 were either written or compiled by the editor, sometimes with re-formatting. Other materials written or edited by the editor appear in Chapter 6. The investigation into numbers in Chapter 6 was developed by Professor Otis Thompson, formerly of the University of Montana Western. Three hundred teachers who took part in the Tlhatloga Project know the pleasure of his stimulating mathematical company. 

There are many references in Chapter 10 to material from the web, a rich resource for educators with internet access. One hopes that in the not too distant future all educators will be able to use information from the web to the benefit of their teaching. The Shuttleworth Foundation s efforts should speed this process. 

The names and contact details of the MSTotY 2003 winners and runners up are recorded here. Experienced colleagues are still an educator's best resource and the MSTotY finalists are, almost by definition, more committed to this than most. Every one, in his or her own way, is willing to help with the establishment of science and mathematics support networks and clusters. Most have already done so.

==Introduction to the book and its theme: investigations==
The theme of this resource book is investigations. Investigation is important to science,
mathematics, engineering and technology educators because investigation lies at the
heart of those disciplines. In the natural sciences, we investigate phenomena in our
physical and biological environments, both the seen and unseen and both the very large
and very small. In mathematics we investigate abstract ideas that arise from our chosen
axioms. We look for mathematical relationships between variables that we study and we
seek mathematical models in the quest to find the &quot;best fit&quot; between physical reality or
human activities and the data we collect about them. In technology we investigate
problems arising out of human &quot;needs and wants&quot; and we seek the best or optimal
solutions to those problems. We are homo sapiens not so much because we &lt;u&gt;are wise&lt;/u&gt;
but because we are forever trying to &lt;u&gt;become wiser&lt;/u&gt; and to know and understand more
and better than we did before.

How do we know this? Well, just start by looking at children and the way young, pre-
school children will probe, examine, try out, explore and inquire if they are left to
themselves in an unfamiliar but friendly environment. What children do is natural to the
type of being we are. Unfortunately the way we teach children - more than the actual
content of our teaching - often removes the natural spirit of inquiry more than
encourages it.

We can also look at the lives of any of the great scientists, mathematicians, engineers
and technologists who could also be regarded as inventors. Some of them may have
been motivated by their pride, their competitive nature, a desire to &quot;be the first&quot; or the
desire to claim authorship of an idea and be recognized by their peers and by history.
Others may have been driven by commercial motives and what they stood to make from
their discoveries and inventions. But the deepest and most common motivation of all
scientists, mathematicians, engineers and technologists finds expression in three,
simple, human needs:

1. the need to know more;

2. the need to understand better; and

3. the need to find solutions to problems (and the need to make a device work well).

===Six great mathematical and scientific investigators===

&lt;center&gt;&quot;Science and mathematics are not everything but they are beautiful.&quot;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;(J. Robert Oppenheimer)&lt;/center&gt;

We can speculate about what drives someone to wrestle doggedly with a problem for
years and years, even when no obvious solution is in sight. Take someone like Andrew
Wiles, the young mathematician who found the solution to perhaps the most famous
mathematical problem of the past thousand years: Fermat's Last Theorem. Despite
having got it wrong when he first announced that he had solved the problem (and
despite the scorn of some other mathematicians at the time) he returned to the problem
(with encouragement from his friends, it must be said) and found the correct solution.

Why did he do it? Why did he sit for years in a small study and forego beautiful spring
and summer days, the company of friends, the laughter of children and the excitement
of great world events? What drives humankind to such extraordinary and single-minded
feats of the intellect? [A very readable account of Fermat's Last Theorem and the quest
to prove it can be found at [[http://www.prometheus.demon.co.uk/01/01/fermat.htm/ www.prometheus.demon.co.uk/01/01/fermat.htm]]  .
An interview with Wiles is reproduced at [[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html/ www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/proof/wiles.html]].

Johannes Kepler studied data about the planets for over 20 years, (1596 to 1619) before
he was able to formulate his three laws of planetary motion. What Kepler found was a
set mathematical formulae or a mathematical model that could fit the available data.
However, he only explained &lt;u&gt;that&lt;/u&gt; planets moved on the orbits they did and not &lt;u&gt;why&lt;/u&gt;. It
took one of the greatest scientific investigators of all time, Sir Isaac Newton, to give an
&lt;u&gt;explanation&lt;/u&gt; for the planets' elliptical orbits through his invention of the calculus as a
mathematical tool to help him solve the problem.

Newton did not think to publish his results until he was urged to do so by the
astronomer Edmund Halley, after whom the comet was named. Why? Probably, for
Newton, his reward was the thrill of discovery after years of investigation and the simple
satisfaction of knowing that he knew. Newton investigated many things as he fed his
insatiable curiosity about the phenomena in his universe. He is rumoured, during his
investigations of light and sight, to have inserted a probe into his eye socket to discover
how his eye was fixed in it. His eye took several weeks to recover and one hopes that
satisfying his curiosity compensated for his discomfort! He also tasted enough heavy
metal compounds to give himself mercury poisoning, a fact which probably explains his
legendary bad temper, paranoia and erratic behaviour at certain times of his life.

Michael Faraday was a man of little formal schooling and was self-taught in the ways of
scientific investigation. Yet he discovered how to generate electricity using a moving
magnet inside a coil of wire. Magnetic induction, as the effect is known, is still one of
the most important, practical discoveries ever made in physics. &quot;But what's the use of
it?&quot; asked Mr. Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) and later
Prime Minister of England. &quot;Why, sir,&quot; replied Faraday in a flash, &quot;there's every
probability that you'll soon be able to tax it.&quot; But taxes and commercial interests were
furthest from Faraday's mind during his years of investigation which led to his discovery.
He consistently refused the honours and riches that would have been lavished on him
had he chosen to accept them. In 1875, six years after Faraday's death, the German
scientist A.W. Hoffman, wrote


&lt;center&gt;
''&quot;...Faraday belonged, from the universality of the benefits conferred
by his genius on the human race, not merely to the island of his
birth, but to all the civilized countries of the globe ...&quot;''
&lt;/center&gt;


Perhaps the greatest investigator of the modern, western world in the past millennium
was an Italian painter, sculptor, anatomist, engineer and inventor called Leonardo da
Vinci. Some have called him &quot;the Renaissance Man&quot;. (The word &quot;renaissance&quot; means
&quot;rebirth&quot;.) For many centuries in Europe a tight lid had been kept on the spirit of
investigation. It was as though the authorities, both religious and secular, believed that if
people were allowed to investigate and question freely it would result in chaos and
anarchy. The same authorities brutally discouraged people from asking awkward
questions or from investigating the unknown. What was known was known, they
seemed to say, and everyone should be satisfied with that state of affairs. But someone
forgot to tell da Vinci and he studied and investigated everything that caught his interest.
And that was just about everything. He dissected dead animals. He dissected dead
humans. He made such accurate and detailed sketches of the muscles in these bodies
that they have never really been improved on. He drew plans for a winged flying
machine after studying birds in flight, parachutes after watching falling leaves and a type
of helicopter after studying seeds falling from pods. He never built them because the
light, strong materials he would have needed did not exist as they do today. But he
imagined and designed them nonetheless. And Leonardo da Vinci lived from 1452 to
1519!

Albert Einstein's particular genius was to investigate crazy questions in his mind.
&quot;What,&quot; asked Einstein, &quot;would I see if I traveled on a beam of light?&quot; By using his
imagination, he found an answer to his question, which surprised even him. But his
belief in his conclusion, even though it contradicted what every other theoretical
physicist believed at the time, led him to state &quot;imagination is more important than
knowledge.&quot; Another great scientist of his day, Max Planck, explained his observations
of heat radiating from an object by cautiously suggesting that energy might occur as
tiny, separate &quot;packets&quot; rather than a steady, unbroken stream. He was so disturbed by
his own conclusion that he immediately began looking for ways to disprove it. Again,
Einstein used his amazing imagination to prove Planck's theory.

===Investigations in the curriculum===
So how do we justify investigation in the curriculum? Easy. Investigations develop
important skills e.g. identifying interesting questions; systematically seeking answers to
puzzling questions; and solving intellectual and practical problems. Too many of us
spend our lives seeing our environments fleetingly through unquestioning eyes. We &lt;u&gt;see&lt;/u&gt;,
but we don't really &lt;u&gt;look&lt;/u&gt;. Educators have the responsibility to develop learners' spirit of
open-minded and active &lt;u&gt;looking&lt;/u&gt; instead of just passively seeing. Today's learner, who is
tomorrow's citizen, must learn to look at and investigate the world, not as a school
activity, but because it is a life habit. &quot;LOOK at that!&quot; &quot;Wow, that's interesting!&quot; &quot;I
wonder why it does that? I would have expected it to ... .&quot; &quot;Isn't that pattern amazing?
Is it perfectly symmetrical?&quot; &quot;Look how this has changed.&quot; &quot;I wonder when ...?&quot; and
&quot;what if ...?&quot; and &quot;how would ...?&quot; and &quot;why does ...?&quot; and &quot;why can ...?&quot; and &quot;why
should ...?&quot; And ultimately: &quot;Aha! I have found it!&quot;

In our science, mathematics and technology classes we cannot afford seeing without
looking. We must nurture curiosity and we must turn curiosity into investigate-able
questions. Learners must be taught how to ask meaningful questions and educators
must make opportunities for their learners to answer them. Above all, we must
encourage learners to dream. When you make the investigation of meaningful things a
part of your curriculum, you will find it unlocking something powerful in your learners: a
genuine enthusiasm for learning.

==The wisdom of the winners: hints and ideas for science and mathematics educators==
&lt;center&gt;&quot;Wisdom is not about saying things that no-one has ever said before but rather about
saying truths clearly that everyone else says confusedly.&quot;
(Anonymous)


&quot;Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.&quot;
(Alfred Lord Tennyson, the English poet)
&lt;/center&gt;

In the Mathematics and Science Teacher of the Year competitions, finalists are asked to
list classroom management tips, projects they have found successful and general
suggestions for educators that they have found personally useful. Many of these pieces
of teaching wisdom come from finalists in the retired educator category. It is wonderful
to meet older educators who are still enthusiastic about teaching and willing to sift
through their years of experience to pass on good advice to their younger colleagues.

In a workshop attended by all the finalists, a brainstorming session produced still more
ideas. Here are some pearls from the brainstorm and the portfolios of the 2003
Mathematics, Science and Technology Educator of the Year winners and runners up.
They provide ideas, suggestions and food for thought. Bear in mind that the list is not
meant to be exhaustive Â­ it is just a resource to spark better ideas in your own mind. If
you like anything you find here don't copy it blindly. Assess it carefully and think how it
could be adapted for your circumstances, your school and your classes. On the other
hand, don't just dismiss it saying &quot;that could never work for me because my learners are
too poor and my school is too rural and the roof is leaking and I am too overworked ...
.&quot; Good ideas apply everywhere and anywhere if you have a will to make them work.
Development for the professional educator means constantly trying new ideas and
strategies and making them work. The educator who doesn't try new ideas will never
develop and isn't very professional.

One can see from the suggestions and hints that follow why their authors are amongst
the top science and mathematics educators in the country. Most of them, it must be
said, also teach in the most disadvantaged communities in the country. The lists are
categorized alphabetically for easy reference:

'''A.''' Assisting memory

'''B.''' Change and the dynamic classroom environment

'''C.''' Classroom atmosphere

'''D.''' Classroom management

'''E.''' Developing an interest in science, technology and mathematics

'''F.''' Developing a relationship with your learners

'''G.''' Enlivening your presentation style

'''H.''' Games

'''I.''' Groups work; working in groups

'''J.''' Language issues and development

'''K.''' Links and continuity in science and mathematics teaching

'''L.''' Motivating learners

'''M.''' Policies, preparation and planning

'''N.''' Professional relationships amongst colleagues

'''O.''' Projects in and around the school

'''P.''' Respect for others

===A. Assisting memory===

*Mnemonics (eg: &quot;&lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ll &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;tudents &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;ake &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;offee&quot; = In trigonometry &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;ll functions are
positive in first quadrant, only the &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ine is positive in second, only the &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;osine is
positive in third and only the &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;angent is positive in fourth) help learners to recall and
link content.

*Use music to memorize geometry theorems (and to relieve stress!).

*Compose rhymes and songs; reciting and singing them to memorize lists and orders.

*Dramatize events or ideas.

===B. Change and the dynamic classroom environment===
*Assign seating in the classroom according to the nature of the activity. Balance this
with opportunities for learners to sit where they want to.

*Do block tutorial where all educators co-operate in setting tutorials for learners on
key or difficult concepts. a bit confusing- which educators

*Vary your teaching and use different techniques. Don't become dull, stale and
stereotyped in your approach.

*The element of surprise: surprise your learners; give them information they were not
aware of e.g. did you know that the fuel gauge in a car uses an electric circuit with a
variable resistor to detect the amount of fuel in the tank? This encourages learners
to start asking themselves &quot;how?, stimulating inquiry and hence learning in science.

===C. Classroom atmosphere===
*Make the classroom welcoming and enjoyable to be in.

*Every lesson should be planned with an activity in mind. Lessons without activities
are like movies of actors standing still. Activities stimulate learner interest; improve
understanding; stimulate inquiry; and make learners more aware of their
environment.

*Use photographs and other visuals and maintain a notice board.

*Change the notice board's contents regularly so that it does not become a static
(and boring) display.

*Encourage learners to bring science articles from magazines and newspapers etc.
especially those that relate to problems in their community.

*Collect resource books and keep these handy in your classroom.

===D. Classroom management===
*Be friendly to learners but avoid the familiarity that breeds contempt. (A variation on
this theme is &quot;don't smile before Easter&quot;!)

*Know and take into consideration any problems specific learners may have.

*Allow learners the freedom to discuss ideas amongst themselves. Specify the time
allowed and make sure that learners stay &quot;on task.&quot;

*Keep equipment and apparatus in containers or cabinets in the classroom for
security; have teams of learners act as &quot;lab assistants&quot; to keep things clean, report
breakages and maintain equipment.

*Use waste material available in the community for teaching purposes e.g. volume
bottles made from 2-litre cold drink bottles.

*Allow learners to explain their thoughts or answers to their peers. Do not allow these
occasions to lapse into aimless (and noisy) debates based on untested assumptions
rather than logically set out arguments based on well-founded information or
knowledge.

===E. Developing an interest in science, technology and mathematics===
*Have a positive attitude to science and mathematics because like any other subject,
they can be learned and understood.

*Stress that every learner has the potential to learn and understand mathematics and
science.

*Take part in science and mathematics competitions (Expos and Olympiads). You
learn from others and improve your skills and abilities.

*Make learning mathematics and science fun.

*Let learners enact moving or bonding molecules, the motion of planets or the relative
motion of two moving bodies etc.

*Form a science and a mathematics club at your school.

*Hold regular science awareness weeks (posters, presentations etc.) especially when
they can coincide with major events.

*Hold demonstrations (with appropriate permission) to protest important local issues
(for example as part of environmental education).

*Hold mock conferences to resolve environmental problems.

*Identify patterns formed by numbers and marvel at what numbers can do. Then
start playing around with numbers to make your own patterns. You will love it!

*Make discoveries with numbers.

*Let learners do practical science and mathematics e.g. measure a tile and the whole
classroom's dimensions; now calculate requirements for tiling the whole room. How
many off-cuts etc.?

===F. Developing a relationship with your learners===
*Know your learners and not just the subject.

*Try to find out what learners' own expectations are.

*Encourage learners to set goals and aims and have a vision for where they want to
go / what they want to be.

*Tell learners in advance what your expectations are and set them high.

*Plan a session to explain rights, duties and responsibilities of the learners in the
class. Explain their right to free, quality, public education but also their responsibility
as learners to learn. Explain other rights like privacy, clean water, shelter etc.

*Individual attention to slower learners to make sure they are not left behind but
learning still continues in the rest of the class.

*Don't say outright that an answer is wrong as it might discourage sensitive learners.
Rather ask probing questions so that learners can see for themselves where their
thinking is illogical or incorrect. In other words work with learners towards a correct
answer or understanding.

===G. Enlivening your presentation style===
*Do little demonstrations throughout a lesson. (Bite-sized chunks!)

*Use color to highlight important issues/facts and to make associations.

*Use teaching media e.g. flip charts etc. as it enhances the teaching atmosphere and
makes learning more meaningful.

*Using the media (magazines, newspapers, radio, TV etc.) in class wherever possible.

===H. Games===
*Games play a role in learning even if the learning is not conscious.

*Play games to illustrate principles e.g. Monopoly in EMS.

*Play mathematical and number games to do remedial work and assist with
terminology.

===I. Groups work; working in groups===
*Let class work in groups or pairs and encourage team work. (Make sure they work
as a group and not just as individuals sitting together in a group.)

*Let groups set their own rules to make the group work effectively

*Encourage learner flexibility by assigning tasks within a group and then rotating
these tasks. Make tags with responsibilities written on them.

*Composition of learner groups should be varied.

*Group work (cooperative learning; whole group participation) encourages learners to
share knowledge.

===J. Language issues and development===
*Impact of language on the teaching of science and mathematics; always point out
the differences between the formal, colloquial and mathematical/scientific meanings
of words and phrases e.g. &quot;at least&quot; which, to some learners, means &quot;the least&quot; or
&quot;the minimum.&quot;

*Because of the language we use, some concepts can be misinterpreted.

*Write poetry and short passages on scientific or mathematical ideas to assess what
a learner understands by them and to develop their ability to express themselves.

*Do sessions of reading aloud.

*Use the language of the subject and of the examinations so that learners can
understand terminology and the particular form of language usage from the onset.

===K. Links and continuity in science and mathematics teaching===
*Before you teach something find out what learners already know. (This is the
concept behind constructivist teaching.) Brainstorming can be useful.

*Link work being done currently with work done previously to make links and ensure
continuity.

*Relate subject matter to real life experiences.

*Make science a living subject, relevant to real life situations. Take relevant examples
from learners' experience e.g. applications of gas behaviour in car tires and
combustion engines etc. Science becomes meaningful because it is linked to the
world beyond the classroom walls.

*Use the school's local environment and community as much as possible in your
teaching.

*Rational debate on important scientific and technological issues. (Make sure that
debaters research their topics beforehand. Great outpourings of passion based on
incorrect facts and poor assumptions are counter-productive to science and
technology education.)

*Integrate learning areas through events and/or joint investigations and surveys e.g.
arts, culture and technology through investigation of local technologies (A&amp;C and
Technology) or survey to determine how cell phones have influenced local social and
business practices (SS, EMS &amp; Technology).

*Spend time regularly on keeping up with current events that relate to science,
mathematics, engineering and technology.

*Relate any particular section of the work to its applications in commerce, industry
and further education.

===L. Motivating learners===
*Motivational talks from successful former students.

*Offer small prizes and incentives from time to time for a significant piece of work or
improvement e.g. a pen to a learner who does not have one. (Do not overdo this
kind of incentive otherwise it loses its value and significance.)

*Encourage learners to ask the question &quot;how?&quot; (how does it work?) and encourage
them to read books on &quot;how it works&quot; as many scientific applications are found in
them. In general encourage them to find answers themselves.

*Find or devise activities that involve all learners.

*During class allow time for Independent learning

*Publicly or privately appreciate and acknowledge good work done by learners.

*Point out that science and mathematics underpin the world's technological advance.

*Demonstration of mathematical content by real life examples.

*Do geometry orals where learners solve geometric problems orally. (This is also a
good assessment tool.)

*Focus on study skills by holding short but regular seminars. Start early in the year.

*Encourage inquiry by constantly asking the two critical questions: &quot;why?&quot; and
&quot;how&quot;?

*Look for books in the library on the subject &quot;How it works&quot; and discover a wide
range of scientific applications in almost every item we use in our daily lives.

*Always make an effort to find relevant, practical, everyday applications of every
concept you learn (or teach) in your science class. This way the understanding of
science and the importance of science in your life becomes real.

*Active participation by learners is essential. Ask directed questions to keep
everyone involved and focused.

*Do informal investigations which challenge learners to come up with different
solutions. (You will be surprised at how fulfilling completing even a small project is.)

*Encourage learners to do self assessment after each lesson.

*Let the learners evaluate you.

*Encourage learners to make their own mind maps, especially at the end of a section
of work.

*Provide materials and opportunity for learners to do their own research.

===M. Policies, preparation and planning===
*Draft school homework policy and include parent body to get their &quot;buy-in&quot; and
willingness to control homework.

*Establish a school academic support program based on enrichment and diagnosis.

*Prepare lessons. A well prepared lesson gives an educator direction and helps her
to work towards the outcomes of the lesson. She can spend time figuring out the
best method to use, the materials and teaching aids needed, the type of questions to
ask and generally how to get learners to where she wants them to be by the end of
the lesson.

*Always be prepared for the unforeseen.

*Always select a variety of examples to use and select according to the way a lesson
is going.

*Plan lessons to accommodate for special needs.

*Thorough planning is vital for success.

*Do long term planning (broken into weeks, days, hours).

===N. Professional relationships amongst colleagues===
*Hold educators' phase and grade meetings to discuss what educators have learnt
during their teaching recently. The strategy of class visits by educators to colleagues
also helps in that one sees problems that other educators encounter and how they
remedy them e.g. learners with disabilities and measures for coping.

*Hold phase, grade and subject meetings for strategic- and year planning.

*Team teaching helps all to move at the same pace; all know more or less what every
one is doing.

*Continuous reporting back from workshops and other in-service training helps to
keep all abreast of latest developments.

*Evaluate and reflect on one's successes, failures and ways of improving

===O. Projects in and around the school===
*We organized an HIV/Aids awareness campaign in the community by involving the
Department of Education, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and an
international funding scheme. We exchanged views about getting across the
message of HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. The community was sensitized to
the scourge of HIV/AIDS by children placing cards with their writings on the school
walls and other places where the community usually congregates. People in the
community started talking and advising others on the epidemic. An HIV/AIDS centre
has been established as a result.

*Train learners to collect and obtain equipment and items (often thrown away) that
can be used in the science, mathematics and technology classroom.

*Give your learners projects to work on. They will use scientific principles, at times
even without knowing it. You then have a chance of highlighting the principles when
you assess their projects or when they explain them. A project like building a model
of a house with an electrical light system lets learners discover how, in practice,
bulbs are connected in a house.

*Allow a reasonable time frame to complete a project. Children deduce real-life
situations from doing things themselves and making informed judgments.

*Calculate the cost of materials and labour for paving the school courtyard. Sketch
the area to be paved, choose the tiles, their color and suitable texture/finish of the
material. Do calculations.

===P. Respect for others===
*Encourage punctuality as a mark of respect for educators and others learners.
*Explain the importance of respecting the rights of others, just as every individual
would like their rights to be respected.
*Respect the rights of each other and their property.
*Establish a classroom code of conduct with regard to mutual respect.
*Learners should feel free to participate in lessons in the knowledge that they won't
be ridiculed.
*Respect each other's language.

==Ideas for investigations==
Ideally learners should choose their own questions because a true investigation will
follow a topic that is of interest to and stimulates the imagination of the investigator. In
reality the educator may have to prompt learners or even assign questions. One hopes
that by doing investigations learners will start developing a more critical eye for their
own questions.

At the MSTotY workshop in March 2004, the participants were asked to brainstorm ideas
for investigations and then to classify them according to a classification scheme. The
purpose of the exercise was to gain a better understanding of what one might expect
from investigations on these topics. The process of classifying ideas for investigations
also gave the participants the opportunity to imagine the directions these ideas might
take a learner and the potential pitfalls and complexities hidden in the topics. One can
never determine these exactly because by the very nature of an investigation that we
cannot, nor should not, be precise about the end point. However, if an investigation
activity is to be well managed, educators had better try to gain some insight into the
possibilities presented by a topic for investigation before agreeing to it. Obviously one's
knowledge of particular learners must be taken into account.

===A classification scheme for investigation topics===

===Classifying science and mathematics investigations===
Imagine learners are asked to come up with questions for their own investigations. You
collect the questions in the class and the list looks like the example below. By
classifying the ideas you can determine whether they are appropriate for the age and
phase of the learners. For the purposes of managing the investigation you can
determine what resources the learners will need and what sort of inputs you may have to
make. The final judgment you must make &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  and the analysis should help you make it -
is whether the topic is feasible. To classify an intended investigation accurately you
must discuss it with the learner. A discussion will help you to advise the learner if
his/her intentions seem too ambitious and together you can agree on appropriate
modifications or a complete re-think. This negotiation places you, the educator, in a
much stronger position to monitor the investigation's progress.

As an exercise try to classify some of the topics suggested here. Most of the topics are
appropriate to more than one phase but this will depend on the conceptual level at
which learners attack the problems and analyse their results.

==Managing and assessing investigations==
''This chapter is based on work by Maryna de Lange, a primary school science educator
from Saldanha Bay and the 2002 Maths and Science Educator of the Year. She is
passionate about investigations and was the prime mover behind making &quot;investigations&quot;
the theme of this year's MSTotY workshop.''

===A suggested procedure for managing a scientific or mathematical investigation for school or &quot;Expo&quot; purposes===
In order to get the most out of learner investigations the process must be managed
carefully. It is important to ensure that the learners (and sometimes their parents too) are
well-informed about the process and exactly what is expected of them. The following
points will be useful for planning your investigations.

1. Clearly state: &quot;This investigation will be for ... e.g. final year assessment / regional
competition etc. and will count 50% towards the year mark in science / may,
thereafter, be submitted for the national competition etc. ... .&quot;

2. Clearly state and publicise timelines and deadlines.

3. Within the first week of the announcement, the CRITERIA (see the assessment pro
forma below) must be fully discussed with participants / learners by organizers /
educators.

4. The learner's choice of the topic is the most important part. These must be finalized
within a week of the announcement.

5. Educator reviews possible topics with each learner and tests the topic against the
criteria provided for the investigation. Get clarification of and agreement on the
&quot;focus question.&quot;

6. Learners must start work on the literature review / research immediately and get as
much outside help as possible on this preliminary stage of the investigation.

7. Within one month of the announcement (or less, depending on overall timeline and
deadlines), the educator must review each learner's topic, focus question(s),
hypotheses, plans and &quot;research design&quot; in a one-to-one interview with the learner.

8. The investigation report must be handed in within the agreed period. On the
deadline for the investigation, all reports must be handed in regardless of their state
of readiness. (No extensions can be allowed without seriously disrupting the year
programme, so careful monitoring of progress by the educator is essential.)

Doing independent assignments / projects / investigations develop extremely important
attitudes, life skills and scientific and mathematical skills e.g. time management  self
discipline  perseverance  careful, thoughtful and insightful work  reflection  accuracy etc.
''These skills and attitudes will all be assessed at the end of the senior phase.''

''In order that learners realize the importance of meeting deadlines etc., they can be made to sign a &quot;contract&quot;''

Declaration: I understand and agree to abide by all conditions and

deadlines as explained to me by: __________________________________

Learner's signature: __________________________________

Dated: 			 			 ____/____/200____

Parent's signature:		 __________________________________

Dated:				 		 ____/____/200____

Publication of notice and criteria: Dated: ____/____/200____

Educator's signature: 	 	 __________________________________

Dated: 			 ____/____/200____

Obviously investigations take a lot of time to set up. Therefore the management of the
process must be meticulous and starting on time and keeping to your schedules is
critical. Each learner must be allocated time for discussion and consultation if
investigations are to serve their educational purpose. It is possible to manage up to 35
learners. For classes larger than this it may be advisable to work in pairs. The problem
with doing investigations is that the experience we want the learners to have is really a
private one and it is most powerful when it is a personal learning experience. When
learners are in pairs there is no guarantee that each will get the full benefit of their
experience. It becomes important to choose well-balanced pairs in which both
individuals will contribute equally and communicate well, so that they learn from each
other.

===Tips on assessing investigations.===
When all is said and done, the amount of effort put into an investigation by educators
and learners is considerable and therefore deserves meticulously thought out and
planned assessment. Investigations provide a wonderful platform to assess scientific
and mathematical thinking in action. But it also means that the assessment must be
continuous in order to extract the most value possible from the process.
Assessment can take on different forms, depending on the situation at a particular time.
Here are some ideas.

*'''Self-assessment.''' Learners assess themselves. This method works well when you
discuss class work or homework, especially when moving to the next topic. It helps
you to recap on work done, provides a basis for moving ahead, saves time and
provides immediate feedback. Its drawbacks include not getting to see individual
learners' problems. Learners tend to mark themselves correct even when they are
not. Sometimes they mark an answer correct when the steps leading to the answer
are not.

*'''Peer assessment.''' Like self-assessment but here learners assess each other.
Possibly members of a group assess other members. The method poses the
problem of learners giving in to peer pressure and awarding marks for incorrect
answers. Control is essential when peer assessing and learners' books must be
checked for the accuracy and honesty. It becomes easier when a class gets used to
the method and sees the value of accurate assessment.

*'''Rubrics.''' work well and if well designed they are one of the best tools for assessing
learners. Rubrics are particularly useful when learners present the findings from their
investigations. Key items to be assessed are listed clearly with their rubrics
alongside them and learners' strengths and weaknesses can be &quot;pegged&quot; at a
glance.

*'''Educator assessment.''' is the most common form because it is the most important.
In order to assess individual strengths and weaknesses there is no substitute for the
educator reviewing and marking each learner's work. The purpose must be not only
to allocate a mark but to find the basis for remedial work where it is needed. The
other forms of assessment add value, but only if they add to the educator's own
review of learner's written work. It may be time consuming but it gets you to know
your learners. At least half of a learner's homework and class work must be
assessed by the educator. Formal tests must be marked by the educator and ideally
even informal tests must at least be reviewed.

===Assessing presentations and products===
There are certain standard types of assessment instrument but apart from the general
type, instruments are seldom &quot;one size fits all&quot;. So we usually construct instruments for
specific activities. An instrument like the one below might be used when individual
learners or groups are presenting their &quot;research&quot; findings on a task assigned to them.
This example would be used when they are explaining the idea of &quot;systems&quot; in the
context of the human body. Assigning a &quot;maximum possible&quot; mark for each item
provides the educator with a benchmark or standard by which to judge performance on
that item. An important principle of assessment is to ensure that learners know well
beforehand, exactly what the criteria are against which they are being judged. When
learners know this they begin to develop their own &quot;internal&quot; standards.

A similar instrument might be used to assess a model that has been constructed. In this
case the model is of the lungs inside the thorax. It shows how, by using the diaphragm
to increase the volume of the thorax the lungs can be inflated and deflated. This model
could be made from a two litre cold drink bottle, a balloon, a plastic drinking straw and a
cork with a hole bored in it. In this activity, the learners would have been given clear
instructions to follow.

|

|- 
| 

4. Does the learner explain how the movement of the plastic
	affects the movement of the balloon?
|
|

|- 
| 

5. Does the balloon inflate or deflate well (i.e. no leaks)?
| 

YES

The score on an instrument like this can be related to an overall, 5-point scale e.g.
excellent (5/5)  good (4/5)  satisfactory (3/5)  unsatisfactory (2/5)  poor (0-1/5).

The words used to describe the different levels are a matter of choice. If, for instance, it
is a 5-point scale, the five words or phrases used must describe a logical sequence of
performance levels, communicate to learners how their educator will judge their
performance and must indicate to learners where they have performed well or poorly on
the task. With the assessment instrument in front of them the educator and learner can
decide how to remedy shortcomings and build on strengths.

===Rubrics===
Rubrics use words to describe successive levels of performance. They are useful
assessment tools but they are of no value unless they are carefully constructed and then
used with fairness, insight and care. It doesn't matter how good a rubric is, if the
educator does not use the rubric consistently appropriately learners will have no
confidence in the method or the instrument. When learners lack confidence in an
educator's judgments (about their performance) they miss the learning opportunity that
good assessment practice can provide. The assessment of an investigation can teach
almost as much about the process of investigation as the activity itself.

Here are some rubrics. In the first example we have a rubric to assess designs in a
technology class. The second the rubric is for assessing actual design drawings. The
third rubric is related to RNCS Learning Outcomes (LOs) and Assessment Standards
(ASs) for the Natural Sciences.

Any good rubric can be adapted or used as a template to produce others. The revised
national curriculum statements (RNCS), scheduled for implementation in 2007, call for
assessment of four level of performance in the GET band. Therefore particular tasks and
activities can be assessed by designing rubrics from the learning outcomes and
assessment standards appropriate to the task.
In these examples (adapted from All Aboard Science 7 by Heinemann Publishers)
various learning tasks are covered. The first example involves an investigation into the
causes of corrosion in metals.

The investigation of sensitive issues can lead to debate that involves prejudices and
emotion. In science it is important to recognize and keep these distractions in check.
That is why scientists try &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  not always successfully &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  to take account of how we
accumulate knowledge and the peculiar role that personal feelings and prevailing ideas
play in attempting to understand the world we live in. The third learning outcome (LO3)
in the Natural Sciences deals with this issue and is notoriously difficult to assess.
Rubrics can help when we discuss issues that bring out emotion and contradiction. But
we should not allow difficulties like this to put us off because dealing with topics that call
for the interpretation of historical evidence and differing points of view are important to
our development as scientifically literate people. The rubrics for the Natural Sciences
LO3 AS1 can be adapted, for instance, to issues of gold mining and processing of gold
ore, the development of dynamite and the effect that refrigeration has had on the
international trade of agricultural products.

===Strategies: your own assessment policy===
Maryna de Lange has set her assessment policy so that several assessable aspects of
her learners' work count towards the final mark for the year. She writes: &quot;I balance five
forms of assessment so that every learner's preference can be accommodated. I use
the assessments to build up learners' portfolios which I keep in my Master file. I
regularly record the outcomes of my observations on a formative record sheet. Learners
are allowed to choose the work they want to keep in their portfolios for promotion
purposes. Assessments consist of educator-, peer- and self- assessments. The forms of
assessment I use are:

(a) Four tests and two examinations. The tests count 30 marks each and the examinations are set for between 100 and 150 marks. The totals for the tests and the examinations are then converted to 60 marks each. [Total 60 + 60]

(b) Eight class- or homework activities count 15 marks each. 120 marks are converted
to 45. [Total 45]

(c) Two projects of 40 and 35 marks respectively. [Total 40 + 35]

(d) Two assignments of 30 mark each. [Total 60]

(e) Two investigations of 30 mark each. [Total 60]

The total mark for Science for the year is 360. The pie-chart below gives us a picture of
this policy. Remember that there is also a portfolio and a formative record that can be
used when the learner's performance for the year is assessed. OBE calls for continuous
assessment to ascertain a learner's development. Does this policy meet these
requirements?

You will agree that this assessment policy gives a very comprehensive picture indeed.
The pie chart also shows that investigations and projects (both involve learners working
independently on problems of their own choice) make up more than a third of the total
mark.

==Examples of investigative activities in science and mathematics.==
The investigations described so far are all projects and of the type where learners come
up with an idea and then try to find out as much as they can about it. The purpose of
investigations like these is to get learners into the processes of science (see Chapter 9
for a comprehensive list of the facets of scientific literacy). But the spirit of investigation
can be found in much simpler activities and lives on in the saying of a great science
educator of the past, Julius Sumner Miller: &quot;more doing and less talking&quot;! When
introducing a new concept or simply when presenting learners with a remarkable
phenomenon to stimulate their imaginative juices, investigations remain a very powerful
tool in the hands of science and mathematics educators. Here are a few popular,
investigative activities. Follow the instructions and work out what scientific concepts are
being demonstrated. Investigative activities leading from each of these would be to find
out where each phenomenon can be seen at work.

A useful acronym that summarises an approach to using these quick investigations is
&quot;OPE&quot; or Observe, Predict and Explain. When doing them in class it is important to
allow learners the time to observe carefully (possibly re-doing the demonstration in the
process)  to discuss their predictions and the theory behind their predictions  and then
their explanations of what happened, particularly if their predictions were incorrect.

===Quick investigations: important concepts in science===
====Lifting an ice cube without touching it.====
You will need a glass of water, ice cubes, a piece of string and some salt.
'''Step 1.''' Put an ice cube into a glass of water. It floats with about one tenth of the cube sticking out above the water.

'''Step 2.''' Put an end of the string on the exposed ice and sprinkle some salt on it. Let it stay there for a minute or two.

'''Step 3.''' Gently lift the string.

''What do you expect?'' That the ice cube will remain in the water and the string will pull away.
''What actually happens?'' The string sticks to the ice cube strongly enough to lift it from the water.
''How does it work?'' Salt lowers the freezing point of water to below 0&amp;deg C. When the ice melts where the end of the string lies, the melted ice dilutes the salt and the ice freezes again. The warmth of the string will first cause a small hole to form in the ice and the water-salt mixture then freezes around it again when the string is inside the ice cube. 

====Heavy paper.====
You will need a double sheet of newspaper and a ruler.
'''Step 1.''' Place the ruler on a table with a few centimetres sticking over the edge.

'''Step 2.''' Cover the ruler on the table with the sheet of newspaper.

'''Step 3.''' Hit the piece of ruler that extends over the edge of the table hard, with your
hand.

''What do you expect?'' You expect the paper to leap into the air as you hit the ruler.
''What actually happens?'' The paper remains stationary on the table. It does not even tear.
''How does it work?'' The weight of air on the palm of your hand, turned upwards, is about
45 kg. What is the weight of air on a double sheet of newspaper? Certainly more than a
ruler can lift!

====How strong are your lungs?====
You will need a balloon and an empty cold drink bottle.

'''Step 1.''' Place the balloon in the neck of the bottle.

'''Step 2.''' Wrap the opening of the balloon around the opening of the bottle.

'''Step 3.''' Blow into the balloon which is inside the bottle.

''What do you expect?'' The balloon should inflate and fill the bottle.
''What actually happens?'' The balloon inflates very slightly but then it is impossible to
inflate it any more.
''How does it work?'' As the balloon inflates, the air in the bottle compresses into the
remaining space. This means that the pressure back on the blower's lungs also
increases. It is very difficult to inflate the balloon, even a little!

====It's not so easy to move coins.====
You will need a heavy water glass, a strip of newspaper, two large coins and a ruler.

'''Step 1.''' Put one end of a strip of paper over the rim of the glass.

'''Step 2.''' Balance the two coins on the edge of the glass.

'''Step 3.''' Make sure the coins are just touching the paper but are actually balancing on the rim and not on the paper.

'''Step 4.''' Lift the free end of the paper and hold it horizontal.

'''Step 5.''' Strike the paper with a ruler about 5 cm from the edge of the glass.

''What do you expect?'' You expect the coins to drop into the glass.
''What actually happens?'' The paper is whipped out from under the coins and they remain on the lip of the glass.
'''How does it work?'' All bodies resist being put into motion (i.e. being made to move). The more mass in a body, the more difficult it is to make it move. So the light paper moves but the heavier coins do not. (Find out what this property of matter is called.)

====Paper scorch and char.==== 
You will need a spirit burner, matches, a rod of wood and metal (make one with a dowel
rod and a piece of aluminium foil wrapped around one half of it a few times) and a piece
of writing paper.

'''Step 1.''' Wrap a single layer of paper around the wood-metal rod.

'''Step 2.''' Light the spirit burner.

'''Step 3.''' Play the flame lightly on the paper over the boundary between the metal and the wood on the rod.

''What do you expect?'' The paper will burn.
''What actually happens?'' The paper chars on the half that covers the wood but not the aluminium foil.
''How does it work?'' The metal conducts the heat away from the paper while the wood does not. So the temperature of the paper over the wood soon rises to the point at which paper scorches and chars. This does not happen over the metal.

====A balancing trick at the dining room table - if your mother lets you do it!====
You will need a cork, a pin, two forks and a heavy glass.

'''Step 1.''' Place the pin in one end of the cork.

'''Step 2.''' Stick the forks into the side of the cork so that they hang downwards &amp;shy  their handles being below the bottom of the cork that has the pin in it.

'''Step 3.''' Balance the pin on the bottom of an upturned glass.

''What do you expect?'' You expect the whole arrangement to fall over because it looks so unstable.
''What actually happens?'' The arrangement balances on the pin and although it may wobble at first it soon settles down.
''How does it work?'' Every body has a point called the Centre of Gravity (CoG) associated with it. It is the point at which the entire mass of the object appears to be concentrated. If the CoG is below the balance point the object will be very stable.

====Superboy and Supergirl!!====
You will need two broomsticks and a length of rope.

'''Step 1.''' Let Superboy/Supergirl hold two broomsticks vertically, one in each hand, and pull inwards while two other people try to pull the broomsticks (and the holder's arms) outwards.

'''Step 2.''' Now, while the two &quot;pullers&quot; each hold a broomstick vertically, tie one end of a piece of rope onto one broomstick (about one third of the way up) and then wind the rope about 5 times around both, working in an upwards direction.

'''Step 3.''' Let the two pullers try to pull the broomsticks outwards again while Superboy/Supergirl pulls on the loose end of the rope. 

''What do you expect?'' You expect the two people to pull the broomsticks apart with ease.
''What actually happens?'' The rope pulls the two people inwards quite easily.
''How does it work?'' This acts like a series of pulleys (or block and tackle). Every turn of rope almost doubles the pulling power of the person on the end of the rope.

====Tight fit.====
You will need a single sheet of A4 paper and a pair of scissors.

'''Step 1.''' Give each learner a pair of scissors and a piece of A4 paper.

'''Step 2.''' Set them the problem: &quot;Can you cut the paper so that it fits over your body?&quot;

'''Step 3.''' Fold the paper in half short end to short end.

'''Step 4.''' Cut out a narrow rectangle from the folded end as shown (X).

'''Step 5.''' Make an odd number of cuts according to this pattern:

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_1.png|center]]

''What do you expect?'' Can't do it!
''What actually happens?'' It works!!
''How does it work?'' Look carefully at the arrangement and see why it works.

'''Step 6.''' You can experiment using another piece of paper. Try disobeying the instructions, for instance by making an even
number of cuts or not cutting right to the edge of the paper!

==Investigating Number Patterns==
''This series of activities was prepared by Professor Otis Thompson of the University of Montana Western in his capacity as Principal Investigator and Mathematics Specialist on the Tlhatloga Project. The activities were presented at a series of workshops held in 2003. Professor Thompson has had a distinguished career as a mathematics educator and regards his three years working with South African educators as the highlight of his professional life.''

===Educator's Guide===
Mathematics has been defined as the study of patterns. Patterns are everywhere &amp;shy  on
wallpaper, floors and wall tiles  in artistic works  in plant and animal growth and behavior 
in traffic  and even in television schedules. Scientists look for patterns in order to isolate
variables so that they can reach valid conclusions in their researches. Learners can gain
experience with patterns by investigating numerical and geometric patterns and
expressing these patterns mathematically in words or symbols. To analyze patterns we
first determine the structure of the pattern and how the pattern changes. We then
organize the information systematically and finally develop generalizations about the
mathematical relationships in the patterns. In these activities learners can explore
number patterns and learn some methods for analyzing them. They can then use their
analyses to express the patterns mathematically. Learners can also investigate how pure
number patterns apply to the real world.

'''Activity 1'''
In this activity, the learner will explore some familiar number patterns and will name the
set of numbers described.

'''Activity 2'''
In this activity, the learner will explore arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, and
sequences of figurate numbers. An arithmetic sequence is one in which each successive
term is obtained from the previous term by the addition or subtraction of a fixed number
called the difference. A geometric sequence is one in which each successive term is
obtained from the previous term by multiplying by a fixed number called the ratio.
Figurate numbers are numbers that can be represented by dots arranged in the shape of
certain geometric figures.

'''Activity 3'''
The Fibonacci sequence will be introduced using the original problem that Leonardo
Fibonacci presented in 1202. Then the learner will explore some other problems that
lead to the Fibonacci sequence. The learner will discover some of the interesting
relationships within this sequence and express these relationships mathematically. The
learner will explore how plant growth patterns are aligned with the Fibonacci numbers.

'''Activity 4'''
1+ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1 + L} }
Learners will explore the continued fraction and see that stopping at a given point always leads to a ratio of
Fibonacci numbers. When converted to a decimal these ratios approach 1.61803..., the golden ratio. The learners will then
experiment to find a &quot;most pleasing rectangular shape&quot; and learn that the ratio of length to width is approximately this golden ratio. The learners will then locate rectangles in their surroundings that are &quot;golden rectangles.&quot; 

'''Materials needed'''
*Paper and pencil
*Calculator (optional)
*A whole pineapple (optional)
*Compass
*Straight edge
*Scissors or cutting knife

===Learner activities===
====Number Patterns Activity 1====
Thembisa had to learn a large list of spelling words for her final spelling test for the term.
The first day she learned two words, and each day thereafter she learned to spell two
more words. If she had the list learned by the 15th day, how many words were on her list?

To solve this problem, complete the following table:

So we see that Thembisa's list contained _____________ words.

The list of numbers you created (called a sequence) is part of a very special set of whole
numbers. This set, written as {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ...}, where the ... (called ellipsis) means the pattern continues forever. What is the name of this set of whole numbers?

There are other sequences of whole numbers for which you probably have a name. Let's
explore and see which ones you know.
In each sequence below, fill in the next three terms and give a name to this sequence.

1. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ______ , ______ , ______ , ...

Name: ________________________________

2. 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ______ , ______ , ______ , ...

3. 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ______ , ______ , ______ , ...

Name: _______________________________

4. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, _____ , ______ , ______ , ...

====Number Patterns Activity 2====
A large theatre is set up in such a way that there are 20 seats in the first row and 4
additional seats in each consecutive row. The last row has 144 seats. How many rows
are there in the theatre?

If we try to solve this problem by creating a list as we did in Activity One, it might take us
a while to finish the list. Let's explore some of the properties of a sequence such as this
one to try to simplify our method of solution.

The sequence we need to create to solve this problem is called an arithmetic sequence.
An arithmetic sequence is one in which each successive term is obtained from the
previous term by the addition or subtraction of a fixed number called the difference.
Write the first five terms of the sequence that correspond to the first five rows:
What would be the tenth term in this sequence?
What would be the twentieth term in this sequence?
Write a rule for finding the nth term of this sequence?

Now use this rule to find the number of rows in the theatre.
To determine if a sequence is an arithmetic sequence, one simply looks to see if the
difference between consecutive terms is constant.
Which of the following sequences are arithmetic sequences? If the sequence is an
arithmetic sequence, write the 100th term of this sequence.

1. 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, ...

Arithmetic ? Yes/No

100th term = ________________

2. 4, 6, 9, 13, 18, ....

Arithmetic ? Yes/No

100th term = ________________

3. 1040, 1032, 1024, 1016, 1008, ....

Arithmetic? Yes/No

100th term = _____________

4. The set of even whole numbers

Arithmetic? Yes/No

100th term = _____________

Now the question arises regarding the introductory problem in Activity 2: How many
seats are there in the theatre?

To answer this question, first let's consider a simpler problem. What is the sum of these
numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 100? (Note this is an arithmetic sequence with a difference of 1.)

Write out the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100

Below it write the Sequence &quot;backwards.&quot;: 100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1

Now if we add the pairs above and below each other, the sum is 101, and since there are
100 such pairs, the total sum of the two rows is 100 x 101. But since this contains every
number in the sequence twice, we will divide this product by 2 giving us 1 + 2 + 3 + ... +
99 + 100 = 5050.

(Note: To find the sum of a finite number of terms of an arithmetic sequence, you need
to know the first term, the last term, and the number of terms. Write a rule using this
information for finding such a sum and then use this rule to find the number of seats in
the theatre.)

Find the sum the following sums:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + 1000 = _______________

2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + ... + 72 = _______________

8 + 11 + 14 + 17 + ... + 305 = _______________

Not all sequences are arithmetic. Other types of sequences exist. A geometric
sequence is a sequence in which each successive term is obtained from its predecessor
by multiplying by a fixed number called the ratio.
Find the next three terms in these geometric sequences:

1. 2, 4, 8, 16, ______ , ______ , ______ , ...

2. 729  486  162, _____ , _____ , _____ , ...

3. 1, 0.4, 0.16, 0.064, _____ , _____ , _____, ...

Figurate numbers (numbers that can be represented by dots arranged in the shape of
certain geometric figures) provide examples of sequences that are neither arithmetic nor
geometric. Below is the first four terms of the sequence of triangular numbers.

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_2.png|center]]

Explain why the next triangular number is 15.

The sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... is not an arithmetic sequence (since no common
difference) nor a geometric sequence (since no constant multiplier.) But if we look at the
difference between consecutive terms and then difference between consecutive
differences, we see a pattern that should help us find the next three terms of this
sequence.

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_3.png|center]]

Here are the first three pentagonal numbers.
Find the next three pentagonal numbers using
the method you used with the triangular
numbers.

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_4.png|center]]

When asked to find a pattern for a given sequence, first look for some easily
recognizable pattern and determine if the sequence is arithmetic or geometric. If a
pattern is unclear, taking successive differences (as done with the figurate numbers) may
help. It is possible that none of these methods will reveal a pattern.

====Number patterns Activity 3====
In 1202 Leonardo Fibonacci presented the following problem in his book Liber abaci
(Book of the abacus): A certain man put a pair of baby rabbits in a place surrounded on
all sides by a wall. How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year, if
it is supposed that every month each pair begets a new pair which, from the second
month on, becomes productive?

To solve this problem, let's make a table and keep track of how many pairs we have
each month. Remember, we will start with one baby pair. At the start of the second
month, they are now an adult pair of rabbits, so they breed. The gestation period for
rabbits is one month so at the start of the third month, we now have an adult pair and a baby pair.

Now complete the table to arrive at the answer as to how many pairs we have at the end
of the year.
Carefully analyze the sequence of numbers you obtained for the total number of pairs.
Describe how one can determine the next term in this sequence.

(Note: this sequence is neither an arithmetic nor a geometric sequence. The method of
successive differences doesn't work like it did for the figurate numbers, but it may give a
clue to how to build successive terms in this sequence.)

Now let's explore this sequence in greater detail and make some conjectures about it.
1. Complete the following table for the first 25 terms of the Fibonacci sequence: There
is nothing anywhere here to explain what the Fibonacci numbers are or how they are
obtained?

2. If your table was completed correctly, the twenty-
fifth Fibonacci term, F25, should be 75025.

3. Find the following sums:

a. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

b. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

c. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

d. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

e. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

g. Write a rule that would let you give the answer to the sum of the first n terms in terms of a
Fibonacci number. 

h. Use your rule to find the sum of the first twenty terms of this sequence.

4. Find the following sums (note: we are just using
the odd numbered terms):

a. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

b. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

c. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;

d. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;

e. F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;

a. F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

b. F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

c. F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;

d. F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;

e. F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; + F&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;

f.Write a rule that would let you give the answer to the sum of the first n even numbered terms in terms of a Fibonacci number.

g. Use your rule to find the sum of the first ten even numbered terms.

6. Find the sum of the square of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers -This is written symbolically as: (F_n)^2 + (F_{n+1})^2. The result should be another Fibonacci number. Which one is it?

7. a. Take any three consecutive Fibonacci numbers from your list. Multiply the first number by the third number and subtract the square of the middle number. -This is written symbolically as: F_{n-1} X F_{n+1} - {F_n}^2
Write a rule that would explain what the answer will be.)

b. Without actually doing the computations, what is the value of F&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt; x F&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;shy  F&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt;^2

this sum of squares.

13. Every natural number is either a Fibonacci number or can be expressed uniquely as a sum of Fibonacci numbers whereby no two are Fibonacci numbers. Here is one way to do it:

a. Write down a natural number.

b. Find the largest Fibonacci number that does not exceed your number. That Fibonacci number is the first term of your sum.

c. Now subtract that Fibonacci number from your number and look at this new number.

d. Next find the largest Fibonacci number that does not exceed this new number. That Fibonacci number is the second number in your sum.

e. Continue this process until the remainder becomes a Fibonacci number (the last term of your sum.)

14. The game, Fibonacci nim, is played with two people: Person 1 and Person 2. All that is needed is a pile of sticks. Person 1 moves first by taking any number of sticks (at least one but not all) away from the pile. After Person 1 moves, it is Person 2's
move, and the moves continue to alternate between them. Each person (after the first move) may take away as many sticks as he or she wishes with the restrictions that he or she must take at least one stick but no more than two times the number of sticks the previous person took. The player who takes the last stick wins the game. Player 1 can always win using the following strategy. Make sure that the initial number of sticks is not a Fibonacci number. Write the number of sticks in the pile as a sum of nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers (see problem 13.) Figure out the smallest Fibonacci number occurring in the sum and as Player 1, remove that many
sticks from the pile. Now your opponent (Player 2) plays. No matter what Player 2 does, you repeat the preceding procedure. That is, once Player 2 is done, Player 1 expresses the number of remaining sticks as a sum of nonconsecutive Fibonacci numbers, and then removes the number of sticks that equal the smallest Fibonacci number in the sum. It is a fact that, no matter what Player 2 does, Player 1 will always be able to remove that number of sticks without breaking the rules and eventually Player 1 will be able to remove the last stick and win. Now let's explore some other problems.

1. A child is trying to climb a staircase. The maximum number of steps he climbs at a time is two  that is, he can climb either one step or two steps at a time. If there are n steps in total, in how many different ways can he climb the staircase?

If there is only one step (n = 1), clearly there is only one way to climb it. If there are
two steps, the child can either climb the two steps at once or take them one at a
time  thus there are two ways. What if there were 3, 4, 5, ... steps?

2. Suppose we have two glass plates made of slightly different types of glass mounted face to face. If we shine light through the plates, the light rays can (in principle) reflect internally at four reflective surfaces before emerging. More specifically, they can pass through without reflecting at all, or they can undergo one internal reflection, two internal reflections, three internal reflections, and so on before emerging (see the diagrams below.) Count the number of beams that emerge when there are n internal
reflections.

3. In a honeybee colony a drone (male) bee gets his start from an unfertilized egg and thus has just one parent (the queen.) The queen bee gets her start from a fertilized egg and thus has two parents (a queen and a drone.) If we went back 10 generations in a drone bee's &quot;family tree,&quot; how many great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents would this drone bee have?

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_6.png|center]]

4. Here is an algorithm for creating a sequence known as the Golden Sequence. Start with the number 1, and then replace 1 by 10. From then on, replace each 1 by 10 and each 0 by 1. How many 1's are there in the sequence of 0's and 1's after you have done this iteration process 12 times?

The above problems all lead to the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is everywhere. It even occurs in plants. Petal counts and petal arrangements of some flowers harbor Fibonacci numbers. Most field daisies have thirteen, twenty-one, or thirty-four petals (all Fibonacci numbers.) The leaves along a twig of a plant or the stems along a branch tend to grow in positions that would optimize their exposure to the sun, rain, and air. The passage from one leaf to the next (or from one stem to the next along a branch) is characterized by a screw-type displacement around the stem. For example, on the pear tree it takes three complete turns to pass through eight stems, a pair of alternate members of the Fibonacci sequence. The hexagonal scale on the surface of a pineapple is a part of three different spirals. Most pineapples have five, eight, thirteen, or twenty-one spirals of increasing steepness on their surface. All of these are Fibonacci numbers. When you look at the head of a sunflower, you will notice both clockwise and counterclockwise spiral pattern. In the pictures below, there are 21 clockwise spirals and 34 counterclockwise spirals, again Fibonacci numbers.

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_sunflower.jpg]]

A pinecone's exterior is composed of two sets of interlocking spirals, usually 5 spirals in one direction and 8 in the other. What examples of Fibonacci numbers can you find in the plants in this location?

====Number Patterns Activity 4====
Now let us look at a very different type of never-ending expression, this time involving
fractions:
1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac {1}{1 + \frac {1}{...}}}}}

This is a special case of mathematical entities known as continued fractions. How
would we compute the value of this fraction? One way is to &quot;truncate&quot; the continued
fraction as various points, simplify the fraction, and look for a pattern in our results.

1. Express as an improper fraction. 1 + \frac{1}{1}

2. Express as an improper fraction. 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1}}

3. Express as an improper fraction. 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1}}}

4. By this time you may have discovered a &quot;short cut&quot; for doing this. So let's do one more. Express as an improper fraction.
1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac {1}{1}}}}

5. Have you seen the numbers that appear in the numerator and denominator of these
improper fractions before? What are they?
(F&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;)/F&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

6. Use a calculator to get a decimal approximation to the fraction for larger and larger values of n where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number. This number is known as the Golden Ratio and is usually identified by , the Greek letter phi. It can be shown mathematically that this number is exactly .

Now let's try a little experiment. You will be given a piece of paper with several rectangles drawn on it. You are to select the one rectangle that is the most &quot;pleasing, attractive, and elegant&quot; of the set. The results for the group will be tabulated. Let us now construct a rectangle that has some special appeal to many people.

1. Draw square ABCD.

2. Locate the midpoint of segment DC.

3. Place the compass point at M and using radius MB, draw arc BE.

4. Point E is the point where DC extended intersects the arc.

5. Locate point F so that AFED is a rectangle.
[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_7.png]]

It can be shown mathematically that in rectangle AFED, the ratios of sides frac{AF}/{DE} and {BC}/{BF}
are both equal to , the Golden Ratio. Hence rectangle AFED is known as the Golden Rectangle. Much has been written about how various artists and architects have allegedly used the Golden Rectangle in designing their various works. Near the center of a sheet of paper, construct a Golden Rectangle. Carefully cut the rectangle from the sheet leaving the outside of the sheet intact. Now use this &quot;template&quot; to find objects around you that are close to being &quot;Golden Rectangles.&quot;

===Investigating Combinatorial Mathematics===
''This activity is based on an idea derived from &quot;The Man Who Loved Only Numbers: the story of Paul Erd&amp;ouml;s and the search for mathematical truth,&quot; by Paul Hoffman (1998)  and &quot;The Combinatorial Mathematics of Scheduling,&quot; Scientific American, March 1978. The
activity was written by Dr Peter Glover and was first used in June 2001 during the Tlhatloga Project's Summer Institute in Dillon, Montana, USA.''

====PROBLEM 1====
Divide a group of 5 weights (2, 2, 2, 3 and 3) into two piles so that each pile is as close as possible in total weight.

''''SOLUTION 1-1''''
By inspection (i.e. just by looking at the weights) we can arrange them (3, 3) and (2, 2, 2). When dealing with a few weights the problem can be solved by &quot;trial and error&quot; i.e. by trying all the variations you can until you get the best answer. This is a problem in the branch of mathematics called &quot;combinatorics&quot; &amp;shy  the mathematics of making the best decision about what to put where and how to
combine quantities in an optimal way to get a desired result. It is a relatively new branch of mathematics and it is finding applications everywhere from defense to cutting lengths of piping to packing of delivery trucks.

'''SOLUTION 1-2'''
Ronald Graham is one of the best combinatorial mathematicians today. Here is his algorithm* for packing weights most efficiently:
&quot;starting with the heaviest weight and working down to the lightest, put each weight into the pile that tends, at each step of the way, to keep the weights of the piles as equal as possible.&quot;

[* The word algorithm is taken from the ninth century Persian number theorist called Abu Ja'far Mohammed ibn Musa al-Khowarizmi, who also gave his name to &quot;algebra.&quot; &quot;An algorithm is ... a step-by-step procedure in which every step is explicitly stated so
that a problem can be blindly solved by man or machine.&quot; (Hoffman. 1998).]

But using Graham's algorithm to solve PROBLEM 1 we get this solution:

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_8.png]]

We can see that this is '''not the best solution''', which our trial-and-error solution was i.e. where each pile totals 6 weight units (i.e. 3, 3 and 2, 2, 2).
But it is also '''not the worst combination''', which it would have been if piles ranged in size from 2 to 10 (i.e. 3, 3, 2 and 2, 2  OR 3, 3, 2, 2 and 2). 

Our computer programs are simply algorithms (many of them) strung together and written in a language that computers can decode, &quot;understand&quot; and act on. The best solution vs the algorithmic solution The best solution (which ours was and which was found by trial and error) is 3, 3 and 2, 2, 2 (i.e. 6 and 6). But Ron Graham's algorithm gives us 3, 2, 2 and 3, 2 (i.e. 7 and 5). 

Therefore Graham's algorithm gives a solution that is out by 1/6 in each case, (i.e. 6 vs 7 and 6 vs 5)  or &amp;plusmn  16% off the best answer.

Graham was able to prove that for 2 piles and any distribution of any 
number of weights, his algorithm will never be off by more than 16%. 
In 1973, Jeffrey Ullman of Princeton University showed that the 
so-called &quot;first-fit packing algorithm&quot; &amp;shy  where you pack items in 
whatever order they arrive into whichever container you choose, as 
long as they fit &amp;shy  can be off by as much as 70%!

====PROBLEM 2====
You have the 33 weights shown below and bins with a capacity of 524 weight units. Using Graham's &quot;first-fit, heaviest-to-lightest&quot; algorithm, divide up the blocks provided into as few bins as possible.

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_problem2.jpg|thumb|center]]

1. Show any calculations you make.

2. Show how you packed your weights in the bins:

====PROBLEM 3====
You still have 33 weights, but now each one is half the weight of those used in PROBLEM 2. Where halving gives a 0.5, round up as shown in the examples. Your new bins have a capacity of 262. Before using the &quot;first-fit, heaviest-to-lightest&quot; algorithm, see if you can make any calculations to predict how many bins you will need to pack the weights. When you have made your prediction, pack your blocks into as few bins as possible.

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_problem3.jpg|thumb]]

Your prediction: _____ bins.

Show how you would pack your weights.

====PROBLEM 4====
Take the 33 weights as used in PROBLEM 3 except that wherever there was a &quot;rounding up&quot; for a 0.5, you should now round down any halves. The bins still have a capacity of 262. When you have predicted the number of bins required, use Graham's algorithm to pack your blocks into as few bins as possible. 

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_9.png|center]]

Your prediction: _____ bins.

Show how you would pack your weights.

====PROBLEM 5====
Use the 33 weights you used in Problem 2 but discard the 46 weight. Predict the number of bins you will need now. (a) Use Graham's algorithm to pack the blocks into the fewest bins possible  and (b) using a trial-and-error approach, try to improve on the
solution your &quot;first-fit, heaviest-to-lightest&quot; strategy gave. 

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_10.png|center]]

Your prediction: _____ bins.

Show how you would pack your weights.

====A Pipe Cutting Problem: another combinatorial investigation====

Fiberglass insulation comes in 1-meter precut sections. A plumber must install insulation in a basement on piping that is often interrupted by joints. The distances (measured in cm) between the joints on the stretches of pipe that must be insulated are 30, 40, 45, 30, 20, 25, 40, 50, 30, 35, 50, 55, 60, 70, 95, 10, 70, 30, 80, 85, 40, 45, 30, 20, 15, 90, 60, and 50. How many precut sections would the plumber have to use to provide insulation. A stretch of pipe must be covered by one solid piece of insulation. No joining of two shorter pieces to make a longer piece is allowed.

This problem and the one presented earlier are known as bin-packing problems. Bin packing refers to finding the minimum number of bins of weight capacity W into which weights w1, w2, w3, ..., wn (each less than or equal to W) can be packed. Graham's algorithm, &quot;first fit, heaviest to lightest&quot; is also known as the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm. This algorithm works quite nicely if you know all the weights prior to assigning to bins so they can be arranged in order from largest to smallest. In some bin packing problems, we do not have this luxury. In these cases other algorithms must be used. Here are the definitions of the more commonly used algorithms for bin packing. 

'''First Fit (FF)'''

The next weight to be packed is placed in the lowest-numbered bin already opened into which it will fit. If it fits in no open bin, a new bin is opened. 

'''First Fit Decreasing (FFD)'''

The first fit algorithm is applied to the list of weights sorted so that they appear in decreasing order.

'''Next Fit (NF)'''

A new bin is opened if the weight to be packed next will not fit in the bin that is currently being filled. No previously opened bin can be used.

'''Next Fit Decreasing (NFD)'''

The next fit algorithm is applied to the list of weights sorted so that they appear in decreasing order.

'''Worst Fit (WF)'''

The next weight to be packed is placed into the open bin with the largest amount of room remaining. If the weight fits in no open bin, a new bin is opened.

'''Worst Fit Decreasing (WFD)'''

The worst fit algorithm is applied to the list of weights sorted so that they appear in
decreasing order.

'''Best Fit (BF)''' 

The next weight to be packed is placed into the open bin that will leave the least room left over after it is placed in that bin. If the weight fits in no open bin, a new bin is opened.

'''Best Fit Decreasing (BFD)'''

The best fit algorithm is applied to the list of weights sorted so that they appear in decreasing order.

Try to solve the pipe-cutting problems at the top of this page using the different bin packing algorithms. Study the different
answers you get from the various algorithms and see if you can understand why the answers differ. Which of the algorithms
appears to be most useful? Why? The chart of pipe lengths will be useful.

====Pipes and Bubbles: An investigation====
Regard this as an educator's guide for teaching the lesson. Use the pages provided but do not distribute descriptions to the learners before time. The activity only works if an element of surprise is retained.

*Four farmers' houses are exactly at the corners of a large, square field that they share.

*They decide to put in a windmill at the very centre of the field to pump water for the farmhouses.

*Naturally they want to use the shortest length of piping possible to reduce their costs.

*The farmers discuss the matter and come to the obvious conclusion:

four pipes leading directly from the pump to each farmhouse will give the shortest total length of piping &amp;shy  and therefore the lowest cost.

Do the measurements. Measure to the centres of the circles and the square and write
down the total length of piping in '''ARRANGEMENT A is ............. cm.'''

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_12.png|center]]

'''Now ...'''

*... using wire and pliers make a cube from wire (a cubic frame). The wires at the corners can be twisted together using the pliers. Make a handle so that the frame can be dipped into soap solution.

*A cube is a &quot;block&quot; shape with 6, square faces. In the case of the cube you are making, it is really a framework that is not filled in &amp;shy  like a small version of a climbing frame at a playground.

*When you and/or the learners have made a cubic frame, dip it in soap solution. (A good recipe for soap solution: 1 part dishwashing detergent, 2 parts water, ? part glycerine. The glycerine makes the soap bubbles stronger. Try these proportions and make adjustments to ensure that good bubbles can be blown. If you have no glycerin, add more detergent.)

*Each face has a thin film of soap on it. You will also notice that some soapy film forms inside the cube. Shake your cube gently until the soap film settles. Do this a few times until you get the soapy film settling into the same shape of film each time.

*Now look carefully at how the soap film is arranged inside the cube.

*If you wind all the edges of the wire frame with knitting wool you will find that the soap films last longer. Make sure that the wool is well soaked with soap solution.

*The shape of the soap films in the cube gives a clue as to how to arrange the water pipes on the farm? Let learners draw an arrangement of pipes that is different from '''ARRANGEMENT A''' and which might solve the farmers' problem.

*Measure the total length of the pipes in '''ARRANGEMENT B is ............. cm.'''

Could the soap bubbles have helped the farmers to save piping?

'''ARRANGEMENT A'''
Measure the total length of the four pipes, each going directly from the windmill(the sqaure in the image) to each farmhouse (the sircles in the image).

[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp6_13.png|center]]

'''ARRANGEMENT B'''
Measure the total length of the four pipes going from each farmhouse to the centre and the piece of pipe laid crossways, through the position of the windwill at the centre of the field.

==Materials developed by the winning educators==
This resource book is not meant to be a textbook on investigations with pages of ideas for teachers. Any examples given are intended to illustrate how even the most common classroom activities can be done with an investigative bias. The materials here, taken
from the portfolios of winners of the MSTotY 2003 demonstrate this clearly. The first activity is the investigation of &quot;fractions&quot; for Intermediate Phase learners. Because it tackles the topic using measurement it is appropriate to both science and mathematics.
The second and third activities are common in FET physics (Newton's Second Law and the electromagnetic motor rule). The reader will appreciate that by re-shaping them ever so slightly, even familiar activities can conform to the requirements of an &quot;investigative
approach.&quot; We might assume that &quot;to investigate&quot; means learners working alone and researching private topics that catch their imaginations. But this is not necessarily the case and activities with a specific focus and educator-directed can also be investigations.

In the first of the three examples learners are given a sequence of activities that follow the logic of fractions and learners study them through measurements. Indeed, measurement itself is an important aspect of investigation. So instead of talking about
the &quot;free investigation of private topics&quot; by learners, which is the pure form, we now have what is an &quot;investigative approach&quot; to teaching and learning. Free investigations by learners are a special subset of the investigative approach. The important point is that
whether learners follow their own curiosity or are led through a logical sequence by their educator, in both cases they are investigating in a way that follows the logic and nature of mathematics and science. The advantage of educator-led investigations is that learners can be shown a logical approach (e.g. asking and then answering a key question before moving to the next stage) even if it may not be as neat and sequenced in &quot;the real world&quot;. By gaining this guided experience learners should adopt a similar
approach in their free investigations. The first investigation was produced by Vanessa Thayer, winner of the 2003 award for
Maths and Science Educator of the Year. Vanessa acknowledges the original inspiration for the activity and the source of some of the content. It is important for professionals to do this as they, of all people, must be above plagiarism and the unacknowledged use of
other people's ideas. Using decimetres to investigate fractions: an investigation into fractions and measurement

SPECIAL NOTE
All activities in this module were adapted from teaching
material and ideas received at the in-service course for
Intermediate Phase mathemaics educators at WCED,
Cape Teaching Institute.

===Guideline notes for the educator===
====The history of fractions====
Early Egyptians made mention of fractions even before the pyramids were built, over 4000 years ago. Measurement was used to survey farms. They first used their elbows and fingers, but this did not work too well because elbows and fingers were of different
lengths for different people. 

In their quest for accuracy, they used standard units as equal parts of a bigger unit, e.g. the decimetre ruler. However, they now found that they had a whole bag of rulers, which was also inconvenient. So they later used tenths, hundredths, thousandths (decimals)
but had to keep to common fractions (halves and quarters) and couldn't, for instance, measure of a metre in decimals. (Take the learners back in time and make the context real.)

We teach fractions to provide a basis for decimal fractions. We deliberately investigate common fractions in the context of measurement to allow learners the opportunity to discover the context within which fractions started and, most importantly, to see the
logic behind equivalent, simple, mixed fractions etc and the relationship between common fractions and decimals. In this way learners are able to formulate their own rules / methods and will also, in the higher grades, understand the logic behind rules, methods and formulae.

The module of activities offer many opportunities for learners to talk about what they have done and engage with other learners and this is an effective way of making learners aware of how they are learning, building on their communication skills and most
importantly, engaging with logic. 

Try not to rush the concrete support of using the rulers. In this way learners will internalise the logic and will later be confident in working with abstract contexts. Ensure that the learners get the fraction language correct. Encourage them to say, e.g. 3 quarters and not 3 over 4. In the next module of activities, learners will have the opportunity of working with fractions in many other, varied contexts.

===Measuring with decimeters===
Put your ordinary rulers away. You will only work with the special rulers provided here.

You will use the decimetre as a unit. Here you can see approximately how long a decimetre is:

{| WIDTH=&quot;65%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2  border: solid 1px #f2fff2  padding: 1em &quot; valign=top|

&lt;center&gt;'''One &quot;practice decimetre&quot;'''&lt;/center&gt;

|}

====Task 1====

1. Cut out a strip of paper as long as the &quot;practice decimetre&quot; above. Now you have made a &quot;one decimetre ruler&quot; for yourself.

2. Use your practice ruler to check whether the pencil below is exactly 2 decimetre long. If not, is it more than or less than or about (approximately) 2 decimetres long?

3. Measure the length and the width of the marble slab below with your practice decimetre. Is it a square?

4. Measure the edges of your desk top with your practice decimetre.

5. Was it possible to measure your desk top accurately with the practice decimetre ruler? Discuss this with a friend.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_1.png]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_2.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

[Use the next two pages as photocopy masters or as exemplars, if they are copied. Make
sure that Rulers ABCD, EFGH and JKMN are all exactly 20cm when they have been
photocopied. The pages may require a slight enlargement. If you redraw them make
sure that the sub-divisions are all exactly equal in any one ruler. For example, all the
small sub-divisions in Ruler D must be exactly 1cm long.]

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_3.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

[KEY: E (30ths), F (15ths), G (24ths), H (16ths), J (20ths), K (25ths), M (40ths), N (50ths)]

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_4.png]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_5.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

====Task 2====

Cut out the ruler (with Rulers A, B, C and D on it) and fold it along the dotted lines. In this way you will make your own set of decimetre ruler.

1. How long is each small part on the lower section of ruler B? Write down your answer.

2. How long is each small part on the lower section of ruler C? Write down your answer.

3. How long is each small part on the lower section of ruler D? Write down your answer.

Simphiwe has measured each of the pencils on the next page. Here are his results:

*Pencil A is a bit less than 1.5 decimetres long.
*Pencil B is about halfway between 1.5 decimetres and 2 decimetres long
*Pencil C is precisely 2 decimetres long.
*Pencil D is a bit less than 2 decimetres long.
*Pencil E is precisely 1.5 decimetres long.
*Pencil F is precisely halfway between 1.5 decimetres and 2 decimetres long.
*Pencil G is a bit more than 2 decimetres long.

4. Use your new decimetre ruler to check each of Simphiwe's measurements. When you have completed your measurements, compare your findings with your group. 

&lt;center&gt;o0o&lt;/center&gt;

Mr. Marota tried to measure this earthworm.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_6.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

First he tried to measure it with the tenths-ruler:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_7.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Can you see that the tenths-ruler does not work well for this worm? You can only say that the worm is a bit longer than 6 tenths of a decimetre, and shorter than 7 tenths of a decimetre.

Then Mr. Marota tried a twelfths-ruler:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_8.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Next he tried the eighths-ruler:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_9.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Mr. Marota was very happy now. He had succeeded in measuring the earthworm quite accurately. He wrote: The earthworm is 5 eighths of a decimetre long.

====Task 3====

1. How long is the earthworm below?

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_10.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

2. Measure each of the pencils below. For each pencil you must find the ruler that fits exactly. In each case write your answer down like Mr Marta did. 

====Task 4====

1. Measure pencils B, E and F accurately using your new rulers.

2. Compare your results with your group.

3. Work alone again. Use one of your rulers to draw a line exactly 7 tenths of a decimetre long.

4. Use one of your rulers to draw a line exactly 5 sixteenths of a decimetre long.

5. Explain to your group how you managed to do Question 4.

6. Use one of your rulers to draw a line exactly 17 twentieths of a decimetre long. 

'''Equivalent Fractions'''

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_11.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Smaller parts'''

Simphiwe wants to investigate how fish grow when they get different kinds of food. So he wants to measure this little fish accurately.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_12.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Simphiwe tries all the different decimetre rulers that he has.'''

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_13.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

====Task 5====
1. Can Simphiwe now say accurately how long the fish is?

2. Ben says the fish is 9 twelfths of a decimetre long. Do you agree?

3. Make two new decimetre rulers, one by cutting out and folding Ruler EFGH and the other by cutting out and folding Ruler JKMN. 4. For each new ruler, count the small sub-divisions of a decimetre and write on the ruler what fraction of a decimetre the y are e.g. Ruler E (30ths).

4. Measure the fish above accurately with Ruler EFGH. Write down your answer.

'''The language of fractions (equivalent fractions)''

====Task 6====
Measure these fish accurately using Rulers EFGH and JKMN. Write down your best answer like this: Fish X is 19 twenty fourths of a dm.

Compare your results with your group.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_14.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Equivalent Fractions: Different descriptions of the same length'''

'''Settling a disagreement'''

Tswanelo and Simphiwe disagree about the lengths of fishes D, F and G. Here are Tswanelo's results:
*Fish D is 3 quarters of a decimetre long.
*Fish F is 8 tenths of a decimetre long.
*Fish G is 21 twenty-fourths of a decimetre long.

Here are Simphiwe's results:
*Fish D is 15 twentieths of a decimetre long.
*Fish F is 16 twentieths of a decimetre long.
*Fish G is 7 eighths of a decimetre long.

====Task 7====

Work on your own.
1. Using all of your decimetre rulers, investigate the situation regarding the lengths of fishes D, F and G.

2. Write a letter to Tswanelo and Simphiwe, to help them to resolve their differences. (Group work)

This is how Tswanelo measured Fish D.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_15.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Tswanelo sees that he can describe the length of Fish D in two ways.
''He can say it is 3 quarters of a decimetre.''

''He can also say it is 6 eighths of a decimetre.''

3. Can one also measure Fish D with other rulers?

Simphiwe sees that Fish D can also be measured more accurately using twelfths of a decimetre. Write down the fish's length in twelfths of a decimetre.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_16.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

4. Vuyo says: Fish D is 4 12 sixths of a decimetre long. Is he correct?

5. Explain in writing why 3 quarters of a decimetre and 9 twelfths of a decimetre are actually the same length. Compare your explanation with your group.

6. Work on your own again. Explain in writing why 4 12 sixths of a decimetre and 9 twelfths of a decimetre are actually the same length. Compare your explanations within your group.

====Task 8====

'''Equivalent Fraction problems'''

1. Use your rulers to check if 15 twentieths of a decimetre is the same length as 9 twelfths of a decimetre? Write down the reason for your answer.

2. Compare your response to question 6 with your group.

3. If Fish C is 23 thirtieths of a decimetre long, do you think it can be measured more accurately in sixtieths of a decimetre? First think about it by yourself and come to your conclusion, do not discuss this with your group just yet. 

4. A certain Fish X is precisely 3 fifths of a decimetre long. Write down all the other ways that you can describe the length of Fish X accurately.

5. Compare your answers with your group.

6. Another fish, Fish Y is precisely 10 sixteenths of a decimetre long. Write down all the other ways that you can describe the length of Fish Y accurately.

7. Compare your answers with your group.

'''Combining parts'''

Houses are sometimes built with cement building sheets instead of bricks. The cement sheets that are made in factories are not all the same thickness. Since sheets of different thicknesses are used for different purposes and sold at different prices, it is sometimes
necessary to measure the sheets quite carefully. 

The cement sheet sample below is {frac}3/24 dm (three twenty-fourths of a decimetre) thick, as you can see.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_17.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

====Task 9====
Measure the thickness of each of the following cement sheet samples. Use the decimetre rulers that you have cut out, and take trouble to make very accurate measurements.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_18.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Compare your answers with your group. You must reach agreement.

====Task 10====

Two or more sheets are sometimes joined to make one thicker sheet. You can see an example of this below. These combined sheets are called composite sheets. Measure the thickness of the dark and the light part of the composite sheet below. Make the most accurate measurements you can.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_19.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

1. Using the twentieths ruler (Ruler J),
*measure the darker sheet:
**measurement _____________ dm.

*measure the lighter sheet:
**measurement _____________ dm

*measure the composite sheet:
**measurement _____________ dm

2. Using the twenty fourths ruler (Ruler G),

*measure the darker sheet:
**measurement _____________ dm.

*measure the lighter sheet:
**measurement _____________ dm

*measure the composite sheet:
**measurement _____________ dm

3. Working very accurately, draw your own composite sheet as follows:
*The total thickness of the composite sheet must be dm. (Use Ruler A)
*The darker sheet must be dm. (Shade it in.)

4. Give the thickness measurements of the darker, lighter and composite sheets in
Number 3 using Rulers, A, E, D, F.

5. Examine all the measurements for your light sheet and compare them with the measurements for the dark sheet. Do you see a pattern? Write down what you notice.

6. Work in a group. Discuss how you can use this pattern to get the measurements of rulers A, E, D and F for your composite sheet without using rulers A, E, D and F. 

7. What were the most important conclusions from your discussion? Write them down.

====Task 11: classroom assessment====
Diane measures some samples of composite sheets and records her results. These are given in the table below. For each measurement show which other rulers could also be used to measure the sheet exactly. Write down the accurate measurement from that ruler in the columns. (Check your answers by comparing rulers. Place them next to one another to do this.)

Copy this table and write in your answers.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_20.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''Tenths and hundredths.'''

This is a very fine decimetre ruler.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_21.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

It is actually a tenths-ruler, but each tenth of a decimetre is again divided into 10 smaller units.

====Task 12====
1. How many small units are there in the above ruler?

2. Measure the thickness of all the sheet samples on the next page with one of your &quot;old&quot; decimetre fraction rulers (ABCD, EFGH or JKMN).

3. Now measure the sheet samples with your new (hundredths) ruler.

4. Calculate the thickness of each of the following composite sheets in two ways, first by adding your measurements in other fraction parts of a decimetre, and then by adding your measurements in hundredths of a decimetre.

'''Writing fractions using decimal notation - A different way to write fractions'''

Instead of writing 7/10, we can write 0,7. &quot;0,7&quot; is read as &quot;nought comma seven&quot;, or just as &quot;comma seven&quot;.

Instead of writing 7/100, we can write 0,07. This is read as &quot;nought comma nought seven&quot;, or just as &quot;comma nought seven&quot;.

Instead of writing 2 37/100, we can write 2,37. This is read as &quot;two comma three seven&quot;.

This way of writing tenths and hundredths is called the decimal notation.

====Task 13====
1. Write each of the following lengths in the decimal notation and then find the sum of
the lengths:
a. 3 dm + 1/10 dm + 4/100 dm 
b. 1 dm + 7/10 dm + 4/100 dm 
c. 3 dm + 5/10 dm + 9/100 dm 
d. 3 dm + 5/10 dm 
e. 3 dm + 5/100 dm 

2. With a partner or in a group, check your answers and compare the methods you used.

3. Arrange Sheet A-F from thickest to thinnest using your tenths / hundredths measurements.

4. Write down their thicknesses in decimetres using decimal notation.

5. Calculate the thickest composite sheet you could make from any two of these sheets and write down the thickness in decimetres and in decimal notation.

6. Calculate the thinnest composite sheet you could make from any two of these sheets and write down the thickness in decimetres and in decimal notation.

====Task 14: Calculator Task====
a. Enter &quot;.2 + .05 =&quot; and write the answer:
*__________

b. Write the answer to (a) as an ordinary fraction:
*__________

c. 25 hundredths is also equal to a ____ part of a decimetre. ( 1
1/10, 4/12, 3/4, 1/2, 1/4

d. Do the following calculations and write them out in the same way as in (a), (b) and (c) above:
* .7 + .05 = ___
* .3 + .45 = ___
* .12 + .13 = ___
* .2 + .55 = ___
* .38 + .12 = ___

==FET Physics==
The next activities cover two important topics in FET physics. They are presented in a very conventional form but, like the Intermediate Phase investigation of fractions, these activities can be taught in an investigative style. The difference is that if the educator's control is strong, the activity will be less of an investigation. If it is less educator-centred i.e. he/she gives more control over the activity to the learners, it will be more of an investigation way. Again we must make the point that the spirit of investigation lies largely in the approach taken by the individual educator to teaching and learning. 

==Newton's Second Law (NII)==

===Outcomes===
At the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
*Draw a graph of force versus acceleration and interpret it.
*State the relationship between acceleration of an object and the force producing the acceleration.
*Apply this relationship to their everyday life experiences

===Teaching method===
Experimental/investigative

===Teaching aids===
Ticker tape timer, ticker tape, metre rule, runway, books to support the runway, thin string, pulley, some 10g mass pieces, graph paper, worksheets, pencil, rubber, ruler, scientific calculator, chalk, board duster.

===Tips===
Most Grade 12 textbooks and practical worksheets suggest that when doing this investigation the force can be applied on the trolley with rubber bands or spring balances double or triple the force. Anyone who has tried this method will have found that it is very difficult to move along with the trolley while at the same time stretching one or two rubber bands to a constant length. This difficulty can be avoided by using mass pieces (i.e. &quot;weights&quot; as described) instead of rubber bands. Any identical objects, e.g. 10g
mass pieces will do the trick. 

*Tie a mass piece to a thin, strong thread.
*Use an oiled pulley. (See sketch above.)
*Start the ticker tape timer and then release the trolley. Prevent it from crashing.
*Increase the number of mass pieces one at a time and repeat the procedure until the trolley accelerates at too high a rate for useful results.
*Problems to overcome: ticker tape timer not making clear marks and the trolley running skew.
*Learners must grasp the concept under investigation AND the fact that experimental results are never &quot;perfect&quot;.
*A runway for the trolley can be made from an old door.

===Start of lesson===
Divide learners into groups  at most four learners per group.

===Introduction===
The educator draws this diagram on the chalkboard ...
... and asks: &quot;What will happen to the object if the two forces act on it simultaneously?&quot;

**(Anticipated answer: &quot;The object will remain a rest because there in resultant force on it.&quot;)

The educator then draws another diagram ...
... and asks: &quot;What will happen if these two forces are applied to the object?&quot;

**(Anticipated answer: &quot;The object will move to the right because there is a resultant force of 2N acting on it.&quot;)

The educator consolidates the answers by referring to previous knowledge: 
A body will, if at rest, remain at rest or, if moving, continue moving in a straight line at constant speed forever if there are no resultant forces acting on it. (NI)

The educator then writes the aim of the investigation on the chalkboard.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_23.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

===Aim===

To investigate the relationship between the motion of an object of constant mass when
it is acted on by an unbalanced force.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_24.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

===Method===

*The educator distributes prepared worksheets and describes the experimental procedure (no mention of &quot;acceleration&quot; at this point) including how the motion of the object can be determined from the ticker timer and tapes.
*Mention here that when there are sufficient data, these can be plotted on graphs. 
*Learners gather around the table and observe the educator as he/she produces the first tape.
*Agree with the class on the series of masses to be used and let the learners produce the rest of the tapes for themselves.
*Agree on the method of finding the time interval between each dot on the tapes and calculate T.
*Learners now analyze each tape. (Discard the first few points and the last few points on the tapes and use the middle section.)
*'''NOTE:''' if ticker timers are not available it is possible to make ticker tapes with dots that can be analysed. While this is less than ideal to do it this it is certainly better than doing the activity purely as a textbook exercise.
*Learners calculate the average velocities for each interval (i.e. between dots on the tape) and record these on their worksheets.
*On the same sheet of graph paper?, plot graphs of velocity vs time for each tape and calculate the &quot;rate change in velocity&quot; for each tape (i.e. for varying masses).
*Ask questions that get the learners to understand that by varying the masses on the string, they have varied the force applied to the trolley.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp7_25.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

*Introduce the concept of acceleration: the rate of change of velocity. Work out the units of acceleration.
*Express the slopes of the graphs on the series of v-t graphs as accelerations.

*Ask the question: &quot;what is responsible for the acceleration of the trolley?&quot; 
**(Anticipated answer: &quot;The changing force applied on the trolley by changing the
number of mass pieces.&quot;)
*Suggest drawing a graph to look for a relationship between force and acceleration. Plot the graph using &quot;number of mass pieces&quot; as the independent variable (x-axis) against the acceleration (y-axis).
*Is there a straight line relationship? Draw a &quot;best fit&quot; line (i.e. a line that goes closest to most points) on the acceleration vs resultant force graph. 

===Discussion===

*Is there a straight line trend on the graph? (Carefully executed tests on this apparatus usually lead to one.)
*If not, what could affect the experimental procedure? (Friction will affect the size of the acceleration but since it is a force in the direction of movement it will not affect the linearity of the graph. The fact that friction varies with the velocity of the moving
object need not be discussed here since the affect is probably within the experimental error anyway.)
*The educator discusses the questions with the class and clarifies the meaning of a straight line graph relating acceleration to the resultant force. (10 min)

===Conclusion===
If there is a straight line trend this shows a linear relationship that can be stated: 
*&quot;a is proportional to 1/F&quot;
*Explain that this is known as Newton's Second Law of motion and show the class the mathematical formulation including mass (of the trolley and NOT the number of mass pieces) as the constant (of proportionality).

===Homework===

Learners are asked to bring along written information about situations where the relationship between acceleration and force is evident in their everyday experiences/practical situations e.g. The difference between one and two people pushing a stalled car and the resultant accelerations. 

==Electromagnetism and electromagnetic forces==
''The beauty of this investigation, on electromagnetism, is that it is almost identical to the kind of investigations done by Michael Faraday in England and Joseph Henry in the USA in the early part of the nineteenth century. Their pioneering work has led to the great motors and generators that keep our industries moving today.''

===Outcomes===
At the end of the lesson, learners should be able to:
*Apply Fleming's Left Hand Rule to determine the force experienced by an electrical conductor in a magnetic field.
*State and understand the factors which influence this force.
*Name practical, everyday applications of this force.

===Teaching method===
Learner investigation

===Teaching aids===
Retort stand, U-magnet, copper leads (x2), torch cells (x4), circuit board, copper pieces designed for this experiment.

===Start of the lesson===
The educator divides learners into 3 groups- at least 8 learners per group. 

===Introduction===

The educator asks the following question:
&quot;What effects does the electrical current in a wire show? Describe any you have seen.&quot; 
**(Anticipated answers: heating, lighting, magnetic and chemical effect.)

The educator starts with phenomena already known to the learners. Make no explanation at this point of the relationship between electric current and its magnetic effect

The educator writes the day's topic on the board. &quot;Investigating forces on current-carrying conductors in magnetic fields.&quot;

===Aim===
To investigate the force experienced by a current carrying conductor in a magnetic field.

The educator issues worksheets, explains the apparatus (see diagrams below) for the investigation and allows the learners to follow the instructions.

===Discussion===
The educator discusses any effects of forces observed (i.e. movement &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  see NII) and draws out learner observations/opinions on the variables affecting the observed forces e.g. increasing the magnetic field strength or increasing the length of the conductor in the magnetic field. Make a chalkboard summary and let learners note the additional information.

===Apparatus===
For this investigation, set up this apparatus using the suggested materials or others like them. The apparatus is not complicated and can be assembled using scrap or low costs materials. 

'''NOTE:''' Magnets are easy to come by in the doors of discarded fridges. Old electrical flex and torch cells can also be found or bought very cheaply.

Obtain 3 metal wires, preferably copper and form them into the three shapes below.

Set up the apparatus for the investigation as shown in the diagram.

When electricity flows in the conducting wires, wire 1 must be able to move freely on the loop joints it makes with wires 2 and 3.

===Apparatus for the investigation===
Wire1 must be free to move into or out of the magnet as shown by the dotted arrows. 
Know which end of the U-magnet is its North pole.

Now connect the terminals of the battery to wires 2 ands 3 to complete the apparatus.
'''(In a perfect world and with unlimited time, one would leave learners with the question &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  &quot;find the relationship among ... etc.&quot; &amp;Acirc &amp;shy  and let them both design the apparatus to test the relationships and come up with answers. Unfortunately few educators can afford this
luxury and so the apparatus for the investigation is a &quot;given&quot;.)'''

==Clusters, support networks and communities of practice==
The ideal environment in which to bring about change, either system-wide curriculum change or more local efforts to change, say, to a more investigative approach to teaching and learning, is one where teacher support is freely available - when and where needed.
Ideally the &quot;when&quot; is all the time and on demand. And ideally the &quot;where&quot; is in the place where educators encounter their problems and difficulties: the classroom. Giving support is not as simple as it sounds. For a start, the giver and receiver should be in a
trusting, professional relationship. Secondly, the receiver must trust the support giver's knowledge and skills in that discipline. And thirdly the support giver must be an expert. The fact is that nowhere is the ideal commonplace. Givers and receivers of professional
support seldom have the time to develop the perfect &quot;mentor-mentee&quot; relationship. There are never enough experts in school education as their skills are in high demand, making them very mobile. It seems to be the way of the organizational world that experts are promoted away from their areas of expertise as they are probably too competent in too many areas! And then there is the principal limitation: money and not enough of it. No government anywhere can afford the cost of quality support needed to effect major change in a very short time. Finally, we all have responsibilities and lives to live beyond our work and so the demands on people and their own time must be kept reasonable.

Now where does this leave us? Is enduring curriculum change a pipe dream? Well, actually, no. If teachers like our MSTotY finalists and many others like them are anything to go by, it is not. We, the willing, can change the curriculum and provide better science and mathematics to all South African learners. But it will take steady progress, creativity and energy to bring about any changes we desire. This chapter offers a few simple suggestions on one course of action. Quite simply, educators can't wait for &quot;the department&quot; to do everything for them. An answer is to develop educator-to-educator support networks. How to organize these depends so much on local circumstances that it is pointless to go into too much detail but here are some provisos for viable teacher support networks. We must start with teachers who:

*really want to improve themselves professionally;
*really want to receive support;
*are prepared to put in effort to improve themselves and each other;
*are really prepared to give to others as well as receive from them;
*live reasonably close together;
*are prepared to meet regularly;
*are prepared to try new things and ...
*are prepared to fail (at first) in their attempts to change without withdrawing.

With a group of like-minded professionals we can establish &quot;communities of practice&quot;. In our context a community of practice is a group of educators who live and work in close proximity and who can meet regularly to offer practical and moral support; to share ideas and to recount successful teaching experiences. Together educators can analyze their failures and see them not as sources of embarrassment but as sources of really useful, professional knowledge. Building a community of practice takes time and patience but it is a basis for true professional development. Because a community of practice is teacher-driven it encourages a stronger commitment to professional
development than official programmes that are attend reluctantly and infrequently. How does one start a professional growth and development group that will become a healthy community of practice? An approach is for a small, committed group to answer a few, key questions. The questions should be re-visited and possible answers re-negotiated as the group grows. The moral &quot;buy-in&quot; of all members is critical so it is important to give every member the chance to add his or her views to the debate. Here are some guidelines.

===How to start?===
====Who are you?====
Someone needs to take the initiative and put out invitations to local schools and teachers to get together. Once this has been done the ball will roll if there is a perceived need for such a grouping.

===What do the group members need in general?====
Ask this question and come to a consensus about a programme.

====What do the group members need, specifically?====
Specific, curricular or teaching support. But be realistic. The group can't equip labs or supply computers!

====Why do the group members need these things?====
Opens the discussion on group members' circumstances and gets a mutual appreciation of each others' problems.

====Needs by phase / grade?====
Catalogue needs. This will help with the development of the group's programme. After the initial discussions, is there still a genuinely felt need for the group/network?

===How to do it?===
====Clustering.====
Schools within close proximity; with similar needs; and with resources or expertise that they are willing to offer to / share with the whole group.

====Optimum size: what can YOU handle?====
Don't be over-ambitious. Although there may be a great need to serve this group, you cannot do it alone.

====What REAL official support is available?====
Survey this and find out from local education authorities.

====Cooperating with official bodies and personnel.====
Make the co-operation with official bodies and persons a priority. Get their blessing and buy-in for the idea.

====Sustaining professional development: communities of practice.====
When group members start seeing their efforts and participation as important to the survival of the group; and when the survival of the group becomes professionally important to the individual group members, you have a community of practice.

===Limitations / problems / weaknesses / difficulties.===
Identify and acknowledge these. Then reduce or solve them.

===Where are you?===
Know where group members teach and try to have all members visit the schools of all other members.

===What to do?===
====Plan programme content.====

====Committees.====
Keep committee work to a minimum and make sure that the bulk of meeting time is spent on doing professional work Â­ and not talking about trivial, administrative matters.

====Functions of committee members / portfolios.====
If a small committee is formed, make sure that each member has a portfolio and that there is general agreement in the whole group of roles and responsibilities.

====Exam setting by cluster.====
This is a useful way to get the group collaborate and to address an important need.

===How often to meet?===
Balance frequency versus efficiency.

===Communicating.===
Establishing a &quot;communication triangle so that no-one has to contact more than two people:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:DoingInvestigations_chp8_1.png&lt;/center&gt;

===Running successful workshops.===
The &quot;workshop&quot; has become a standard in development work, and for good reason. A good workshop involves more doing and less talking; an occasion where participants experiment, investigate, hear and share new ideas, and give themselves time to think of better approaches in an engaging atmosphere. Some key features of successful workshops are:

====Participant selection:====
Workshop participants begin by selecting themselves, in that they should already have done something to show that they are passionate about improving maths, science and technology (MST) education in their schools or districts. Punctuality and attendance; responsiveness, participation and enthusiasm for MST; and the willingness to share their curricular and content insights are important. The group decides who is welcome and who is not.

====Intensive engagement:====
Workshops must be intensive with total immersion in MST, the principles of OBE and activity-based teaching and learning. This also means workshops that are not too short or where people are arriving late and leaving early. Teacher participants who cannot cope with intense, hard work should not be part of the group in the first place.

====Modeling:====
At MST workshops, the presenters should try to model good MST education and OBE practice, from planning to presentation. Participants must be able to imbibe the spirit and application of good teaching and learning, the first principle of which is &quot;maximum learner activity.&quot;

====Less is more:==== 
Less focus on recallable answers (less &quot;right answer-ism&quot;) and more focus on the processes of scientific and mathematical investigation, exploration, discovery and pattern-seeking. Less talking and more doing does not mean no time for critical discussion and reflection. It means a shift in emphasis from talk to action. OBE: The context of all MST work done is set by the spirit of OBE. But worry less about OBE terminology and OBE Policy and give more attention to elements of good MST education that promote OBE.

====Technology:==== 
Technology Education is a wonderful means to integrate mathematics and science learning and gives both learning areas relevance. Emphasise mathematical, scientific and technological literacy. (The &quot;literacies&quot; get their meaning from an ability to apply MST knowledge to real life. Technological problems are solved by using science and mathematics in context.)

====Resources:====
Place an emphasis on using waste and recycle-able materials and on improvisation. Any resource that enables learners to do hands-on work is important. Teachers cannot wait for such materials to be supplied and must work together to create them through ingenuity and improvisation. 

===Follow up and &quot;Subject Advisors&quot;:===
A focus of the community of practice model is to develop &quot;lead teachers&quot; who give rather than take the lead in their own group's development. Ideally MST lead teachers should serve a wider, provincial commitment to MST- and HR Development but this is not essential. Subject advisors are ideally placed to take the &quot;community's&quot; lead teachers into a wider development process but again, this  does not have to be a primary aim of the home-grown support and development network. Educators should see themselves as professional friends and mentors for the other members of their group. Where possible members should observe each other's teaching.

===Keep a reflective journal===
*It is not a report of factual information but a record of personal insights and of expectations, perceptions and feelings about one's teaching activities.
*Journal entries should include observation, speculation, doubt, questioning, self-awareness, problem stating, problem solving, expressing sentiments and emotions, stating ideas regarding content and direction of one's teaching.
*What did you learn today that you can apply to your teaching in the future? 
*What questions did today's lessons raise for you?
*What do you need to learn more about?
*Did you encounter anything today that was a complete surprise to you?

==Scientific and mathematical literacy==
Science and mathematics education, projects and investigations have one, common goal: to develop a scientifically and mathematically literate society. In Chapter 10 of this resource book, you are given a number of internet addresses of &quot;websites&quot; that you can
visit if you are connected to the internet. (The government is committed to providing all schools with computers in due course.) Useful websites are being created all the time and even though many more may be available by the time your school is connected,
those in Chapter 10 are a good entry point. 

The definitions given below of the characteristics of science have been adapted from &quot;Explanations of the Factors in ... Scientific Literacy&quot; which can be found at 
[[http://www.sasked.gov.sk.ca/docs/chemistry/ns_a.html/ www.sasked.gov.sk.ca/docs/chemistry/ns_a.html/]]

The website contains material from &quot;Student Evaluation: An Educator Handbook&quot; by Saskatchewan Education (1991). The authors have broken scientific literacy down into its components to help educators to assess learners' progress in science. The examples given apply as much to us in South Africa as they do to Canadian students. ''As you examine them see which component skills etc. can be developed using an investigative approach to science education.''

To be scientifically literate is to understand what science is, its &quot;nature&quot; '''[A]''' and its relationship to technology and society '''[D]'''; what science is about, the key concepts we study in science '''[B]''' and how we study them '''[C &amp; D]'''; skills that we need to develop '''[E]''' and the values and attitudes that good scientists and scientifically literate people will hold '''[F &amp; G]'''. The lists actually tell us about the content of science education. Reflect on them and how investigations can help us to achieve our science education aims. Lists A, B and C are described in detail because they are closely related to investigations.

===A. Nature of Science===
''Scientifically literate people understand the nature of science and scientific knowledge. Science experiences should expose learners to ... scientific inquiry and discovery as ... ''

'''public and private:''' Science is based on evidence developed privately by individuals or groups that is shared publicly with others.

'''holistic:''' All branches of science are interrelated. E.g. The principles of chemistry govern how an animal digests food.

'''replicable:''' Science is based on evidence that could be obtained by other people working in a different place and at a different time under similar conditions.

'''empirical:''' Scientific knowledge is based on experimentation or observation. E.g. Scientists perform experiments and gather data from the things they observe.

'''probabilistic:''' Science does not make absolute predictions or explanations. E.g. A weather forecaster predicts a 20% chance of rain tomorrow.

'''unique:''' The nature of scientific knowledge and the procedures for generating new scientific knowledge are different from those in other fields of knowledge such as philosophy.

'''tentative:''' Scientific knowledge is subject to change. It does not claim to be truth in an absolute and final sense. E.g. As new data become available, theories are modified to encompass the new and the old data. Our views since 1900 of atomic structure have
changed considerably for this reason. 

'''related to human culture:''' Scientific knowledge is a product of humankind. It involves creative imagination and is the product of a culture and its technologies. E.g. The use of biotechnology has resulted in the production of synthetic insulin for the treatment of
diabetics.

===B. Key Science Concepts===
''Scientifically literate people understand and accurately apply appropriate science concepts, principles, laws and theories as they interact with society and the environment.''

Among the most important concepts of science are:
'''change:''' Change is the process of becoming different. It may involve several stages. E.g. Seasons change throughout the year. Rocks are eroded.

'''interaction:''' This happens when two or more things influence or affect each other. E.g. Some animals living in the same place have to compete for available food and space.

'''orderliness:''' This is a regular sequence that either exists in nature or is imposed through classification. E.g. The Earth moves about the Sun in a regular manner.

'''organism:''' An organism is a living thing or something that was once alive. E.g. Plants and animals are organisms.

'''symmetry:''' This is a repetition of a pattern within some larger structure. E.g. Most animals appear to have matching halves. Most wallpaper patterns exhibit symmetry.

'''force:''' It is a push or a pull. E.g. A magnet can pick up a paper clip. Pedaling a bicycle causes it to move.

'''quantification:''' Numbers can be used to convey important information. E.g. There are 60 seconds in one minute. There are 206 bones in the human body.

'''reproducibility of results:''' Repetition of a procedure should produce the same results if all other conditions are identical.

'''cause-effect:''' It is how one thing affects another. E.g. Walking outside in the winter may cause your face to get cold.

'''predictability:''' Patterns can be identified in nature. From those patterns we make predictions. E.g. When a seed receives enough moisture in a warm place it will germinate. From this, one might predict that to keep seeds from germinating they should
be kept cool and dry.

'''conservation:''' An understanding of the finite nature of the world's resources, and an understanding of the necessity to treat those resources with prudence and economy, are underlying principles of conservation. In physics, the term `conservation' also has a
unique meaning, as in the conservation of energy. E.g. Insulating a home will save energy. Smaller, more efficient cars can be designed to use less fuel.

'''energy-matter:''' It is the interchangeable and dependent relationship between energy and matter. E.g. When a candle burns, some of the energy stored in the wax is released as heat and light.

'''cycle:''' Certain events or conditions are repeated. E.g. The seasons change during the year. Some birds migrate in the spring and autumn. A pendulum on a clock swings back and forth in a regular manner.

'''model:''' It is a representation of a real structure, event, or class of events intended to facilitate a better understanding of abstract concepts or to allow scaling to a manageable size. E.g. A globe is a model of the Earth. Marbles and styrofoam balls can be used to make models that represent atoms.

'''system:''' A set of interrelated parts forms a system. E.g. The Earth is a planet in the solar system. A stereo sound system consists of speakers, an amplifier, input devices such as a CD player, and other parts that are all connected together. field: A field is a region of space that is influenced by some agent. E.g. Two similar magnetic poles repel one another. If a ball is thrown into the air, it returns to earth because of the pull of gravity.

'''population:''' A population is a group of organisms that share common characteristics.

'''probability:''' Probability is the relative degree of certainty that can be assigned to certain events happening in a specified time interval or within a sequence of events. E.g. The probability of getting some types of cancer increases with prolonged exposure to large doses of radiation.

'''theory:''' A theory is a connected and internally consistent group of statements, equations, models, or a combination of these that serves to explain a relatively large and diverse group of things and events. E.g. One theory suggests that there are periodic mass
extinctions of species.

'''accuracy:''' Accuracy involves the recognition that there is uncertainty in measurement. It also involves the correct use of significant figures. E.g. A watch with a minute hand is more accurate for measuring time than an hourglass.

'''fundamental entities:''' They are units of structure or function that are useful in explaining certain phenomena. E.g. The cell is the basic unit of life. The atom is the basic unit of matter.

'''scale:''' Scale involves a change in dimensions. This may affect other characteristics of a system. E.g. A paper airplane made from a sheet of notebook paper may fly differently than a plane of identical design made from a poster-size sheet of the same paper. time-space: It is a mathematical framework in that it is convenient to describe objects and events. E.g. An average human being has an extension in one direction of approximately 1,75 metres and in another direction of about 70 years.

'''evolution:''' Evolution is a series of changes that can be used to explain how something got to be the way it is or what it might become in the future. It is generally regarded as going from simple to complex. E.g. Organic evolution is thought to progress in small,
incremental changes. Similarly, scientific theories undergo change to accommodate new data as they become available.

===C. Processes of Science===
''Scientifically literate people use appropriate processes of science to solve problems, make decisions and further their understanding of society and the environment.''

Integrated processes include the more basic skills. Skills are acquired and practised throughout life and information processing and problem solving abilities eventually go beyond any curriculum. The basic processes of science are:

'''classifying:''' Classifying is a systematic procedure used to impose order on collections of objects or events. E.g. Objects can be grouped in a variety of ways, such as by size, shape or colour.

'''communicating:''' Communicating is any one of several procedures for transmitting information from one person to another. E.g. Writing reports, or participating in discussions in class are examples of communicating.

'''observing and describing:''' This is the most basic process of science. The senses are used to obtain information about the environment. E.g. During an investigation a student writes a paragraph recording the progress of a chemical reaction between hot copper
metal and sulphur vapour.

'''working co-operatively:''' This involves an individual working productively as a member of a team for the benefit of the team's goals. E.g. While one member of a group is stirring a mixture of reactants in a beaker, another is reading the temperature whiles
another member of the group is writing down the temperatures. 

'''measuring:''' An instrument is used to obtain a quantitative value associated with some characteristic of an object or an event. E.g. The length of a metal bar can be determined to the nearest millimetre with an appropriate measuring device.

'''questioning:''' It is the ability to raise problems or points for investigation or discussion. E.g. A student should be able to create directed questions about observed events. When migratory birds are observed, questions such as, &quot;Why do birds flock to migrate?&quot;, &quot;Do some birds migrate singly?&quot;, and &quot;How do birds know where to go?&quot; should direct further inquiry.

'''using numbers:''' This involves counting or measuring to express ideas, observations, or relationships, often as a complement to the use of words. E.g. One orange had seven seeds in it, while another orange had no seeds.

'''hypothesizing:''' Hypothesizing is stating a tentative generalization that may be used to explain a relatively large number of events. It is subject to immediate or eventual testing by experiments. E.g. Ask students to explain what they think might happen to a plant if it is placed in a dark place for several days. Then ask them to explain how to design and conduct experiments to test their explanations.

'''inferring:''' It is explaining an observation in terms of previous experience. E.g. Because clay is a less permeable material, puddles of water do not soak away as quickly on clay soil as they do on sandy soil.

'''predicting:''' This involves determining future outcomes on the basis of previous information. E.g. Anticipate whether or not it is likely to rain later in the day based on current cloud conditions.

'''controlling variables:''' Controlling variables is based on identifying and managing the conditions that may influence a situation or event. E.g. In order to test the effect of fertilizer on plant growth, all other factors that may be important in plant growth must be identified and kept similar so that the effect of the fertilizer can be seen.

'''interpreting data:''' This important process is based on finding a pattern in a collection of data. It leads to a generalization. E.g. The grass under a carpet that is thrown on a lawn turns yellow. Removing it eventually allows the grass to turn green again. One might infer from the observations that a lack of light, or an increase in pressure on the plants, caused them to turn yellow. In a different experiment, leaves turn yellow when a plant is kept in the dark. The leaves on a similar plant kept in the light remain green. From this, one might suppose that there is a link between the amount of light a plant receives and the colour of its leaves. A piece of glass can then be placed on the lawn to see if pressure alone will cause plants to turn yellow.

'''formulating models:''' Models are used to represent an object, event, or process. E.g. The globe is a model of the Earth.
 
'''problem solving:'''  Scientific knowledge is generated by, and used for, asking questions concerning the natural world. Quantitative methods are frequently employed. E.g. A student sees a bat one evening and cannot remember ever seeing one during the day. A question arises: &quot;Why is it that I have never seen a bat before dark?&quot; This leads to a series of investigations and research in an attempt to find an answer to the question. 

'''analyzing:''' It is examining scientific ideas and concepts to determine their essence or meaning. E.g. Groups of students observe satellite weather images. Each group tries to develop a forecast based on the satellite images and their knowledge of weather patterns,
the characteristics of weather systems, the motion of weather systems, and so on.

'''designing experiments:''' Designing experiments involves planning a series of data-gathering operations that will provide a basis for testing a hypothesis or answering a question. E.g. Car manufacturers test seat belt performance in crash tests. using mathematics: When using mathematics, numeric or spatial relationships are expressed in abstract terms. E.g. The area of a rectangular surface can be found by multiplying the length by the width.

'''using time-space relationships:''' These are the two criteria used to describe the location of things or events. E.g. The position of a star on any given date can be determined from astronomical reference tables. 

'''consensus making:''' Consensus making is reaching an agreement when a diversity of opinions exist. E.g. Discussion of disposal of toxic waste, based on student research, gives students a chance to evaluate information. 

===D. Science-Technology-Society-Environment Interrelationships===
''Scientifically literate people understand and appreciate the joint enterprises of science and technology, their interrelationships and their impacts on society and the environment including issues such as:''

*scientists and technologists are human and fallible;

*attitudes to the contributions of others.


==Mathematical Literacy==
Material from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is equally useful from a mathematical point of view. It does not analyze the components of mathematical literacy in as much detail as the Saskatchewan group analyzes scientific literacy. PISA starts with the assumption that in order to assess learner achievement of certain outcomes, you must have clear definitions. The PISA definitions, developed between 2000 and 2003, provide us with international standards of mathematical literacy, scientific literacy and cross-curricular problem solving, all of which are Critical Outcomes of the new South African curriculum. Compare the PISA view of scientific literacy with that of Saskatchewan Education. The websites containing the PISA 2003 definitions are:

[[http://www.erc.ie/pisa/maths.html/ www.erc.ie/pisa/maths.html/]]

[[http://www.erc.ie/pisa/science.html/ www.erc.ie/pisa/science.html/]]

[[http://www.erc.ie/pisa/probsolve.html/ www.erc.ie/pisa/probsolve.html/]]

The PISA definitions are useful yardsticks against which to assess both one's teaching and the learners' progress.
According to PISA, mathematical literacy entails &quot;the use of mathematical competencies at several levels, ranging from performance of standard mathematical operations to mathematical thinking and insight. It also requires the knowledge and application of a range of mathematical content that is drawn from areas such as chance, change and growth, space and shape, quantitative reasoning, uncertainty and dependency relationships. These include specific areas of the mathematics curriculum, such as algebra, statistics
and geometry.&quot;

PISA assesses mathematical literacy in three dimensions: What is the relevance of this compared with the revised national curriculum statements on assessment? 

1. First, the '''content''' of mathematics, as defined mainly in terms of broad, overarching concepts underlying mathematical thinking, and only secondarily in relation to traditional curricular strands (such as algebra and geometry). ... The four overarching ideas are: '''Quantity, Space and Shape, Change and Relationships, and Uncertainty.'''

2. Second, the '''process''' of mathematics as defined by general mathematical competencies. These include the use of mathematical language, modeling and problem-solving skills. The idea is not ... to separate out such skills ... rather, questions are organised in terms of three '''clusters''' defining the type of thinking skill needed:
a) '''The Reproduction Cluster''' - is mathematical competencies consisting of simple computations.

b) '''The Connections Cluster''' - requires connections to be made to solve straightforward problems.

c) '''The Reflection Cluster''' - consists of mathematical thinking, generalisation and insight, and requires students to engage in analysis, to identify the mathematical elements in a situation and to pose questions and reflect on problems.

3. Third, the '''situations''' in which mathematics is used, ranging from '''private''' contexts to those relating to wider '''scientific''' and '''public''' issues. An important reason for distinguishing between different mathematical contexts is to embed mathematical problems in real-life contexts that are broader and less abstract than those found in traditional school curricula. According to PISA, scientific literacy involves the use of key scientific concepts to understand and make decisions about the natural world. It also involves being able to recognize scientific questions, use evidence, draw scientific conclusions and communicate these conclusions. (Compare this with the Saskatchewan facets of scientific literacy.) PISA suggests using scientific concepts relevant to the students' world both now and in the near future. These include concepts related to science in life and health, earth and the environment and in technology.

PISA defines '''scientific literacy''' as
''&quot;the capacity to use scientific knowledge, to identify questions and to draw evidence-based conclusions, in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity.&quot;''

PISA suggests assessing scientific literacy in three dimensions:

1. First, '''scientific concepts''', which are needed to understand certain phenomena of the natural world and the changes made to it through human activity. ... concepts ... are the familiar ones relating to physics, chemistry, biological sciences and earth and space sciences (but) they need to be applied to real-life scientific problems rather than just recalled. The main content of the assessment is selected from within three broad areas of application: science in '''life and health'''; science in '''earth and environment''' and science in '''technology'''.

2. Second, scientific processes, which are centred on the ability to acquire, interpret and act upon evidence. Five such processes ... relate to: 
*the recognition of scientific questions
*the identification of evidence
*the drawing of conclusions
*the communication of these conclusions
*the demonstration of understanding of scientific concepts

 [(Only) ... the last of these ... requires a pre-set body of science knowledge. ... since
 no scientific process can be content-free, the PISA science questions will always
 require understanding of key scientific concepts.]
 
3. Third, '''scientific situations''', selected mainly from people's everyday lives rather than from the practice of science in a school classroom or laboratory, or the work of professional scientists ... . 

===Cross-Curricular Problem-Solving===
&quot;Problem-solving is an educational objective that is common across countries and school subjects, particularly science, mathematics and technology. Students' ability to solve problems in everyday situations is ... of particular interest to educators ... . Problem-solving is a competency essential to successful participation in society and an integral part of the learning process.&quot;

PISA defines problem-solving as

''&quot;an individual's ability to use cognitive processes to confront and resolve real, cross-disciplinary situations where the solution path is not immediately obvious and where the literacy domains or curricular areas that might be applicable are not within a single domain of mathematics, science and reading.&quot;''

PISA assesses problem-solving in three dimensions:
1. Three broad '''Problem Types''':

a) '''Decision Making''', which requires the student to make a decision under certain constraints, and taking a number of features of the situation presented into consideration.

b) '''System Analysis''' and Design is concerned with either the analysis of a complex situation in order to find out what is the cause of the problem to be solved, or the design of a system that works and achieves certain goals 

c) '''Troubleshooting''' problems require students to diagnose a faulty or underperforming system or mechanism, and to suggest solutions.

2. '''Problem Solving Processes'''
The assessment of cross-curricular problem-solving focuses on five processes that students may implement when attempting to solve a problem. These include:

a) Understanding the information given

b) Identifying the critical features and their inter-relationships

c) Constructing or applying an external representation

d) Solving the problem

e) Evaluating, justifying and communicating the problem solution

3. '''Real-life Contexts'''
The contextual nature of problems in PISA 2003 involves the use of life skills. Rather than using contexts presented as part of the school curriculum, an attempt has been made to develop questions which simulate real-life situations.

Make three comparisons. First, compare the three PISA definitions and see how much they are interrelated. Second, compare the PISA definition of scientific literacy with the Saskatchewan lists and see how well they are matched. And third, compare your own teaching and assessment with the PISA and Saskatchewan Education aims. You will gather that the international aims of science and mathematics education are very consistent with our own here in South Africa.

Look again at the emphasis placed on &quot;real-life situations&quot; in all three PISA definitions (mathematical- and scientific literacy and problem solving). Now think of this aim in terms of investigations which involve real-life situations in learners' own lives. We hope that you will agree that '''investigations''' in science and mathematics education are both a modern and internationally respected approach to teaching these very important subjects.

==Useful &quot;Uniform Resource Locators&quot; (URLs)==
If you are fortunate enough to have a computer and access to the internet (the world-wide web or &quot;www&quot;) there are wonderful &quot;websites&quot; to visit for information. Each site has a unique URL (e.g. www.enc.org) which is actually its electronic address. Many sites are useful for science-, mathematics- and technology educators. Because so many sites exist these days we can only mention a few examples here. 

Once you start visiting websites you will find links to many other sites that you may prefer to the ones below. Develop the habit of collecting useful sites in your computer's &quot;Favourites&quot; box. The Department of National Education has a comprehensive website (&quot;Thutong&quot;) that consolidates all available curriculum information for educators. In the near future it will also contain actual materials and lesson plans or links to these. The other websites also provide links to many other educational websites. Browse through these and you will find information that you didn't even know you needed! That's the way of the web.

[http://www.thutong.org.za/ www.thutong.org.za/]

[http://www.curriculum.wcape.school.za/ www.curriculum.wcape.school.za/]

[http://www.wcsn.org.za/news.php/ www.wcsn.org.za/news.php]

[http://www.school.za/ www.school.za/]

A good place to start if you are trying to establish standards for science and mathematics education (i.e. to pinpoint the skills, competences, knowledge, attitudes, values etc. you want children at various grades, ages and stages of development to learn), is at
[http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/standards.html/ ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/standards.html]

It gives you links to literature on the whole issue of standards as well as taking you to some of the key sites for the individual subjects of interest to NASA. The site covers selected entries for science, mathematics, technology and geography. The (American) National Council of Educators of Mathematics standards site is at [http://www.enc.org/reform/journals/enc2280/nf_280dtoc1.htm/ www.enc.org]

What they have done is show how the essential concepts are built up from the simplest elements to advanced concepts. They follow certain key concepts in mathematics (which are usually applicable to other subject areas as well e.g. science and geography) such as &quot;change&quot; and show the age- and grade-related steps that one might take in developing the concept.

A most ambitious project by the American science / science education community is Project 2061, so named because that is the year in which Halley's comet next appears. The grand aim is for every American citizen to be scientifically literate by then. So [http://www.project2061.org/ www.project2061.org/] is a great website for science educators. The Project 2061 home page then leads you to their &quot;Benchmarks On-Line&quot; at [http://www.project2061.org/tools/benchol/bolframe.html www.project2061.org/tools/benchol/bolframe.html ] that sets out what is meant by scientific literacy and the steps for getting there. For a quick, pictorial summary of Project 2001, you can look at [http://www.enc.org/reform/journals/enc2299/nf_2299.htm/ www.enc.org/] 

The National Curriculum On-Line for the United Kingdom gives details of educational expectations by Key Stage and Attainment Targets for education in the UK at [http://www.nc.uk.net/ www.nc.uk.net/] Unlike most of the American work on standards the British version is not based on grade levels but rather attainment levels, regardless of age. Having said that, the levels of development one would expect for certain age ranges are given and this can be a useful guide for educators.

A review of numeracy Attainment Targets are described at [http://www.standards.dfee.gov.uk/numeracy/ www.standards.dfee.gov.uk/numeracy/] 

A useful site to begin with if you are new to technology education and still trying to fathom how it differs from technical education is the website of the International Technology Education Association (ITEA) at [http://www.iteawww.org/ www.iteawww.org/] In addition it gives their 20 standards (which define technology education for the ITEA) at [http://www.iteawww.org/TAA/Publications/STL/STLListingPage.htm/ www.iteawww.org/] 

If you want something meatier, including academic papers and discussions of the finer points of technology education, why not browse the Journal of Technology Education at [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/ scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/].

The web is literally overflowing with sites containing practical ideas for technology education and challenging material on how things work, for instance at [http://www.howstuffworks.com/ www.howstuffworks.com/]

At one time the University of Southern California was said to have the biggest computerized university library anywhere in the world. They have produced a &quot;Science Educator's Glossary&quot; which is at [http://www.usc.edu/dept/education/science-edu/A-Clist.html/ www.usc.edu/dept/education/science-edu/A-Clist.html]

Browse through the links that interest you and you may find something useful. There are also some very good commercial encyclopedias. But if you want a site that costs you no more than your service provider fee and which gives you some information on just about everything, try [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page/ wikipedia.org]

Once you start searching for sites with good teaching resources you will enter a world with more information than you can cope with. So be quite focused about your searches unless you want to get sucked in and carried away! Some of the sites are commercial,like [http://www.enchantedlearning.com/Home.html/ www.enchantedlearning.com]

Another excellent resource site (over 30,000 lesson plans here) costing $9.95 a year for membership Â­ less than R70 - is at [http://www.lessonplanet.com/ www.lessonplanet.com/]

There are excellent mathematics resources for pre-school to Grade 12 and university students (these are suitable for the high flyers in the senior school) at [http://forum.swarthmore.edu/math.topics.html/ forum.swarthmore.edu/math.topics.html/]. The beauty of the website is that it links you to a whole lot of other mathematics resources as well.

A site that is not commercial and which provides some really interesting activities in a range of learning areas is the American Public Broadcast Service site at [http://www.pbs.org/educatorsource/ www.pbs.org]

The education website of the US Geological Survey at [http://info.er.usgs.gov/education/ info.er.usgs.gov/education/] provides activity sheets and background material in geology, hydrology, biology and geography. The geographical stuff is fantastic. Even though it's all about the USA it can be adapted easily. There are activities for pre-school to Grade 12 learners. 

On a slightly whackier note you can visit Beakman at [http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Set/4567/ex.html www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Set/4567/ex.html ] to find some weird and wonderful activities and investigations that come out of a TV science show. Learners will love these.

In the end, no matter how much fun we have in the classroom, we have to assess and evaluate. Continuous assessment, rubrics etc. are new to many of us and it is interesting to see what other people are doing. Although materials from other countries may have to be adapted before South African educators can use them, good ideas and examples will always be useful. So have a look at [http://www.techtrekers.com/rubrics.html/ www.techtrekers.com/rubrics.html] and [http://www.newburyport.k12.ma.us/middle/educator.htm/ www.newburyport.k12.ma.us/middle/educator.htm]

One of the best and most useful, all round, mathematics and science education sites must be Kathy Schrock's [http://school.discovery.com/schrockguide school.discovery.com/schrockguide] Not only do we find masses of ideas, including many on assessment, but we also get mathematics and science activities (classified according to grades) and many links to other sites on the world wide web.

Finally, here's something for a bit of fun. The web is full of interesting sites like these to spice up your class with puzzles and icebreakers. [http://thinks.com/ thinks.com] Look in the &quot;Web Guides&quot; on this site and you will find more puzzles. Many of them may be too difficult for your learners. If so, just get the idea of the puzzles and make up your own! 

There are some nice mathematical puzzles at [http://www.puzzles.com/ www.puzzles.com/]

Finally there are some good icebreakers and energizers at these two websites:
[http://www.eslcafe.com/ideas/sefer.cgi?Ice:Breakers www.eslcafe.com] and [http://www.kimskorner4teachertalk.com/classmanagement/icebreakers.html www.kimskorner4teachertalk.com]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Technology Education?==

A definition of technology can be taken from any technology curriculum, but what it means to each individual is dependant on ones understanding of technology.

Below are some teachers understanding of technology:

Technology teaches communication, problem solving, finding solutions (based on informed choices), time and self management. Technology reinforces the fact that there are often many solutions to problems. 
''Ricardo Miller''

Technology is a process whereby learners identify a need or opportunity .Through the acquisition of knowledge they apply their skills. It stimulates critical thinking and creativity.  
''Averil Nolly 	''

It is about using the relevant skills, knowledge, and creativity making a contribution to address the problem in a particular situation by making use of necessary materials. It is a technique of doing something to solve a particular problem.
''Nonzali Mzizi''

Technology is about applying the knowledge and skills which was acquired to meet certain needs and wants of society. 
''Cheryl Jafta''

Engaging in a process (Investigate, design, make and evaluate) to solve human needs and wants.
''Deon Khan''

==The RNCS does not say what I must do!==
This sets the stage for a basic differentiation between a curriculum and a syllabus...

(TECHNOLOGY Revised National Curriculum Statement (RNCS))
A curriculum states in general terms concepts, skills, attitudes &amp; awareness that should be developed, whilst, a syllabus is specific about what exactly must be developed e.g. a curriculum might say  manipulative skills , while a syllabus might say cutting. 

'''The RNCS is a  curriculum  statement, not a  syllabus.''' 

In each of the learning outcomes assessment standards spells out the minimum that a learner should be able to do and know at any particular grade level. What it says are the key concepts and ideas that should be developed. These can be developed through activities that are relevant to the concept of idea. Minimum does not preclude learners functioning at levels higher that those for a specific grade. Many of the assessment standards have some text within brackets. These texts are prefaced with;  such as ,  e.g.  and some are not prefaced. Interpretation of these texts will depend largely on whether the reader analyses it linguistically, technically, or emotively. Whatever the approach, it must not detract from the core requirement of the assessment standard.

The development of technology in the RNCS through the assessment standards suggests an approach which can be summed up thus:

*FP - craft-like in the approach to projects  focus on the developing of manipulative skills 
*IP - some elements of reproduction and/or adapting of existing products focus on development of cognitive skills while further developing manipulative skills 
*SP - more innovative   no reproduction    focus on the honing of manipulative and specific skills   greater emphasis on creative and lateral thinking.

Teaching and learning in Technology must be aimed at developing Technological Literacy so that learners are empowered to cope with the challenges of a technological society. As all developments are manifested through economic, political, social and environmental context there is a need for an understanding of the interconnections between technology, society and the environment. Inherent in the development towards technological literacy is Technological Capability. In the South African technology curriculum, the development of the skills associated with problem solving lies at the heart of capability.

==What are these Learning Outcomes about?==
 
The Learning Outcomes in the Technology Learning Area are interrelated statements that state in broad terms the facets that are considered vital to develop technological literacy in learners. The three outcomes focus on the following: 

===Learning Outcome 1===
''The learner is able to apply technological processes and skills ethically and responsibly using appropriate Information and communication Technologies'' 

This outcome is a '''SKILLS''' outcome. The technological process is a way of doing something (like the scientific process skills). When a learner does technology he/she is demonstrating the ability to do the skill. But the outcome talks of  Process and Skill    this refers to the stages of the process (South African) which are: Investigate Design, Make, Evaluate and Communicate. Each of these stages has skills associated with them, viz:
*Investigate: the skills of Finding out. 
*Design: the skills of Planning / Decision making.
*Make: the skills of Making / Manufacturing. 
*Evaluate: the skills of Reflecting / Checking. 
*Communicate: the skills of Communication. 

===Learning Outcome 2=== 
''The learner is able to understand and apply relevant technological knowledge ethically and responsibly.''

This outcome is about the '''Content''' (South African) through which we do our technology. It states the Knowledge and Understanding in the areas that form the focus of our studies. These are; Structures, Processing, and Systems &amp; Control. Each of these are have information (knowledge) associated with them, but acquiring knowledge on its own is of no use unless there is an understanding of it. It is '''Very Important''' to note that the knowledge is written in as concepts. Refer to the section on [[/Key Concepts/]] to gain a better understanding of what is required in terms of these areas.

===Learning Outcome 3===
''The learner is able to demonstrate an understanding of the inter-relationships between technology, society and the environment.'' 

This outcome is about the interrelationship between '''Science &amp; Technology and Society'''. It is designed to provide opportunities to develop '''Awareness''' of and opportunities to come up with strategies to address situations. This outcome is by far the '''Most Powerful''' of the outcomes because it gives us reasons for doing Technology. This outcome can '''provide''' the context and situations / scenarios for technology modules / projects. Technology exist because of us (our needs, wants and aspirations, to fix the things we do wrong and improve on the things we do right) and Technology is for us (to make our lives easier and comfortable). It is also important to note that this outcome is '''Exactly''' the same in the '''Natural Science''' learning area.

==[[/Key Concepts/]]==
The key concepts are the results of the lead teachers analysis of all the assessment standards. It talks to the key aspects that need to be addressed in each outcome at any grade level.

==[[/Modules/]]==
Our  modules are complete units of work that contain a series of enabling activities / tasks and a challenge. 

Each of these modules is designed to provide the learner with an opportunity to apply knowledge and skills in an authentic situation.

==[[/Activities/]]==
The activities have been  designed to develop specific knowledge &amp; associated skills that form the core of the assessment standards of the various grades. These must not be considered, nor taken to be &quot;technology&quot; - They are only enabling activities designed  specifically to assist you with ideas for the development of concepts, what needs to be taught, learnt, so that learners have a chance at success when engaging in technology. The activities are not contextualised in any module as such and are not about making a product,  as our focus is on the development of concepts.

Imagine that you go to another country.  You can't speak this country's language, and so you grab a travel book with some common sentences.  Let's say you go to France, and you see that the way you ask for the hotel is &quot;S'il vous plaît, où est l'hôtel?&quot;.  Try to say it.  If you don't know how to read French, perhaps you are trying to read it as an English sentence.  That's just not good, because you might read it something like &quot;Sil vooze plate, ow ehst low-tel&quot;, which doesn't sound like the French sentence you wanted to say.

== IPA and CXS ==

To prevent such things from happening, an alphabet was invented to represent the most common sounds in all languages on Earth, called the '''International Phonetic Alphabet''', or '''IPA'''.  In order to represent each sound by a single symbol, the designers of the IPA have created a great many new letters &amp;mdash; upper- and lower-case Roman letters treated separately, modified versions of Roman letters that rotate them, flip them around, or add hooks, loops, or bars to them, Greek letters, and a few symbols that are partly or completely new.  IPA is a very valuable tool for linguists, but there's also a downside to all those special symbols.  They aren't easy to add into electronic documents &amp;mdash; there isn't a key on a standard keyboard for, say, &amp;#624; &amp;mdash; and they're hard to display, too &amp;mdash; with all those little details, they require higher resolution than ordinary text (that is, plain ASCII), and many computer programs can't display them at all.  To get around these problems, people have invented various alternatives to IPA using standard ASCII characters (though of course these alternatives sometimes need more than one character to represent a single sound).  For this book, we're going to use one such alternative designed by and for conlangers, called '''Conlang X-SAMPA''', or '''CXS''' for short.  (The ''full'' name, in case you're curious, is &quot;Conlang Extended Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet&quot;.)

Here is a chart of [[../../Appendix/CXS#Sounds|CXS sound names]].  Don't worry, you don't need to know all these sounds right now; the next section will introduce you to some of the more common English ones.  There are a few general patterns that may help make sense out of the overall arrangement of CXS.  (Don't put yourself out trying to memorize these patterns; it should be enough later that you've been exposed to them now.)  Most consonants start with a letter; if any additional symbols are needed, the additional symbols usually aren't letters, and if there is an additional letter it's preceded by an underscore, like &quot;{{CXS|p_d}}&quot; or &quot;{{CXS|B_o}}&quot;.  Most digits are used to represent vowels.  The backslash, backquote, tilde, and semicolon symbols, &quot;&amp;nbsp;{{CXS|\}}&amp;nbsp;{{CXS|`}}&amp;nbsp;{{CXS|~}}&amp;nbsp;{{CXS|;}}&amp;nbsp;&quot;, are only used as modifiers after something else to form a different sound &amp;mdash; though it will turn out that, of these, backquote tilde and semicolon modify the sound in uniform ways, while backslash usually means &quot;something similar to&quot;, and occasionally is used to make a new symbol with no relation at all to the old one.  The underscore symbol, &quot;{{CXS|_}}&quot;, is only used as a separator between other symbols within the representation of a single sound.

CXS is a handy single phonetic alphabet if you only get to learn one, and we won't expect you to learn any other phonetic alphabets for this book.  But, that said, you'll also find IPA being used routinely by conlangers in finished documents (like slide presentations, or language descriptions made to be printable on paper); so it will probably pay off for you to become somewhat familiar with IPA as well.  To help you along with that, we've set up a chart showing [[../../Appendix/CXS#Comparison between CXS and IPA|both IPA and CXS together]], for comparison.

==Distinguishing sounds from letters==

&lt;!-- Save allophonic distinction for the advanced lessons --&gt;
You may have noticed during the Beginner lesson on sounds that there was some trouble distinguishing between the sounds that we say and the words that we write. To solve this problem linguists tend to write sounds &amp;mdash; that are spoken &amp;mdash; between a pair of forward-slashes (//) and letters &amp;mdash; that are written &amp;mdash; between angle brackets (&amp;lt;&amp;gt;).

For example, the English word '''ship''' is written &amp;lt;ship&amp;gt; and pronounced /{{CXS|SIp}}/ (in CXS, or {{IPA|/ʃɪp/}} in IPA).

==Situation==
Company TLTP is inviting you to submit a design and sample for a new material to be used in the
manufacture of a variety of South African made products. The company is looking for innovative use of
basic materials and processes for a material that meets with the following:
The use of any recyclable paper (non-gloss)

The use of a suitable laminating and /or weaving technique that maximizes strength
The use of a suitable bonding agent ­ that allows for initial and/or further forming and contributes to the
strength of the material.

===Activity 1=== approx: 1 week (LO 1, 3)
Basic raw materials have for centuries been processed to produce useable materials. Some of these
materials were plant (flax, bamboo, reed), animal (hides, silk, hair) or mineral (sand, clay) in origin.
Conduct a basic research into how &quot;your forefathers&quot; ­ &quot;the San culture&quot; ­ &quot;the Egyptians&quot;, &quot;Khoi&quot;;
processed plant materials. Present your research topic under the following headings:
* The plant type that was processed (include pictures/drawings where possible)
* The actual process that was carried out on the plant
* What the final product was for the processed plant
* What do you think the need was for this product
* What effect do you think the use of this plant had on the environment

Place this research task in your portfolio under the section: Investigate.

* Assessment ­ RESEARCH*

===Activity 2 === approx: 2 weeks (LO 2, 1)
Textile is a word commonly used to describe something made from fibres.

Fibres are the basic materials (building blocks) and can be natural (wool, rubber, cotton, wood, carbon) or synthetic (nylon, polyester-made from chemicals). These can be processed in different ways: they can be twisted together to produce yarn, can be pulped and rolled to produce sheets, they can be extruded (forced through a small hole) to produce thread. Fibres can be classified as primary materials. When they have been processed they can be called secondary materials. 

[[Image:Fibres_Tech.jpg|Fibres]]&lt;br&gt;Fibres&lt;br&gt;

Secondary materials could be used in this state or could be further processed to produce fabrics.Fabrics are anything that is made by interlacing these secondary materials. There are many methods of interlacing, but this module will focus on a common method of interlacing called weaving. When we weave we use two sets of material. One is referred to as the warp and the other the weft. The
warps are usually the initial structure of the fabric. The weft, which is the filler, usually runs at right angles (90 degrees) to the warp. They do not always have to be at right angles. It is the way in which the weft is interlaced that gives a fabric its working qualities. 

''In this module we indicate warp as shaded and weft as un-shaded.''

[[Image:Warp_Weft1_Tech.jpg|Warp and Weft]]&lt;br&gt;Warp and Weft&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Warp_Weft2_Tech.jpg|Warp and Weft]]&lt;br&gt;Warp and Weft&lt;br&gt;

Study the basic weaves shown below:

[[Image:Twill_Tech.jpg|Twill]]&lt;br&gt;Twill&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Satin_Tech.jpg|Satin]]&lt;br&gt;Satin&lt;br&gt;


The strength of Fabrics is influenced by the orientation of the fibers. A unidirectional material has the fibres laid parallel to one another (like laminating), a bi-directional material is one where the fibres are at an angle to one another, and random reinforcement is where the fibers are randomly placed (felting, matting).

====Practical task 1====
Make one or more of the different types of interlacing (plain, twill, satin, diamond, random) using any one of the following: paper, thin cardboard, plastic, string, knitting wool etc.

==== Worksheet 1====
''Refer to worksheet 1 for the task''

Place this worksheet task in your portfolio under the section: Investigate. You must also put the examples of the weaving that you made in this section.

* assessment ­ PRACTICAL

===Activity 3=== approx: 1 week (LO 1, 2)
Materials technology is one of the fastest growing technologies in the world. It is because of new materials or new ways of making materials that their initial properties are improved. These new materials allow products to be better, stronger, smaller, lighter, resistant to the elements, etc. One of the ways to improve the properties is to use a bonding agent.

This activity is a practical activity in experimentation. It is a controlled experiment where certain variables are kept constant. We want to find out which bonding agent is best AND which interlacing is best. You will conduct the experiment, record the results in graph form, make your findings and finally offer an informed decision on which of the four test pieces is the strongest (in terms of bending).

Refer to worksheet 2 for the task

Recording of results - using a bar graph. An example of a bar graph is shown below.

[[Image:BarGraph_Tech.jpg|Bar Graph]]&lt;br&gt;Bar Graph &lt;br&gt; In the bar graph alongside the X axis is the constant (days of the week) ­ the Y axis is the responding variable.

Place the graph in your portfolio under the section: Investigate. ­ If it is possible place the test pieces in a
plastic sleeve or glue to a page in the portfolio as well.

===Activity 4- approx: 1 week (LO 1)===
Now that you have created your own material we are going to look at manufacturing something with it. In this module we will look at a basic concepts viz: forming (refer to the glossary for the meaning of forming)

[[Image:Container1_Tech.jpg|Container]]
[[Image:Container2_Tech.jpg|Container]]&lt;br&gt;Containers&lt;br&gt;

* First do a sketch of the shape you want to form a curve hollow, etc
* Use any interlacing technique to create a piece of material. The size is up to you
* Decide on what to use as a former or how you will do the forming
* Use your bonding agent to complete the piece.

==Technological Process (LO 1)==
Identify a need or opportunity to use the knowledge and skill that you gained in this module to design and make something within the context of the brief from Company Kalamazoo. The material must be hard, scratch resistant and waterproof.

==Educators Guide==

The focus of this module is on outcomes 1, 2 &amp; 3

The core of this module is to:
* Create an understanding of the term processing
* Create an understanding of materials
* Create an understanding of interlacing as one way to produce a material
* Create an awareness that different cultures have created materials for specific purposes
* Provide authentic (real) experiences of the creation of a material outside of mere reproduction of existing ones.
* Expose learners and educators to various aspects that make up research and how this falls within investigations
* Provide opportunities to develop technological literacy by creating an understanding and awareness of technological terminology
* Creating opportunity for learners to acquire relevant knowledge and apply this to a real situation.

This module requires that educators &quot;teach&quot; the module. ­ It also requires that learners &quot;actively do things&quot; so that learning takes place. The entire module could be completed in 4 to 5 weeks (approx 4 periods in a 5 day cycle)

The module is designed to take a logical approach by first setting the scene or context (in this case the need from the company for a material with specific properties). We want learners to see the connection to technology today and to the past and we do this by addressing outcome 3. We then address outcomes 2 &amp; 1 by finding out things by research, investigations, experiments, etc to
construct knowledge relevant to the context /situation ­ and then in line with the definition of technology we ask the learners to apply the knowledge and skills to address the situation (outcome 1). When this module is done we pick out those activities we want to assess for certain forms of assessment.

Introduce activity 1 by using anything in the classroom to begin the conversation: This could be a non threatening way to start this module is to have an oral discussion. This also draws on their prior learning.

You could ask what the tiles on the floor, the glass of the window, the desk, the roof sheet, the clothes they are wearing, the paper in the class, the ink in the pen, etc are made of. ­ All of these things made of materials that have been processed in some way.
Ask what they think the raw material was and how they thing it was processed. Notice we want their ideas on these questions and not necessarily a technical or pure scientific correct answer. When this is done tell them about their first task that will be discussed in the next period ­In the next period introduce activity 1 ­ Explain that it is a research task and that they have to go and
find out how another culture in the past created products from basic materials. They should write this up ­ It should not be longer than one page ­ discourage photocopies of books This is an assessment activity

In activity 2 we have started with knowledge ­ The idea is for you to go through this with the learners (teaching and explain as you go along) ­ For the knowledge we have supplied a worksheet which summarizes the essential things that need to be known. Later as a form of
assessment we give a test. The practical activity is to get them to make the connection between the theory and the practice ­ We suggest that paper be used so that the final task is easier to do. This is an assessment activity for two things (practical ­ the small weave that they make &amp; the test of knowledge: notice the way in which we set out the test ­ it is less theoretical)

In activity 3 we focus on an investigation in the form of an experiment ­ the idea is to get learners into the skills of performing authentic test and recording findings and then making decisions based on their findings ­ What is good about this activity is that it has a direct bearing on the final task (that is, it is not just something to do in the class, but what they find out here can and should influence their decisions on the final product). As this is the first of our modules we are giving the steps of the experiment. The idea is to make the test pieces, use the diagram as a guide to test them and recording the findings in a graph. There is a lot of learning in this activity ­ one is that they learn the value of fair testing, two they learn how to work with graphs, three they learning about conducting relevant research. Note the following: they must use many layers of the bonding agent (one or two is not going to be enough) ­ They must note exactly how many layers they apply to each side ­ All test pieces must have the same number of layers or the results will be false. 

When doing the graph the following is important:
The constants always go on the &quot;X&quot; axis ­ In our case it will be each test piece. The responding variables always go on the &quot;Y&quot; axis ­ In our case it will be the measurement of the amount of sagging with the mass pieces on it. The example in the module is of the constants on the X axis which is the days of the week (this is constant) ­ the Y axis the responding variable which shows the number of learners that were absent on particular days.

In activity 4 we introduce the concept of forming (forming is twisting, pushing, etc a material out of shape without removing any of the material, i.e. no cutting or filing, etc). The simplest way to form the interlaced material is to place it over or into a former. Formers can be things like plastic bottles, bowls, balloons, pipes, etc. ­ After the bonding agent is applied and it dries the material
will keep its shape.

For the technological process we have set out lead questions or statements to help the learners complete the task.
They can decide on any situation to address (e.g. a pencil holder, a sweet tray, a protective cover for something, a holder for something, etc) 
*They must write a design brief
*They must write 2 design specifications of the material (type of interlacing, type of bonding agent, number of layers of bonding agent, etc)
*They must write 1 product specification (shape, size, use, purpose, etc)
*The designing has two parts to it ­ one is of the material and the other is of the product ­
*Ensure that learners understand what is required ­ The module tell them exactly what is required.

Other aspects of the task are in the module.

Enjoy the module with your learners

==MECHANISMS==
===What is a mechanism?===
It is a device that has the ability to do Mechanical work. The machine will change (convert) or pass on (transmit) energy. Machines are made from a number of working parts called MECHANISMS. All mechanisms are based on what ancient philosophers called the big five machines. The five simple machines form the basis of all other machines developed throughout history. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_2.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Machines cannot do work on their own. They need energy and someone or something to operate them. Some machines are controlled by computers. (e.g. automatic washing machine). The energy, which is used by the machine, is called the INPUT. The result of this energy input is called OUTPUT.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_3.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Three major mechanisms include:
1. LEVERS - A rod that pivots around a point. 

2. GEARS - (Wheel &amp; Axle) A wheel with teeth. 

3. PULLEY - (Wheel &amp; Axle) A wheel with a groove.

===THE SIMPLEST AND ONE OF THE EARLIEST MECHANISMS USED: LEVERS===
====Understanding levers:====

A lever can therefore be described as a mechanism designed to lift loads or create (or transfer) movement. It uses a stiff rod that pivots (turns) about a point. The point is called the FULCRUM.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_4.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The following symbols, represents the different elements in a lever system.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_5.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Three classes of levers are identified, which are determined by the placement of the FULCRUM (pivot) relative to the EFFORT and the LOAD. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_6.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The load is at one end and the effort at the other, with the fulcrum situated somewhere in between. Eg. scissors

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_7.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The load is placed between the effort and the fulcrum. Eg. Wheelbarrow

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_8.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The fulcrum is at one end, the load at the other and the effort somewhere in between the two. Eg. Tweezers

Conclusion: What effect does the position of the fulcrum have on the output distance?
*...............................................................................................

Which one of the three examples is the best demonstration of distance multiplication?

*................................................................................................

Mechanisms are used to make work easier. (e.g. input motion less than the output motion). This is called a Mechanical Advantage. There are two types of Mechanical Advantage e.g. Distance Multiplication and Force Multiplication. The mechanical advantage of a lever can be calculated. The greater the mechanical advantage, the easier it is to lift an object.

The formula used to calculate mechanical advantage is: MA =load/effort

Study the following example and complete the calculations: 

'''Always convert mass into force, 50 kg x 10 m/s² = 500 N'''

An effort of 20 N is needed to lift a load of 50 kg with a wheelbarrow. What is the mechanical advantage created by the wheelbarrow?

Mechanical advantage is: MA =load/effort

===Activity 2 LINKAGES / LINKED LEVERS===
'''LINKAGE:''' A mechanism made by connecting levers together.

Linkages are designed to:
*change the direction of a force or motion,
*allow two parts to move at once,
*make objects move identical to each other

The following graphic symbols can be useful in understanding how a linkage system works.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_13.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

The following drawings indicate different combinations of levers in a linkage system:
Fill in I for input and O for output

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_14.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

* complete the practical activity on the next page.

====PRACTICAL ACTIVITY====

This activity must be done in groups. (2/3 students)

====MAKE, LOOK AND DRAW WORKSHEET.====

Use the mechanisms kits provided by your teacher and construct all the linkage systems as illustrated on the previous page. Discuss in your group the input and output direction of motion. Complete the table below.

===Introduction to PULLEYS===

A pulley is a wheel with a groove, e.g.[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_15.png]]

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_16.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

*Use your mechanisms kit to build the above examples.
*Draw exactly what you have done.
*Use a block diagram to indicate the Input and Output direction.
*Provide 2 examples of where pulleys are used in the building industry.

===Introduction to GEARS===

A gear is a wheel with teeth, e.g.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_17.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Use the mechanisms kit and build at least 3 examples of gears (you could use more than 2 gears in a gear system).
*Draw exactly what you have done.
*Use a block diagram to indicate the Input and Output directions in each of your examples.
*Provide 2 or 3 examples of gears in used in children's toys.

===PROJECT PORTFOLIO===
'''work in groups of 3'''

====SITUATION====

You are employed as an engineer at a city office block, which has boom gates on entering and leaving. You have noticed that at peak time on rainy days the security guards have to stand in the rain to lift and lower the boom gates. Use one or a combination of the 3 simple mechanical systems to lift and lower the boom gate, which can be operated from inside the security office.

*Discuss the words you do not understand.
*Circle the most important words.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Modules_18.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

1. Write in your own words what you think the problem is. Try and do it in two sentences
*...........................................................................................................
*............................................................................................................

2. Write down a design brief, a few specifications and two constraints for the problem identified in the last sentence of the paragraph.
*...........................................................................................................
*............................................................................................................
*...........................................................................................................
*............................................................................................................
*...........................................................................................................
*............................................................................................................

3. In your group, think of possible solutions that will solve the problem identified in the situation above. Draw freehand sketches of two different ideas.
*...........................................................................................................
*............................................................................................................

4. From the two solutions you identified and sketched (drew), select the one you believe to be the best solution. Give one reason for your choice.
*...........................................................................................................
*............................................................................................................

5. Produce a two-dimensional working drawing for presentation. The working drawing should include the dimensions and the kind of materials that must be used in arriving at the solution.

6. Produce a model. You will be assessed on the effectiveness of the mechanisms used in your model.

7. Prepare a formal presentation to sell your idea to the class. Your presentation should explain to the class how the mechanism that you have designed in Activity 3 works.

====HINTS====

*The product can be 2 dimensional on an A4 card.
*Divide the card in half (one half for in the booth and the other half outside)
*Corrugated cardboard is a versatile and cheap resource
*One-sided corrugated cardboard can be used for gear teeth and on racks.
*Hot melt glue guns are very effective (glues strongly and quickly)
*Paper fasteners are quick and easy to use (e.g. fixed and loose pivots)

==Types of Structures==

===GLOSSARY:===

*'''Structure:''' consists of materials which are joined together in a specific manner
*'''Frame structure:''' made up of individual pieces of material &amp;shy  it forms a framework
*'''Shell structure:''' protects things from the outside.
*'''Solid / mass structure:''' consists mainly of matter.
*'''Natural structure:''' exists in nature.
*'''Constructed structure:''' is built by people

The environment we live in consists of structures .Structures are made of materials that are suitable for a certain function.

Structures which exist in nature are known as natural structures and those built by people are known as constructed structures.

There are 3 basic types of structures:
*Shell structures: protect something.
*Frame structures: form a frame work.
*Solid / mass structures: consist mostly of matter

Structures either:
*Perform a supportive role (bear loads e.g. pillars, constructed beams, crutches, towers), span gaps (e.g. bridge), protect contents (e.g. helmet, eggshell), contain or hold things (e.g. box), provide stability (foundations) .

Sometimes structures tend to collapse or fail to do their job because of  failure of the materials: i.e. wrong material being used for a particular job, or because they have been designed incorrectly, or because they have been manufactured badly.

===Activity 1:=== -(approx.: 1 week (L.O. 2)

'''Textures''' are laid on top of materials to give them complicated colors and other effects. An object is covered with a material, which might contain several textures: An image texture of stone, a texture to make the stone look bumpy, and a texture to make the stone deform in different ways.

A texture may be an [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Image Textures|image]] or a [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Procedural Textures|computed function]]. What the texture does and how it is mapped onto your object is set in the material buttons. Some commonly used texture types are shown on the page [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Using Textures|Using Textures]].

This tutorial uses the file from the '''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Quickie Material|Quickie Material]]''' tutorial.  If you didn't do it before, go back and do it now.

==Making It Mottled ==
[[Image:Blender263BasicCloudsTexture.png|right|framed|x513px|'''Figure 1:''' A simple Clouds texture]]
The file we're working with has no texture by default. 

To '''add a texture''':
* Bring up the ''Texture'' tab [[File:Blender255TextureContextButton.png]] in the Properties window.
* The top panel shows a list of texture ''slots'' for the current material. In Blender v2.70, there should already be a texture in the first slot called &quot;Tex&quot;. If it is not present, click on the ''+ New''-button under this list. This will create a new texture, attach it to the current material in the first slot, and select it ready for adjustments to its settings.
* Select the texture type ''Clouds'' in the pop-up menu.  You can also change the texture's name, as we have done for the material.
A preview appears, as well as some parameters to experiment with. A ''Clouds'' texture provides some irregularities.
* If you check back in the Materials tab, you will see a preview of the texture applied to the material in a garish magenta colour. This is the default influence colour for a new texture; presumably it was deliberately chosen to stand out as a reminder to make you switch to settings other than the default!
{{Clear}}

== Adjusting the Influence ==
[[Image:Blender268TextureInfluenceDefault.png|right|x423px|framed|'''Figure 2:''' Default texture mapping &amp; influence settings]]
If you scroll down the Texture settings in the Properties window, you will see two further panels, titled ''Mapping'' and ''Influence''. The ''Influence'' panel controls how the material is affected by the texture. Among the ways it can do this are:
# RGB color (all images, ''Magic'', every texture with a colorband)
# Intensity, either as grey scale or/and an alpha value  (most of the procedural textures, image textures with alpha, textures with a colorband)
# Normal values (''Stucci'', normal maps), which give the material a bumpy or grainy appearance
If you want to use textures you always have to be aware of the value a texture provides and the ''Influence'' settings for the material.

If you look at the above default Influence settings, there is just one box checked, in a group titled “Diffuse:” (which means the texture influences parameters for the material’s diffuse shader). The labels next to the checkboxes will probably not be visible in the default window width; if you widen the window, you should see the word “Color:” appear in the value slider. Alternatively, hover the mouse over either the checkbox or the slider, and you will see tooltips that mention “diffuse color”.

A ''Clouds'' texture provides a monochrome intensity value, ranging from 0 (where the texture is black) to 1 (where the texture is white). If you click on the colour swatch at the bottom of the Influence panel, you can alter the colour that is applied to the texture intensity value.

* Set the influence colour to black. 

Procedural textures are not shown in the 3D window (only if you would use excessive amounts of vertices), even if you use GLSL materials. This means that we have to render the image to see the texture properly.

* Render the image ('''F12'''), or use the preview to judge the result of the texture.
[[Image:CloudTexturePreview.png]]

Next we will add a ''Stucci'' texture to make our clouds look bumpy.

==Making It Wrinkly (Bump Map)==
[[File:CloudsPlusStucciBumpExample.png|right]]
* In the Texture panel in the Properties window, click on the second (empty) slot in the list of textures at the top. All the settings for the texture you previously created should disappear. (But of course they haven’t really gone, as you can confirm by reselecting the texture in the first slot.)
* Add a new texture here and set the type to ''Stucci''.  
* In the ''Influence'' panel, uncheck the Diffuse Color influence and, in the group titled “Geometry”, check the first box (titled “Norm”). This means it affects the rendered normal, i.e. the angle the renderer treats the surface as - creating fake shadows on the surface.
* Play with the ''Norm'' slider, but leave it on about 4. 

''Newbie help: I was unable to get this to work by following the instructions. It turned out that I had to switch from &quot;UV&quot; to &quot;Generated&quot; under &quot;Mapping&quot;.
''

The ''normal'' in physics and geometry is a vector perpendicular (“normal”) to a surface. It is used to calculate the effect of lighting. In computer graphics, we find we can achieve all kinds of interesting effects by having the normal point in some other direction than actually normal to the surface. As, in this example, by perturbing it from one pixel to the next according to the value of a texture function, we can give the impression of a more complex geometry than a simple smooth surface, ''without actually generating such a geometry''. In other words, like many things in 3D graphics, this is a lie and a cheat, and you can tell because the outline border of the object is still smooth—the bumps only appear on the visible parts within the silhouette.

Such a use of a texture to fiddle the surface normal is called a “bump” map or “normal” map. If it were used to actually generate new geometry, then it is called a “displacement” map—of course, this becomes much more computationally expensive. Since bump mapping is fake 3D, it doesn’t necessarily look good under every circumstance, you will get a greater effect on smoothly curved surfaces with high specularity, only a little or no effect on flat surfaces with low specularity.

Linux 32 bit is a supported platform up to SPM8. You might have to recompile SPM MEX files (*.mexglx) if those provided with the SPM distribution do not appear to be compatible with your system. The [[SPM/Installation_on_64bit_Linux#Troubleshooting | Troubleshooting]] section of the Linux 64 bit installation page might also contain some useful information.

== SPM12 ==

SPM12 is not officially supported on Linux 32 bit, as this platform is about to be phased out (see [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html MATLAB Platform Roadmap]). This means that precompiled MEX files (*.mexglx) are not included in the SPM distribution.

== SPM8 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm8.zip] and its updates [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8_updates/ spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
unzip spm8.zip
unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /home/login/spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM8 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm8/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
make toolbox-distclean
make toolbox &amp;&amp; make toolbox-install
make external-distclean
make external &amp;&amp; make external-install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM5 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] and its updated MEX files [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm5_updates/SPM5_Matlab7.1_LINUX32_MEX.zip SPM5_Matlab7.1_LINUX32_MEX.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
unzip spm5.zip
unzip -o SPM5_Matlab7.1_LINUX32_MEX.zip -d spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /home/login/spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM5 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm5/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM2 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm2.tar.gz] and its updated MEX files [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm2_updates/SPM2_LINUX32_MEX.tar.gz SPM2_LINUX32_MEX.tar.gz] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
tar xvfz spm2.tar.gz
tar xvfz SPM2_LINUX32_MEX.tar.gz -C spm2
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm2
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm2
make Linux
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Equal or not equal==

In gambas the = sign is used differently than it is in mathematics.
It is used to assign a value to a variable. 

When the equal sign shows up in the code, you should always think of it as:
*''It is assigned''
*''A place in computer memory is reserved for the variable''
*''Fill the memory with this value''

Then you will not run into illogical conclusions.

The following code is correct in Gambas. Try it out . What is the result?
 
 a = 5
 a = a * 4

Translated to natural language this says:

 Assign 5 to the variable a 
 Multiply 4 with the old variable a and assign it to the new variable a.

Maybe the first person who started assignment in computers came from Arabia. Perhaps this is why we have to read the line from the right to left. 

By the way: the result is 20. 

How does this work in a little program:
You need one command button to get the program going. The result is shown in the terminal window.
 
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM a AS Integer
 a = 5
 a = a * 4
 PRINT &quot;a = &quot;;a
 END

A math teacher would not like these equations, but in gambas (or in basic in general) it is correct.
Of course, you could make things clearer by using two different variables.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM a AS Integer
 DIM b AS integer 
 a = 5
 b = a * 4
 PRINT b
 END

The line 

  DIM a AS Integer

is not an assignment. It is a declaration of a variable as a datatype. In this case a is of the datatype ''integer''. 

As you can see in the second example, the word '''DIM''' can be skipped without an error warning.

==Theory of the assignment==

The following code shows you in general the method of assignment:

 Variable = Expression 

Assigns the value of an expression to one of the following elements. : 
*A local variable. 
*A function parameter. 
*A global (class) variable. 
*An array slot. 
*An object public variable. 
*An object property. 

Example 

 iVal = 1972
 Name = &quot;Gambas&quot;
 hObject.Property = iVal
 cCollection[sKey] = Name

*[[../Combination|Combination Assignment Operators]]

==List==
The gambas toolbox contains all the controls you can drop on a Gambas form. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gambas_toolbox3.png 

In the beginning you should get used to some of the tools. 
*Try the textbox and textarea. 
*Try the commandbutton. 
*Try the drawingArea 
*Try the timer. 
They are important and the other ones are a lot easier, when you have learned to use these few in the beginning. 

*Label 
*Image 
*TextLabel 
*ProgressBar 
*Button 
*CheckBox 
*RadioButton 
*ToggleButton 
*TextBox 
*ComboBox 
*TextArea 
*ListBox 
*ListView 
*TreeView 
*IconView 
*GridView 
*ColumnView 
*Frame 
*Panel 
*TabStrip 
*ScrollView 
*DrawingArea 
*Timer 
*GambasEditor 
*LCDNumber 
*Dial 
*SpinBox 
*ScrollBar 
*Slider 
*TableView 
*Splitter 
*Workspace 

The first one in the row, the Selection Tool , is rather useless. It isn't actually a control. The selection tool simply gives you the plain pointer back, with which you can select and operate on forms and their controls.

==Hotkeys==

If you want to use some hotkeys for a project, you might code something like this:
 
 Public sub Form_KeyPress ()
  If key.code = ... then
  Something happens

Unfortunately this only works, if the form has no buttons and other controls. If the form has other controls and  one of the controls has the focus, then it does not work.

There is no interface in the QT component to globally intercept key events yet, but there is a trick:
 
If you have a menu in your form, its keyboard shortcuts are globally managed. So you can add an hidden menu to your form to solve your problem.

==KDE panel applet ?==
Is it possible to write a KDE panel applet with Gambas?  
 
No, currently it is not possible to do that.  KDE panel applets are implemented as shared libraries with specific 
interfaces.

==Listview==

How can I add a listview item after an existing one, when there is an item missing:

Wrong: Listview.add(&quot;Key&quot;,&quot;Name&quot;,,&quot;Key2&quot;) -- Error: Comma missing.

You have to pass NULL as picture argument. You cannot &quot;jump&quot; arguments when 
you call a function in Gambas.

Listview.add(&quot;Key&quot;,&quot;Name&quot;,NULL,&quot;Key2&quot;)


[[Category:Gambas]]

== Variables ==

==== Does gambas support structured data types? ====

In some versions of basic, it is possible to create structured data types using by using type definitions as follows:

 ' This will not work in gambas
 TYPE rhubarbstructure
   foo AS STRING * 32
   bar AS INTEGER
 END TYPE

 PUBLIC rhubarb AS rhubarbstructure

Currently, [[Gambas]] does not support the TYPE keyword. However, it is possible to [[Gambas/Variable#Creating_a_class|use class definitions]] for the same effect.

== Project Building ==

==== Does gambas support include files? ====

==== Does gambas support conditional compilation directives? ====

== Application Startup ==

=== Making the application startup from a main routine ===

In gambas, to make an application startup from a main routine:

* Create a new module called MMain

* In the MMain module, create a public sub called Main as follows:

 PUBLIC SUB Main()
   ' This is the start of the program
 END

* Right click the MMain module, then select Startup class from the context menu

=== Obtaining the command line parameters ===

 PUBLIC SUB main()
   ' This reads and displays the command line parameters
   DIM l AS Integer
   DIM numparms AS Integer
   DIM parm AS String
   numparms = Application.Args.Count
   FOR l = 0 TO numparms - 1
     parm = Application.Args[l]
     PRINT l; &quot; : &quot;; parm
   NEXT 
 END SUB

== Window Geometry ==

=== Determining the maximum window size ===

==== Overview ====

In gambas, the trick to determining the maximum window size that will fit on the screen is to create a form that is maximized and then query its dimensions from within a Form_Resize() event. Note that the form can be invisible during this process, and typically we would use the main modal window (FMain in this example).

==== Creating the form ====

From with the project create a form (FMain) with the following properties set:

 FMain.Maximized = True
 FMain.Visible = False    ' The form can be invisible

From within the project view, rightclick the FMain form and select Edit class from the contextmenu. This will display a form class file (FMain.class) as follows:

 PUBLIC SUB _new()

 END

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()

 END

We can now add a Form_Resize() event to the class file with the necessary code to obtain the screen dimensions as follows:

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Resize()
   PRINT &quot;The maximum window size that can be used is &quot;; FMain.Width; &quot; x &quot;; FMain.Height
 END</text>

'''Shortcuts''' are available for quick access to a page.  For example, if the shortcut for [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] is &quot;[[WB:RFD]]&quot;, you can access the page by typing &quot;WB:RFD&quot; in the search box from any page and pressing &quot;Go&quot; (or enter on your keyboard).  The URL [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/WB:RFD http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/WB:RFD] also works.

== About shortcuts ==
We have shortcuts for the following pages:
# Shortcuts to pages in the Wikibooks namespace. These shortcuts always start with &quot;WB:&quot;.
# Shortcuts to [[WJ|Wikijunior]] pages.  These shortcuts always start with &quot;WJ:&quot;.
# Shortcuts to pages in the [[COOK|Cookbook]] namespace.  These shortcuts always start with &quot;COOK:&quot;.
# Shortcuts to [[SUB|subject]] pages.  These shortcuts always start with &quot;SUB:&quot;.
# Shortcuts to [[CAT|categories]].  These shortcuts always start with &quot;CAT:&quot;. Be careful about using category redirects. They work as expected as links, but not if you try to use them as a way to categorize pages.

== Vowels-Ómatehtar ==
It is well known that the vowels were originally displayed as diacritics. In Rúmilian writing these have been attested, and it is shown how they modify the letter ''t''. The sounds ''æ'' and weak ''&amp;#601;'' were probably employed only in English.
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| T
| T
| T
| T
| T
| T
| T
| T&amp;#601;
|-
| ta
| te
| ti
| to
| tó
| tu
| tæ
| t&amp;#601;
|}

Note that if the signs were placed on the left of the letter, they would be pronounced ''at'', ''et'' etc.

Concerning the Modes using tengwar, the vowels were displayed with signs that are identical to all of the attested systems (with minor varieties). We can think that they were identical to the first ones that Fëanor made. The attested Quenya tehtar are shown here over the letter Tinco, and how they would be read in Quenya:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1E&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1R&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1T&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1Y&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1U&lt;/em&gt;
|-
| ta
| te/ti
| ti/te
| to
| tu
|}

And Sindarin:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1E&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1R&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1T&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1Y&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1U&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;1Ö&lt;/em&gt;
|-
| at
| et/it
| it/et
| ot
| ut
| yt
|}

Sindarin had the ancient umlaut ''œ'' that later became ''e'' (as in ''Arnœdiad''), but it is attested nowhere. Long vowels were placed on long carriers, but the signs for ''o'', ''u'' and ''e'' could also be doubled. In Quenya, the sign of ''a'' could be simplified as a circumflex or even ommited, as it was a very frequent sound. Tolkien says in some modes, the signs for ''e'' and ''i'' swapped values, which is seen in the '''Ring Inscription''', but it's not clear if this swapping occurred in Elvish modes. This was also the case with the signs for ''o'' and ''u'' in the '''Ring Inscription''', because in Orcish, the sound ''o'' was rare.

We don't know how dipthongs were written in Sarati and Valinorean Tengwar, but in later Quenya they are written in a peculiar way: The tehta is placed over the following element. Some of them are attested in Namárie, the others formed by analogy. The six diphthongs of Quenya are:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lE&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.E&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lY&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lJ&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.F&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.G&lt;/em&gt;
|-
| ai
| au

| eu

And of Sindarin (tehta mode):
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hE&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;yE&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hJ&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hF&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lE&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lY&lt;/em&gt;
|-
| ai
| au
| ui
| ei
| ae
| oe
|}

And both full modes:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;]Ö&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;]é&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;.Ö&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;lÖ&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;]l&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;]â&lt;/em&gt;
| &lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hl&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em style=&quot;font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Elfica'&quot;&gt;hâ&lt;/em&gt;
|-
| ai
| au
| ui
| ei
| ae
| oe
|}

''Au'' and ''oe'' have been attested nowhere and are guessed. ''Oe'' shouldn't be confused with the ancient umlaut ''œ''. ''Au'' is written -''aw'' finally (as in ''baw'', ''lhaw'') by Tolkien. Final -''w'' in other combinations like ''têw, aew, lhiw'' is a semivowel and doesn't form a diphthong.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Mongol Conquest&lt;/big&gt;:'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Europe lived through its High Middle Ages, the largest empire the world had yet seen emerged in Asia. In the early 1200's, a chief called Chingis Khan (formerly spelled &quot;Ghengis,&quot; from the Persian) unified the Mongols with other nomadic steppe tribes. The unified Mongols were called the Golden Horde. Chingis (meaning &quot;oceanic;&quot; before his coronation his name was Temujin) had numerous skillfull generals, the most noted of them being Subutei Bagatur and Jebe Bagatur (no relation, Bagatur in Mongolian simply means 'brave'. The names of all Mongol generals and leaders have multiple spellings).

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Russian Conquest&lt;/big&gt;:'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the year 1240, the Mongols invaded the Slavic people of Russia. The Mongols imposed taxes on the kings but let the kings rule. In the year 1480, Ivan the Great ended Mongolian dominance after the Standoff on the Ugra river.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Asian Conquest&lt;/big&gt;:'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By 1260, the armies of Mongol Empire had swept with overwhelming force out of the Asian steppes, utterly destroyed ancient and powerful kingdoms in the Middle East, and reached as far west as Egypt and Poland before halting their advance. During the same period, Mongol assaults on China wore down the Sung dynasty and let them establish the Da Yuan (&quot;Great Beginning&quot;) dynasty. The Mongols' military tactics, based on the swift and ferocious use of mounted cavalry, crushed even the strongest European and Islamic forces that took the field against them. They also learned primitive cannon and firearm technologies and brought them to the West.

&lt;big&gt;'''&lt;big&gt;Aftermath of the Conquest&lt;/big&gt;:'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Mongol Empire would become the largest empire at its peak, stretching from China as far as Russia. Mongol rule in these areas integrated them from the rest of the world, and stimulated trade between Europe and Asia. This would have profound effects that would continue many centuries after the disintegration of the empire (which was caused by the need for different styles or government in different areas, and war between Chingis' successors), including stimulating Europeans to explore the world looking for Asia's riches.

In 1917, the Russian Empire was losing a war against both Germany and Austria-Hungary. The population was starting to resent the Czar/Tsar, and wanted a different leader so the war would end. Vladimir Lenin, returning from exile in Switzerland, led the Communist Party of Russia to power in the October Revolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">CSS can be applied to HTML or XHTML using three methods: linked, embedded, and inline. In the linked method, the CSS is stored in a separate file, instead of directly in the HTML page. In the embedded method, CSS is stored as part of the HTML page, in the header section. In the inline method, CSS is stored directly in the ''style'' attributes of the HTML tags, as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bold Font&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

The neatest method is probably the linked one, but the other ones are convenient and quick in the phases of prototyping a web page. The embedded and inline methods do not require having a separate file. The inline method saves you the trouble of considering what CSS classes your document should have. For a larger site, in which many web pages share the same styling, and in which the styling should be customizable by the user, the linked method is the only viable option.

The methods are treated in detail in the following sections.

==Linking==

With linked CSS, CSS rules are stored in a separate file. To refer to that file from the HTML page, add the &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; element (and its closing element within XHTML) to the &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; element, as shown in the following example, which assumes that the stylesheet is stored in the file named &quot;style.css&quot;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; element in the example has three attributes. The first, &lt;code&gt;rel&lt;/code&gt;, tells the browser the type of the target of the link. The second, &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, tells the browser what type of stylesheet it is. And the third, &lt;code&gt;href&lt;/code&gt;, tells the browser under which URL to find the stylesheet. In the example, the URL is relative, but it can also be absolute.

The &quot;style.css&quot; with a single rule contains only the following text:
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
 p {
   font-weight:bold;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

This tells the browser that the text in the paragraph (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;) element should be rendered as bold.

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Text that will be formatted.&lt;/p&gt;}}

The source code for the complete HTML document is thus as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Text that will be formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Embedding==

Dynamically generated webpages may need to use embedded CSS, but this should be kept to a minimum. Even in dynamic pages, any CSS that is common to multiple pages should generally be moved to a linked stylesheet.

Embedded CSS is CSS that is located in the header of the HTML document that requires styling. For example we would like the text in this HTML document to appear bold.
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
 &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Text that will be formatted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The CSS may be placed in the document's header section:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
    p {
     font-weight:bold;
    }
   &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The CSS is contained in a &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; element. Setting the element's &lt;code&gt;type&lt;code&gt; attribute to &lt;code&gt;text/css&lt;/code&gt; tells the browser that the  enclosed sheetstyle is written in CSS and should be used to format the page. If the attribute &lt;code&gt;type&lt;code&gt; is missing or set to an unrecognized value, the CSS will not be applied to the page.

The bit of CSS in this example tells the browser to make all the text found in any paragraph (&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;) elements bold. The text on the page would look like this:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot; title=&quot;This text is bold&quot;&gt;Text that will be formatted.&lt;/p&gt;}}

Here is the complete document including the CSS.

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Example Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
    p {
     font-weight:bold;
     color:green;
    }
   &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
    Text that will be formatted.
   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember, you should use [[#Linking|linked]] stylesheets in preference to embedded stylesheets whenever possible. That will allow easy replacement of the general style information without having to keep track of styles within the various HTML files.

==Inlining==

Inline CSS is specified directly in the opening tag of the element you want it to apply to. It is entered into the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute within HTML or XHTML 1.1.

For example

&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot;&gt;Bold Font&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

is rendered as:

{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold; color: red;&quot;&gt;Bold Font&lt;/div&gt;}}

As mentioned, you should in general prefer linked CSS to embedded CSS, and both are preferred over inline CSS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In CSS, a '''selector''' is the part of a rule that comes before the first &quot;{&quot;, such as &quot;p&quot; in the rule &quot;&lt;code&gt; p { font-weight:bold; } &lt;/code&gt;&quot;. A selector specifies to which elements a rule should apply, by naming the type of the element, such as &quot;div&quot;, the class of the element, or the id of the element. Selectors can only be used in linked and embedded CSS, not in inlined one.

The following table provides an overview of selectors. The sections that follow discuss each type of selector in detail.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Overview of selectors
! Type of Selector
! Example Selector
! Example Rule
|-
| type
| div
| div { margin:7px; padding:7px; }
|-
| class
| .important
| .important { font-weight:bold; color:red; }
|-
| id
| #onlyThisOne
| #onlyThisOne { font-family:courier; }
|-
| universal
| *
| * { color:green; }
|-
| pseudo-class
| a:link
| a:link { color:blue; }
|-
| pseudo-element
| p:first-letter
| p:first-letter { color:red }
|-
| descendant
| td span
| td span { font-weight:bold; }
|-
| grouped
| h1, h2, h3
| h1, h2, h3 {  text-align:center; }
|}

==Type==
These selectors match elements based on the name of their element type. The example above is using a type selector to make every instance of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; have bold text. You can use the type selector with any element. Here are a few examples:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 div{
   margin:7px;
   padding:7px;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 body{
   background-image:url(&quot;image.gif&quot;);
   font-size:.9em;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Class==
&lt;strong&gt;The class selector works with (X)HTML documents. It does not work with general XML documents unless the User Agent (web browser or other document reader) can determine which attribute is the class attribute for elements in the document. In (X)HTML documents &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; is defined to be the class attribute.&lt;/strong&gt;

HTML permits the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; attribute for all elements that are valid in the body section of an HTML document, including the &lt;code&gt;body&lt;/code&gt; element itself. This allows the web designer to distinguish between elements of the same type used in different contexts. For example, the designer could differentiate between HTML elements and HTML attributes in a technical document on HTML.
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 The &lt;code class=&quot;attribute&quot;&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code class=&quot;element&quot;&gt;img&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The class selector allows you to apply CSS rules based on the class of an element.

The first way is to make a global class, which can be added to any element. You do that like this:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 .important {
   font-weight:bold; color:red;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
That will make any element that has the class of '''important''' be bold and red. 

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Important Text&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Ordinary Text&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Important Footnote&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;Important Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold; color:red;&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;Important Footnote&lt;/div&gt;
}}
The second way is to attach it to a type selector. The rule is only applied to elements of the given type which are of the specified class.

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 p.right {
   float:right;
   clear:both
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Righty Righty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering (look right):
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;Righty Righty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
}}

An element may belong to more than one class, e.g.
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'right'.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'important'.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p class=&quot;right important&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to both classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;float:right;&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'right'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold;color:red;&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'important'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;float:right;font-weight:bold;color:red;&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to both classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
}}

Class names should describe the purpose of the class, e.g. important, not the effect of the class, e.g. red. If you name classes by effect and then change your mind about the appearance you want you can end up with rules like:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 .red {color:blue}
&lt;/source&gt;

If necessary multiple class selectors can be used to select only elements that belong to all the specified classes, e.g.
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
p.important.right {
  border: 2px dashed #666
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;float:right;&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'right'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold;color:red;&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'important'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;float:right;font-weight:bold;color:red;border: 2px dashed #666&quot; title=&quot;This text is red and bordered.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to both classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
}}

=== Internet Explorer 6 bug ===
Multiple class selectors as shown in the previous example do not work in Internet Explorer version 6. It treats the selector as though only the last class selector was present, e.g. &lt;code&gt;p.important.right&lt;/code&gt; is treated as equivalent to &lt;code&gt;p.right&lt;/code&gt;.

Previous example rendered in Internet Explorer 6:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;float:right;border: 2px dashed #666&quot; title=&quot;This text is bordered.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'right'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:bold;color:red;&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'important'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;float:right;font-weight:bold;color:red;border: 2px dashed #666&quot; title=&quot;This text is red and bordered.&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to both classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
}}

The complete HTML document and CSS stylesheet to test this bug are given below.

classBug.css:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
.important {
  font-weight:bold; color:red;
}

p.right {
  float:right;
  clear:both
}

p.important.right {
  border: 2px dashed #666
}
&lt;/source&gt;

classBug.htm:
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;IE6 multiple class bug&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;classBug.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'right'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to the class 'important'.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=&quot;right important&quot;&gt;This paragraph belongs to both classes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==ID==
&lt;strong&gt;The ID selector works with (X)HTML documents. It does not work with general XML documents unless the User Agent (web browser or other document reader) can determine which attribute is the ID attribute for elements in the document. In (X)HTML documents &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is defined to be the ID attribute.&lt;/strong&gt;

The ID selector is used to select a single item on a page. It matches the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute of an element. Two elements on the same page must not have the same &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

However, several different webpages within the same site might reuse an &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;. It is commonly used for the major divisions of a page, e.g. mainContent, navigationBar. It is often used in conjunction with descendant selectors, e.g. to style all list items in the navigation bar whilst not affecting lists in the main content.

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 #onlyThisOne {
   font-family:courier;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p id=&quot;onlyThisOne&quot;&gt;Courier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p style=&quot;font-family:courier;&quot;&gt;Courier&lt;/p&gt;}}

==Universal==
These selectors apply a style to all the items on the page. For example to make all the text on the page green use the rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 * {
   color:green;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Pseudo-Classes==
Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow elements to be formatted on the basis of information other than the position of the element in the document tree. Pseudo-class and pseudo-element selectors are prefixed by a colon, &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, in CSS1 and CSS2.1. In CSS3 pseudo-elements are prefixed by &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;.

CSS level 1 defines three pseudo-classes:
;&lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; : unvisited links
;&lt;code&gt;visited&lt;/code&gt; : visited links
;&lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; : active links
These can only be applied to the anchor (&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;) elements.
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 a:link{
   color:blue;
 }

 a:visited{
   color:purple;
 }

 a:active{
   color:red;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

CSS level 2.1 introduces several additional pseudo-classes, including &lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; can be used to create rollover effects without resorting to Javascript.
CSS2.1 also allows &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; to apply to any element that can be active, e.g. a button.

The additional CSS 2.1 pseudo-classes are:
;&lt;code&gt;first-child&lt;/code&gt; : matches any element that is the first child of its parent.
;&lt;code&gt;lang(...)&lt;/code&gt; : matches the language of the element. The language may be set directly on the element or inherited from an ancestor element. A valid language code must appear in the parentheses, e.g. &lt;code&gt;en&lt;/code&gt; for any variant of English or &lt;code&gt;en-gb&lt;/code&gt; for British English.
;&lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; : applies whilst the user hovers over the element with the mouse.
;&lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt; : now allowed on any element capable of being 'active' &amp;#8211; applies whilst the element is active.
;&lt;code&gt;focus&lt;/code&gt; : applies whilst the element has the keyboard focus.

Although CSS2.1 allows &lt;code&gt;hover&lt;/code&gt; on any element Internet Explorer only allows it on anchor elements.

Examples:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
  p:first-child {
    font-size:120%
  }

  span:lang(la) { /* render Latin text, e.g. per se, in italics */
    font-style:italic
  }

  li:hover { /* doesn't work in Internet Explorer */
    background-color:blue
  }

  input:active {
    color:red
  }

  input:focus {
    background-color:yellow
  }
&lt;/source&gt;
An example of the &lt;code&gt;first-child&lt;/code&gt; pseudo-class is given at the end of the [[#Descendant|descendant]] selector section.

Multiple pseudo-classes may be specified, e.g. to warn the user that they are hovering over a link they have already visited:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
a:visited:hover {
  background-color:red
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Care should be taken over the order of rules using pseudo-classes. For example, if you want visited links to be green except whilst the user hovers over them, when they should be yellow, the rules must be in the following order:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 a:visited{
   color:green
 }

 a:hover{
   color:yellow
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

If the rules were reversed the [[CSS Programming/Important|cascade]] would mean that the visited color would take precedence over the hover color. Visited links would remain green even when the user hovered over them.

==Pseudo-Elements==
Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow elements to be formatted on the basis of information other than the position of the element in the document tree. Pseudo-class and pseudo-element selectors are prefixed by a colon, &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;, in CSS1 and CSS2.1. In CSS3 pseudo-elements are prefixed by &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt;.

CSS level 1 defines two pseudo-elements, &lt;code&gt;first-letter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;first-line&lt;/code&gt;, which select the first letter and line of the rendered element respectively.
These can be used to apply typographic effects, e.g. to create a drop cap at the start of a paragraph.
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 p:first-letter { color:red } 
&lt;/source&gt;

Only one pseudo-element selector may be used and it must be the last part of the selector chain. The &lt;code&gt;first-line&lt;/code&gt; selector may only be applied to block-level elements, inline-blocks, table captions and table cells.

CSS2.1 adds two more pseudo-elements, &lt;code&gt;before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;after&lt;/code&gt;.

Starting in CSS3 pseudo-elements are prefixed with &lt;code&gt;::&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;.

==Simple selectors==
The selectors described above (type, class, ID, universal, pseudo-class and pseudo-element) are all examples of simple selectors. The full syntax for a simple selector is:
* a type selector or the universal selector
* zero, one or more class, ID and pseudo-class selectors (CSS2.1 also allows attribute selectors)
* zero or one pseudo-element selectors

The following are all examples of simple selectors:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
  p
  p.important
  p#navigation
  a:link
  p:first-line
  a:visited#homePage.menu2:first-letter
  *
  *#footer
  *.content.abstract
  *#mainArticle:first-letter
&lt;/source&gt;

As a shorthand notation the universal selector, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, may be omitted if it is not the only component of the simple selector. For example, &lt;code&gt;#footer&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;*#footer&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:first-line&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;*:first-line&lt;/code&gt;.

Combining simple selectors: Simple selectors can be combined to take the context of the element in to account. For example you might want to apply a rule only to list elements in the navigation bar.

==Descendant==
Descendant selectors allow you to apply style to elements that are nested within another specified element. For example, you could have every &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; element inside of every &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; element be bold. The &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; can be a child element of the &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; element, or a grandchild, or a great-grandchild, etc.

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 p span{
   font-weight:bold;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Start of paragraph. &lt;span&gt;This span is bold.&lt;/span&gt; Rest of paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;Start of division. &lt;span&gt;This span is normal.&lt;/span&gt; Rest of division.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p&gt;Start of paragraph. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot; title=&quot;This text is bold.&quot;&gt;This span is bold.&lt;/span&gt; Rest of paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Start of division. &lt;span&gt;This span is normal.&lt;/span&gt; Rest of division.&lt;/div&gt;
}}

The next example changes the color of visited links in the navigation section. Visited links in other parts of the document would be unaffected.

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 ul#navigation a:visited {
   color:red
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang = &quot;html&quot;&gt;
 &lt;ul id=&quot;navigation&quot;&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;HomePage&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;AnotherPage&quot;&gt;A page you haven't visited yet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;color:red&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;A page you haven't visited yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
}}

An example using the &lt;code&gt;first-child&lt;/code&gt; selector.

CSS rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 div.content strong:first-child {
   color:red
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample HTML:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; text and some &lt;strong&gt;strongly emphasized&lt;/strong&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;strong&gt;strongly emphasized&lt;/strong&gt; text and some &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Example rendering:
{{CSS:rendered|1=&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; text and some &lt;strong&gt;strongly emphasized&lt;/strong&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;strong style=&quot;color:red&quot; title=&quot;This text is red.&quot;&gt;strongly emphasized&lt;/strong&gt; text and some &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; text.&lt;/p&gt;
}}

Two important points to note:
* an element is still the first child if it is preceded by text, so the &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt; element in the first paragraph and the &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt; element in the second paragraph are the first children of their respective paragraphs.
* a rule is only applied to an element if it matches all parts of the selector. The &lt;code&gt;strong&lt;/code&gt; element in the first paragraph is a second child, so it is not matched by the &lt;code&gt;strong:first-child&lt;/code&gt; selector.

==Grouping selectors==
Selectors can be grouped into comma separated lists.
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
h1, h2, h3 { text-align:center; }
&lt;/source&gt;
is equivalent to
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
h1 { text-align:center; }
h2 { text-align:center; }
h3 { text-align:center; }
&lt;/source&gt;

An element may be selected by more than one rule:
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { color: white; background-color: red; }
 h1 { color:yellow } 
&lt;/source&gt;
All headings will have a red background. Level 2&amp;#8211;6 headings will have white text. Level 1 headings will have yellow text.

The order of the rules is significant. In the following example all headings would have white text.
&lt;source lang = &quot;css&quot;&gt;
 h1 { color:yellow } 
 h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { color: white; background-color: red; }
&lt;/source&gt;
When more than one rule applies to an element the [[CSS Programming/Important|cascade]] is used to determine the resulting style applied to the element.

==Later CSS versions==

Additional selectors in CSS 2.1:
* Child selectors
* Adjacent sibling selectors
* Attribute selectors
* More pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

Additional selectors in CSS 3:
* More sibling selectors
* More attribute selectors
* More pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

==The Point?==
What is the real point of this page? It seems like mostly content that was removed and is not allowed in the [[How To Build A Computer]] article. The format also seems to be copied from its parts section. I have cleaned up the article without making any real content changes. However, you shouldn't simply state that a buyer should just buy a certain product. The reader should be able to make a choce based on the guide, not the guide making the choice.

P.S. Is there a reason you like LCDs soo much? If you do, put it in the main article. And for anyone editing, lookout for more errors in parts that I've cleaned up. I'm not too good with proper grammer myself. [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 09:25, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:Does this actually serve any purpose as an article? It doesn't seem to have any information useful to the purchase of parts; and most of the content has been rejected elsewhere.  I'm starting tomorrow on a campaign to redesign this article, to an extent where it can actually be used as information in effectively purchasing PC components. --[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 09:50, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Amalgamation with [[How To Build A Computer]] ==

* When we perform the split in the [[How To Build A Computer]] article, it would most likely be beneficial to merge this article into a section in the reformed Builder's guide, as a lot of the information is useful, and could prove useful in the actual building of a computer.--[[User:Noogz|Noogz]] 10:20, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Justification ==

I started making some changes which were generally along the lines of why you should go with certain components or another. Currently, the article seems to be saying &quot;Trust me, I like this brand.&quot; Rather than recommending that everyone go out and buy a Celeron CPU on an ASUS motherboard through PriceWatch.com, I think it'd be much more useful to say why people choose Celeron or Athlon or Pentium. --[[User:Cprompt|cprompt]] 12:15, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== A guide for people living outside the USA ==

I've been fumbling through Newegg, Tigerdirect, Geeks.com and Pricewatch, and so far I've never found an online computer parts shop that ships to Mexico other than Deremate.com, an used stuff shop. So, I'd like to see a section about what to do if you're not from the USA. [[User:201.128.248.147|201.128.248.147]] 02:41, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

== Out of Date - 2008 ==

As of the first week of 2008 this article is really really out of date.
1.  Laptop vs Desktop question is not discussed.
(I'm not familiar with people building a laptop but RE-building a laptop, sure, of course).  Laptops are (2008) now very powerful and can compete for the same users as desktop machines.  At a higher cost-point than a desktop of similar power, of course.  But they have a whole lot of advantages, too.
2.  Memory - DDR memory a luxury?  DDR2 is mainstream and DDR3 will be commonplace by end of year.  Probably should discuss Intel's plans and especially the coming (planned) obsolescence of the front side bus (which isn't mentioned!)
3.  Speaking of memory shouldn't operating system be FIRST?  The decision of building a computer should start by the evaluation of what you want it to do.  And that is intimately connected to the question of which OS you'll be using.  Its a year after Microsoft launched the Vista OS and many of the bugs have been ironed out.  The first patch is due in a few months but Vista (32 bit) is not the first choice of high performance users and has not swept away XP.  It has a huge (memory and CPU/GPU) overhead and is still got performance and crash problems.  Vista (64 bit) is even less popular and hence fewer of its issues have yet to be paid any attention.
4.  With the need in &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; systems to either run Vista or run PC games the once optional graphics card has become almost a necessity.  I expect this trend to continue.  Currently the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; in Graphics cards is multiple cards in the SLI (780i from nVidia) or (CrossfireX from ATI).  Good luck finding them.  680i, 650i, and Crossfire motherboards are &quot;mainstream&quot;.  The 680i (and 780i) supports up to 3 nVIdia Cards and the Crossfire 2 ATI cards. (780i allows serious overclocking from your desktop and the CrossfireX allows up to 4 cards).  The community expects nVidia to introduce a 9xxx series card for the SLI boards in the first quarter of '08, but its just a rumor.  ATI has lost some traction so I expect some great deals (this is speculation) on Crossfire and their HD3800 series cards to regain some market presence.  These cards burn power which means you'll need over 500 Watt power supplies and over 1kWatt for multiple cards.  Note I said they burn power.  The heat that they generate can roast a pig let alone a chip in a small case with poor air flow.  I think the need for water cooling, liquid cooling (non-conductive) has been over-hyped but it is real at the top end especially with overclocking.  One word of caution: a water-cooled system will, sooner or later, leak.  This is as true as the fact that a hard drive will, sooner or later crash.  You'll at least need some fans.  many cases will have puny inadequate fans; size does matter.  Anyway, as of right now an Intel cpu and a nVidia video card will out-perform their AMD/ATi rivals, IMO.  For the &quot;value&quot;, choose a faster clock on the CPU and a 8800 GT card.  For the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; (today - tomorrow it will be old news) choose a QX6850 quad core (or DDR3 QX9750) with SLI and two or three 8800 GTX's or Ultras. 
4.  MPC - the choice is between a cheap printer (my last I bought at Wa..er..MegaMart for $19 - its slow and drinks ink but is good enough for letters for personal use) and an expensive one (ink will be much cheaper, the unit will be faster and quieter but is really unlikely to be justified unless you have a home business or you have several kids using it for homework routinely) on the one side and Printer Scanner Copiers (and fax for businesses) on the other.  I personally favor PSC's just to save the one trip to the store or library to copy some important document before I mail it.  With the price of gas and the time savings, why not pay a bit more for that functionality?
5.  No mention of Blu-Ray or HD drives.  $300 - $400 for a reader, $550 - $800 for a writer.  Since the format war isn't settled yet I recommend a BR/HD combo reader for about $350 (LG).  Prices  change all the time, remember.

= Building computers from used parts =
As wikibooks is not only accessible in industrialized first world countries, it would be highly appreciable to include informations on how to build computers from used parts. Maybe this could even be a book on it's own, Title suggestion: &quot;Build your own Linux PC from scratch and scrap - Guidelines for a sustainable use of microelectronics in developing countries&quot;, Chapter 1 &quot;How to build a Failsafe (10/100MBit Ethernet Network)/RAID5-SCSI File-Server based on the ultra160 Bus&quot;; Chapter 2 &quot;How to build workstations with low power consumption&quot;, Chapter 3 &quot;Using Freeware and OpenSource Software for educational purposes&quot;, well.. just an idea

== Section Headings ==

To me, the section headings on this page are both inconsistent and unattractive. Some first-level headings are ALL CAPS, but not all, and the same for second and even third-level headings. Also, some headings are '''bold''' and/or ''italics'', which seems to defeat the purpose of having special heading tags at all. Unless there's some method to this, I think these section headings should be made a little more standard. [[User:Jfmantis|Jfmantis]] ([[User talk:Jfmantis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jfmantis|contribs]]) 00:40, 27 December 2011 (UTC)

== Book Merge ==


I think that this wiki book  should be merged into the [[How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC/Choosing_the_parts|Choosing the parts]] section of [[How_To_Assemble_A_Desktop_PC|How to Assemble a Desktop PC]]. They share similar interests , and I think that it is better to merge the advises on choosing on selecting the parts in the former book to that of the latter book. Keeping it as a supplement is not a good idea to me.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
&lt;big&gt;'''Overview:'''&lt;/big&gt;

Unlike in America, the French Revolution (1789-99) did not go well, for either side of the revolution.  It was a time of great political upheaval and radical change.  At the time of the revolution France was still firmly under a class system consisting of three states or ''etats'', the aristocracy, the clergy and everybody else.  This system meant that farming was still run on feudal lines, peasants work the land but ceased to be given any amount of protection from their overlords.  This lead to major unhappiness and eventually a republic, a constitutional monarchy and finally an Empire the likes Europe would not see in terms of conquering power until the Second World War.

----

&lt;big&gt;Causes:&lt;/big&gt;

Historians agree that a major cause of the revolution was economic. The struggle to match the economic power of other European power such as England caused massive famine and malnutrition due to rapid industrial expansion.  Another major cause was the Seven Years War, which saw France booted out of both India and Quebec by the English.  The French also supported the Americans in their revolution, pushing them further into bankruptcy.  Despite the failing economy the nobility continued to consume high level goods, especially Marie-Antionette.(&quot;They can't afford bread?  Let them eat cake!&quot;)  The final reason was the enlightenment fever.  After watching other countries change into constitutional monarchies or republics, peasants felt resentment towards their own absolute monarchy.  They were not alone.  A large percentage of rural clergymen hated their aristocratic biships, Protestent minorities yearned for freedom from persecution, and the enlightenment thinkers who so longed for a democratic state which they could call their own


&lt;big&gt;Early Wars&lt;/big&gt;
France broke into revolution against the king, starting with the storming of the Bastaille.  The leaders of the rebellion quickly started to gain control of the government.  That control was lost later

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_3.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Insert both fly leads into a beaker containing water and observe the output.

===Activity 4:===
Use your original circuit and extend it by connecting LED 2 and R3 as shown in the circuit diagram below:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_4.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

LED 2 - 5mm. infra red detector LED
R 3 - 2,7 MΩ

Use any remote control (from a TV, Hi-Fi etc.). Bring it close to LED 2. Press any button on the remote control and observe the output.

Note: An LED is a transducer: it converts energy from one form to another

&lt;u&gt;Component data:&lt;/u&gt;
*R1 - Blue, grey, brown, gold
*R2 - Yellow, violet, red, gold 
*R3 - Red, violet, green, gold

'''Note:''' 5%(gold), 10%(silver) or 20%(no 4th band) resistors may be used

The colours for the 4, 7 KΩ resistor was worked out like this: Each number of the value of the resistor correspond to the three bands on the one end of the resistor.

4 in the first band = yellow
7 in the second band = violet
K in the third band would be orange. Because there is a decimal place (comma) between the 4 &amp; 7, we move one decimal place and now have 2 zeros which correspond to red.

Try working out the colours for the following resistors: 47 KΩ, 50Ω, 330Ω , 100Ω , 560Ω , 390Ω.

&lt;/center&gt;

== AND &amp; OR Logic Gates ==
There are two types of electrical systems, viz. Digital and Analogue. Digital systems operate on logic circuits. The logic state or logic level of a system can either be HIGH or LOW.

This high and low state is referred to as ON or 1 to represent High and OFF or 0 to represent Low. We use logic gates in electrical systems to decide in a logical way our desired output.

&lt;center&gt;Understanding a logic level
&lt;/center&gt;

The table is called a truth table. It shows the possible logic levels of the circuit by using a 1 to indicate
ON and a 0 to indicate OFF.

This circuit can also be represented as a Systems Diagram as follows:

=== Activity 1: ===
Practical, truth table and systems diagram

Practical

Gather the necessary components and connect up the circuit shown below:

Truth Table

Complete the truth table alongside the circuit

This is an AND circuit &amp;shy the lamp will only light up if S1 AND S2 are closed.

Systems Diagram

Draw a systems diagram to represent the AND circuit.

=== Activity 2: ===
Practical and truth table

Practical

Gather the necessary components and connect up the circuit shown below:

Truth Table

Complete the truth table below:

'''Truth Table:''' represents the functioning of a digital circuit. This table uses a `1' to indicate a closed switch (or an `on' lamp, motor etc.), and `0' indicates an open switch (or an `off' lamp, motor etc.).

'''Logic state or logic level:''' tell us if the system is high or low or on or off.

'''Analogue system:''' has a range of values within its limits

'''Digital system:''' have discreet values within its limits

'''`AND' gate:''' produces 1 or high when all of its inputs are 1 or high

'''`OR' gate:''' produces 1 or high when any of its inputs is 1 or high

==Hydraulics==

Syringes can be used to change the type &amp; size of an input movement into a different output movement

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_14.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

===ACTIVITY 1===
Set up the investigation illustrated by the drawing above:

*Use two 10-ml syringes with approximately 200 mm length of plastic tubing.
*Use water in the system.
*Use syringes A as the master cylinder.

1. Observe and write down what happens at syringe B: 
*.......................................................................
2. Compare the distances
*.......................................................................
*.......................................................................

===ACTIVITY 2===

Repeat the investigation using a 60-ml syringe as the master and a 10-ml syringe as the slave.

2. Observe and note what happens.
*.......................................................................
*.......................................................................

3. Choose the correct options. If the plunger of the master syringe is pushed down 10 mm, the plunger
of the slave will have moved:

A. 10 mm 
B. less than 10 mm 
C. more than 10 mm


Complete the system diagram below:

==Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics==

Syringes can be used to demonstrate movement and the basic principles of pneumatics and hydraulics.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_14.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Set up the experiment as illustrated of the drawing above by doing the following:

*Connect two 10ml syringes with a 200 mm length of plastic tubing.
*Pull the plunger of syringe A completely out and push the plunger of syringe B fully in.
*Replace the plunger of syringe A and press slowly down.

Observe and write down what happens at syringe B
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................
Complete the system diagram below:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_16.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Repeat the demonstration, but this time fill the system with water.

Observe and write down what happens at syringe B
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................

Syringe A is referred to as the MASTER cylinder and Syringe B as the SLAVE cylinder.

Complete the system diagram below:

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_16.png]]&lt;/center&gt;


When syringes are filled with air we are demonstrating pneumatics. True pneumatics use compressed air.
When syringes are filled with water we are demonstrating hydraulics. True hydraulics usually uses oil as the fluid.

*Which is the more effective? 
*..............................................................................................................................................

*Why do you think so?
*..............................................................................................................................................

*Explain why in this case syringes A is the master and syringe B is the slave: 
*..............................................................................................................................................

==Preservation==

Materials deteriorate in different ways. Some get moldy (bread), some dry out and crack (wood), some go sour (milk), some rust (steels), etc. In the case of food it is micro-organisms that cause it to go bad. When we preserve materials we can prolong its lifespan or in some cases prevent it from deteriorating. 

This activity will show us one method of preserving a food material:

You need:
*One slice of bread.
*A knife
*Either an oven, grill, braai coals (something that gives off high heat)

Cut the slice of bread into two.

===Experiment 1===
1. Place one piece on a window sill. (Make sure it is in a spot where it will get a lot of sun).

2. Remove it after two days and check what it looks, and feels like.

===Experiment 2===
1. Place the other piece of bread in the oven, on or under the grill (depending on which type you have), or over the braai coals.

2. Remove it after a few minutes. (The time will depend on how hot the heat source is). Check what it feels like and looks like.

Write down what has happened to the bread in each experiment.

Answer these questions: (some of these words will help you: dry, evaporate, moisture, water)

1. What do you think happened to the bread?
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................

2. How would you explain this method of preservation to anyone?
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................

3. Name three other materials that this method of preservation could be used on.
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................

4. Write down a method that could be used to preserve a flower.
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................

Some information: Drying is process of removing water (moisture) from a material. In drying the
moisture that comes out is not used, i.e. it goes up into the air. One way to remove moisture is by
applying heat.

==Properties of Materials==
===Practical investigation===

Look at the table below and make a tick next to the correct property that tell us more about the material.

To do this you must test the material.

Collect each of the materials and do a test to check if it is strong (does not break or tear easily), and what its mass is (is it heavy or light)

Tell your class how you tested some of the materials.

==Preserving==
Wind, heat, water are some of the main causes of materials deteriorating. One of the ways to preserve these materials is to treat them with a preservative.

The material we will work with is wood.

You will need:
*Wooden peg, small piece of wood, wooden coaster, wooden spoon, wooden cutting board, classroom desk.
*Varnish, wax polish, silicone spray, cooking oil, lacquer, paint.
*Brushes, pieces of cloth, newspaper.

===About preservatives===
The technique you use will depend on:
*the condition of the article
*the type of preservative used

The choice of preservative will depend on:
*the type of article
*the intended use of the article

How to apply preservatives:
*In most case it is advisable to sandpaper the article first.
*If you are using paint, varnish, lacquer, etc use a clean brush and apply thin coats. Allow to dry between coats and sand lightly before applying the next coat.
*If you are using wax, apply with a clean cloth. Use a circular motion and finish off with straight strokes. You could also &quot;buff&quot; (shine) the article with a dry cloth.
*If you are using oil you could pour a little onto the article and then using a clean cloth rub the oil into the article. Wipe off any excess oil.
*If you are using sprays, apply thin coats. Sand in between coats.

Think and Do activity:

Think:
Complete the table below to show what preservative you will use for each article, give a reason and say how you will do it.

==ELECTROPLATING==

Electroplating is the process of producing a thin metallic coating on a surface of a metal object. This process has wide application in industry, e.g. used as a protective coating to prevent corrosion (chrome plating), to enhance the aesthetics / appearance (copper plating). The process of electroplating involves: Immersing an object to be plated as well as an electrode in a salt of metal solution, sending an electric current through it causing the free metal ions (charged atoms) to be deposited on the object.

&lt;center&gt;'''Copper plating'''&lt;/center&gt;
The following process gives the basics of electroplating and is not a guide for doing practical industrial electro plating.

You will need
*A plastic or glass container (non metal)
*(1.5 V cell)
*Two length of copper wire
*One coil of copper wire
*A metal object to copper plate (spoon, nail)
*Plastic spoon
*Copper sulphate (the metal salt,) available at most chemist

&lt;center&gt;'''Copper sulphate is poisonous if swallowed'''&lt;/center&gt;

1. Add 1 teaspoon of copper sulphate to water to make up a solution (about to 400ml.)

2. Strip &amp; connect ­ve lead to object that must be copper plated and place in solution. (For good results make sure object is clean.)

3. Strip coil, connect to positive lead and place coil into the solution

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_25.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Within a minute the object becomes coated with copper.The electric current splits the COPPER sulphate. The COPPER is deposited on the metal object.

For you to find out:
*Is it possible to electro plate on a non-metallic object? Please explain your answer.
*Silver plating, chrome plating, and gold plating are examples of electroplating in industry. The picture shows a watch that was chrome plated. Parts of the plating are eroding. Say what can be done to recoat it. Use the word electroplating in your answer. In the real world getting rid of chemical waste in electro plating is huge problem. What effect does the waste chemical have on the environment?

==Conditioning - Strengthening &amp; Waterproofing==

Conditioning is the process of changing the internal properties of a material. E.g. a piece of steel can be magnetised. There are two basic forms of conditioning; mechanical conditioning (when metal is hammered it becomes harder - clay that is fired becomes harder and stronger), and chemical conditioning (when we mix resin and hardener heat is given off (exothermic reaction) as the chemical reaction takes place. The product is hard and strong) There are a range of processes that can be carried out to condition a material; e.g. coating, mixing, impregnating, applying pressure, heat, energy, etc. 

This activity will focus on the PROCESSING SKILLS of: Coating and Impregnating

You will need:
·
*Glossy magazine paper / newspaper / tissue or toilet paper / small piece of sponge.
*Wood varnish / wood glue / Nail polish
*Optional:
**Toothpicks
**Paints
**String

===Activity===
Cut the material into five (5) squares 50 X 50. Cut the sponge into two small pieces Leave one (1) square uncoated. Leave one piece of sponge plain.

&lt;u&gt;Coating&lt;/u&gt;

1. Paint on the varnish onto test piece 1

2. Paint on the wood glue onto test piece 2

3. Leave to dry completely.

&lt;u&gt;Impregnating&lt;/u&gt;

1. Dip test piece 3 into the varnish.

2. Dip test piece 4 into the wood glue.

3. Dip the piece of sponge into the varnish.

4. Leave to dry completely.
·
Conduct tests to check for waterproofing and strength of all the test pieces and compare to the originals.
·
Decide on a suitable way to communicate this information to your teacher. (graph , table, paragraph, drawings, etc)

===Optional activity:===
You can combine the knowledge and skill you have learnt in the activity above by trying the following. It is a practical task where you can combine strengthening and waterproofing into a small product.
·
*Cut a piece of your paper (glossy magazine preferably) according to the template given.
*Apply glue to one side of the template and roll onto the toothpick. Start rolling from the wide side.
*Remove the toothpick and allow to dry.
*Coat the finished product with varnish / nail polish.
*Suggest three uses for the product that you made.

----

== Shaping ==
In the process of &quot;Shaping&quot; some of the material is removed (taken away). I.e. certain processes are carried out to remove the material. E.g. cutting, filing, sandpapering, grinding, planning, turning, drilling, etc.

You will practice the following PROCESSING SKILLS: Cutting, filing, sandpapering and drilling

You will need:
* ·A piece of plastic (Perspex, ice-cream tub, milk bottle, etc)
* Scissors,
* junior hacksaw,
* snips,
* files,
* hand drill + drill bits,
* sandpaper

=== Activity 1 ===
This is an investigation on plastics.
1. Feel and look at the plastics, and share what you notice about each one in your own words.

2. What do you think plastic is made of?

3. Name 4 things that plastic is used for.

=== Activity 2 ===
This is a communication and a practical activity. We have given you two rectangular shapes below. Do the following:

'''A:'''

1. Draw a &quot;geometrical&quot; shape in the first rectangle

2. In the second rectangle draw a &quot;free form&quot; shape.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_28.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

'''B:'''
1. Choose one of the shapes and transfer it to your piece of plastic. (Write down how you are going to do this)

2. Smoothen the cut out shape. (Write down how you are going to do this)

3. Drill a hole wherever you want to on the plastic shape that you have made.

4. Write down 3 things that this &quot;product&quot; you have made can be used for. 

'''Please remember and practice all safety precautions when working with tools and materials.'''

==Forming==

In the process of &quot;forming&quot; all of the material is used to make the product. This means that no material is removed (taken away) e.g. nothing is cut, filed, sandpapered etc. The simple process used in this activity is casting.

You will practice the following PROCESSING SKILLS
'''Mixing''' and '''combining''' and '''joining'''

You will need:
*A small mould
*Yellow stone (plaster of paris)
*Water
*Spoon

Optional:
*Small magnet
*Brooch pin
*Small cup hook
*Straw
*toothpicks
*Paints
*Glue (Bostik)

===How to cast===
1. Fill the mould half with water.

2. Slowly add some yellow stone ­ (enough to fill the mould) and mix well.

3. Allow to set for 25 minutes and turn out.

Or alternatively

1. Mix the plaster of paris with water in a separate container.

2. Pour the mixture into the mould

3. Allow to set.

===Optional activity:===
Once you have cast your object you can turn it into a useable work of art. 
You could:
*Decide on any creative use for your casting,
OR
*Glue on the magnet to make a fridge magnet,
*Glue the brooch pin and make it a brooch,
*Use the cup hook or straw to make a pendant (the challenge is deciding when and how to use the cup hook and straw)

==Understanding Forces==

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_29.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

When a material bends the two forces we talked about above can be seen in the material

Use an eraser (or similar object) and draw evenly spaced lines on the side. Bend, by applying upward pressure with the thumbs at arrow A and downward pressure at arrows B.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_30.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

Refer to Fig: 1 and answer these questions.
1. What is causing the bending in the material? 
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................

2. What would you call the OBJECT that is being bent? 
*..............................................................................................................................................
*..............................................................................................................................................


3. The drawing below shows a piece of metal which was struck by a cricket ball.
Use your knowledge of forces and indicate on the drawing, where the metal has experienced the
forces of compression and tension.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:SA_NC_Saaste_Activities_31.png]]&lt;/center&gt;


4. A material that is being stretched is said to be in:

==Types of Structures==
Structures are either natural (are found in nature) or constructed (are made by people). There are three types of structures;

#Frame: made of separate members (usually thin pieces) put together.
#Shell: encloses or contains its contents
#Solid (mass): made almost entirely of matter.

The best way to learn how the scientific method works is to engage, with an inquisitive attitude, in some scientific research broad enough to ensure that the special methods or techniques do not overshadow the general pattern.(Bunge, M. 1967)...

==Guidelines for Scientific Investigations==
''How do I go about selecting and initiating a suitable investigation for my learners?''

The following is a suggested route for the educator to assist his/her learners in arriving at a suitable investigation:...

==Radon Project==
'''Measurement of radon in Paarl'''

Paarl is situated about 60 km from Cape Town and is built on the slopes of a hill consisting granite rock. Granite rock typically has a higher than average uranium content. Radon is a colourless, tasteless and odourless gas that is a decay product in the uranium decay chain in soil and rock. 

Radon diffuses easily through cracks in walls and floors and may therefore accumulate in homes with poor ventilation. Radon gas has been found to be a major cause of lung cancer and contribute to at least 15 000 deaths in the United States annually. Radon measurements have been performed previously in Paarl and elevated levels were found in some older homes1. It was therefore proposed that further measurements are needed for a broader study of radon gas concentrations in soil and inside homes in Paarl....

*[[/Radon Measurement/]]

==Road Markings==
This project involved ten committed educators from the EMDC, South Metropole (Mitchells Plain and surrounding areas). The objective of the project was to engage their learners in science process skills and empowering them in facilitating investigative skills in their classrooms. Educators from different schools were at different stages within their learning programmes. In order to choose a common topic to advance the project it was decided to select a topic that could easily be done in the different classes, without undue disruption of the learning programmes in progress.

==SCIENTIFIC METHOD== 
A method is a procedure for handling a set of problems. Every kind of problem requires a set of special methods or techniques. The general method of science, by contrast, is a procedure applying to a whole cycle of investigation into every problem of knowledge. The best way to learn how the scientific method works is to engage, with an inquisitive attitude, in some scientific research broad enough to ensure that the special methods or techniques do not overshadow the general pattern. (Bunge, M. 1967) 

The webpage [http://va.essortment.com/sientificresea_rqce.htm/ va.essortment.com/sientificresea_rqce.htm/ ] explains the scientific method as follows: 
*The first step to using the scientific method is to have some basis for conducting your research. This is based on observed phenomena that are either directly or indirectly related to the specific subject matter of your proposed research. The first step is then actually observations you make for scientific research. 
*The next step is to form a hypothesis to explain some aspects of your observations. The hypothesis is ready to be tested. You must now use your hypothesis to predict other phenomena that have not yet been observed. 
*The final step of the scientific method is to rigorously test your prediction. It is important to know that you can not &quot;prove&quot; your hypothesis. You can only fail to disprove it. While this is an example of how the scientific method is used in everyday research and hypothesis testing, it is also the basis of creating theories and laws. It should be noted that a theory or hypothesis is not meaningful if it is not quantitative and testable. If a theory does not allow for predictions and experimental research, than it is not a scientific theory. A common error encountered by people who claim to use the scientific method is a lack of testing. A hypothesis brought about by common observation and common sense does not have scientific validity. 

===SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS=== 
The following ordered sequence of operations are recommended by Bunge (1967) 

* 1. Ask well-formulated and likely fruitful questions.
* 2. Devise hypotheses both grounded and testable to answer the questions.
* 3. Derive logical consequences of the assumptions.
* 4. Design techniques to test the assumptions.
* 5. Test the techniques for relevance and reliability.
* 6. Execute the tests and interpret their results.
* 7. Evaluate the truth claims of assumptions and the fidelity of techniques.
* 8. Determine the domains in which the assumptions and techniques hold, and state the new problems raised by the research. 

===RULES OF SCIENTIFIC METHOD=== 
For the sake of illustration we shall mention and exemplify some quite obvious rules of scientific method. 

====Rule 1====
'''State your problem precisely and, in the beginning, specifically.'''

For example, do not just ask &quot;Does antacid increase the pH of gastric fluid?, but pose a wellcircumscribed question such as e.g., At what tempo does various brands of antacids increase the pH of gastric fluid?

====Rule 2==== 
'''Try definite and somehow grounded conjectures rather than noncommittal and wild hunches.''' 

Formulate a hypothesis to explain the phenomenon with definite relations among clear-cut variables. e.g. &quot;Antacid 1 would lower the pH value of gastric fluid the quickest&quot;. 

====Rule 3==== 
'''Subject your assumptions to tough tests rather than soft ones.''' 

e.g. by comparing four different brands of antacid under the same conditions. Devise an experiment test all antacids under the same conditions e.g. temperature ... 

====Rule 4==== 
'''Do not pronounce a true satisfactorily confirmed hypothesis: regard it as, at best, partially true.''' 

Allow yourself to be led to deductions/conclusions only by empirical results from experiment. 

====Rule 5==== 
'''Ask why the answer should be as it is and not f*** otherwise'''</text>

==Guidelines for selecting suitable investigations==
''How do I go about selecting and initiating a suitable investigation for my learners?'' 

Many investigations deal with the selection of the appropriate materials to perform a particular function e.g. 
* Perform an investigation to determine which material is best for insulation purposes 
* Perform an investigation to determine which material is best to create a specific structure or product. 

Investigations concerning events in the school's immediate surrounding should also be considered. 
The following is a suggested route for the educator to assist his/her learners in arriving at a suitable investigation: 
Perform a few focus tasks to improve the learners' observational skills. One must bear in mind that observations can include all five senses (taste, touch, hearing, sight and smell).

A possible way of improving observation in terms of hearing: 
* pair learners 
* one learner from each pair is blindfolded 
* one learner leads the blindfolded learner 
* the blindfolded learner mentions all the sounds he/she hears and reports happenings in the surroundings to the other learner who records it on a sheet 

A possible way of improving observation in terms of touch: 
* put different objects in a container 
* learners identify objects in the container by means of touch only (learners are not to see the objects in the container) 

A warning in the case of tasting: 
This observational skill should be practiced under controlled circumstances

Once the focus tasks on observation have been completed the educator can ask learners to prepare a list of events which occur in their immediate surroundings e.g. 
* Gardening 
* Making a noise 
* Working 
* Littering 

Ask the learners to indicate what events they are happy or unhappy about - this will lead to problem identification. 

A hypothesis can then be formulated. 

The extent of the problem can then be determined quantitatively, which implies that measurements have to be made. 

The educators now have to assess whether the measurements can be performed within a reasonable time frame. 

If the outcome of this assessment is positive the educator can confidently go ahead with this investigation, knowing his/her learners will be exposed to the majority of the science process skills.

==MEASUREMENT OF INDOOR RADON IN PAARL==
&lt;center&gt;''SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS PROJECT'''&lt;/center&gt;
===REASON FOR STUDY===
Paarl is situated about 60 km from Cape Town and is built on the slopes of a hill consisting granite rock. Granite rock typically has a higher than average uranium content. Radon is a colourless, tasteless and odourless gas that is a decay product in the uranium decay chain in soil and rock
.  
Radon diffuses easily through cracks in walls and floors and may therefore accumulate in homes with poor ventilation. Radon gas has been found to be a major cause of lung cancer and contribute to at least 15 000 deaths in the United States annually. Radon measurements have been performed previously in Paarl and elevated levels were found in some older homes [[Saaste_Science:Radon_Measurement#footnote|1]]. It was therefore proposed that further measurements are needed for a broader study of radon gas concentrations in soil and inside homes in Paarl.     

===HYPOTHESIS===

The Radon concentrations in houses and soil in areas with high granite deposits are higher than in houses and soil in areas with low granite deposits.    

===RADON===

====What is Radon?====

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is produced in the uranium decay chain. Radium is a product of the radioactive decay of uranium. Radon is then formed during the decay of radium. Radioactive decay is a natural, spontaneous process in which an atom of one element breaks down to form another element by losing atomic particles. When solid radium decays to form radon gas it loses two protons and two neutrons. The two protons and two neutrons are called an alpha particle. An alpha particle is identical to the nuclei of helium-4 atoms. Radon itself eventually loses an alpha particle to form the element polonium.   

Radon is considered a noble gas and is thus very reluctant to react with other elements. Radon is not detectable through human senses; the only way to determine radon occurrence is by measurement.    

The rate of radioactive decay is measured in terms of half-life, the time it takes for half of a sample of an element to decay. While uranium has a half-life of 4.4 billion years, the half-life of radon is only 3.8 days. This means that 50 % of a given volume of radon will decay in 3.8 days to form decay products like polonium, bismuth and lead. When we inhale high concentrations of radon, the gas molecules may decay to the above mentioned elements, which may stick to the epithelial cells of the lung. The presence of these elements may eventually cause lung cancer.

====Radon formation====
All rocks contain some uranium-most of them in the region of 1 to 3 parts per million (ppm) of uranium. Granite rocks, as volcanic rocks, dark shale and certain sedimentary rocks, have higher than average uranium content, as much as 100 ppm. The higher the uranium content in rocks and soil in an area, the greater the chances of higher radon levels indoors.     

====Radon movement and diffusion====
Radon is released from mineral grain via alpha recoil. As each radium atom decays by ejecting an alpha particle, the newly formed radon atom recoils in the opposite direction. By recoiling the radon atom may then enter the pore space between grains in a fractured rock. The radon atom could also recoil towards the interior of the grain and not enter the pore space.  

Because radon is a gas it moves more easily than radium that is fixed in rocks and soil. Radon easily escapes into fractures in rocks and pore spaces between grains of soil. The ease of movement of radon affects how much radon may enter a home. Radons movement is dependent on porosity of soil, soil permeability and soil moisture content. Radon moves rapidly through permeable soils, such as sand and gravel, than through impermeable soils like clay. Fractures and pores allow radon to diffuse more quickly. In water, however, radon moves slower than in air. 

For these reasons, homes in areas with drier, highly permeable soils and fractured bedrocks may have higher levels of indoor radon. The air pressure in the ground around most houses is said to be higher than the air pressure inside the house. Air tends to move through cracks in the foundation and walls of houses. Soil air may thus diffuse easily into houses with low indoor pressures, poorly sealed foundations and several entry points for soil air, leading to higher than normal radon levels.

===LOOKING AT THE ACTUAL INVESTIGATION===

====Equipment used====

There are a few methods to measure radon indoors, but this procedure explains the handling and usage of a standard (S) chamber E-PERM monitoring device.  This device takes the measurement over a few days. To measure radon with this method, the equipment used were:

*A SChamber E-PERM
*An electret to fit the S  Chamber
*A special reader to read voltage on electret
*A Mylar bag (A type of plastic bag)
*Data Logging Sheet

====Method of data collection====

When an electret (ST) is fitted to a S-chamber, the E-PERM configuration is called a SSTE-PERM.

1.All electrets are covered by a protective cap when in storage. Unscrew the cap and place the electret face down in the slot provided on the electret reader to measure its Initial Voltage (I).  Record the value on the data logging sheet provided.

2.Screw the electret into the bottom of the S-Chamber.  Make sure not to touch the white surface of the electret. 

3.When you are ready to start measuring, turn the E-PERM to the on position, by unscrewing the top screw cap.

4.Place the E-PERM at the location to be monitored.  Make sure to read the instructions on where to place the detector or where not to in a later section in the supplement.  Record the date and time of the placement.

5.After the exposure period (about seven days), close the cap of the E-PERM which returns it to its off position.  Record the date and time on the logging sheet when the measurement was stopped.

6.Read the Final voltage (F) on the electret thereafter with the reader and record it.

7.The radon concentration is then calculated with a few equations.
