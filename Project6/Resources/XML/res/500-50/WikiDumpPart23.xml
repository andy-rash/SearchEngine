'''Fructose''' is the chemical name for the kind of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] found in most [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]]. Sugar found in [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]] and human [[Cookbook:Blood|blood]] is called glucose. Normal table sugar, produced from sugar cane or sugar beets, is called sucrose.

Fructose is sweeter than glucose and sucrose. It is thus useful for people who wish to reduce the sugar in their diet without reducing sweetness. It's also useful for people who simply want extra-sweet food. Note that reducing the sugar in a recipe can have bad effects; sugar is used for browning and for mold prevention.

==Warning==
Fructose can cause diarrhea, flatulence, obesity, [[w:Low_density_lipoprotein|elevated LDL cholesterol]] and [[w:Triglyceride|triglycerides]], loss of minerals, and glycation-related cellular damage that may lead to age-related chronic diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Tactile sensors measure force applied to them. This can be in an on-off fashion or as a more or less accurate measurement.

==Simple Contact Sensor==
===Bumper switches===
One of the most simple sensors available are contact sensors or bumper switches. These sensors use some form of bumper to press a button when the robot comes in contact with another object. A well built bumper switch is a very reliable sensor, but since these detect by touch, they're not very practical on fast or heavy robots. 

One key point on bumper switches (or any kind of mechanical switches) is that they don't give a clean signal when closed. The contact tends to &quot;bounce&quot; a bit.

===Whiskers===
Whiskers use the same principle as bumper switches, however they give a slightly larger detection range and so avoid the need to bump against other objects. One common design is to mount the whisker through a circular bend wire. When something hits the whisker, it bends and touches the circular bend wire. The electrical contact formed in this way is used to detect the object.

==Mozilla/Firefox==
You need a guide for Mozilla/Firefox users (such as myself).
:There already is.. just follow the instructions on the page and it will install the fonts/etc for windows. Firefox will use these fonts. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 05:48, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)

==Unix/X11==
A guide for X11 and Gnome/KDE (Unix, *BSD, Linux) users would be much appreciated.

:^I second that

:Yep. Triple that. I never got an IME working on Linux.

: I'll see if I can get IME working on my machine. If I am able to get it working, I'll write down what I did here. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 14:10, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

:I put up a preliminary guide to IMEs under Debian. It could do with somebody testing that all the neccessary packages are listed. I'm afraid I don't know how one enables an IME if you're using some wierd &quot;desktop environment&quot; that doesn't use a .Xsession file.
:The Unix/X11 section could do with lists of packages for other distributions, and also some information on Japanese-specific distributions.

==Windows 2000==
Windows 2000-specific instructions are needed; the steps are not quite the same as XP.  I'd put them up myself, but I already got it working and I forget how :)

== How to use it?  (GNOME) ==

OK, I followed the steps here, and while I'm sure these are useful first things to install, I still need to figure out how to use them.  :-)

A different approach I tried:
* added a GNOME panel object called &quot;Keyboard Indicator&quot;
** right-click, Keyboard Preferences
** Layouts, Add..., Japan / Kana
** (Layout Options has a &quot;Japanese keyboard options&quot;, but I have no clue what they are: &quot;Kana Lock key is locking&quot;, and &quot;NICOLA-F style Backspace&quot;; the help file doesn't mention them)
** (there's a &quot;Default&quot; column, with a circle in each row, but it doesn't seem to do anything)
Now if I click the panel object (it looks like just a label, but it acts sort of like a button!) until it says &quot;Jpn&quot;, I'm typing in Katakana.  Huzzah!  The katakana don't seem to correspond to either Qwerty or Dvorak locations, unfortunately, so it's going to be complete trial-and-error for a couple weeks.

I don't know yet how to type Hiragana (which is what I really wanted), or Kanji (but that sounds really complicated).  It looks like &quot;scim&quot; is what I'll need for this, but I tried running &quot;scim-setup&quot; and it's obviously written for somebody who already knows what they're doing, and I am not (yet) that person.

== Windows Vista ==

How about an input method for vista?

: From what I gather, Microsoft has become more and more i18n friendly and I suppose IMs should be covered. If you have Vista, feel free to research this and [[WB:BB|leave a note]] on how that is done. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 16:52, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The drone honeybee is the only male resident within a colony of bees. At the beginning of a spring season their population is often below one hundred, with a healthy hive often not having a population greater than a thousand. A good approximation dictates that about 15% of the hive's population is made up of drones. The drone is often described as simply being a fat, lazy bee that is unable to care for himself. 

==Appearance==
Those unfamiliar with distinguishing the sexes of bees many often mistake a drone bee as being a [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen bee]], as he is noticeably different than his sister  [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee| worker bees]]. In actuality, the drone bee can be easily distinguished from a queen bee by identifying his large round eyes located close together at the top of his head. The drone’s body shape is also more cylindrical than that of the thinner tapering queen’s body.
Though not obviously apparent from casual observation, drone bees also do not have pollen baskets, stingers or wax glands.

==Behavior==
===Beg, Borrow and Steal===
The drone has a reputation for being fat and lazy, this likely comes across due to his manner within the hive. The drone will not help out in brood rearing, comb building, honey curing or storage. Rather the drone does little more than eat. In fact when possible, the drone will beg [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee#Nurse Bee| nurse bees]] to feed them, when unsuccessful a drone will eventually help himself to stored nourishment.
The drone is likely only tolerated within the colony as he is needed to spread the hive’s genetics.

===Leaving the Hive===
In about six days after emerging as a bee, the drone will begin to leave the colony. This however depends on the weather and time of year. As they mature, they will begin to congregate in areas where other drones exist, in hopes of mating with a viable queen.

===Kicked Out===
As the outside weather cools, and mating season comes to an end, most drones that managed to survive unmated will be kicked out of the hive. Drones are a tremendous drain on resources, and are not required for the overwintering process. It is also not uncommon for both adult and brood drone to be kicked out of the hive during a dearth in food collection.

==From Egg to Bee==
===Eggs===
Drones are the result of unfertilized egg and the process of parthenogenesis. Normally, a queen bee will purposely deposit an unfertilized egg into a slightly larger drone cell. A special case also exists where a [[Beekeeping/Worker Bee#Laying Worker| laying worker bee]] may deposit eggs into any brood cell.

===Larval Diet===
After hatching into a larval form, drones begin to eat a mixture of worker jelly, pollen and honey. This food has been called drone jelly, though all beekeepers and researchers have not adopted this term.
===Drone Cell===
Most commonly, drone eggs are deposited in what is known as a drone cell. These cells are similar to worker cells, but are wider. After about six days, the drone larva, within the drone cell is capped. These drone cells can easily be distinguished from worker cells once they their capping is domed shaped and protrude beyond other brood cells.

==Duties==
===Mating===
The drone has only one purpose, after completion of which, he will quickly die. The drone honeybee exists to mate. Once mature, the drone leaves his colony to join other drones within designated mating grounds called drone congregation areas. If the drone is successful, mating will occur somewhere around two hundred feet in the air. Because of the fact that his mating apparatus is barbed, much like the stinger of a worker, it will be ripped from his body after mating, and he will fall towards the earth with the only possible outcome of death.

===Warmth===
It is debated by some, that drone bees may also provide insulation to a hive, making it easier to maintain warmth. If anything this function is incidental, and can likely be more efficiently achieved by worker bees.
==Life Cycle==
;Day 0:An unfertilized egg is laid by either the queen bee or a laying worker.
;Day 3 :The unfertilized egg hatches.
;Day 11 :The drone cell is capped.
;Day 15 :Metamorphosis in to a pupa is complete
;Day 24 :Adult drone emerges.
;Day 30 :The drone begins to leave the colony
;Day 85-06 :The drone dies, if survived unmated

==Quick Facts==
*Many beginning beekeepers practice on drones when learning how to successfully [[Beekeeping/Marking the Queen| mark the queen]], as they do not have stingers, and are not vital to the colony if accidentally injured or even killed.

Over 300 Prophecies from the Hebrew Scriptures Reveal Messiah   [http://www.messiahrevealed.org/]



== Messiah in Genesis 3 The fall of man ==

Text from KJV 

''12.  And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13.  And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.  14.  And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  '''15.  And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel'''.'' 


Gen 3.15 is seen as a prophesy that the Messiah would:-
1. be born of woman.
2. be the enemy of evil
3. suffer in his struggle against evil (bruised heel)
4. defeat evil (shall bruise thy head)

CJL -28 April 05

== Messiah in Genesis 9 The story of Noah's Ark ==

''King James Version ...   20.  And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:  21.  And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.  22.  And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.  23.  And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.  24.  And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.  25.  And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.  '''26.  And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant'''.  27.  God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. 28.  And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.  29.  And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.''


MESSIAH DESCENDS FROM SHEM.

== Genesis 12 The Call of Abram ==

1 The LORD had said to Abram, &quot;Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. 
2 &quot;I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you;
I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
3 I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse;
and '''all peoples on earth will be blessed through you'''.&quot;

MESSIAH IS A DESCENDANT OF ABRAM

MESSIAH COMES FOR ALL NATIONS

== Genesis 17 The Covenant of Circumcision ==

19 Then God said, &quot;Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.&quot;



MESSIAH WILL BE A DESCENDANT OF ISAAC.

== Genesis 18 - Abraham pleads for Sodom ==

16 When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. 17 Then the LORD said, &quot;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? 18 Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and '''all nations on earth will be blessed through him'''. 19 For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.&quot;

THE MESSIAH WILL BE A DESCENDANT OF ABRAHAM

THE MESSIAH WILL COME FOR ALL NATIONS

== Genesis 21 Hagar and Ishmael ==

9.  And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian (hebrew: Mitsriyt), whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 
10.  Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. 11.  And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son. 12.  And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. '''In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.''' 13.  And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.


MESSIAH WILL DESCENT FROM ISAAC.

Isaac means = he laughs

Academics suggest that there were 2 Mizraims - one is Egypt and the other was in northern Arabia.

== Genesis 22 - Sacrifice of Issac ==

9.  And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. 
10.  And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 
11.  And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am. 
12.  And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me. 
13.  And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son. 
14.  '''And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided'''. 
15.  And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven, 
16.  and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, 
17.  that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. 
18.  '''And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.'''  


THE MESSIAH WILL BE SACRIFICED ON THE SAME MOUNTAIN

MESSIAH DESCENDS FROM ABRAHAM AND WILL COME FOR ALL NATIONS.

== Genesis 26 - Abraham goes to Philistine ==

1.  And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar. 
2.  And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. 
3.  Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father. 
4.  And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And '''in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed'''. 
5.  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 6.  And Isaac dwelt in Gerar. 

MESSIAH IS A DESCENDANT OF ISAAC AND COMES FOR ALL NATIONS.

== Genesis 28 - Jacobs Ladder ==

10.  And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran. 
11.  And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep. 
12.  And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
13.  And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed. 
14.  And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And '''in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed'''. 
15.  And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of. 
16.  And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not. 
17.  And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
18.  And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
19.  And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first. 

MESSIAH IS A DESCENDANT OF JACOB AND COMES FOR ALL NATIONS.

== Genesis 49 - Jacob's Blessing of the 12 Tribes ==

1.  And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days. 

8.  Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee. 9.  Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? 10.  '''The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come: And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.''' 11.  Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes: 12.  His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk. 
-----------------------------------------

THE AUTHORITY TO ADMINSITER CAPITAL PUNISHEMNT WILL END WHEN THE MESSIAH COMES.

      <text xml:space="preserve">if dx is contravariant, then surely g must be covariant, or vice versa? To be honest I can never remember which is which, but I'm sure they must be different.

dx is contravariant, g is covariant and symmetric. The way to remember is that 
dx'&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;=dx'&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;/dx&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;·dx&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;    by the chain rule
This is the change-of-coordinate equation of a contravariant tensor, and thus dx is contravariant.  Hope this helps. - Itzamna 2 Feb 2008

I also don't understand the last example.  How could that work, since ds is a scalar, 2 is a scalar, and dx and dy are contravariant vectors?

=='''Testing Intelligence:''' ==
['''PURPOSES AND METHODS''']

Although, as we have seen , theorists and researchers are still working on a definition of intelligence, psychologists, educators, and others who face a very real need to measure intelligence in some way continue to study existing tests and to explore ways to improve their ability to provide us with useful information. Why do we need to measure intelligence? There are three primary purposes in intelligence testing : predicting academic performance, predicting performance on the job, and assessing general adjustment and health

The earliest intelligence tests were designed to meet the first of these goals, and most existing intelligence tests, such as the Binet and Wechsler scales, predict performance in school better than they predict anything else. Predicting how well a person will succeed at a job is the second goal of intelligence testing, and according to Gottfredson (1997), such measures are the most powerful predictors of over all work performance. A third use of intelligence testing is in assessing people's general adjustment and health. The Binet and Wechsler tests that we discuss in this section can detect signs of neurological problems, mental retardation, and emotional distress in children as well as adults, and the Bayley scales and other infant tests are useful in assessing developmental progress in infants as well as neurological disorders or mental retardation.

Unfortunately, traditional tests do not make predictions as accurately for some groups in our society as for others. Many critics, for example, have pointed out that these tests often require knowledge that children with fewer advantages are unlikely to have and that thus, traditional tests may unfairly classify some people as less intelligent than they actually are. For some years researchers have been attempting to develop what are known as culture-fair tests, that is, tests that attempt to exclude or minimize the presence of culturally biased content that could prejudice test takers' responses. The raven progressive matrices test which requires people to identify, distinguish, and match patterns of varying complexity, and the Kaufman test we discuss shortly are such tests.

We begin this section with a brief discussion of the Bayley scales and then examine the two most widely used sets of traditional tests – the Stanford – Binet tests and the Wechsler scales. Neither of these tests is culture fair, and both tests measure the products of intelligence, that is, actual information. Next we examine the relatively new, Kaufman assessment measure, which attempts both to be culture –fair and to measure the processes by which people acquire information and solve problems we then turn to the methodology of test construction, including the ways in which psychologist s develop norms for test scoring and the kinds of procedures they considering the relative stability of intelligence as well as what factors may effect changes in intelligence over time.

== '''Measuring infant intelligence''' ==

The Bayley scales of infant development (Bayley, 1969, 1993) are probably the best known and most widely used of all infant development tests. Because these tests were designed to be used with the very young, their nonverbal test items were chosen for their ability to measure specific developmental milestones. The Bayley scales are used with infants and children between 1 and 3 years of age, and they are generally used to assess children who are suspected to be at risk for abnormal development. For example, the Bayley mental scale includes such things as looking for a hidden object and naming pictures, whereas the motor scale includes such items as grasping ability and jumping skills in a third part of the test, the examiner observes the child's behavior, making notes about such things as sociability and displays of fear 

The growing emphasis on the processes of intelligence has led some investigators to explore ways of assessing processing skills in the very young as well as to devise measures that are culture – fair . box 11-1 discusses one of these newer tests, the Fagan test of infant intelligence, which is capable not only of assessing process but of eliciting similar performance from infants of different cultures. The test also correlates well with measures of intelligence in children of older ages. Such predictive value not only can tell us something about the relative stability of intelligence, a topic we discuss later in this section, but also can serve a diagnostic purpose, indicating the need for special assistance for a child at risk for less than adequate cognitive development (Fagan, 1992).


== '''The Stanford – Binet test''' ==

Widely used by psychologists both in schools and in health settings, the Stanford Binet test is the modern version of the test devised in the early 1900s by Binet and Simon at the request of the Paris school system. At that time because of new compulsory education laws, the city's schools were overcrowded, and school administrators wanted to identify children who were unable to learn in traditional classroom settings, fearing that teachers might judge these children unfairly, school officials proposed giving them the opportunity for special education.
Binet and Simon, who believed that intelligence was malleable and that children's academic performance could be improved with special programs, took an innovative approach to the construction of their test (Binet, 1909/1973; Siegler, 1992). Critical of earlier psychologists, who had tried to assess intelligence by measuring simple sensory or motor responses, Binet and simon asserted that to differentiate among individuals, one had to sample higher mental function such as

== '''Child psychology in action''' ==

'''''The Fagan test of infant intelligence'''''

All mothers and fathers know that their babies are destined to win Nobel prizes or to become great leaders, but is it really possible to test intelligence in very young children? The Fagan test of infant intelligence was built on the notion that infants display their intelligence in their capable use of such processes as encoding the attributes of objects, seeing similarities and differences between objects, forming mental representations, and retrieving those representations (Fagan, 1992). Of course we cannot see an infant's selective attention to novelty, the primary basis of the Fagan test, but we can infer it from infants behavior. Suppose, for example , that we show a 5-month old a red diamond shape; next we show the infant a green diamond and a green square. Typically, the infant will show a preference for the square, indicting that she has processed the element of from the original color form compound and is now interested in the new form. (Remember our discussion in chapter 5 of habituation and the infant's tendency to attend to what is novel in her environment)

The Fagan test estimates an infant's intelligence by measuring the amount of time the infant spends looking at a new object compared with the time  spends looking at a familiar object (Fagan et al , 1991) using a set of 20 photographs of human faces, arranged in pairs, the examiner begins by showing a baby one photograph of the first pair, for 20 seconds. Then the examiner pairs that photograph with its mate, showing the baby the two photos together for 5 seconds, and then again for another 5 seconds, this time reversing the two photos left to right (to avoid any tendency for the infant to choose one side).  The score the infant receives is made up of the total time he spends looking at the novel photograph throughout presentation of all the 10 pairs.

To determine whether infants from different cultures would be equally adept at this task, Fagan and his colleagues administered the test to groups of European American and African American babies in the United States, a group of infants in Bahrain (bordering Saudi Arabia), and a group of infants in Kampala, Uganda.  Within each cultural group infants of four ages - 6, 8, 18, and 24 months – were tested. The researchers found that there were practically no differences between the average scores obtained by the nearly 200 infants in these groups:

European American babies scored an average of 58.8 African American 59.1 Bahrainans 59.6 and Ugandans 58.4. according to Fagan (1992), the most parsimonious explanation for these findings is that differences in IQ between blacks and whites spring from differences in cultural exposure to information (that) influences scores in the domain of cultural knowledge tested (p.85).

Interestingly, among these infants, 54 percent of European Americans, 49 percent of African Americans, and 26 percent of Bahrainians were considered to be physically at risk – that is, they had spent five or more days in a neonatal intensive care unit. Moreover, among the Ugandan babies, 62 percent had mothers who were HIV positive. The presence of these potentially negative influences may add significance to the authors statement that there appeared to be no differences in intelligence among the four group.

Fagan and his associates (Fagan , 1984) have demonstrated the Fagan test's ability to predict intelligence scores at a later age, a quality that greatly enhances the potential usefulness of the test (see also text discussion of the predictive value of infant testing). In fact, a primary goal of the test is to differentiate normal from cognitively deficient infants. According to Fagan (1992), the test has been shown highly sensitive to later evidence of mental retardation, identifying some 85 percent of children who later obtained low IQ scores.

Binet originated the concept of mental age, which is an index of a child's actual performance level as contrasted with her true age. Thus, if a 6-year – old child gets as many items correct as the average 7-year-old , the 6-year – olds mental age is 7; she performs as well as a child 7 years old. The mental age concept was later superseded by the intelligence quoting for which the German psychologist William stern devised the following form:
 
Where IQ equals mental age MA) divided by chronological age (CA), multiplied by 100. thus, if a child's mental age equaled her chronological age, she would be performing like an average child of her true age, and her IQ would be 100. if her performance were superior to other children her age , her IQ would be above 100; if it were inferior, her IQ would be less than 100.  Today's Stanford-Binet test, a revision of the Binet-Simon measure, has been designed to include items that tap other than language and math skills, such as putting together jigsaw puzzles and making designs with blocks, but the extent to which academic experience influences the latter types of tasks is not completely clear. As we will see next, the Wechsler scales have placed more emphasis on tests that assess so-called performance skills.

The Wechsler Scales

The Wechsler intelligence scales, developed by David Wechsler (1952, 1958), include the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). Although these tests show the influence of Binets tests. Wechsler designed them specifically to yield separate verbal and performance IQ scores as well as a combined, full scale IQ score. The descriptions of the WISC subtests shown in table 11- highlight that performance items are some what less likely to be influenced by formal education or cultural factors. As a result, a child who has a specific learning problem such as a difficulty with language may do quite well on these items, even if he performs poorly on the verbal subtests.  Children who come from homes that lack some of the advantages other children enjoy may also be more successful on these performance tests.

Rather than use mental age as a basis for estimating intelligence, Wechsler created the deviation IQ, which is a number that reflects the higher, lower, or similar position of the test taker's score in relation to the score obtained by an average child of the test taker's age. How is this different from the concept of mental age? The deviation IQ scoring system, which like the Binet IQ takes 100 as an average score, is based on extensive testing of people of different ages in many parts of the United States and on the statistical computation of mean scores for each age group. In computing these average scores, psychologists use a statistic called the standard deviation to signal the extent to which no average scores deviate from the norm. as a result, an individual's score may be at the mean, or it may be one or more standard deviations above or below the mean.

== '''The Kaufman assessment battery for children''' ==
The first test to include a specific focus on processing skills, the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC), is based directly on cognitive development research (Kaufman &amp; Kaufman, 1983). The test measures several types of information – processing skills grouped into two categories: sequential processing (solving problems in a step – by – step fashion) and simultaneous processing (examining and integrating a wide variety of materials in the solution of a problem) the test also assesses achievement in academic subjects, like vocabulary and arithmetic, yet its test items (many nonverbal) are intended to be culture-fair. In fact, the designers of this test used a wide and representative sample of many American cultural and socio-economic groups in establishing norms for the test.

An interesting innovation is that if a child fails early items on a subscale, K-ABC examiners teach the child how to complete these items before they administer the rest of the subtest. According to the designers of the test, this ensures that no child who is capable of learning an unfamiliar task receives a failing score in it. The Kaufman test has been criticized for offering only a limited range of items that tap information – processing function, such as short-term memory (Conoley, 1990); Sternberg, 1985) critics have argued that the test should focus more on problem solving strategies, a central component of the information – processing approach to intelligence. Nevertheless, the Kaufman test is a creative approach to the measurement of intelligence that applies important insights from the information – processing approach to the study of intelligence and intelligence testing. ==

* Understand what neuropsychology is and what a neuropsychologist does.
* Gain knowledge of the basic structures and functions of the brain.
* Understand the tools a neuropsychologist uses, and what each can help diagnose and why.
* Understand the different areas that a neuropsychologist tests, and examples of tests that are used.

== Neuropsychology ==

Psychological testing in health is mostly done by neuropsychologists in a field called '''neuropsychology'''. Neuropsychology is the study of the brain and how it relates to behavior. The '''neuropsychologist''' uses neuropsychological tests in order to test for dysfunction in the brain that affects behavior. Through these tests, neuropsychologists can identify disorders of the brain and spinal cord for further treatment or for the sake of gaining knowledge. It is also a diverse field which overlaps with the studies of psychological testing, neurology, and psychiatry.

Neuropsychologists study the brain in many different disorders. Some of these include how alcohol affects the functioning of the brain, how the AIDs virus changes brain functioning, problems in memory, the effects of Alzheimer's disease, deficiencies in language, motor and movement problems, malingering, injury or disease of the brain, epilepsy, and learning disabilities such as attention deficit hyperactive disorder.

== Lateralization in the Brain ==
In order to understand neuropsychological tests a basic understanding of the nervous system and brain. The nervous system is made of two parts, the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The '''central nervous''' system consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the '''peripheral nervous''' system is made up of cranial nerves.

The central nervous system is the part of the nervous system that is more important to neuropsychologists, especially the function of the brain. The brain is made up of both neurons and glial cells. One of the characteristics of a normal adult brain is that it is lateralized into the right and left '''hemispheres'''. '''Lateralization''' is the separation of the function of both side of the brain.

In order to study the functions of each hemisphere, neuropsychologists study split-brain patients. '''Split brained patients''' have had the '''corpus callosum''' severed. This area of the brain is the major commisure, or major pathway for communication between the two hemispheres, in the brain. When it is severed, it's as if both sides of the brain operate independently of one another, thus it's like having two separate brains that are specialized for different tasks that can't communicate with one another; however, this lack of communication is short-lived since the brains other '''commisures''' (posterior, anterior, and hippocampal) start to take on additional functioning in order to allow for the hemispheres to communicate.

For example: &quot;[a] patient with a split brain, when shown an image in their left visual field (the left half of what each eye sees), will be unable to say what they have seen. This is because the speech control center is in the left side of the brain in most people and the image from the left visual field is sent only to the right side of the brain. Since the two sides of the brain cannot communicate, the patient can't say what they are seeing. The person can, however, pick up a corresponding object with their left hand, since that hand is controlled by the right side of their brain.&quot; (en.wikipedia.org)

This example of a neuropsychological test in split-brained patients shows how neuropsychologists know that left hemisphere of the brain is dominant for speech. Other generalities is that the left hemisphere works in a sequential manner, it is also dominant for understanding language while the right hemisphere is better at understanding emotional tone of speech. The right hemisphere also works in simultaneous way and is better at spatial tasks. 

Although these generalities in most people, it should be noted that not all people share this same type of lateralization. For example, many left-handers and a few right-handers have language dominance in the right hemisphere instead of in the left.

'''Wernicke and Broca's Areas'''

Two are of the brain that are specialized for language are Wernicke and Broca's Areas. '''Wernicke's Area''' is specialized in the ability to understand spoken language while '''Broca's Area''' is specialized in the ability to speak and use expressive language.

== The Three Areas ==

The brain is organized into three areas. The hindbrain, the midbrain, and the forebrain. The '''hindbrain''' is believed to be the most ancient part of the brain because it controls the most basic functions of life. In addition, it is also the closest area of the brain to the spinal cord or it is the lowest part of the brain. The hindbrain controls breathing, swallowing, vomiting, and blood pressure. It also is used for basic things such as general arousal, consciousness, muscle tone, posture, and hand eye movements. 

The next higher level of the brain is the midbrain. The '''midbrain''' controls head and eye movements, and it is used to localize and follow visual stimuli as well as auditory stimuli. The diagnosis of dysfunction in the midbrain is done by neurologists, those who study the biological function of the brain, because this part of the brain deals with more with cranial nerves.

The last and most advanced area is the forebrain. The '''forebrain''' is composed of six major areas: the pineal body, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and the corpus callosum. The '''pineal body''''s major function is in the secretion of hormones. The second structure, the thalamus, is the area in which all sensory information is sent initially before it is projected to other areas. Next, the '''hypothalamus''' is the area in feeding, sexual behavior, sleeping, temperature regulation, emotional behaviors and movement. While the major role of the '''hippocampus''' is in memory. As for the '''basal ganglia''', it is responsible for motor functions, in fact, damage to this area results in Parkinson's disease. Last, the '''corpus callosum''', as mentioned above, allows both hemispheres to communicate with each other.

== The Lobes ==

The brain is separated into four lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal. The '''frontal lobe''' is responsible for executive functions and motor performance. For example, executive functions are the ability to plan, carry out the plan, organize, and to engage in goal directed behavior.

The '''temporal lobe''' is responsible for auditory information, sensations, long-term memory storage and control of biological drives such as aggression and sexuality. The '''occipital lobe''' is responsible for vision and the '''parietal lobe''' is responsible for sensory skills.

== Testing Tools ==

Neuropsychologists use a series of brain imaging techniques to localize the areas of dysfunction. First, the '''electroencephalograph (EEG)'''. In this electrodes are placed on the skull and the EEG record the electrical activity of the brain. This tool is useful in diagnosing epilepsy because part of epilepsy is abnormal electrical activity which an EEG can measure.

The next imaging technique is '''computerized tomography (CT scan)'''. In this, x-rays are passed through the brain measuring the density it. Because a CT scan can detect density differences it is helpful in identifying any abnormality in density, such as in the presence of cancer or blood clots.

Another technique is '''positron emission tomography (PET scan)'''. In order to perform a PET scan, glucose is injected with a radioactive tracer and then the positrons are measured with the instrument. This works because glucose is permeable to the blood-brain barrier and the radioactive tracer can get into the brain. A PET scan helps to diagnose Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. This is because it can detect differences in glucose metabolism thus differences in brain functioning and structure which are affect by Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

The last technique is the use of '''magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'''. In an MRI, atoms and radio waves scan the brain to determine the structure of the brain. Since this also can detect abnormalities it is useful in finding brain tumors. It also can determine neurological diseases if damage to brain areas can be detected in the MRI.

== Testing Techniques ==

Neuropsychologists use many techniques in order to diagnose psychological disorders. The tests measure sensory input, attention and concentration, learning and memory, language, spatial skills, executive functions, and motor output. These different areas allow the neuropsychologist to determine the area in which the dysfunction exists.

'''Sensory input''' is important because humans need to hear, feel, smell and perceive incoming stimuli accurately to learn and function well. Neuropsychologists measure the senses to see if their is a deficiency or dysfunction. One example of a test is asking a blindfolded subject, after touching one hand, to determine what hand has been touched. This test determines if the sense of touch is operating correctly. In addition, a faint sound could be presented to one ear to test if hearing is working correctly.

'''Attention and concentration''' is the ability to attend to stimuli, sustain attention, shift attention, the ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli and the ability to divide attention to different tasks at the same time. Most attention tasks measure one component of attention. An example of an attention test is the '''continuous performance tests'''. This test measures sustained attention. In it, a person is asked to press a key when a certain letter or shape appears on the computer monitor. This test is used often to diagnose children with ADHD although it is not very reliable.

Another important area is '''learning and memory'''. Learning and memory are connected to each other and it is not meaningful to separate them in tests. Tests measure the various aspects of learning and memory such as short term memory, long term memory, auditory and visual memory, and verbal memory. Examples of tests for learning and memory is the '''Wechsler Memory Scale-3 (WMS-3)'''.

The use and understanding of language is the ability to speak, write and read language. '''Expressive language''' is the ability to speak whereas '''receptive language''' is the ability to understand language. A deficiency in language skills due to brain damage is known as '''aphasia'''. There are two major forms of aphasia, Wernicke's aphasia and Broca's aphasia. '''Wernicke's aphasia''' is deficiencies understanding language and '''Broca's aphasia''' is difficulty producing language. Aphasia's can be determined using an MRI because the MRI will reveal structural damage to the brain.

To test '''executive functioning''' (conceptual reasoning, planning, organization, flexibility in thinking) the '''Wisconsin Card Sorting test''' can be used. In this test, a number of cards which have varying numbers, colors, and shapes are used. The subject is then asked to sort the cards according to different aspects of the cards. This tests for frontal lobe damage.

The last area in which neuropsychologists measure is '''motor output'''. The tests measure both motor speed and accuracy. One test is the '''finger tapping test'''. In this test, subjects are asked to tap their index fingers of both hands as fast as they can in one minute, the number of taps are counter as an indication of motor speed. As for the '''grooved pegboard tests''', subjects are asked to put pegs in holes in a certain time with their left and right hand. The number of pegs put in the pegboard are counted also as an indication of motor speed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Often, after making the decision to keep bees, the hardest task is actually starting. Many questions arise due to the many options for keeping bees. The following is simply a recommended guideline. It is therefore not the only correct path to starting right with bees. It is more important to know the reason behind each step than simply taking it. This way an educated decision can be made based on knowledge, not based simply on because that was what you were told to do.

==Gain Knowledge==
Before becoming involved with live bees, often the best advice is to gain a secondhand experience in some form.
===Read===
Be prepared to read about beekeeping, the more reading you accomplish on the subject, the better informed you will be. There exist a handful of books regarding the subject of beekeeping, which can be found in many libraries and through many booksellers. There also exist many helpful websites and tutorials, including [[Beekeeping| this wikibook]], just remember to take all advice with a grain of salt, as beekeepers are an opinionated group. Only follow books or guidelines that you feel comfortable with.

===Practical Experience===
The best way to gain knowledge on beekeeping is through practical experience. If possible locate a beekeeper in your area that may be willing to guide you along or even mentor you during your newfound interests. 
===Join An Association===
Many regions have [[Beekeeping/Beekeeping Clubs| beekeeping associations or clubs]]. Joining one of these can be a valuable resource. It may even be advised to join some time before you actually intend to keep bees.

==Getting Equipment==
Most beginners to beekeeping start with a standard [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth style hive]], but this is by no means the only option available. It is, however, the advisable path, due to ease of availability and experience of others. It is more than possible to start beekeeping with a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], however that is not the way we shall continue.
===What To Get===
There is a wide range of equipment available to prospective beekeepers. It is advised by most keepers to start with a minimum of two hives and fewer than five. Though you should feel free to expand once you feel comfortable. 
====Hive Parts====
Keep in mind the following list is making the assumption that you will be using a [[Beekeeping/Langstroth Hive| Langstroth style hive]]. The parts on this list will create one complete hive unless otherwise noted.
&lt;br&gt;

*2 [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| Deep Hive Bodies]] to be used as [[Beekeeping/Brood Nests| brood nests]]
*20 [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]] and sheets of [[Beekeeping/Foundation| foundation]] to fit the two deep hive bodies.
*A Minimum of 2 [[Beekeeping/Honey Supers| supers]] for collecting honey.
*20 [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]] and sheets of [[Beekeeping/Foundation| foundation]] to fit the two honey supers.
*A [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducer| Entrance Reducer]]
*A [[Beekeeping/Feeder| Feeder]], often a [[Beekeeping/Hive Top Feeder| hive top feeder]] of a large capacity is recommended, though other designs will work.
*A [[Beekeeping/Inner Cover| Inner Cover]].
*A [[Beekeeping/Telescopic Cover| Telescopic Cover]].
*A [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| Bottom Board]].

====Tools====
*A [[Beekeeping/Smoker| Smoker]]
*A [[Beekeeping/Hive Tool| Hive Tool]], some beekeepers use a large flat head screwdriver or a pocketknife, but a real hive tool is recommended.
*A [[Beekeeping/Bee Brush| Bee Brush]]
====Safety Equipment====
*A [[Beekeeping/Veil| Veil]] for each beekeeper, an extra one is recommended if you ever expect observers.
*A pair of [[Beekeeping/Gloves| Beekeeping Gloves]], this is an optional item but most beginners prefer to use them.

====Other====
*Enough exterior paint or varnishes to properly weather proof the outside of the hive.
====Equipment For Honey Harvesting====
Often it is best to wait before buying honey-harvesting equipment, due to the large investment. It may be possible to borrow equipment from an association or use that of an existing beekeeper.
*A [[Beekeeping/Queen Excluder| Queen Excluder]], some beekeepers choose not to use this device.
*A [[Beekeeping/Bee Escape| Bee Escape]], some beekeepers choose not to use this device.
*An [[Beekeeping/Uncapping Knife| Uncapping Knife]]
*A [[Beekeeping/Honey Extractor| Honey Extractor]]

===New Versus Used===
Buying [[Beekeeping/Buying New Hive Parts| new]] equipment is often safer than [[Beekeeping/Buying Used Hive Parts| used]] hive equipment, as there is no chance of disease or other pests being transferred. It is obviously more expensive too. Some beginning beekeepers choose to [[Beekeeping/Building Hive Parts| build]] their hive parts, where as this process can be fun, it is often more expensive to build a single hive than it would be to buy one new.

==Getting Bees==
Bees should only be obtained after all the hive equipment is acquired and setup. There exist a wide variety of [[Beekeeping/Honey Bee Races| honeybee races]], you should familiarize your self with their specific attributes and see what works best in your area before acquiring any. Once you have selected your desired race you should look at [[Beekeeping/Obtaining Bees| obtaining bees]] that best meet your purpose. It is recommended that a beginner acquire bees either from a [[Beekeeping/Packaged Bees| package of bees]] or from a [[Beekeeping/Nuc| nucleus hive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Objectives ==
* Basic understanding of what I/O psychology is, and what an I/O psychologist does.
* Know the various types of selection tests in I/O psychology.
* Understand the process of validating an employment test.
* Know the legal issues associated with employee selection.

== Industrial and Organization (I/O) Psychology ==

'''Industrial and organization psychology''' is the field of psychology that applies psychological principles to work related issues. I/O psychologists develop tests to predict and measure employee performance.

== Selection Tests ==

There are a variety of '''selection tests'''. They range from unstructured interviews to structured personality tests. The main goal of these tests is to predict job performance. Each test has its own relative strengths and weaknesses in this regard.

A very commonly employed selection test is a '''job interview'''. Job interviews can be structured or unstructured. In an '''unstructured interview''', the interviewer engages in dialogue with the interviewee that does not follow a predetermined format, questions may vary from applicant to applicant, and there is usually no standardized scoring method. Consequently, validitating this technique as a job performance predictor is quite difficult (One applicant may have the opportunity to respond favorably to a question that was not asked of another or vice versa). By contrast, in a '''structured interview''' all applicants are judged on responses to the same questions asked in the same format. Structured interviews provide for more reliable and consistent scoring results.

Another tool used for selection is '''personality testing'''. Many personality tests now employ the five factor model of personality (FFM). These factors are conscientiousness, extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, and openness. A short description of each factor is listed below:

* '''Neuroticism''': a tendency to easily experience unpleasant emotions
* '''Extraversion''': a tendency to seek stimulation and the company of others
* '''Agreeableness''': a tendency to be compassionate rather than antagonistic about others
* '''Conscientiousness''': a tendency to show self-discipline, act dutiful, and aim for achievement and competence
* '''Openness to experience''': a tendency to enjoy new intellectual experiences and ideas

Of all the factors, conscientiousness has been found to positively correlate most with job performance ratings{{Citation needed|date=Jan 2010}}. This factor is higly related to self-discipline, attention to detail, and organization. 

'''Mental ability tests''' measure intelligence and are the best predictor{{Citation needed|date=Jan 2010}} of job performance in all jobs and all organizations. '''Crystalized Intelligence''' relates to the ability of a person to use prior knowledge through learned processes to solve problems. '''Fluid Intelligence''' relates to a person's ability to solve a new problem utilizing novel or unlearned strategies. Employers employ both types of intelligence testing for varying job demands. 

Much like IQ, EQ or '''emotional intelligence''' is used to predict job performance. This information is gained through emotional intelligence testing. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognized and control the emotions of oneself and others. This is a relatively new are being studied for predicting job satisfaction.

The next testing technique is the '''biodata''' technique. Biodata uses personal background information to predict job performance. The type of information is job history, family history, gender, and things of that sort. These factors are then derived empirically instead of theoretically like other selection tests.

An area of selection testing that relates to motor skills are '''psychomotor ability''' tests. These tests measure fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. These skills are important in jobs like carpentry where the worker needs to have control over a hammer to hit a small nail. Unlike psychomotor ability tests, physical ability tests measure gross motor skills, such as lifting and running. These skills are important in jobs like construction where strength is an important aspect.

Another selection test technique is taking a '''work sample''' of an applicant. During a work sample, an applicant completes a realistic job task. These tasks are highly realistic and are supposed to simulate the actual job one is applying for. One example of a work sample is a drivers test. During a drivers test simulates realistic driving. The goal is to assess how well an applicant can perform the tasks, or how well an applicant can learn the task.

Tasks are also performed when an employee or applicant visits an '''assessment centers'''. These centers are used to assess applicants potential for high-level jobs. The testing takes multiple days and is costly to the organization providing the assessment and that is why it is seldom used for jobs other then those of high-level. The assessment consists of a battery of psychological tests. One example of a psychological test given is the '''leaderless group exercise''', where a group is given a task to complete without a leader this task is testing if any of the applicants will take the role of leader, thus showing leadership skills. Another exercise completed at an assessment center is a '''role-playing exercise'''. In these exercises applicants are asked to take a role in a job-related situation in order to study how well the applicants handle the situation. Another example of a psychological test is the '''in-basket exercise'''. In this exercise, applicants have a number of jobs in a &quot;basket&quot; that need to be completed in an allotted time. Each job has requirements in order to complete and they take a certain set amount of time to complete. This tests the organizational ability of applicants, how well applicants work together, leadership, among other things.

Like the role playing task in assessment centers, another selection test is the '''situational judgment test'''. This test is a paper and pencil test where a participant is presented with a hypothetical situation and asked to write what they would do in that situation. 

Unlike hypothetical situations, often, jobs require knowledge of the job. The '''job knowledge test''' is used for that purpose. These tests measure how much knowledge a person has in the field they want to work in. An example of this is the State Medical Board test that needs to be taken before a person can practice medicine in a state. Another example are certification tests, such as the A+ Certification test for people who wish to show they have basic hardware and software computer knowledge.

Often times, people need help making decisions about their career. '''Occupational counselors''' use '''vocational interest tests''' in order to help guide career decisions. These tests measure different occupational interests.

The last type of selection test are '''tests of mental illness'''. These tests measure if a person has a mental illness. However, due to the '''American's with Disabilities Act''' (ADA) they are illegal to give to job applicants. This is because it mental illness is considered a disability, and even if a person has one, it does not mean they cannot perform the job. If they can perform the job, then, in spite of their disability, the ADA protects them. Although, in some jobs mental illness can not be tolerated. This is because these jobs have interest in public welfare. One example of a job which where public welfare is at risk is a job as a police officer.

== Validating Employee Selection Tests ==

In order to use a selection test with confidence it must be validated. This validation process is important because it builds validity and reliability for using the test for a specific job. For example, if a fast food restaurant called Gopher Burger creates a selection test for employees by putting together a series of questions like &quot;What is your favorite color?&quot; it would have no basis for job performance theoretically nor empirically.

In order to establish validity in the select tests first, a '''job analysis''' must be conducted. A job analysis is a study that is used to determine the important tasks and skills needed for a specific job. In our example about Gopher Burger, the test creators would start brain storming about what skills a cook needs in the restaurant, such as manual dexterity for flipping the burgers, keen memory for remembering what goes on the burgers, and speed to make the food quickly.

The next step is to create a rudimentary test from the job analysis. This tests should then be administered to the employees or applicants. Then, predictive and concurrent validation would be calculated. The measures for the validation studies would be gotten from ratings ('''subjective measures''') or objective measures. In Gopher Burger, an example of an '''objective measure''' would be the number of burgers the applicant can make it an hour; whereas, ratings can be gained from a supervisors observation of the applicant.

After the validation studies are complete, the test should be revised until validity and reliability are statistically significant in order to accurately predict job performance from the test.

A '''bain-marie''' is a double-walled [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pot]] with water in between the walls. This construction limits the maximum temperature to the [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] point of water, which is  [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|212°F]] (100°C). Two suitably sized oven-proof pots can function as a bain-marie, provided that the inner pot can be kept from touching the outer pot (except perhaps at the top edge) and can be kept stable enough.

Oven temperature should be 325°F to 350°F (165°C to 175°C). Start the bain-marie with boiling water, instead of waiting for it to get hot in the oven. To prevent [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], use a lid and ensure that the water goes well up the side of the inner pot.

A bain-marie can be used to cook [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]], preventing the outside from crusting before the inside is fully cooked.

A similar device is the [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double-boiler]], which is for use on a normal [[Cookbook:Cooktop|cooktop]].

[[Image:Ocelot.jpg|thumb|left|Ocelot]]
The '''ocelot''' is a beautiful small-to-medium sized cat whose markings resemble the much-larger jaguar.  That beauty once brought them close to extinction, though they have fared better in recent years with legal protection.

== Where do the ocelots live? ==
[[Image:Ocelot range.png|thumb|left|Places where ocelots live are colored green]]

Ocelots mostly live in South and Central America, but there are some as far north as the southernmost reaches of the United States of America.  There are eleven different types (or ''subspecies'') of ocelot. These live in different parts of the south of the Americas.

Three of these eleven subspecies live in Mexico, and a different subspecies lives in each of the Amazon Rainforest, Atlantic Forest, the Northern Andes (Venezuela and Guyana) and all other countries of South America, Argentina, Colombia, Brazil (the biggest area on the map), Bolivia, Ecuador and Paraguay.
  
Ocelots are excellent climbers, but they do most of their hunting on the ground.  Ocelots mostly come out at night. During the day they sleep in trees, bushes and thick grasses. Some ocelots live alone, while others have been reported to live in pairs, maintaining contact by mewing to each other.

==What do ocelots look like?==
[[Image:Ocelot_at_Zoo.jpg|thumb|right|An Ocelot at the Marwell Zoo]]
Ocelots grow up to 3 feet and 2 inches (100 cm) in length, plus a foot and a half (45 cm) tail length. It is similar in appearance to the oncilla and the margay, who inhabit the same region, but the ocelot is larger.  Their fur is gold with black spots.  They are very thin, have huge teeth, and can jump quite far. Ocelots have long spots.

==What do ocelots eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all of the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is. Scientists think that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (''prey'') by smell, sniffing for where they've been on the ground. They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and move very stealthily, too. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings then pouncing on their prey.

==Fun facts==
* ''Ocelot'' comes from the Aztec word ''tlalocelot'' which means &quot;field tiger.&quot;
* Ocelots have only 36 pairs of chromosomes while most other cats have 38.  Their close relatives the margay and oncilla are the others to share this distinction.
* Ocelots often sit perfectly still for a half hour or more waiting for unsuspecting prey.
* Some observers believe that ocelots remain faithful to their chosen mates.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#ffeedd; font-size:90%; padding:4px&quot;&gt;
'''How to catch an ocelot?'''

Scientists at the Dallas Zoo in Texas, including Jennifer Fontana Cooke and Suzy Steele, first discovered that ocelots were attracted to Obsession for Men cologne by Calvin Klein in 1999. In south Texas, researchers were having a hard time finding the few ocelots that lived in the area.  They tried using all kinds of animal smells but the ocelots would never show up. So, now Obsession for Men cologne is used in the wild to attract and survey ocelot populations. They are now trying to use the cologne to help in their project to raise the number of ocelots. 
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
[[Image:Serval.jpg|thumb|right|A Serval]]

The '''serval''' is a little-known but fascinating creature, a lightweight cat living in tall grass where the lions hunt gazelles and buffalo.  It does not attempt to compete with the mighty &quot;king of beasts&quot;, content to tackle smaller prey.  Gliding along on stilt-like limbs, with a long neck and large ears, the serval looks like no other cat, and for a reason...  From the tall grass a startled flock of birds takes flight only to be chased in the air.  With a spring of its powerful limbs, a serval shoots straight up, battering one of the birds back to earth with its long front limbs.

== Where do servals live? ==
[[Image:serval range.png|thumb|left|Places where servals live are colored green.]]
Servals live in the ''savannahs'' (grasslands) of Africa.  This allows them to see both their prey and their predators.  As a medium sized cat they have to be wary of lions and hyenas.  Servals are good swimmers, and often live near open water where they can take an occasional dip to hunt for fish or swipe at the birds that stop by.

==What do servals look like?==
[[Image:Serval in Tanzania.jpg|thumb|right|The serval is built for tall grass]]
The serval's lanky body gives them the most advantage for their bulk in coping with the tall grass where they roam. It gives them the appearance of being larger than they really are. In fact, the smaller female ranges from less than twenty pounds up to about thirty-five pounds. Males generally weigh thirty to fifty pounds. Their large ears give them an advantage in hearing their prey before it hears them. Their fur is yellow with black spots. On the back of the ears are horizontal gray bars. Servals use the position of their ears to communicate with each other. They also hiss a great deal, but this sound can have friendly meanings too. People often think a captive raised serval is being aggressive that is only trying to say hello.

==What do servals eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Servals usually eat birds, fish and small rodents.  
When hunting a bird, the serval will jump up in the air and bat the bird with its front paws.  This stuns the bird and makes it fall to the ground.  When hunting rodents, the serval uses its large ears to listen for them under the ground.  It then jumps straight up into the air six feet or higher, and comes straight down on its prey.  Like most cats, a serval will take advantage of other opportunities that come along, taking on anything it feels it can safely subdue.  However a serval never poses a threat to humans.

==Fun facts==
* Servals can jump up to 10 feet straight up to catch birds.
* Their hearing is so acute they can hear burrowing rodents underground and dig them up.
* A cross between a male serval and a female domestic cat is called a savannah cat.
* The mother will chase her male offspring away as soon as they can hunt, at about 8 to 10 months of age, but will let females stay with her for a little longer, up to a year.

These little confections are great one-per-afternoon snacks. These badboys are dense and will give you a euphoric high on sweets but make you want to go work out after.

==Ingredients==

*1 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb.]] (450g) [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Eggs|eggs]]
*3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (180g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*semi-sweet [[cookbook:chocolate chips|chocolate chips]]

==Equipment==
*cupcake papers
*[[Cookbook:Cupcake Pan|cupcake pan]]
*[[cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave oven]]
*[[Cookbook:Oven|oven]]
*[[cookbook:Mixing bowl|mixing bowl]]
*[[cookbook:Double boiler|double boiler]] (optional)

==Procedure==

#Preheat your [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|350°F]] (180°C).
#Soften the cream cheese in the [[Cookbook:Microwave Oven|microwave]] in a bowl. Thirty seconds on a medium setting should be sufficient.
#Combine the cream cheese, eggs, and sugar.
#Line the pan with the papers.
#Put chocolate chips in the bottom of the cupcake papers - less than a full layer; do not completely cover the bottom of the papers.
#Fill the cups with the mixture, then place into the oven.
#[[cookbook:Bake|Bake]] for about 15 minutes. The chocolate will melt and create a bottom to your cakes, but part of that chocolate will also bubble up through the cream cheese for an added effect.
#Remove and allow to cool for 20 minutes, until the chocolate hardens on the bottom and becomes crunchy.

You can also garnish the top of the cakes with chocolate that you melt in a [[cookbook:double boiler|double boiler]]. I added a dollop of chocolate little larger than a quarter on the top.

* [http://www.surveymonkey.com Survey Monkey] is a tool (both free and paid versions) for creating online surveys.


== Rich Internet Applications ==

According to the Wikipedia entry &quot;[[wikipedia:Rich Internet Application|Rich Internet Application]],&quot;

 Rich Internet Applications (RIA) are a cross between
 web applications and traditional desktop applications,
 transferring some of the processing to the client end.

[[w:Macromedia|Macromedia]], the software company which makes, among other programs, Flash and Dreamweaver, is credited with introducing this term in a 2002 whitepaper.

In the context of ATALL, RIAs represent a set of technologies that materials designers (be they practicing classroom teachers, resesarchers, or learners) can use to create ATALL-enabling on-line environments. This section of the ATALL Wikibook will present a specific set of technologies which may be used to support solitary and collaborative ATALL and research into ATALL.

=== Relevant Technologies ===
==== Flash MX 2004 ====
Flash MX 2004 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Macromedia Flash|Flash]]&quot;) is an authoring program which allows users to create applications (often called &quot;movies&quot; in the Flash literature) with varied user interfaces ([[w:User interface|UI]]), featuring still and animated graphics as well as audio elements. It features drawing tools (e.g. lines, boxes, ovals, shading, paint brushes), an [[w:Animation|animation]] timeline, and a programming language, [[w:ActionScript|ActionScript]] (version 2.0), which is based on the proposed standard for version 1.5 of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]]. Applications authored with Flash are exported as Shockwave files (with .[[w:SWF|swf]] extension), which may then be run by the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in or a stand-alone player.

GUI resources include...
*text fields (both plain text and HTML)
*buttons
*movie clips
*audio and video display and capture objects
*custom mouse pointers
*pull-down menus

=====Example GUI Designs=====
'''Text Chat''': A collaborative application (see discussion of Flash Communication Server) may be easily authored using a multi-line text field (for display of the transcript), a single-line text field (for entry of messages), and a button (for sending a new message entered in the single-line text field).

'''Total Physical Response ([[W:Total_Physical_Response|TPR]]) Tasks''': A solitary activity might use a collection of so-called &quot;[[w:Drag-and-drop|drag-and-drop]]&quot; movie clips as items to be manipulated in response to text and/or audio prompts. Feedback would be provided when each item is moved to the proper location. For example, a learner might hear &quot;Place the table to the left of the chair.&quot; Placing the table anywhere except to the left of the chair would result in the application informing the user that the table had been misplaced.

'''Asynchronous Audio/Video [[W:email|Electronic mail]]''': Flash's audio and/or video capturing functions make it possible for learners to save their speech for later listening and viewing by a partner.

==== Flash Communication Server ====
Flash Communication Server 1.5 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Flash Communication Server|FlashComm]]&quot;) provides real-time audio, video, and data exchange between connected applications running in the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in from Macromedia. FlashComm servers may also interact with other FlashComm or [[w:Web server|web servers]] (e.g., the [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache server]]) in order to access dynamically generated data via a [[w:Scripting programming language|scripting language]] such as [[w:PHP|PHP]], [[w:Perl|Perl]], or [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]]. Such interaction is frequently used to retrieve, add, or update information to a database (e.g., [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] or [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]]). Though this scripting and database interaction is also available to SWF files running in the Flash Player, routing the interactions through FlashComm may be preferable when the results of each interaction should update all clients or when extra layers of security are desired.

==== PHP ====
One of the possible readings of &quot;P&quot; in &quot;[[w:LAMP|LAMP]]&quot; (the first three letters standing for &quot;Linux,&quot; &quot;Apache,&quot; and &quot;MySQL&quot;), [[w:PHP|PHP]] is a scripting language that features a broad variety of capabilities such as text searching, database connections, file management, and HTML form processing (via [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]). In general, the LAMP suite of software is popular because it is free for anyone wishing to set up their own web hosting, and it allows web hosting companies to offer very cheap (under six U.S. dollars per month) web hosting. As noted in in the Wikipedia entry for the LAMP acronym, &quot;Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, runs software that can be characterized as a LAMP application. Wikipedia's MediaWiki software is developed primarily under Linux, using the Apache HTTP Server, with its content being stored in a MySQL database, and the program logic being implemented in PHP.&quot;

===== AMFPHP =====
One particular technology built with PHP, AMFPHP (available for free at http://www.amfphp.org), is especially useful for RIA-enabled ATALL. This collection of scripts decodes and encodes Macromedia's '''A'''ction '''M'''essage '''F'''ormat ([[w:AMF|AMF]], a data format that allows for the exchange of almost every type of data object defined in ActionScript such as numeric and string variables as well as custom objects. In contrast to extensible markup language ([[w:XML|XML]]), also used to exchange a wide variety of data types, AMF is designed so that information may be transmitted quickly. An immediate benefit of this format is the time saved by not having to program conversions of the applications data into XML for transmission as well as conversion of XML from a server back into an application's data structures.

One of the most important reasons for using an implementation of AMF is the availability of AMF-compatible scripts libraries for the free scripting languages [[w:Perl|Perl]] and [[w:Python programming language|Python]] (the other possible readings of the &quot;P&quot; in the LAMP acronym) in addition to the native support for the format in Macromedia's proprietary [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]] scripting language. This almost guarantees that the particular model in which an RIA is deployed may be changed (e.g., using Perl and PostgreSQL instead of PHP and MySQL) with minimal alteration of the Flash and/or FlashComm code.

==== MySQL ====
A free (for non-commercial use) database server, MySQL (or any other database) is primarily responsible for making Internet applications rich. The long-term, centralized, and rapidly searchable storage provided by a database enables an application to minimize, if not completely eliminate, the data it must contain within itself each time it is loaded. Once loaded and running in the Flash Player, for example, an application can request only those data sets which are needed at a given point in a user's interactions with the system. Free web-based utility applications such as [[w:PhpMyAdmin|PhpMyAdmin]], installed with most scripting- and database-enabled hosting services, make modifying, archiving, and moving database entries easy for most moderately skilled users, thereby insuring data integrity and security.

=== Use of These Technologies ===
Because PHP communicates easily with Flash Player applications and with FlashComm via multiple connection methods (e.g., AMFPHP), these connections allow PHP to return information retrieved from a database (e.g., MySQL). This functionality may be used for a variety of ATALL-related purposes such as...
*presenting pre-prepared texts to users
*logging user behavior (e.g., quiz results or text from chat sessions)
*tracking user behavior over time
*matching users by common interests, languages, skill levels, etc.

*Anneberg video on for foreign language learning and teaching:
**The U.S. Senate has designated 2005 The Year of Languages, recognizing
an initiative of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign
Languages (ACTFL). The goal of this effort is to encourage Americans to
develop proficiency in languages other than English. Annenberg Media can
help with this effort through our foreign language series, &quot;Destinos: An
Introduction to Spanish&quot;
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/destinos2.html&gt;, &quot;French in Action&quot;
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/french3.html&gt;, and &quot;Fokus Deutsch&quot;
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/deutsch4.html&gt; -- all currently
airing on the Channel. Click on &quot;Broadcast Dates&quot; for the schedules.
The Year of Languages focus for October is early language learning. Our
&quot;Teaching Foreign Languages&quot; video library
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/tfl_lib5.html&gt; (Web site
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/tfl_lib6.html&gt;) is an excellent
resource for building teaching strategies. Also see our related
&quot;Teaching Foreign Languages&quot; workshop series
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/tfl_ws7.html&gt; (Web site
&lt;http://learner.org/redirect/october/tfl_ws8.html&gt;), particularly
Workshop 5, &quot;Subjects Matter,&quot; which looks at ways in which language
acquisition can be promoted through subjects across the curriculum, such
as geography, life science, math, and language arts.
For general background on the psychology of language acquisition, you
may be interested in &quot;Language Development,&quot; Program 6 of our series

*Intervention [[Technology as Intervention Strategies]]

This is an interactive series of activities and games that teachers using McMillan Treasures Curriculum in elementary grades for language arts can access via the Internet.  Students can try at home or they can interact with the website in the classroom during center time if the capabilities of computers will allow it.  These activities are related with the story, vocabulary, and grammar that the students are studying in class.   
http://activities.macmillanmh.com/reading/treasures/

*Resources for Interventions
1. Just as important to identify the student's learning style is to identify the stages of language acquisition in the second language.  Here is a great resource link to better understand the stage of language acquisition. 
http://www.everythingesl.net/inservices/language_stages.php

2. Once the teacher is able to identify the best combination of learning styles to implement in the classroom, the stage of language development needs to be identified.  Then a series of interventions and strategies are implemented, here is a good resource link on issues of identification and intervention methods.   
http://web.archive.org/web/20050516174907/http://www.crosscultured.com/articles/accult_cogn_handouts.pdf

3. What to do when you have an ESL\ELL student with special needs?  Here is link to a great article on this matter and it is a source for great strategies to implement in the classroom. 
http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0108ortiz.html

'''Nastar''', or '''tananas''', are [[Cookbook:pineapple|pineapple]] jam filled cookies. These are popular treats for Eid ul-Fitr and Christmas celebrations in Indonesia.

==Ingredients==
===Cookie===
* 0.5 kg [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]
* 0.5 kg all-purpose [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
* 6 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] yolks
* 2 egg yolks, for painting the top of the cookies
* 1 ounce [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 5 gr [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]] powder
* 1 ounce Gouda [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] grated, or Cheddar as substitute
* 0.5 ounce [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]] for garnish

===Jam===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapples]]
* 300 gr [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] 
* 1 [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] stick

==Procedure==
===Jam===
# Peel pineapple, wash and make pineapple [[Cookbook:Purée|purée]]
# Put pineapple purée in a pan, add sugar and cinnamon, cook while mixing in medium fire until set
# If the jam still tastes sour, add more sugar to taste
# Let it cool, pineapple jam has to be thick enough to roll into small marbles

===Dough===
# Batter 6 egg yolks with margarine and sugar
# Add grated cheese to mix
# Add flour and vanilla little by little to make dough

===Cookie===
# Roll the dough smaller than golf ball, fill with pineapple jam
# Cut raisin into two, put it on top
# Paint the cookie with egg yolk
# Use [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheet]], bake in oven (30 minutes) until golden yellow.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Operator redirects to Special and Special refers to operator. I think we should give preminence to operators and redirect Special pages to their correspondent operator page. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:07, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: actualy I was moving the other way and the reason are the keywords. All operator pages which are also keywords redirect to the keyword page. So for the reason of symetry I also changed all operator pages which a are special characters to the page of that character - I must have overlooked '/' --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 06:53, 1 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Are really **, /= etc. special characters? I mean, they are operators compounded from two special characters, but not a special character per se. I think we should not write special character pages, or at least make it consistent with those of keywords. For example:

Programming:Ada:Special:*

This special character is used in the [[Programming:Ada:Operators:*|multiplication operator (*)]] and the [[Programming:Ada:Operators:**|exponentiation operator (**)]].

Programming:Ada:Special:-

This special character is used to define comments (--), and as [[Programming:Ada:Operators:-|minus unary and binary operator (-)]].

According to the [http://www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-2-2.html RM], we are saying special character when we should say delimiter (not all special characters are delimiters, and some delimiters are compounded of more than one special characters). [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:30, 30 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Well, this is a tutorial so we should keep it simple. Also moving i.E. - and -- together will make bad linking in source code examples. So I think the compound delimiters need there own pages. Prehaps we should better explain the different groups. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 07:15, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

:: What do you think about following the current structure but renaming Special pages to Programming:Ada:Delimiter, e.g. Programming:Ada:Delimiter:** Programming:Ada:Delimiter:*? That would be a minimal change and would be in line with RM terminology. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:59, 1 May 2005 (UTC)

::: Shure, that's a good idea. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 05:18, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

::::There are, however, two used special characters that are not delimiters - they are # and &quot;. I think it is not necessary to write a page   for them, since their usage should be described in Integers and Strings pages. For the unused special characters, there is nothing to say beyond that they are unused. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:58, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</text>

&lt;big&gt;&lt;center&gt;''Voting is now officially over.  Vote for the July 2005 collaboration [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month/July 2005 voting|here]].&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/big&gt;''

==Voting rules==
The following are the rules and conditions for voting for the [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month|Collaboration of the Month]]:

#'''Only registered users with 20 or more edits to their name may vote.'''
#You may vote under as many nominations as you wish, however, you may only vote for each book itself once.  
#Sign your vote with a number sign and four tildes, &lt;nowiki&gt;#~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;,  after the most previous vote under the book's nomination. Unsigned votes will be removed.  
#Any nomination which receives 3 or more votes in one month will automatically be renominated the next month if it is not chosen.
#If you wish to include a short comment for your vote, then you may do so. Make sure that if you leave such a comment, that you are also voting for that page.  
#Do not post objection votes as these will have no effect on the final tally.  
#Voting will end at 00:00 UTC on the first day of each month. In essence, when a new month begins voting ends. Any votes added after this time will be discarded.
#The nomination with most votes will be chosen as the [[Collaboration of the Month]]. In case of a tie, the older Wikibook will be chosen.

Comments:

I would like to get some information about how much stuff is still being developed by the main FHSST group and what actual on-line colaboration can be done by users here with the WikiBooks community.  It seems as though this book should actually be a part of WikiSource instead, but I'm not sure.  The main page is encouraging people to join their group if you want to contribute, and not add content to the WikiBook side.  Is that correct?   If this is something that will be encouraged to be edited by the Wikibook community as a fork of what the FHSST group is doing, I wouldn't mind participating.  If not, then this nomination should be removed as it is not the nature of this Wikibook to get collaboration in this manner.
[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:03, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

&lt;b&gt;Response to Rob&lt;/b&gt;:
Hi Rob - you are partly right but as always things are more complicated than they seem. We (FHSST) are dedicated to
WikiBooks - its a great idea and I support the idea fully. A couple of points that have led to the current situation:

* we started (Oct 2002) before WikiBooks (mid 2003) existed so we had to come up with a collaborative solution
* we have a lot of content that isn't in wiki format - [http://www.nongnu.org/fhsst FHSST].
* the new syllabus in South Africa comes into force in 2006 so we have a deadline
* we spent many hours moving the Physics book onto WikiBooks (hours not developing content)
* we will move Maths and Chemistry over as well but we decided that we would benefit more from developing content right now 

Regarding our commitment to WikiBooks:
* we recently (this month) started two new books which we want to develop &lt;b&gt;solely&lt;/b&gt; on WikiBooks (Biology, Computer Literacy) and &lt;b&gt;any other books we start from now&lt;/b&gt; on will be done on WikiBooks
* we only ask people to join our external project because we have mailing lists where there is active discussion regarding the syllabus, structure and how we'll print books etc. so that efforts are coordinated and coherent
* we know from experience that if you have a specific objective (proper syllabus) you had better coordinate contributions

We don't insist that people join our project if they are going to contribute but encourage it because it helps us coordinate and write a book which meets a specific syllabus - quote from the Physics book: 
&lt;small&gt;&quot;Please consider joining the mainstream development group of FHSST to help get this text complete as fast as possible. We really want to provide a complete set of high school science texts that are freely available as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/small&gt; We are happy for anybody to add whatever they want to the Physics book on WikiBooks but what would really make a difference is the Optics and Heat and Properties of Matter  chapters as this would help us finish the book off.

Other books on WikiBooks that are developed by random volunteers suffer from a lack of cohesion and coordination. Talk pages and some vague guidelines haven't been able to streamline contributions and most books are developing incredibly slowly. The ones that are quite advanced tend to have been written by a single person (Botany, Cell Biology for example - not really the point of WikiBooks). We have also found that older volunteers who have been interested in helping have really struggled with the technology of contributing. Explaining what a wiki is to them is difficult (its easier than when we were using CVS for sure!). So its easier to work with them via email.

There is one issue that is never addressed on WikiBooks that I have seen - if we developed a book for the South African syllabus on WikiBooks and finished it, if you came back a month later you'd find that all the spelling would have been changed to American English and other such things. People (obviously with the best intentions) have already started &quot;fixing spelling mistakes&quot; in the Physics book. So WikiBooks as I see it will always just be a place for developing content and so the Physics book is there for the random volunteers who might add something useful to our cause or not. Ultimately a fixed edition will have to made available somewhere or tagged somehow, I haven't looked into this yet.

Everything we write will be given to the WikiBooks community to develop further or use to develop other books but right now its difficult because we need specific things to produce a printed text in South Africa.

I hope that something that I have written makes sense, I am very happy to continue discussing things and I am also keen on finding the best way to develop content. We have more books still to start. 

Basically how do you best get people to work together in a coordinated and coherent manner?

*A book of the month is not the same as a featured article on Wikipedia- the US History book found itself only 75% done- this book is good but needs some editing that I feel a month or so could fix.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control Structures ==
=== Conditional Branches ===

Ruby can control the execution of code using Conditional branches. A conditional Branch takes the result of a test [[Ruby Programming/Syntax/Lexicology#Expressions|expression]] and executes a block of code depending whether the test expression is true or false. If the test expression evaluates to the constant &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;, the test is false; otherwise, it is true.  Note that the number &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt; is considered true, whereas many other programming languages consider it false.

In many popular programming languages, conditional branches are statements.  They can affect which code is executed, but they do not result in values themselves.  In Ruby, however, conditional branches are expressions.  They evaluate to values, just like other expressions do.  An &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression, for example, not only determines whether a subordinate block of code will execute, but also results in a value itself.  If no block is executed, the if expression results in nil. For instance, the following &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression evaluates to 3:

  if true
    3
  end

Ruby's conditional branches are explained below.

==== if expression ====

Examples:

  a = 5
  if a == 4
    a = 7
  end
  print a # prints 5 since the if-block isn't executed

You can also put the test expression and code block on the same line if you use &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt;:
  if a == 4 then a = 7 end
  #or
  if a == 4: a = 7 end
  #Note that the &quot;:&quot; syntax for if one line blocks do not work anymore in ruby 1.9. Ternary statements still work

This is equal to:

  a = 5
  a = 7 if a == 4
  print a # prints 5 since the if-block isn't executed

==== unless expression ====

The unless-expression is the opposite of the if-expression, the code-block it contains will only be executed if the test expression is false.

Examples:

  a = 5
  unless a == 4
    a = 7
  end
  print a # prints 7 since the unless-block is executed

The ''unless'' expression is almost exactly like a negated ''if'' expression:
  if !expression # is equal to using unless expression

The difference is that the ''unless'' does not permit a following ''elsif''.  And there is no ''elsunless''.

Like the if-expression you can also write:

  a = 5
  a = 7 unless a == 4
  print a # prints 7 since the unless-block is executed

The &quot;one-liners&quot; are handy when the code executed in the block is one line only.

==== if-elsif-else expression ====

The elsif (note that it's &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;elseif&lt;/code&gt;) and else blocks give you further control of your scripts by providing the option to accommodate additional tests.
The &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; blocks are considered only if the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; test is false.  You can have any number of &lt;code&gt;elsif&lt;/code&gt; blocks but only one &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and one &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block.

Syntax:
  if expression
    ...code block...
  elsif another expression
    ...code block...
  elsif another expression
    ...code block...
  else
    ...code block...
  end

==== short-if expression (aka ternary operator) ====

The &quot;short-if&quot; statement provides you with a space-saving way of evaluating an expression and returning a value. 

The format is: 

  result = (condition) ? (expression-if-true) : (expression-if-false)

It is also known as the ternary operator and it is suggested to only use this syntax for minor tasks, such as string formatting, because of poor code readability that may result.

  irb(main):037:0&gt; true ? 't' : 'f'
  =&gt; &quot;t&quot;
  irb(main):038:0&gt; false ? 't' : 'f'
  =&gt; &quot;f&quot;

This is very useful when doing string concatenation among other things. 

Example:
  a = 5
  plus_or_minus = '+'
  print &quot;The number #{a}#{plus_or_minus}1 is: #{plus_or_minus == '+' ? (a+1).to_s : (a-1).to_s}.&quot;

Also, this can be written as:

  result = if condition then expression-1 else expression-2 end

Assignments can be made as:

  result = (value-1 if expression-1) || (value-2 if expression-2)

==== case expression ====
An alternative to the if-elsif-else expression (above) is the case expression.  Case in Ruby supports a number of syntaxes.  For example, suppose we want to determine the relationship of a number (given by the variable a) to 5.  We could say:

  a = 1
  case 
  when a &lt; 5 then puts &quot;#{a} is less than 5&quot;    
  when a == 5 then puts &quot;#{a} equals 5&quot;   
  when a &gt; 5 then puts &quot;#{a} is greater than 5&quot; 
  end

Note that, as with if, the comparison operator is ==.  The assignment operator is =.  Though Ruby will accept the assignment operator:

    when a = 5 then puts &quot;#{a} equals 5&quot;   # WARNING! This code CHANGES the value of a!

this is not what we want!  Here, we want the comparison operator.

A more concise syntax for case is to imply the comparison:

  case a
  when 0..4 then puts &quot;#{a} is less than 5&quot;    
  when 5 then puts &quot;#{a} equals 5&quot; 
  when 5..10 then puts &quot;#{a} is greater than 5&quot; 
  else puts &quot;unexpected value #{a} &quot;         # Just in case &quot;a&quot; is bigger than 10 or negative.
  end

Note: because the ranges are explicitly stated, it is a good coding practice to handle unexpected values of a.  This concise syntax is perhaps most useful when we know in advance what values to expect.  For example:

  a = &quot;apple&quot;
  case a
  when &quot;vanilla&quot; then &quot;a spice&quot;    
  when  &quot;spinach&quot; then &quot;a vegetable&quot; 
  when &quot;apple&quot; then &quot;a fruit&quot; 
  else &quot;an unexpected value&quot;
  end

If entered into IRB this gives:

  =&gt; &quot;a fruit&quot;

Other ways to use case and variations on its syntax may be seen at Linuxtopia Ruby Programming [http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/ruby_tutorial/Ruby_Expressions_Case_Expressions.html]

=== Loops ===

==== while ====
The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement in Ruby is very similar to &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and to other languages' &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; (syntactically):
 while &lt;expression&gt;
   &lt;...code block...&gt;
 end

The code block will be executed again and again, as long as the expression evaluates to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.

Also, like &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unless&lt;/code&gt;, the following is possible:
 &lt;...code...&gt; while &lt;expression&gt;

Note the following strange case works...
  line = readline.chomp while line != &quot;what I'm looking for&quot;

So if local variable &lt;code&gt;line&lt;/code&gt; has no existence prior to this line, on seeing it for the first time it has the value &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; when the loop expression is first evaluated.

==== until ====
The &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; statement is similar to the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement in functionality. Unlike the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement, the code block for the &lt;code&gt;until&lt;/code&gt; loop will execute as long as the expression evaluates to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;.
 until &lt;expression&gt;
   &lt;...code block...&gt;
 end

=== Keywords ===

==== return ====

&lt;code&gt; return value &lt;/code&gt; causes the method in which it appears to exit at that point and return the value specified

Note that if no return of a value is specified in a method the value of the last value set is implicitly returned as the return value of the method.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hobbyist beekeeping does not fit one specific definition, though hobbyists tend to have many things in common. Essentially, those who keep bees as a hobby have a different day job, and simply find beekeeping or its related practices enjoyable.
Rarely do hobbyists keep as substantial number of colonies, often just enough to keep at home in the backyard or within a few minutes drive. Similarly to those who [[Beekeeping/Sideline Beekeeping| sideline]] in beekeeping, a hobbyist may sell products as result to beekeeping, but they rarely earn much more than the price to maintain their bees.

==Reasons To Keep Bees As a Hobby==
There are many reasons as to why a person may decide to pickup the task of hobby beekeeping. There are likely as many reasons as there are beekeepers. Either way, beekeeping as a hobby is a scarcity in today’s modern world, and generally only benefits are gained when one peruses such a task.
===The Joy of Honey===
[[Image:runny hunny.jpg|thumb|Honey]]
Often the number one reason people pickup beekeeping as a hobby is because of the potential to produce [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]]. Honey was one of the earliest, and remains one of the sweetest, commodities available to man. Because of the recent desire for a do-it-yourself attitude, many people have decided to make a step towards producing such a sweet reward within their own backyard.
===Pollination===
A second most popular reason to keep bees as a hobby is pollination. Many beekeepers also keep gardens. The simple act of keeping bees often enhances fruit and vegetable production because of all the pollination that the bees achieve.

===Entertainment===
Watching bees can be fun. A colony of bees, when observed form the outside, or even from the inside if you're lucky enough to have an [[Beekeeping/Observation Hive| observation hive]], holds the same kind of draw as watching an ant farm.
===Education===
Some times beekeepers start keeping bees as a project for a science fair, for the 4H club or other similar organization; this educational experience often evolves into beekeeping as a hobby. Many things can be learned from bees; in fact many things are still being learned. 
Those who enjoy the complex inter-workings of the world around them may find beekeeping to be an exceptionally educational experience.
===Stress Relief===
Some beekeepers keep their bees to take their mind off other things. Some even say that simply sitting down and watching the comings and goings of a hive is an extremely relaxing experience. Some have even been known to simply spend the entire afternoon observing the activities going on outside a single hive.

===Gifts===
Beekeepers often have access to goods and supplies, thanks to their bees, that many others do not. Because of this, a beekeeper is able to assemble wonderful gifts to give away during the holidays or for birthdays. These gifts may include various forms of honey, home made candles, cosmetics and such.

===Animal Husbandry===
Many people keep pets, whereas bees cannot be domesticated, the companionship is still often appreciated. Many hobbyist build a bond between themselves and their literally thousands of bees. This can make beekeeping a joyful experience when done right. 
===Healthy Life Style===
Some hobby beekeepers keep bees for their own health. Some keepers collect [[Beekeeping/Pollen| pollen]] to supplement their diet, [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] to make home medication and eat a diet with local [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]] to lower the effects of allergies. Though many of these processes have not been scientifically proven to be effective, beekeepers who practice them often swear by them.

==Related Hobbies==
Though beekeeping may seem innocent enough on its own, it can often lead to other related hobbies such as the following.
*Baking and [[Beekeeping/Food Recipes| Cooking]]
*[[Beekeeping/Candle Making| Candle Making]]
*Gardening
*Home [[Beekeeping/Cosmetic Formulas| cosmetics]] making
*Mentoring and Educating
*Retailing hive products
*Soap Making
*Wine and [[Beekeeping/Mead| Mead]] making
*[[Beekeeping/Building Hive Parts| Wood Working]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Software Application Management Overview =

Computer applications are created by human for Computers. This human and computer interaction can be abstracted
into following steps.

* Design the software for computers.
* Build the software on computers.
* Package the software for all kind of computers.
* Install/Remove the software from computers.

Last three activities can be divided into more detail steps as follows

* Software build process(SB):
** unpack source files
** patch source code
** configure source file for a particular OS
** compile souce codes to generate binary and documentation
** test the compiled binary if need to
** install the binaries into installation path
** uninstall the binaries

* Package build (PB) process is much straight forward:
** prepare the scripts to take care of preinstall, postinstall, preremove and postremove required actions.
** prepare initilization  script to start/stop application service 
** call up local PMS to pack the binary,documentation and scripts into local PMS format.

* Package Management (PKGUTIL) Process:
** upload and administrate packages on package depot server.
** install 
** remove
** upgrade/patch
** auto installation upon package dependence.

==  Acronyms: CPAD, CPAM, PMS, HPMS and TWW ==
&quot;The Written Words&quot; is to describe the cross-platofrm application developement and management activities performed by System administrators. &quot;The Written Words&quot; is an attempt to write down tasks performed into XML language. 

To provide a generic naming to describe activities, following acronyms are defined for easy reference. Also
this will leave room for other packaging methods like openpkg or Portage in gentoo.

* '''CPAD:''' '''C'''ross-'''P'''laform '''A'''pplication '''D'''evelopment, a solution to enable software application developement easily for man-made,incompatible and variated operating systems. X windows, Java,OpenStep and GNUstep are examples of solutions.

* '''CPAM:''' '''C'''ross-'''P'''latform '''A'''pplication '''M'''anagement, a solution to enable easy and consistent application management. TWW's HPMS is one of the solutions.

* '''HPMS:''' '''H'''brid '''P'''ackage '''M'''anagement '''S'''ystem. A wrapper solution that work with PMS to shield package developer from incompatible local PMS. It will allow package developer to consistently create and maintain software packages without knowing the details of each PMS when they don't need to.

* '''PMS:''' '''P'''ackage '''M'''anagement '''S'''ystem. A software system designed to create,build,install,remove and upgrade software in a packed format. Examples: RPM,dpkg,inst,lpp,portage,Installsield,HP SD-UX.

* '''PMS format:''' PMS Package Format. A file or directory to include a group of compiled binaries ,documenation or script file. This file is usually in compressed form and called as software package. With this work being done, a software package can be better maintained. Example formats:rpm,msi,ipk,pkgadd,depot and GNUstep's .app.

* '''TWW:''' '''T'''he '''W'''ritten '''W'''ord of wisdom to guide you through the maze of getting an open source software built and packaged. Better yet, the words are digitalized into a xml file that can be play back and repeated by others. 

* [http://www.thewrittenword.com '''TWW Inc:''']A company specialize in open source building and packaging to make opensource easier to use across different OS platforms.

== What is Package Management System ? ==
* Every modern OS come with a PMS(Package Management System). Because we went through the pains of not having one during the age of DOS. Adding software binaries into an OS without systematic packaging is proven to be not manageable.

Following ASCI diagram depict some OS and their PMS relationship. 
&lt;pre&gt;
       |--------------------------------------------|
       |Software|Software   | Software  |  Software |
       |--------------------------------------------|
PMS    |  RPM   |  PKGADD   |   MSI     | SD-UX     |
       ---------------------------------------------|
       | Linux  | Solaris   | Windows   | HP-UX     |
OS     |        |           |           |           |
       --------  ----------   -----------  ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What is Hybrid Package Management System ? ==
* Like hybrid car, it is hard to throw away old technology(burning gas in engine) and use new one(battery for electric motor) directly, Existing installed OS need a less intrusive, hybrid package management system to help us transit to new technology.
* To achieve best compatibility with existing deployed machines in an IT or Home computer environment, We need to create packages using native PMS as much as possible and use different installation path. Undo or removing existing application installation effort is usually cost prohibitive. The Written Word Inc. design and implement their HPMS for commercial open-source support. The tools can be used to package and administrate commercial packages that doesn't need to use native PMS directly. Examples are IBM/Rational's clearcase and Oracle database software. Using HPMS, we can install clearcase with &quot;pkg-inst clearcase-6.0&quot; or we can install a Oracle server using &quot;pkg-inst oracle-8.1.7&quot;   without using their installers directly.

* Following is a ascii diagram to illustrate a HPMS can work on top(hyper) of existing native PMS to build , package and manage software applications.
&lt;pre&gt;

       --------  ----------   -----------  ----------
&lt;/pre&gt;

== What is HPMS ? ==
* Following is ASCII diagram to illustrate the os,pms and hpms relationships when creating a native package.

* When creating a software binary from source codes.
** On Linux with RPM PMS, you will need to use rpmbuild command to parse through configure and build section of instruction in package.spec file.
** On Oracle Solaris, you usually type make command to parse Makefile that contain instruction about source code and compiler options to build the binary.

=== Procedures to install TWW HPMS ===
* Go to http://www.thewrittenword.com/evaluate/
* On the right side of OS menu, click on the OS version you need
* Following the instruction on web page you clicked on.

== pkg-inst ==
pkg-inst install the packages. It will handle package dependency automatically. The automation is achieved by package dependency description in  pkg-db.xml on application repository server.
following example commands are the most usded ones.
# pkg-inst bash : This is a very simple syntax to install a package comparing to &quot;pkg-get -i bash&quot;, &quot;rpm -i bash&quot;.
# pkg-inst -N bash : -N is to do dry-run without install the actural package. a good way to see what is going to happened in advance.
# pkg-inst --tempdir=/tmp clearcase: /var is used by default to store downloaded package, we can specify other directory as temporary directory when /var/ is tool small to hold the package we want to install.

== pkg-rm ==
# pkg-rm bash : A simple syntax to remove  package comparing to &quot;pkg-get -d bash&quot;, &quot;rpm -e bash&quot;.
# pkg-rm -N bash : -N is to do dry-run without install the actural package. 
# pkg-rm  clearcase: /var is used by default to store downloaded package, we can specify other directory as temporary directory when /var/ is tool small to hold the package we want to install.

== pkg-info ==
# &quot;pkg-info bash&quot;
# &quot;pkg-info -N bash&quot; : -N is to do dry-run with out install the actual package. a good way to see what is going to happened in advance.
# &quot;pkg-info&quot;: find out what is available on applicaton repository server.

Packager using this HPMS tool can  capture all their package-specific knowledge in a programmatic, reusable way by digitializing the knowledge in XML file.

TWW Inc. has three tools to automate the package management processes, i.e. software building,packaging and package installation and removal.

== Create the hello-world TWW package ==
In this tutorial, we will use tranditional hello world example to illustrate the digition of software package creation process.
Said, you read the news update from [http://www.stepwise.com stepwise] about [http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2137.html TN2137] on configuring hello-world example from GNU to be a fatbinary execuatable which contains ppc and i386 binary code. 

We can increase the digitation degree more on tn3127 document by automate the process into hello-2.1.1/sb-db.xml. Once the process is digitized we can repeat the accurate result of achieving goals in tn3127. 

=== Flow chart of a TWW package creation ===
[[Image:CreatingTWWPackage.jpg|The flow chart diagram of TWW Cross-Platform Application Management System]]

Above diagram is the process of creating a TWW package and upload to application repository server.
# Install the TWW development tool.
# Create a package template from newtww.sh script.
# Build  the software by '''&quot;sb small-1.0.sb&quot;''' which will go through the following steps.
## '''sb -u hello-2.1.1.sb''' : unpack compressed source.
## '''sb -C hello-2.1.1.sb''' : configure the source tree to have fat binary.
## '''sb -B hello-2.1.1.sb''' : call up make command to build the source.
## '''sb -i hello-2.1.1.sb''' : install the binaries to installation directory.
## '''sb -t hello-2.1.1.sb''' : test the installed binaries on installed directory 
# '''pb -1 hello-2.1.1.pb''' will package the binaries in installation directory into native PMS format.
# We then turn the native PMS (Solaris pkgadd in this case) a zip file.
# Generate a MD5 sum file so have a way to make sure the integrity of the file.
# Upload the small-1.0.pkgadd.pkg-inst, small-1.0.pkgadd.pkg-inst.md5sum to package repository server.
# Add an entry in pkg-db.xml in package repository server.
# Package is now ready for retrieval by simple  &quot;pkg-inst hello&quot; command from  Solaris machine.

== Porting TWW HPMS to other OS ==

These are tasks  need to be done when porting TWW HPMS tools to other OS.
* Porting the TWW HPMS tool itself.
** sb need to add in new OS indentication code.
** pb need to have a new python module to deal with the new PMS.
* Porting the package sources.
** The packages source contain instruction for a particular OS. We need to add the new supported OS to the package source. 
* The makefile to automate the TWW tools porting. 
** Same as Makefile, each makefile contain instruction for a perticular OS, if a new OS is added then the Makefile need to be updated as well.

Hello,

thank you for your effort in [[Computer programming]]. However the texts are just a but off topic. The chapter in question is about learning languages and why a particular lanuguage makes a good (or prehaps bad) learning language. And what the language can teach you.

Look at Ada, C, C++ or Objective-C.

BTW: I seriously consider to remove i.E. the Perl and PHP texts since they say nothing about learning curve or paradigms available and they have been added anomymously so I can't ask the author the improve them.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Johnp. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Johnp~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Finnish|^^Contents^^]] [[Finnish/Grammar-Vowel harmony |&lt;&lt;Grammar-Vowel harmony]] | '''Grammar-Suffixes''' |

----
Now the big part! In Finnish, like all Finno-Uralic languages, there are a huge series of suffixes to represent plurals, positions, postpositions (prepositions), pronouns and descriptions. They are grouped in to 4 groups of which there is a strict order, Group 1 which are plurals, Group 2 which are positions (2a) and postpositions (2b), Group 3 which are accusative pronuons (i.e. my, your...)   And Group 4 which are descriptions (i.e. also, too). To describe the suffixes easily the word '''auto''' (car) is used.

== Group 1: Plurals ==

The first group of suffixes are plurals, of which there are 3 different ways.

===-t===
You can pluralize many words by simply putting a &quot;'''t'''&quot; after the word:
*'''auto → auto''t''''' ;  car → cars
*'''kirja → kirja''t''''' ;  book → books


If there are &quot;'''kk'''&quot;, &quot;'''pp'''&quot;, or &quot;'''tt'''&quot; in a word in a similar way like those below, pluralize it in the following way:

* '''kukka → kuka''t''''' ;  flower → flowers
* '''hattu → hatu''t''''' ;  hat → hats


If a word has &quot;'''nk'''&quot; in a similar way like those below, pluralize in the following way:

* '''kenkä → kengät''' ;  shoe → shoes
* '''sanko → sangot''' ;  bucket → buckets
* '''henki → henget''' ;  spirit → spirits


If a word ends with a letter &quot;'''s'''&quot; like those below, pluralize it in the following way:

* '''varis → varikset''' ;  crow → crows
* '''tulos → tulokset''' ;  result → results


If a word ends with &quot;'''nen'''&quot; like those below, pluralize it in the following way:

* '''kukkanen → kukkaset''' ;  small flower → small flowers
* '''Virtanen''' → '''Virtaset''' ;

===-i (-j)===
To pluralise a word with another suffix you put an '''i''' in between the word and the suffix(es). If where there is a cluster of more than 2 vowels, then the '''i''' becomes a '''j'''
*'''autossani → auto''i''ssani''' in my car → in my cars
*'''autoa →  auto''j''a''' car → cars (partitive)

===-a===
When there is a number before the word to indicate an amount, you put an '''a''' after the word (in fact this is not a plural at all, but partitive: it is the number that takes the formal role of '''auto''' in the sentence, more about that later)
*'''auto →  kaksi auto''a''''' car → two cars
*'''autoni → kaksi auto''a''ni''' my car → my two cars

== Exercises ==

Answer to these exercises are at the end of the page.

=== Exercise Number One ===

Pluralize these Finnish words. Translations in English are beside some words.

# '''talo''' (house)
# '''koira''' (dog)
# '''kirja''' (book)

# '''jalas'''  (runner)
# '''Leinonen'''
# '''kello''' (clock/bell)
# '''mato''' (worm)
# '''sänky''' (bed)

# '''teko''' (act)
# '''lumihanki'''
# '''laite''' (gadget)
# '''pilvi'''
# '''haapa'''
# '''tuuletin'''
# '''tiede'''
# '''kanne'''
# '''kansi'''

# '''autona''' (as a car)
# '''kellossani''' (in my clock)
# '''kelloa''' (clock(partitive))
# '''kynällä''' (with a pen)

As you submitted the recipe, feel free to categorize it as you see fit.  However, if it comes from Chicago, it is Midwestern.  Every cuisine has its everyday food and its more special meals.  In the [[:Category:Californian recipes|California recipes]] category, we have the simple [[Cookbook:French Dip Sandwiches|French Dip Sandwiches]] next to the more exotic [[Cookbook:San Francisco style Scallop Ceviche|San Francisco style Scallop Ceviche]].  Under [[:Category:Australian recipes|Australian]] come both the gourmet [[Cookbook:Carpetbag Steak|Carpetbag Steak]] and the meatloaf-esk [[Cookbook:Rissoles|Rissoles]].

= Topics Covered =
* Radiation Background ==
* “Dirty Bomb” ==
* Radioactive Waste / Nuclear Reactors ==
** Yucca Mountain ===
= Radiation =
= Basics of Radiation- Irradiation =
* Irradiation is exposure to penetrating radiation ==
** External irradiation does not make a person radioactive. ===
** External irradiation can damage tissue through direct or indirect means (generation of free radicals and H2O2 from ionization of water) ===
= Basics of Radiation- Contamination =
* Contamination occurs when material that contains radioactive atoms is deposited on skin, clothing, body cavities, wounds. May also damage tissue, but much more slowly than direct irradiation. ==
* Person contaminated with radioactive materials will be irradiated until the source of radiation (the radioactive material) is removed ==
= Basics of Radiation =
* Ionizing radiation is produced by unstable atoms (isotopes) which have an excess of energy or mass. ==
* Atoms give off, or emit, the excess energy or mass as radiation which collide with adjacent molecules and ionize (knock off electrons) ==
** electromagnetic ( gamma or x-rays)  ===
** particulate (i.e., mass given off with the energy of motion - beta and alpha radiation).  ===
= 4 types of ionizing radiation =
* Alpha- little penetration, easily stopped by skin and clothes, dangerous if ingested or inhaled. 20x more damaging than equivalent dose of beta or gamma. ==
* Beta- light penetration, may cause red “burn” on skin. ==
* Gamma- deep penetration, like x-rays. ==
* Neutrons- particles that also penetrate deeply and cause extensive damage. Seen only in nuclear bombs. ==
* All types of radiation cause damage to DNA of cells. Most vulnerable tissues are heme, GI and reproductive systems. ==
= Biological Effects of Radiation =
* Stochastic- effects that are also seen in unexposed individuals, but are increased in frequency with radiation exposure (trigger effect). Not all individuals exposed will get effect. Severity is independent of dose. ==
** Examples include cancer, mental retardation in exposed fetus, genetic damage. ===
= Biological Effects of Radiation =
* Non-stochastic effects- threshold dose, predictable causal relationship with dose related severity in all individuals exposed. ==
** Sterility, skin burns, cataracts, hemopoietic damage, GI and CNS damage. ===
= Radiation Physics for Dummies =
* Absorbed dose = energy/mass=joule/kg ==
* 1 Roentgen=1 rad ==
* 100 rad= 1Grey(Gy). ==
* Dose equivalent=energy/mass x (strength of type of radiation). Alpha is 20x. ==
* 1 rad of gamma is 1 rem ==
* 			BUT ==
* 1 rad of alpha is 20 rem ==
* 100 rem = 1 Seivert (Sv) ==
= Radiation Physics for Dummies =
* Natural radioactivity - 40 mrem/year. ==
* Air travel NYC-London- 4 mrem ==
* CXR- 10 mrem ==
* National Council of Radiation Protection ==
** 5 rem/yr (50 mSv) =annual exposure limit of radiation workers ===
** 0.5 rem (500 mrem or 5 mSv) = max annual exposure to layperson = 50 CXR. ===
= Radiation Physics for Dummies =
* 50 rem is max single dose recommended for a first responder acting in a life saving situation ==
** No risk of Acute Radiation Sickness ===
** 1-4% estimated increase in Ca risk. ===
* In this case, rem = rad, since workers in this situation will be wearing PPE, so gamma is only radiation that will penetrate. ==
= Biological Effects of Radiation =

[[Image:Zizania palustris macro.jpg|right|thumb|Wild rice grains]]

Despite the name, '''wild rice''' is not [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]]. It is a seed native to the Great Lakes region of North America. Compared to other grains, wild rice is highly nutritious. The seeds are purple-tinted black, 1/3 to 1/2 inch long, and about 1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter.

==Copyright==
The cookbook is not a place for you to violate copyright. Hire a lawyer if you need legal advice, but anyway: In the USA, you can get by with ''fully'' rewriting the procedure in your own words. The actions of the procedure and the ingredient list can only be subject to patent, not copyright. Patented recepes are extremely rare. Note that Europe is in general stricter about this; merely rewriting the procedure might not do the job. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:56, 2 May 2005 (UTC)
:Ha. Thanks for the advice! I was not aware of the &quot;procedural rewrite&quot; way of getting around copyright. That is what I had suspected, but was unsure. I prefer to create a recipe from a variety of sources, though, just as I would any other article. I'm not sure what recipe you're talking about, but you must be wrong. The only recipe I've copied directly from a source was from ''The Grand Union Cookbook'', which is over 100 years old, and thus (I assume) falls safely into public domain. Any other recipes were my own creation. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 18:42, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

== Pickle ==

Please show me an example of a recipe that:
#should link to [[Cookbook:Pickle]] instead of [[Cookbook:Pickling]] (explain why)
#means anything other than pickled cucumebers

Note that [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|peppers]] are best linked as I just did, because &quot;pickled&quot; is not a noun.

It's to your benefit that [[Cookbook:Pickle]] be primarily about pickled cucumbers, so that you can correctly interpret all the American recipes that specify &quot;pickle&quot;.
:Whew! Well, I tried to address all of the meanings of pickle, while making it crystal clear that if a recipe calls for a &quot;pickle&quot; just exactly which one it is. I melded the edits from you and [[User:Redlentil|Redlentil]] with some of my own stuff, along with a usage note for recipe writers. I hope everybody's happy with it. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 07:51, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

== bonito flakes ==

I couldn't find a perfect match for you to look at, though I have seen it in person. The bonito flakes I bought in San Francisco's &quot;Japan Town&quot; area were not as long and bacon-like as these, and the cedar bedding chips I've used were a bit more red. (the lighting might be the cause of the minor color difference though) Notice how both images have light and dark parts. Only the smell is really different. Here, see for yourself:

* http://www.medaille.edu/vmacer/120_graphic_16bedding_cedar.jpg
* http://www.gastronews.cz/pictures/poradna/2004-05-05_BONITO%20FLAKES.jpg

So, isn't it helpful to describe the bonito flakes as looking like cedar bedding material? Consider the person who has never seen it before, and who might want to search for it in a Japanese market. If they know to look for a bag full of what appears to be rodent bedding, they'll have no trouble.

BTW, mackeral flakes look like pine bedding.

:What. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 15:56, 12 May 2005 (UTC)

== capitalization ==

I noticed that you've taken a bunch of pages in &quot;Title Case&quot; and redirected them to normal &quot;Wiki case&quot;. Since most of our pages are in title case already, I think it would be prudent to try to get consensus from other contributors before redirecting a ton of things to different cases. In [[Cookbook:Policy]] I noted this with respect to naming. There was also an argument/discussion between Albert and some other contributors about this in the past... I think there might be archives of this from [[Talk:Cookbook]]. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:47, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

== Cannabis ==

You changed [[Cookbook:Cannabis]] to say that marijuana was physically addictive, which is inaccurate. At best, addictiveness is highly disputed, and at &quot;worst&quot; it's not physically addictive. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 02:17, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
:That wasn't me...I wrote that addiction was &quot;a common myth&quot;, but I didn't try to present it as a fact. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 20:47, 18 September 2005 (UTC)
::Oh wow. I just totally misread (several times) that as &quot;a common myth is that cannabis is '''not''' physically addictive&quot;. Sorry sorry sorry sorry. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:57, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

== Thank you for fighting vandalism ==

Thanks for your help in fighting vandalism. One suggestion I have is that next time you use the &quot;move&quot; tab to move a page back to its original location. This will preserve the edit history of the vandalised page. Thanks again, [[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 01:24, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== What's up with the Japanese History Book? ==

Hiya, I was just wondering what's happening to the Japenese history book. I've noticed you've done quite a bit of work on it and I'm thinking of having a go at it. I'm really just wondering if anyone's still actively working on it or something. [[User:WietsE|WietsE]] 12:02, 6 December 2006 (UTC)
:I'm not actively working on it. At least, not now. I just put up all my notes from Japanese Culture &amp; Civilization class. (That's why it's so scattered and spotty.) I may get back to it later, or not. So, please, just roll up your sleeves and dive in anywhere! [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 22:23, 12 December 2006 (UTC) 
::Cheers. I have actually just jumped into another book! If you're getting back into it and need some help at some point give me a shout though! [[User:WietsE|WietsE]] 18:58, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== [[Satanism]] ==

Hi - just looking at recent changes I see this one.  As it stands it does not seem to be a &quot;text book&quot;.   What is your target audience for the book and how do you see it being used as a text book by folk.

::Correct. It is the ''beginning'' of a textbook. I saw it in the requests, and decided to give it a go. It would be used in a class on alternative religions. (For instance, two colleges in my area have a class called &quot;Magic, Witchcraft, and Religion&quot;.) [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 15:18, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

::On what grounds? I know it's considered a &quot;joke religion&quot;, but that alone doesn't make it an invalid topic for study. I think this should be decided by numbers and influence; otherwise you have to A) argue about what constitutes a &quot;real&quot; religion, or B) let any nut with a cult make a wikibook about it. I would argue that if you look at [[w:Subgenius|Wikipedia's article]], the church has been around for quite some time, and has accumulated a decent following. If not worthy of study as a religion, it is definitely worthy of study as a countercultural movement. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 15:31, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

== Avoid generic names for book project ==
For instance [[Kexi]] could be better label as &quot;Database management with Kexi&quot; (or something that better describes the scope of the book project).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:03, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:Thanks! I wondered about that, but wasn't sure about naming conventions (e.g. the GIMP book is just called &quot;[[GIMP]]&quot;). I've changed it to your suggestion, so it'll be more obvious what the book's about. ---[[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] ([[User talk:PurplePieman|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/PurplePieman|contribs]]) 22:39, 24 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

| I was sitting in a park near my house one day half reading a novel and half watching the people move around the area.  As someone who studies people, I spend a lot of time watching them and attempting to both make sense of what they do and use these observations to make sense of my own research and theory development.  On this particular day in the park, I saw two children playing on opposite sides of a typical swing set, and around the time I was getting bored with my novel one of the little kids asked the other, “are you a boy,” and the other little kid said “no.”  Smiling, the first child said, “oh, then you’re a girl,” but again the second child said “no.”  After staring for a moment, the first child said, “but I thought you had to pick one or the other.”  Climbing into a swing, the second child responded, “My parents don’t make me choose – they say I can be anything I want.”  Smiling, the first child asked, “I wonder why I can’t be anything I want,” and without missing a beat, the second child responded, “Ask your parents.”  

This experience (along with many other observations of children when they don’t think adults are paying attention) reminds me of an exercise I do in my classes where I ask students to answer the question “who am I” twenty times.  Every time, students (like most humans) respond with group identities (i.e., &quot;I’m a son,&quot; &quot;I’m white,&quot; &quot;I’m gay,&quot; &quot;I’m a football player,&quot; &quot;I’m an atheist,&quot; &quot;I’m genderqueer,&quot; &quot;I’m a boy,&quot; &quot;I’m black,&quot; &quot;I’m a soccer player,&quot; &quot;I’m a mother,&quot; &quot;I’m a Muslim,&quot; etc.) that they have been taught to use to define themselves.  I then ask my students “Is there anything about you that makes you an individual instead of part of a bunch of different groups.”  While one or two might try to use their names (which come from languages, religions, and other groups) or adjectives like “kind” or “polite” (which come from norms established by groups and vary dramatically even within groups), it doesn’t take students long to realize that every thing about themselves is tied to some form of group membership and shared meaning.  In fact, like the kid on the playground, many of them very quickly start to wonder what they might have lost or gained by being placed into specific groups in the first place.  

In this section, we examine what sociologists have learned about groups, and the ways group memberships influence social and personal experience.  As we begin this section, ask yourself the questions noted above.  Who are you?  Do you allow yourself to be anything you want or do you act certain ways to fit into the groups that you either selected or were placed in throughout your life?  How might your life be different if you became a member of other groups?  If everything about you is based on some group membership, is anyone really an individual?

==Introduction==
In sociology, a '''group''' is usually defined as a number of people who identify and interact with one another. This is a very broad definition, as it includes groups of all sizes, from [[w:dyad|dyads]] to whole societies.  While an [[w:aggregate|aggregate]] comprises merely a number of individuals, a group in sociology exhibits cohesiveness to a larger degree. Aspects that members in the group may share include: interests, values, ethnic/linguistic background, [[w:role|roles]] and kinship. One way of determining if a collection of people can be considered a group is if individuals who belong to that collection use the self-referent pronoun &quot;we;&quot; using &quot;we&quot; to refer to a collection of people often implies that the collection thinks of itself as a group. Examples of groups include: families, companies, circles of friends, clubs, local chapters of fraternities and sororities, and local religious congregations.

[[Image:US Secret Service officers.jpg|right|200 px|thumb|A law enforcement official is a social category, not a group. However, law enforcement officials who all work in the same station and regularly meet to plan their day and work together would be considered part of a group.]]

Collections of people that do not use the self-referent pronoun &quot;we&quot; but share certain characteristics (e.g., roles, social functions, etc.) are different from groups in that they usually do not regularly interact with each other nor share similar interests or values. Such collections are referred to as ''categories'' of people rather than groups; examples include: police, soldiers, millionaires, women, etc.

Individuals form groups for a variety of reasons. There are some rather obvious ones, like reproduction, protection, trade, protest, and food production. But [[w:social categorization|social categorization]] of people into groups and categories also facilitates behavior and action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogg2003&quot;&gt;Hogg, Michael A. Social Categorization, Depersonalization, and Group Behavior. Hogg, Michael A. and Tindale, Scott, Editors. Blackwell Handbook of Social Psychology: Group Processes. Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishers; 2003; pp. 56-85.&lt;/ref&gt; An example may help explain this idea:

:Suppose you are driving somewhere in a car when you notice red lights flashing in your rearview mirror. Because you have been [[Introduction to Sociology/Socialization|socialized]] into society, you know that the red lights mean you should pull over, so you do.  After waiting for a minute or two, an individual in a uniform walks toward your car door. You roll down your window and the individual asks you for your &quot;license and registration.&quot;  

Because groups and categories help facilitate social behavior, you know who this individual is: a member of a law enforcement category like the [[w:police|police]] or [[w:highway patrol|highway patrol]].  In all likelihood, you do not have to question this individual as to why they are driving a special car with lights on it, why they are wearing a uniform, why they are carrying a gun, or why they pulled you over (you may ask why they pulled you over, but doing so often increases the likelihood they'll give you a ticket).  In short, because you recognize that the individual driving the car belongs to a specific social category (or group), you can enter this interaction with a body of knowledge that will help guide your behavior.  You do not have to learn how to interact in that situation every single time you encounter it.  

In fact, sociologists have long recognized the people experience much of social life by attempting to frame situations in terms they can understand.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, Erving.  1974.  Frame Analysis:  An Essay on the Organization of Social Experience.  Harper and Row Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, people approach each situation by consciously or unconsciously asking &quot;What is going on here,&quot; and seeking to coordinate their activities to the &quot;definition of the situation&quot; they decide upon.  To accomplish this, people scan situations for information &quot;given&quot; (e.g., the things people do to signify who they are and what groups they belong to intentionally) and &quot;given off&quot; (e.g., the things people do that inadvertently signify who they are and the groups they belong to) by other people in the situation.  Based on this information, people then act in ways they have been socialized to believe is appropriate for the situation.  In the case above, for example, you (as the driver) would note the information given (e.g., the special car, the lights, and the uniform worn) to ascertain what was happening and who the other driver was, and then you could note the information given off (e.g., the apparent mood of the police officer based upon her or his body language, verbal language, and mannerisms) to predict (accurately or otherwise) what was about to happen to you.  In so doing, you would be using the knowledge of groups at your disposal to manage the situation.  Such interpretive work combined with social categorizations to smooth a wide variety of interactional and interpretive experiences.

==Social Identity Theory==
'''Social identity''' is a theory developed by [[w:Henri Tajfel|Henri Tajfel]] and [[w:John Turner|John Turner]] to understand the psychological basis of intergroup [[w:discrimination|discrimination]]. As developed by Tajfel, Social Identity Theory is a diffuse but interrelated group of social psychological theories concerned with when and why individuals identify with, and behave as part of, social groups, adopting shared attitudes to outsiders. It is also concerned with what difference it makes when encounters between individuals are perceived as encounters between group members. Social Identity Theory is thus concerned both with the psychological and sociological aspects of group behavior.  According to Tajfel and Turner, social identities are composed of three elements.
  
===Categorization===  
We categorize objects in order to understand them, in a very similar way we categorize people (including ourselves) in order to understand the social environment. We use social categories like black, white, Australian, Christian, Muslim, student, and busdriver because they are useful. If we can assign people to a category then that tells us things about those people.  Without an understanding of people's groups and categories, we would have a very difficult time functioning in society. Similarly, we find out things about ourselves by knowing what categories we belong to. We define appropriate behaviour by reference to the norms of groups we belong to, but you can only do this if you can tell who belongs to your group. 

===Identification===
We identify with groups that we perceive ourselves to belong to. Identification carries two meanings. Part of who we are is made up of our group memberships. That is, sometimes we think of ourselves as &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; or &quot;we&quot; vs. &quot;they&quot;, and at other times we think of ourselves as &quot;I&quot; vs. &quot;he or she&quot; or &quot;me&quot; vs. &quot;him or her&quot;. In other words, sometimes we think of ourselves as group members and at other times we think of ourselves as unique individuals. This varies situationally, so that we can be more or less a group member, depending upon the circumstances. What is crucial for our purposes is that thinking of yourself as a group member and thinking of yourself as a unique individual are both parts of your self-concept. The first is referred to as social identity, the latter is referred to as personal identity. In social identity theory, group membership is not something foreign which is tacked onto the person, it is a real, true and vital part of the person. Our groups make up part of who we are.

The other meaning implied by the concept of identity is the idea that we are, in some sense, the same, or identical to other people. This should not be misinterpreted, when we say that we are the same, we mean that for some purposes we treat members of our groups as being similar to ourselves in some relevant way. To take the most extreme example, in some violent conflict such as a war, the members of the opposite group - the [[w:Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] - are treated as identical and completely different to the those people in your group - the [[w:ingroup|ingroup]] - which is made up of distinct individuals.  Thinking about individuals in one's outgroup in such a fashion allows the individual to believe that the enemy is deserving of death by dehumanizing them (more on this below). Treating people this way allows us to justify otherwise unjustifiable behavior.

===Comparison===
A positive self-concept is a part of normal psychological functioning. There is pretty good evidence that to deal effectively with the world we need to feel good about ourselves. The idea of social comparison is that in order to evaluate ourselves we compare ourselves with similar others. We often gain self-esteem by comparing ourselves with others in our group, particularly if we can claim membership in a prestigious group. The prestige of a group is also often created through comparisons that positively reflect on the group.  In other words, people in groups choose to compare their groups with other groups in ways that reflect positively on themselves. In fact, people are motivated to see their own group as relatively better than similar (but inferior) groups (i.e., [[w:positive distinctiveness|positive distinctiveness]]). Inversely, people in a group may minimize differences between their group and another, slightly more prestigious group so one's own group tends to be seen more favorably (i.e., [[w:negative distinctiveness|negative distinctiveness]]). 

Groups choose dimensions for comparison in order to maximize the positivity of their own group. Groups which perceive themselves to be of high status on particular dimensions will choose those as the basis of comparison. Groups of low status will minimize differences on those dimensions or choose new dimensions. For example, people from some Middle Eastern Islamic countries might regard their country as inferior to the West in terms of economic and technological advancement but might regard their way of life as being morally superior.

Intriguingly, the notion that inferior or &quot;underdog&quot; groups are hyper-motivated to succeed against superior groups turns out not to be true, generally.  Members of a group or team will actually work harder when they are competing against a lower ranked group than when they are competing against a higher-ranked group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pettit2010&quot;&gt;Pettit, Nathan C., Kevyn Yong, and Sandra E. Spataro. 2010. Holding Your Place: Reactions to the Prospect of Status Gains and Losses. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology. 46, 2:396-401.&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes sense when framed as a status issue: the superior group has more to lose if it is defeated by an inferior team while the inferior team, if it loses, has not lost anything but rather has affirmed the existing social order.  Thus, members of higher status groups work harder when competing against lower status groups.

==Primary and Secondary Groups==
[[File:1975family.jpg|right|thumb|200px|This family from the 1970s would be an example of a primary group.]]

In sociology we distinguish between two types of groups based upon their characteristics.  A '''Primary group''' is typically a small social group whose members share close, personal, enduring relationships.  These groups are marked by concern for one another, shared activities and culture, and long periods of time spent together.  The goal of primary groups is actually the relationships themselves rather than achieving some other purpose. Families and close friends are examples of primary groups

[[Image:Ian Mackenzie High School Classroom.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A class of students is generally considered a secondary group.]]

'''Secondary groups''' are large groups whose relationships are impersonal and goal-oriented. Some secondary groups may last for many years, though most are short term. Such groups also begin and end with very little significance in the lives of the people involved. People in a secondary group interact on a less personal level than in a primary group. Rather than having as the goal the maintenance and development of the relationships themselves, these groups generally come together to accomplish a specific purpose. Since secondary groups are established to perform functions, people’s roles are more interchangeable. Examples of secondary groups include: classmates in a college course, athletic teams, and co-workers.

The distinction between primary and secondary groups was originally proposed by [[w:Charles Horton Cooley|Charles Horton Cooley]].  He labeled groups as &quot;primary&quot; because people often experience such groups early in their life and such groups play an important role in the development of [[w:personal identity|personal identity]].  Secondary groups generally develop later in life and are much less likely to be influential on one's identity.

==Group Dynamics==
Building on the recognition of primary and secondary groups, sociologists often focus their studies on either group dynamics, group influence (see the next section) or a combination of these two areas of inquiry.  In terms of group dynamics, sociologists have long explored the ways people act in groups as a method for bridging individual and societal level forms of meaning making and activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumer1969&quot;&gt;Blumer, Herbert.  1969.  Symbolic Interaction:  Perspective and Method.  University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing heavily on insights from Symbolic Interaction and Structural Functionalist theories, researchers explore the ways that groups are shaped by and in turn shape societal notions of &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;deviant&quot; as well as societal patterns of inequality.  At the same time, researchers explore the ways that groups are formed, negotiated, and adjusted by the actions of individual beings interacting with one another on a newfound and/or regular basis.  In so doing, studies of group dynamics shed light upon some ways groups reflect, reinforce, and/or shift the ongoing reciprocal relationship between self and society.  

===Dramaturgy===
Much research into group dynamics draws from the dramaturgical approach outlined by [[w: Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman]], and refined by other Symbolic Interactionists throughout the latter part of the 20th Century.  Utilizing the metaphor of the theatre, Goffman defined social life as an information game wherein people give (i.e., intentionally transmit information) and give off (i.e., accidentally transmit information) details about themselves through the emphasis they place upon the social groups to which they belong.  Specifically, people spend much of their lives attempting to demonstrate and affirm their membership within groups that are well regarded while distancing themselves from groups that are stigmatized within society.  In so doing, people learn a wide variety of &quot;signifying practices&quot; or ways of showing others who we are and what we do within group contexts, which demonstrate group membership.  An average college student, for example, may decide to wear certain brands of clothing, display certain logos of sports teams, adorn oneself with specific types of jewelry, and/or speak in certain manners all to give the impression they are a certain type of person.  At the same time, others will constantly &quot;read&quot; the presentations and impressions generated by this college student's signifying practices to guess what type of person they are. For example, if a students is perceived to be wearing a cross, one might think one is a Christian, or if a student is carrying a [[w:Coach,_Inc.|Coach]] bag, others may perceive one has some money).  Drawing on such information, people can then sort themselves into various groups, which may then establish specific codes of conduct and dress for members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler1998&quot;&gt;Adler, Peter and Patricia Adler.  1998.  Peer Power: Preadolescent Culture and Identity.  Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity Work===
Building upon Dramaturgical insights, sociologists developed the notion of &quot;identity work,&quot; or the things people do (individually and collectively) to give meaning to themselves and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwalbe1996&quot;&gt;Schwalbe, Michael, and Douglas Schrock. 1996.  “Identity Work as Group Process.” Advances in Group Processes, 13:113-147.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examining the ways people constructed personal, collective, group, and social identities, researchers taking an identity work approach have outlined four generic processes whereby people give meaning to themselves and others within group contexts.  First, group members must define an identity into existence.  For example, as a class we all might decide to call ourselves the dragon class.  Second, group members must establish a set of codes or symbolic signals that allow people to tell others they are a member of a group.  In our class example, we could say that members of the dragon class always wear pink on Tuesdays, calls things that are cool &quot;fetch&quot;, and always skip whenever we leave the classroom while pumping our fists and laughing.  While we would likely need to develop other codes as time went by to further demonstrate our group identity, these initial ideas would allow us to begin showing others we are members of a group.  Third, group members must establish ritual occasions or opportunities to affirm our membership in the group.  In our class example, we could pick meeting times outside of class to get together on Tuesdays when we're all wearing pink, and we could applaud, laugh, or pat others on the back whenever they use the word &quot;fetch.&quot;  In such cases, we could each demonstrate to other group members that they belong while also having opportunities to remind ourselves that we belong.  Finally, group members must come up with ways to police the boundaries of our group.  In our class example, we would make sure to stop people when they used any term other than &quot;fetch&quot; to say something was cool and question group members that did not skip out of class.  Specifically, we would seek to make sure others within the group behaved in the already agreed upon ways in order to make sure the group norms held.  Through the combination of all these processes, we would have created a group identity and a set of norms to demonstrate that identity to others.  

A real life example may be illustrative here.  Imagine that you have just joined a new religion and you are learning what it means to be a member of that group.  To do this, first you will go to other members of that religion to learn what the religion means, what its people believe, what items they consider important, and what actions are allowed for members - all of these would be identity codes.  After you defined yourself as a group member, you would then need to adopt some or all of these identity codes so others believe you are a member.  By adopting these identity codes correctly in the presence of other group members, you would gain affirmation wherein existing group members approve of your performance of these identity codes and welcome you into the group (in some cases, there may even be a formal ceremony where you profess your membership and other group members affirm that profession).  Finally, you will begin to notice that other group members (and over time you will do this to) will check on you to make sure you are doing the identity codes properly.  In so doing, they will police your behavior to make sure you still belong to the group.  Similar to the religious example just outlined, sociologists have noted similar processes of (1) definition, (2) coding, (3) affirming, and (4) policing in social groups as wide ranging as scientific disciplines, support groups, fraternities, sororities, sports teams, friendship groups or cliques, office or other occupational settings, social movement organizations, and classrooms to name just a few.  In fact, it might be interesting for you to ask yourself how many times you have experienced and enacted these patterns in your own group memberships.  In all such cases, people engage in identity work to construct, affirm, and signify membership within social groups.  

===Emotion Work===
Similar to identity work processes, scholars have noted the tendency for people to alter their emotional expressions, experiences, and understandings in relation to group memberships.  Specifically, social groups and contexts typically contain &quot;feeling rules,&quot; or cultural understandings or scripts that provide people with clues to how one ''should'' feel, ''how much'' one should feel, and how one ''should display'' feelings within a given group or situation.  When one arrives at a funeral, for example, people will expect one to be sad, appear sad, and do so in a manner that does not detract from the funeral ritual itself ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krJW2qMVv4M though funeral norms are culture specific]).  Despite these expectations, one may arrive feeling happy (e.g., &quot;I hated that dude.&quot;), appear nervous (e.g., &quot;Can anyone tell I hated that dude?&quot;), or become more emotional than people are comfortable with seeing (e.g., crying &quot;OH MY BABY! OH MY BABY!&quot; before falling on the floor or the casket).  In such cases where our actual emotions do not match the feeling rules of a given group or context, we engage in what [[w: Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Russell Hochschild]] termed &quot;emotion work,&quot; or the processes whereby people seek to manage or change their emotions to align them with normative feeling rules in a given group or context.  Drawing on these insights, sociologists have outlined three main strategies of emotion work:

*Bodily = adjusting the body to shape feelings (e.g., scratching an arm or popping a rubber band on the skin to invoke feelings)
*Cognitive = adjusting thoughts to shape feelings (e.g., telling ourselves &quot;I need to be happy for him&quot; when our boyfriend is getting ready to marry that other man we don't like)
*Discursive = using language to reframe feelings (e.g., &quot;Oh, it was...nice&quot; or other phrases used to hide our actual feelings about something)

Further, sociologists have outlined three main types of emotion work people do in the course of their lives:

*Individual = working on our own emotions (e.g., college students managing anxiety at test time) 
*Interpersonal = working on the emotions of others during interactional exchanges (e.g., people in wheelchairs managing the discomfort of others in their presence) 
*Reciprocal = working with others to manage collective emotions (e.g., employees managing the negative reactions of bosses or other co-workers during tense working situations)

===Self &amp; Society===
In recent years, Dramaturgical scholars have integrated many of the insights on group dynamics to demonstrate the ways groups reflect the reciprocal relationship between selves and societies.  They have demonstrated that the primary codes that individuals use within groups to signify personal and collective identities rely heavily upon existing societal beliefs, values, and norms.  People form groups by doing identity work that blends their personal desires with the symbolic materials provided by social structures.  Similarly, people manage and maintain groups and group membership by doing emotion work that aligns their personal feelings with existing structural feeling rules.  As a result, groups provide opportunities to examine the ways that selves and structures work hand in hand - to varying degrees - to continuously reproduce individuals and societies predicated upon &quot;who we believe ourselves to be,&quot; &quot;what we believe this says about us,&quot; and &quot;how we feel about these details.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwalbe2000&quot;&gt;Schwalbe, Michael, Sandra Godwin, Daphne Holden, Douglas Schrock, Shealy Thompson, and Michele Wolkomir. 2000. “Generic Processes in the Reproduction of Inequality: An Interactionist Analysis.” Social Forces 79: 419-452.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group Influence==
The primary reason sociologists study groups is because of their power over individuals. A large body of research suggests that group membership strongly shapes the everyday behavior of individuals.  Following are some of the many ways groups shape individual level behavior.

===Conformity===
[[File:Asch experiment.svg|thumb|200px|An example of the types of cards used in the Solomon Asch line experiments.]]

If you've ever done something in a group that you would not do if you were alone, it's likely that you experienced conformity; your attitudes, beliefs, and/or behaviors were influenced by other people.  One of the most well-known illustrations of conformity is [[w:Solomon Asch|Solomon Asch's]] [[w:Asch conformity experiments|conformity experiments]]. The experiment was set up as follows: 

Research participants would enter a room and sit at a table with several other people (who were [[w:confederates|confederates]], meaning they were actually helping with the research).  The participant and confederates would be shown one card that had a reference line and another card that had three comparison lines. Subjects were required to select the comparison line that corresponded in length to the reference line. 

This seems like a relatively straightforward task.  However, choosing the correct line becomes much more difficult when the confederates choose the wrong answer.  Why?  Because of our tendency to conform to those around us.  Thus, when Asch has the confederates choose the wrong answer, participants also chose the wrong line 37% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asch1956&quot;&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). Studies of independence and conformity: A minority of one against a unanimous majority. Psychological Monographs, 70 (Whole no. 416).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asch1951&quot;&gt;Asch, S. E. (1951). Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgment. In H. Guetzkow (ed.) Groups, leadership and men. Pittsburgh, PA: Carnegie Press. &lt;/ref&gt;  How do you think you would respond in such a situation?

Jason Chein and Laurence Steinberg have illustrated why people in groups are more likely to take risks (one form of conforming) using functional magnetic resonance imaging: the presence of peers heightens the benefits that result from risky decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chein2010&quot;&gt;Chein, Jason, Dustin Albert, Lia O’Brien, Kaitlyn Uckert, and Laurence Steinberg. 2010. “Peers increase adolescent risk taking by enhancing activity in the brain’s reward circuitry.” Developmental Science no.&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants in their research remained aware of the risks, but their brains exhibited heightened sensitivity to the benefits of succeeding. Thus, the presence of peers can facilitate risky behavior as it makes the reward more meaningful.

===Social Facilitation===
[[File:Hpv-race.jpg|right|thumb|200px|People often perform their best when competing with others, like in races, as a result of social facilitation.  This is just one illustration of the influence of groups on individuals.]]
Social facilitation is the tendency for people to be aroused into better performance on simple tasks (or tasks at which they are expert or that have become autonomous) when under the eye of others,&lt;ref name=&quot;Triplett1898&quot;&gt;Triplett, N. (1898). The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition. American Journal of Psychology, 9, 507-533.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than while they are alone (i.e., the '''audience effect'''), or when competing against another (i.e., the '''coactor effect''').&lt;ref name=&quot;Zajonc1965&quot;&gt;Zajonc, R. B. (1965). Social facilitation. Science, 149, 269-274.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex tasks (or tasks at which people are not skilled), however, are often performed in an inferior manner in such situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cottrell1968&quot;&gt;Cottrell, N.B., Wack, D.L., Sekerak, G.J., &amp; Rittle, R.M. (1968). Social facilitation of dominant responses by the presence of an audience and the mere presence of others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 9, 245-250.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been demonstrated in a variety of species. In humans, it is strongest among those who are most concerned about the opinions of others, and when the individual is being watched by someone he or she does not know, or cannot see well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bond1983&quot;&gt;Bond, Charles F., Titus, L. J. (1983). Social facilitation: a meta-analysis of 241 studies. Psychological Bulletin. 94(2), Sep 1983, 265-292.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Loafing===
'''Social loafing''' refers to the phenomenon that can occur when people in a group make less of an effort to achieve a goal than they would working alone. As a result of social loafing, groups can sometimes generate less total output than the combined performance of their members working as individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karau1993&quot;&gt;Karau, S. J. &amp; Williams, K. D. (1993). Social loafing: A meta-analytic review and theoretical integration. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65'', 681-706.&lt;/ref&gt; Social loafing results from a lack of motivation when working in a group because individuals do not believe their specific contribution will be evaluated. As a result, they do not put in as much effort as they otherwise would.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karau1993&quot;/&gt;

===Deindividuation===
'''Deindividuation''' refers to the phenomenon of relinquishing one's sense of [[w:identity|identity]], self-awareness, or evaluation apprehension. This can happen as a result of becoming part of a [[w:group|group]] that fosters obedience to group norms rather than an individual's norms, such as an [[w:army|army]] or [[w:mob|mob]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullen1986&quot;&gt;Mullen, B. 1986. Atrocity as a function of lynch mob composition: A self-attention perspective. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 13, 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Once this happens, individuals no longer think about themselves before they act and may, in fact, be unaware of their own actions.  

Deindividuation can have quite destructive effects, like increasing the odds someone will commit a crime&lt;ref name=&quot;Diener1976&quot;&gt;Diener, E., Fraser, S. C., Beaman, A. L. and Kelem, R. T. (1976). Effects of deindividuation variables on stealing among Halloween trick-or-treaters. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33(2), 178-183.&lt;/ref&gt;, engaging in violence,&lt;ref name=&quot;Diener1976-2&quot;&gt;Diener, E. (1976). Effects of prior destructive behavior, anonymity, and group presence on deindividuation and aggression. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 33, 497-507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Silke2003&quot;&gt;Silke, A. (2003). Deindividuation, anonymity, and violence: Findings from Northern Ireland. Journal of Social Psychology, 143, 493-499&lt;/ref&gt; or even over-enforce the law, such as police in riot situations.

===Group Polarization===
[[File:Jury selection - Faulk.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Juries can be influenced by group polarization, leading to more extreme punitive damage awards.]]

'''Group polarization''' refers to the finding that after participating in a discussion group, members tend to advocate more extreme positions and/or call for riskier courses of action than individuals who did not participate in any such discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscovici1969&quot;&gt;Moscovici, S., &amp; Zavalloni, M. (1969). The group as a polarizer of attitudes. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 12, 125-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group polarization results from two primary mechanisms: social comparison and informational influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Isenberg1986&quot;&gt;Isenberg, Daniel J. 1986. &quot;Group Polarization: A Critical Review and Meta-Analysis,&quot; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50 (6), 1141-1151.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[w:Social comparison|Social comparison]] refers to the drive of individuals to appear socially desirable. [[w:Informational_Social_Influence|Informational social influence]] occurs when a person is in a situation where he or she is unsure of the correct way to behave.  In such situations, that person will often look to others for cues concerning the correct behavior. When &quot;we conform because we believe that other's interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aronson2005&quot;&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M. (2005). Social Psychology (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; it is informational social influence.

Group polarization has been used to explain the decision-making of [[w:jury|juries]], particularly when considering [[w:punitive damages|punitive damages]] in a civil trial. Studies have shown that after deliberating together, mock jury members often decided on punitive damage awards that were larger or smaller than the amount any individual juror had favored prior to deliberation. The studies indicated that when the jurors favored a relatively low award, discussion would lead to an even more lenient result, while if the jury was inclined to impose a stiff penalty, discussion would make it even harsher.

===Diffusion of Responsibility===
'''Diffusion of responsibility''' (also called the '''bystander effect''') is a social phenomenon which tends to occur in groups of people above a certain critical size when responsibility is not explicitly assigned. A common example would be observing a minor fender-bender on a busy freeway.  Most people, when they observe something like that, do not stop and do not call the police, assuming someone else will do so. This phenomenon rarely ever occurs in small groups. In tests involving groups of three or fewer, everyone in the group took action as opposed to groups of over ten where in almost every test, no one took action.

{|  style=&quot;background:lightblue;border:1px solid gray;&quot; cellspacing=5px cellpadding=5px align=right width=30% 
| [[w:Kitty Genovese|Kitty Genovese's]] murder is widely cited as an example of the diffusion of responsibility as numerous people observed (either heard or saw) her murder but no one called the police immediately, allowing the murderer to leave the scene of the initial attack then return to track her down and kill her and still get away.

===False Consensus and Illusory Superiority===
'''The false consensus effect''' is the tendency for people to project their way of thinking onto other people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ross1977&quot;&gt;Ross L., Greene D. &amp; House, P. (1977). The false consensus effect: An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 13, 279-301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fields1976&quot;&gt;Fields, James M., and Howard Schuman, (1976-77) &quot;Public Beliefs about the Beliefs of the Public,&quot; Public Opinion Quarterly, 40: 427-448.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, people often assume that everyone else thinks the same way they do. This belief is unsubstantiated by statistical and qualitative data, leading to the perception of a consensus that does not exist. This logical fallacy involves a group or individual assuming that their own opinions, beliefs and predilections are more prevalent amongst the general public than they really are.  This bias is commonly present in a group setting where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population. Since the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe that everybody thinks the same way.  This is done to justify one's own beliefs.

'''Illusory superiority''' is a cognitive bias in which people overestimate the degree to which they possess desirable qualities, relative to others, or underestimate their negative qualities relative to others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoorens1993&quot;&gt;Hoorens, Vera (1993). &quot;Self-enhancement and Superiority Biases in Social Comparison&quot;. European Review of Social Psychology (Psychology Press) 4 (1): 113—139. &lt;/ref&gt; Such over- and under-estimations serve to bolster peoples' self-esteem.  People who succumb to the illusory superiority bias have inflated views of their own characteristics. Some surveys have found all, or nearly all, the participants rate themselves as above the group average. The strongest effect has been found when people rate themselves on abilities at which they are totally incompetent. These subjects have the greatest disparity between their actual performance (at the low end of the distribution) and their self-rating (placing themselves above average). The effect has been found when people compare themselves to others on many different abilities and personality traits:
* Sorority members perceive those in their sorority as far less likely to be conceited and snobby than those in other sororities&lt;ref name=&quot;Biernat1996&quot;&gt;Biernat, M., Vescio, T.K., &amp; Theno, S.A. (1996). Violating American Values: A &quot;Value congruence&quot; approach to understanding outgroup attitudes. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 32, 387-410.&lt;/ref&gt;
*53% of Dutch adults rate their marriage or partnership as better than most others; only 1% rate it as worse than most marriages&lt;ref name=&quot;Buunk1997&quot;&gt;Buunk, B.P., &amp; van der Eijnden, R.J.J.M.

Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 219-228.&lt;/ref&gt;
*66% of adult Americans grade their oldest child's public school with an A or B, but 64% give the nation's public schools a C or D&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitman1996&quot;&gt;Whitman, D. (1996, December, 16). Im OK, you're not. U.S. News and World Report, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Groupthink===
'''Groupthink''' is a term coined by [[w:psychologist|psychologist]] [[w:Irving Janis|Irving Janis]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Janis1972&quot;&gt;Janis, I. (1972). ''Victims of Groupthink: A Psychological Study of Foreign-Policy Decisions and Fiascoes''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. ISBN 0395140447&lt;/ref&gt; to describe a process by which a group can make bad or [[w:irrationality|irrational]] decisions.  In a groupthink situation, each member of the group attempts to conform his or her opinions to what they believe to be the [[w:consensus|consensus]] of the group.  In a general sense this seems to be a very rationalistic way to approach the situation.  However this results in a situation in which the group ultimately agrees upon an action which each member might individually consider to be unwise (the [[w:risky shift|risky shift]]).

Janis' original definition of the term was &quot;a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.&quot;  The word ''groupthink'' was intended to be reminiscent of [[w:George Orwell|George Orwell]]'s coinages (such as ''[[w:doublethink|doublethink]]'' and ''[[w:duckspeak|duckspeak]]'') from the fictional language [[w:Newspeak|Newspeak]], which he portrayed in his novel ''[[w:Nineteen Eighty-Four|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.

Groupthink tends to occur on [[w:committee|committee]]s and in large organizations. Janis originally studied the [[w:Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] bombing, the [[w:Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] and the [[w:Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. Recently, in [[w:2004|2004]], the [[w:United States|US]] [[w:Senate Intelligence Committee|Senate Intelligence Committee]]'s ''Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq''&lt;ref name=&quot;SIC2004&quot;&gt;Senate Intelligence Committee. 2004. Report on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq http://intelligence.senate.gov/conclusions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; blamed groupthink for failures to correctly interpret intelligence relating to Iraq's [[w:weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] capabilities.

One mechanism which management consultants recommend to avoid groupthink is to place responsibility and authority for a decision in the hands of a single person who can turn to others for advice.  Others advise that a pre-selected individual take the role of disagreeing with any suggestion presented, thereby making other individuals more likely to present their own ideas and point out flaws in others' &amp;mdash; and reducing the stigma associated with being the first to take negative stances (see [[w:Devil's Advocate|Devil's Advocate]]).  

Anonymous feedback via suggestion box or [[w:online chat|online chat]] has been found to be a useful remedy for groupthink &amp;mdash; negative or dissenting views of proposals can be raised without any individual being identifiable by others as having lodged a critique.  Thus the [[w:social capital|social capital]] of the group is preserved, as all members have [[w:plausible deniability|plausible deniability]] that they raised a dissenting point.

==Networks==
A '''social network''' is a social structure between actors, either individuals or organizations. It indicates the ways in which they are connected through various social familiarities ranging from casual acquaintance to close familial bonds.  The study of social networks is called both '''social network analysis''' and '''social network theory.'''  Research in a number of academic fields has demonstrated that social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals.	

[[Image:social-network.svg|right|340px|thumb|An example of a social network diagram]]

Social network theory views social relationships in terms of ''nodes'' and ''ties''.  Nodes are the individual actors within the networks, and ties are the relationships between the actors. There can be many kinds of ties between the nodes. In its most simple form, a social network is a map of all of the relevant ties between the nodes being studied.  The network can also be used to determine the [[w:social capital|social capital]] of individual actors.  These concepts are often displayed in a social network diagram, where nodes are the points and ties are the lines. 

The shape of the social network helps determine a network's usefulness to its individuals.  Smaller, tighter networks can be less useful to their members than networks with lots of loose connections ([[w:weak tie|weak tie]]s) to individuals outside the main network.  More &quot;open&quot; networks, with many weak ties and social connections, are more likely to introduce new ideas and opportunities to their members than closed networks with many redundant ties.  In other words, a group of friends who only do things with each other already share the same knowledge and opportunities.  A group of individuals with connections to other social worlds is likely to have access to a wider range of information.  It is better for individual success to have connections to a variety of networks rather than many connections within a single network.  Similarly, individuals can exercise influence or act as brokers within their social networks by bridging two networks that are not directly linked (called filling social holes).

The power of social network theory stems from its difference from traditional sociological studies, which assume that it is the attributes of individual actors - whether they are friendly or unfriendly, smart or dumb, etc. - that matter.  Social network theory produces an alternate view, where the attributes of individuals are less important than their relationships and ties with other actors within the network.  This approach has turned out to be useful for explaining many real-world phenomena, but leaves less room for individual agency, the ability for individuals to influence their success, so much of it rests within the structure of their network. For instance, social networks have been used to examine how companies interact with each other, characterizing the many informal connections that link executives together, as well as associations and connections between individual employees at different companies.  These networks provide ways for companies to gather information, deter competition, and even [[w:collusion|collude]] in setting prices or policies.  Power within organizations has also been found to be tied to social networks.  Powerful people in organizations often derive their power from their degree of connectedness within the organization (i.e., the degree to which an individual within a network is at the center of many relationships) rather than from job title or statuses.  Social networks also play a key role in hiring, in business success for firms, and in job performance.  

The so-called '''[[w:rule of 150|rule of 150]]''' states that the size of a genuine social network is limited to about 150 members (sometimes called the [http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2004/03/the_dunbar_numb.html Dunbar Number]).  The rule arises from cross-cultural studies in [[w:sociology|sociology]] and especially [[w:anthropology|anthropology]] of the maximum size of a [[w:village|village]] (in modern parlance an ''[[w:ecovillage|ecovillage]]'').  It is theorized in [[w:evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychology]] that the number may be some kind of limit of average human ability to [[w:recognition|recognize]] members and track emotional facts about all members of a group.  However, it may be due to [[w:economics|economics]] and the need to track &quot;[[w:free rider|free rider]]s&quot;, as larger groups tend to be easier for [[w:cheat|cheats]] and [[w:lying|liars]] to prosper in.

[[File:Six degrees of separation.png|thumb|right|200px|The &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; model.]]

The [[w:small world phenomenon|small world phenomenon]] is the [[w:hypothesis|hypothesis]] that the chain of social acquaintances required to connect one arbitrary person to another arbitrary person anywhere in the world is generally short. The concept gave rise to the famous phrase [[w:six degrees of separation|six degrees of separation]] after a [[w:1967|1967]] ''small world experiment'' by psychologist [[w:Stanley Milgram|Stanley Milgram]] which found that two random [[w:United States|US]] citizens were connected by an average of six acquaintances. Current internet experiments continue to explore this phenomenon, including the Ohio State [http://smallworld.sociology.ohio-state.edu/html/homepage.html Electronic Small World Project] and Columbia's [http://smallworld.columbia.edu/ Small World Project]. [[w:As of 2005|As of 2005]], these experiments confirm that about five to seven degrees of separation are sufficient for connecting any two people through the internet.

Sociologists are interested in social networks because of their influence on and importance for the individual.  Social networks are the basic tools used by individuals to meet other people, to recreate, and to find social support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;&gt;Putnam, Robert D. 2001. Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community. 1st ed. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent research suggests that the social networks of Americans are shrinking and more and more people have no close confidants or people with whom they can share their most intimate thoughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson2006&quot;&gt;McPherson, J. Miller, Lynn Smith-Lovin, and Matthew E. Brashears. 2006. &quot;Social Isolation in America: Changes in Core Discussion Networks over Two Decades.&quot; American Sociological Review. 71(3): 353-375.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the mean network size of individuals in the U.S. was 2.94 people.  Networks declined by almost an entire confidant by 2004, to 2.08 people.  Almost half, 46.3% of Americans, say they have only one or no confidants with whom they can discuss important matters.  The most frequently occurring response to the question of how many confidants one has was zero in 2004.  The decline in confidants has been most notable among non-kin networks, putting greater emphasis on kin and spouses as social confidants. Most social confidants are similar in demographic characteristics to the person doing the sharing.&lt;ref name=&quot;McPherson2006&quot;/&gt;  The implications of these findings are potentially disturbing for American society as people have smaller [[w:social support|social support]] networks, which are important for both social but also health reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam2001&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some additional information on group socialization from Levine, John M. in Group Processes (also, look for the graphic):
pp. 86-87 &quot;To clarify temporal changes in individual-group relations, Moreland and Levine (1982) developed a model of group socialization that analyzes the passage of individuals through groups. The model seeks to describe and explain the affective, cognitive, and behavioral changes that groups and individuals produce in one another over the course of their relationship. Two fundamental assumptions underlie the model. The first assumption is that relationships between groups and individuals change in systematic ways over time, with individuals moving through different membership phases as a function of the length and quality of their experience with the group. The second assumption, which will prove central to our discussion of innovation, is that groups and individuals exert reciprocal influence on one another, with both parties acting as sources as well as targets of influence.&quot;

p. 87 &quot;The dynamic properties of the group socialization model derive from the operation of three psychological processes - evaluation, commitment, and role transition.&quot;

p. 91 &quot;Until recently, most of the work on socialization in both organizations and small groups was characterized by a restricted social perspective. During socialization, organizations and groups were assumed to be sources of influence, whereas new members were assumed to be targets. Recently, however, there has been increasing recognition that newcomers play an active role in their socialization and can produce changes (intentional or unintentional) in their organizations or groups (Bauer et al., 1998; Feldman, 1994; Levine &amp; Moreland, 1985; Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1997; Sutton &amp; Louis, 1987).&quot;

p. 96 &quot;Newcomers can also use a variety of additional tactics for producing intended innovation that do not have clear parallels in unintended innovation. One such tactic involves the timing of innovation efforts. In his research on idiosyncrasy credit, Hollander (1960) found that individuals attempting to change a group's procedural norms were less successful if they tried to initiate innovation immediately after entering the group than if they conformed for a while before suggesting any changes. Extrapolating from these findings, newcomers who attempt to produce innovation immediately after entry (when group commitment to them is low) are likely to be less successful than those who wait until later (when group commitment is higher).&quot;
I wonder if LDS leaders know this: Mission President advice.

p. 99 &quot;Jones (1986) organized these socialization tactics into two clusters - &quot;institutionalized&quot; tactics (collective, formal, sequential, fixed, serial, investiture) and &quot;individualized&quot; tactics (individual, informal, random, variable, disjunctive, divestiture). He also argued that institutionalized tactics produce custodianship (in which newcomers accept traditional role expectations), whereas individualized tactics produce innovation (in which newcomers challenge these expectations). Subsequent research has provided some support for these hypotheses (e.g., Ashforth &amp; Saks, 1996; Black, 1992; Black &amp; Ashford, 1995; Mignerey, Rubin, &amp; Gorden, 1995). Although little is known about why groups use particular socialization tactics (Bauer et al., 1998), it would not be surprising if institutionalized and individualized tactics were employed by groups with norms favoring custodianship and innovation, respectively.&quot;

Seems like a clear if simplified definition of &quot;socialization&quot; should start this entry. Then more implications and subtleties of the concept can unfold as the material is presented, but at least at the start it might help to have a simple idea of what is being discussed -- RlKap 12/28/2010</text>

Some notes from Reicher, Stephen - in Group Processes:


p. 183 &quot;However, these hostile and external observers never took care to investigate the patterns of crowd action and the conceptions of crowd members to see if their suppositions were warranted. If one did - and there is a growing literature by historians and social scientists that does (e.g. Feagin &amp; Hahn, 1973; Krantz, 1988; Rude, 1964; Williams, 1986) - then two things would become immediately apparent. The first is that crowd action is patterned in such a way as to reflect existing cultures and societies.&quot;

p. 183 &quot;The second obvious feature of crowd phenomena is that they are not only shaped by society but also that they in turn bring about social change. Indeed the changes wrought by crowds exist at three levels. There is change in the ways that crowd members see themselves as social actors. Autobiographies and studies of activists (e.g. Biko, 1988; Burns, 1990; Cluster, 1979; Haley, 1980; Teske, 1997) repeatedly show that people do not enter collective movements with fully fledged movement ideologies but that they develop their understanding of society and who they are within it as a consequence of participation.&quot;

p. 186 &quot;Both are equally represented in the core concept of submergence which, for Le Bon, marked the transition from individual psychology to crowd psychology. Simply by being part of the crowd, individuals lose all sense of self and all sense of responsibility. Yet, at the same time, they gain a sentiment of invincible power due to their numbers.
&quot;Once individual identity and the capability to control behavior disappears, crowd members become subject to contagion. That is, they are unable to resist any passing idea or, more particularly and because the intellect is all but obliterated, any passing emotion. This may even lead crowd members to sacrifice their personal interests - a further sign of irrationality.&quot;

p. 186 &quot;The majority of his crowd text is, in fact, essentially a primer on how to take advantage of the crowd mentality, how to manipulate crowds, and how to recruit their enthusiasms to one's own ends. In brief, Le Bon exhorts the would-be demagogue to direct the primitive mass by simplifying ideas, substituting affirmation and exaggeration for proof, and by repeating points over and again. It is important to acknowledge this stress on the power and the potential of crowds as a strength in Le Bon's work which has often been overlooked...&quot;
Sounds like a page in the Republican playbook.

p. 189 &quot;Such acceptance is easily obscured by the ferocity with which Allport condemned any notion of a group mind. He considered any reference to a mind that was separate from the psyche of individuals as a meaningless abstraction or even as &quot;a babble of tongues&quot; (Allport, 1933) and, in his seminal text on social psychology (Allport, 1924) he asserted that: &quot;there is no psychology of groups which is not essentially and entirely a psychology of individuals&quot; (p. 4). When it came to collective action, Allport declared, still more famously: &quot;The individual in the crowd behaves just as he would behave alone only more so&quot; (p. 295).&quot;
I knew there was a reason I didn't like Allport.

p. 190 &quot;Riots tended to happen in towns and in areas that were stable and had well-established social networks.  Feagin and Hahn (1973) provide similar evidence for the American urban revolts of the 1960s.
&quot;Next, there are considerable data that show migrants were under-represented and long-standing residents were over-represented in riot events.&quot;

p. 194 &quot;To start with, the social identity tradition assumes identity to be multiple and to constitute a complex system rather than being unitary. Most notably, a distinction has been made between personal identity, which refers to the unique characteristics of the individual, and social identity, which refers to an individual's self-understanding as a member of a social category (Tajfel, 1978; Turner &amp; Giles, 1981).&quot;
Apparently, social identity theory is 'da bomb in social psychology.

==Notes from Abrams, D. in Group Processes:==

p. 427 &quot;The split between psychology and more sociological theories of social processes was accentuated with Floyd Allport's pronouncement that, &quot;There is no psychology of groups which is not essentially and entirely a psychology of individuals&quot; (Allport, 1924, p. 4; see Graumann, 1986). By 1925 sociology and psychology had become discrete disciplines (Manicas, 1987), and this meant that social psychology and the study of groups in psychology became separated from its collectivist past. As a result, different levels of analysis were not well articulated in theory and research (Doise, 1986).
&quot;According to Farr (1996), there are two social psychologies. The sociological form owes much to collectivist perspectives, and in an extreme form it regards psychological processes as barely relevant for explaining the impact of social categories and institutions on societal change and development. The psychological form is rooted in the behaviorism and reductionism of Watson and Floyd Allport. At its extreme, social categories, institutions, and roles are treated simply as factual inputs that individuals process, without much regard to the way the meaning of the categories is shaped by societal context (see Hopkins, Reicher, &amp; Levine, 1997, for a contentious critique of the way psychologists treat race as a stimulus variable in social cognition research on prejudice).
&quot;The direction taken by social psychology throughout the following six decades suggests that, as far as most were concerned, Allport had won the day. For example, the idea that the group somehow dehumanizes us, stripping us of our identity and individuality, re-emerged in the form of deindividuation theory (Diener, 1980; Zimbardo, 1969; see also Reicher, this volume, chapter 8). As a result, James's view that the group may be represented in the self (as distinct from simply influencing the self) was neglected in much of the theorizing that followed his writing (see Hogg &amp; Abrams, 1988; Reicher, 1984; Tajfel, 1978). An individualistic meta-theoretical framework also pervaded the enormous arena of group dynamics, which was dominant from the 1940s to the 1960s (e.g., Cartwright &amp; Zander, 1969; Shaw, 1981). Despite its roots in Lewin's potentially collectivist field theory (e.g., Lewin, 1952), group process research has largely been a study of interpersonal interaction in small face-to-face groups, in which &quot;I&quot; reigns supreme, and any reference to &quot;we&quot; is largely descriptive; &quot;we&quot; is simply an arithmetic aggregation (Hogg, 1992).&quot;

p. 428 &quot;In social psychology, the dominant meta-theory remains one in which the self is a unique, individual entity that is relatively autonomous and independently motivated. For example, Baumeister's (1999) choice of articles in his collection of readings on The Self in Social Psychology reflects a ballot mailed to the membership of the International Society for Self and Identity, and includes topics such as self-regulation, self-awareness, self-presentation, self-esteem, self-evaluation, and self-affirmation. None of the articles focuses on group processes, intergroup relations, or social identity. The collection is largely concerned with (a North American view of) the self as an individual psychological entity. Baumeister (1998) argues that selfhood is based in three human experiences: reflexive consciousness, interpersonal being, and executive function.&quot;

{{question-answer|question=1. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x}{x+1} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|none}}}}
{{question-answer|question=2. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = (x-1)^{2/3} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Minimum at the point &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=3. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = x^2 + \frac{2}{x} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=4. &lt;math&gt; f(s) = \frac{s}{1+s^2} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;s=-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relative maximum at &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=5. &lt;math&gt; f(x) =  x^2 - 4x + 9 \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=2&lt;/math&gt;}}}}
{{question-answer|question=6. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{x^2 + x +1}{x^2 -x +1} \,&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Relative minimum at &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Relative maximum at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

==Range of Function==
{{question-answer|question=7. Show that the expression &lt;math&gt;x+ 1/x&lt;/math&gt; cannot take on any value strictly between 2 and -2.|answer={{noprint|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=1-\frac{1}{x^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1-\frac{1}{x^{2}}=0\implies x=\pm1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(x)=\frac{2}{x^{3}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(-1)=-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(-1)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a relative maximum.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(-1)=-2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits _{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;x&lt;-1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, which means that the function is increasing. Coming from very negative &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-values, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; increases from a very negative value to reach a relative maximum of &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is negative, which means that the function is decreasing.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^{-}}f(x)=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^{+}}f(x)=+\infty&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime\prime}(1)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a relative minimum.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;f(1)=2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Between &lt;math&gt;[-1,0)&lt;/math&gt; the function decreases from &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, then jumps to &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; and decreases until it reaches a relative minimum of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
For &lt;math&gt;x&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, so the function increases from a minimum of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
The above analysis shows that there is a gap in the function's range between &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;.}}}}

==Absolute Extrema==
Determine the absolute maximum and minimum of the following functions on the given domain
{{question-answer|question=8. &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 1 &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[0,3]&lt;/math&gt;|answer={{noprint|Maximum at &lt;math&gt;(3,\frac{11}{2})&lt;/math&gt;; minimum at &lt;math&gt;(1,\frac{5}{6})&lt;/math&gt;}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Mark,

I suggest that you use slashes (/) to organize levels in the textbooks. The reason is that the wiki software recognizes that as a way of grouping or subdividing pages, and on the pages that come after a slash the software makes an automatic link back to the parent page. Check out [[Seven Habits Study Guide]] for an example. Hopefully we will able to standardize all the new books on this structure. PS Let me know at any time if there is anything I can do to make your life easier. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 02:14, 2 May 2005 (UTC)

== Regarding link on [[Optics]] ==

Hi there.  I'm not sure if the author has allowed it to be used under the GFDL (I didn't put the link there).  As far as I know, the content on [[Optics]] is written at a high school level, so I think most of it (if not all) can be moved to the FHSST section.  I should really work on expanding that...I've been neglecting it quite a bit ;)

I'm real sorry for my late response, but I've been really busy lately. -[[User:Frazzydee|Frazzydee]]|[[User talk:Frazzydee|&amp;#9997;]] 19:25, 15 May 2005 (UTC)



== Book Order ==
Hi, I noticed that you were listed as a contributer to the FHSST Physics book.  I noticed that wavelike motion is covered before forces in the book. This makes it very hard to explain the simple harmonic motion of a mass oscillating on a spring, which I believe is an example of wavelike motion.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Langstroth beehive is a beehive that was designed using the principle of [[Beekeeping/Bee Space| bee space]], discovered and published by [[Beekeeping/Langstroth| L. L. Langstroth]], and manipulation. This hive design is characterized by its removable frames, which allow for the inspection of the bees for development, diseases and parasites. In 1860, Langstroth developed and published his design and it has since been the basis for a majority of the world’s man made beehives.

==Characteristics==
Like most common designs of hives, the Langstroth hive uses [[Beekeeping/Frames| frames]]. These frames are often filled with some form of [[Beekeeping/Foundation| foundation]] to give the bees a proper starting position and template for building comb. These frames are then installed in [[Beekeeping/Hive Bodies| hive bodies]]. The Langstroth hive is known to impose artificial segregation of the colony by physically dividing honey from brood by use of the [[Beekeeping/Brood Chamber| brood chambers]], for brood development and bee residence, and the [[Beekeeping/Honey Super| honey supers]], for excess honey collection. These separate chambers are stacked onto a [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| bottom board]] and capped off with some form of cover, most often a [[Beekeeping/Inner Cover| inner cover]] and an outside fitting [[Beekeeping/Telescopic Cover| telescopic cover]].

Other parts, such as [[Beekeeping/Feeders| feeders]], [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducers| entrance reducers]], [[Beekeeping/Hive Stand| hive stands]], [[Beekeeping/Queen Excluders| queen excluders]], or similar items may also be used in conjunction with Langstroth style hives.

==Advantages==
===Interchangeable Parts===
Langstroth hives use standard sized hive parts to allow for interchangeability with other hives. This feature of non-unique hive parts allows for mass production, and therefore cheaper prices.
===Availability===
Langstroth hives are the most common design of retailed hives. Because of this, it is relatively easy to acquire the proper parts to fit them.
===Increased Honey Harvesting===
Because [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]] is often extracted from reusable comb only small amounts of wax is lost during honey production. This means that the same comb, when properly stored, may be used season after season, not needing to be replaced by the bees, and is therefore more efficient. 
===Expansion and Contraction===
Because of their modular design, Langstroth hives are perfect for expansion and contraction of particular hives. Hives can be made larger to fit more bees, or smaller to fit fewer depending on seasonal population.

==Disadvantages==
===Complex Design===
Langstroth hives require exact measurements and must conform to rather precise standards. These standards ensure that parts are actually interchangeable between hives. Attention must also be taken to consider bee space. If bee space is not properly observed it is not uncommon to have parts glued together with [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] or connected with burr comb.

===Decreased Wax Harvesting===
Though wax may be harvested from Langstroth style hives, especially in the form of old comb, generally the only wax collected is that in the from of wax capping during honey harvesting and that of burr comb. Most beekeepers prefer to preserve their wax comb so that it may be reused for as many seasons as possible.
If wax production is desired a [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]] may better suited than a Langstroth hive.

===Heavy Lifting===
Langstroth hives are known for heavy lifting when it comes time to harvest honey. Some beekeepers choose to use smaller [[Beekeeping/Honey Supers]], but often they too may become difficult to lift when filled with ripe honey.

===Difficult Management===
Langstroth hives may be more difficult to manage compared to other hive designs, such as the [[Beekeeping/Top Bar Hive| top bar hive]], as the entire hive must be opened in order to do even minor management. This difficulty of management is most easily expressed with having to remove the cover, and alerting the entire hive by way of a suddenly well-lit hive where it was once quite dark. Difficulty also arises during inspection of the [[Beekeeping/Brood Chamber| brood chamber]], the [[Beekeeping/Honey Super| supers]] must be removed, and so likely would the top most brood chamber, to make a satisfactory hive wide inspection.

==Is this real?==
Take the ''Cookbook:Blue Corn-Pinon Pancakes with Apricot-Pinon Compote'' as an example. Do apricots, pine nuts, almonds, cinnamon, and corn all grow in the same area? I think not, and baking powder is less than 100 years old.

Now consider ''Cookbook:Wild Rice Blueberry Dessert''. Lemon juice with blueberries and wild rice??? Lemons are citrus fruit, which comes from tropical and subtropical southeast Asia. Wild rice does not grow well in places that citrus fruit will tolerate.

Canned food, like the cream of broccoli soup, isn't more than 150 years old AFAIK.

Oogruk is untranslated. Walrus? Seal? Whale? Porpoise? Dolfin?

Certo-brand liquid fruit pectin is seriously inappropriate. The same goes for sugar actually.

Bacon is cured pig meat. Pigs are from the Old World.

:Well, it does make sense that they would adapt new foods into their recipes over time. Native Americans are still around, and their cuisine is probably still evolving. [[User:PurplePieman|PurplePieman]] 08:33, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
::We call that &quot;[[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States]]&quot;. I may be of European descent, but I don't claim to cook &quot;colonial cuisine&quot; or &quot;European cuisine&quot; or &quot;white cuisine&quot;. I cook US cuisine, which certainly does contain influences from the first people to settle the area. Probably [[Cookbook:Grits|grits]] and corn tortillas are still fairly authentic. The [[Cookbook:Tamale|tamale]] recipe, which you might consider to be more Mexican than US, is roughly an old recipe from Central America (ready-to-eat field rations for warriors) if you leave out the pork and black pepper. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 19:09, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

There is such a thing as &quot;Native American&quot; cuisine, but a lot of it has been absorbed into the cuisines of the respective countries.  Succotash and Glot (or Glottucks) are Amerindian dishes, but the inclusion of milk or butter is a European influence.

One can categorize the recipes as &quot;traditional&quot; (pre-colonial or colonial with minimal influence of European cuisine) and &quot;modern&quot; (utilising canned goods, different regions, out-of-season, non-native ingredients).

This should also be broken up into regions. There's a difference between South Western US, Tex-Mex, South-Eastern US, North-Eastern US/Canada, etc. regions.</text>

A '''cupcake pan''' is similar to a [[Cookbook:Muffin Pan|muffin pan]], but usually has smaller cups. It is a tray intended for [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] use, with shallow cup-like depressions (cups) about 2.5 inches (60 mm) in diameter and 1.5 inches (40 mm) deep. However, there also exist cupcake pans with &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;miniature&quot; cups.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conclusion ==

As I have shown so far, EFL learners engage in various interactions in virtual environments for EFL writing development such as 1) authentic writing tasks with authentic audiences 2) direct or indirect feedback from native speakers 3) learning English and English society and culture as well as language 4) involving simulated society 5) creating avatar and various own objects and rooms. 

However, because the primary goal of virtual environments is not to help EFL learners to improve their writing, all interaction and activities are not helpful to them. For example, sometimes, virtual environments expose EFL learners to inappropriate relation with partners and improper language input. Thus, I suggest some guidelines to obtain the desired results.      
          

* Find someone to talk to and ask three questions.
* Interview a native speaker at some length
* Gather information from other users or from items, and write a report.
* Log and print out a conversation, highlighting new vocabulary or idiomatic expressions. 
* Build rooms in response to an in-class reading. 
* Hold a party; invite on-line friends. 
* Start an e-mail correspondence with someone you meet in virtual environments.
* Design your own tasks, as individuals or in groups. 
* Keep a journal of activities in virtual environments. 
* Write a simple program that helps others learn the language (Lonnie, 1999)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Biology is all about life - what affects it, what changes it, about how it's organized, about what makes it possible and predictable. 

It can be easy to see how Biology applies to our bodies, or our immediate environment, but sometimes it is less easy to see how it applies to the bigger picture of the world around us. To help in understanding the bigger picture, there are a few things any student should remember:

* Although Biology is taught in sections, each section has links to other sections. What you learn about the structure of a cell has links to how water-borne diseases spread. If you spend some time trying to see and understand these cross-links when you are learning and revising, you will be more able to see the bigger picture.

* Similarly, Biology cannot be completely separated from any other science. It is connected to Maths, to Chemistry, to Physics, to Geography, even to Sociology and Philosophy. If you want to do well in Biology, don't be afraid of these other sciences!

* Biology is not just about what you know, or can describe - it's also about what skills you have. Work hard to develop your skills and you will give yourself a better chance at figuring out the bigger picture. Skills can be used in unfamiliar situations; knowledge is more difficult to apply in unfamiliar situations.

Biology is fun, even though it can be hard work! We hope that as you study and learn, you will discover your own passion for this subject, and that what you learn will make a difference to your life on a daily basis.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Unit Systems ==

=== SI Units (Système International d'Unités) ===

These are the internationally agreed upon units and the ones we will use. Historically these units are based on the metric
system which was developed in France at the time of the French Revolution.

{| style=&quot;border-spacing:3px; text-align:center;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
 |+ '''Table 1.1:''' SI Base Units
 |- 
 ! Base quantity
 ! Name
 ! Symbol
 |- 
 | length
 | meter
 | m
 |- 
 | mass
 | kilogram
 | kg
 |- 
 | time
 | second
 | s
 |- 
 | electric current
 | ampere
 | A
 |-
 | thermodynamic temperature
 | kelvin
 | K
 |-
 | amount of substance
 | mole
 | mol
 |- 
 | luminous intensity
 | candela
 | cd
 |}

All physical quantities have units which can be built from the 7 base units listed in Table 1.1 (incidentally the choice of these seven was arbitrary). They are called base units because none of them can be expressed as combinations of the other six. This is similar to breaking a language down into a set of sounds from which all words are made. Another way of viewing the base units is like the three primary colours. All other colours can be made from the primary colours but no primary colour can be made by combining the other two primaries.
 
Unit names are always written with lowercase initials (e.g. the metre). The symbols (or abbreviations) of units are also written with lowercase initials except if they are named after scientists (e.g. the kelvin (K) and the ampere (A)). 

To make life convenient, particular combinations of the base units are given special names. This makes working with them easier, but it is always correct
to reduce everything to the base units. Table 1.2 lists some examples of combinations of SI base units assigned special names. Do not be concerned if the formulae look unfamiliar at this stage &amp;mdash; we will deal with each in detail in the chapters ahead (as well as many others)!

It is very important that you are able to say the units correctly. For instance, the '''newton''' is another name for the '''kilogram metre per second squared''' (kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;}, while the '''kilogram metre squared per second squared''' ((kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;}) is called the '''joule'''.  

{| style=&quot;border-spacing:3px; text-align:center;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
 |+ '''Table 1.2: ''' Some Examples of Combinations of SI Base Units Assigned Special Names
 |- 
 ! Quantity
 ! Formula
 ! Unit Expressed in
 ! Name of
 |- 
 | &amp;nbsp; 
 | &amp;nbsp; 
 | Base Units
 | Combination
 |- 
 | Force
 | ''m·a''
 | kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
 | N (newton)
 |- 
 | Frequency
 | &lt;math&gt;{1\over T} &lt;/math&gt;
 | s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
 | Hz (hertz)
 |- 
 | Work &amp; Energy
 | ''F·s''
 | kg·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;
 | J (joule)
 |}

Another important aspect of dealing with units is the prefixes that they sometimes have (prefixes are words or letters written in front that change the meaning). The kilogram (kg) is a simple  example: 1 kg is 1000 g or 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; g. Grouping the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the g together we can replace the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with the prefix k (kilo). Therefore the k takes the place of the 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Incidentally the kilogram is unique in that it is the only SI base unit containing a prefix.

There are prefixes for many powers of 10 (Table 1.3 lists a large set of these prefixes). This is a larger set than you will need but it serves as a good reference. The case of the prefix symbol is very important. Where a letter features twice in the table, it is written in uppercase for exponents bigger than one and in lowercase for exponents less than one. ''' Those prefixes listed in boldface should be learnt.'''

 | deca
 | da
 | 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
 | deci
 | d
 | 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
 |}

As another example of the use of prefixes, 1&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; g  can be written as 1 mg (1 milligram).

===Other Unit Systems===
The remaining sets of units, although not used by us, are also internationally recognised and still in use by others. We will mention them briefly for interest only.  

====c.g.s Units====
In this system the metre is replaced by the centimetre and the kilogram is replaced by the gram. This is a simple change but it means that all units derived from these two are changed. For example, the units of force and work are different. These units are used most often in astrophysics and atomic physics. 

====Imperial Units====
These units (as their name suggests) stem from the days when monarchs decided measures. Here all the base units are different, except the measure of time. This is the unit system you are most likely to encounter if SI units are not used. These units are used by the Americans and British. As you can imagine, having different units in use from place to place makes scientific communication very difficult. This was the motivation for adopting a set of internationally agreed upon units. 

====Natural Units====
This is the most sophisticated choice of units. Here the most fundamental discovered quantities (such as the speed of light) are set equal to 1. The argument for this choice is that all other quantities should be built from these fundamental units. This system of units is used in high energy physics and quantum mechanics.

== The Importance of Units ==

Without units much of our work as scientists would be meaningless. We need to express our thoughts clearly and units give meaning to the
numbers we calculate. Depending on which units we use, the numbers are different (e.g. 3.8 ''m'' and 3800 ''mm''
actually represent the same length). Units are an essential part of the language we use. Units must be
specified when expressing physical quantities. In the case of the curtain example at the beginning of the chapter, 
the result of a misunderstanding would simply have been an incorrect amount of material cut. However, sometimes such misunderstandings have
catastrophic results. Here is an extract from a story on CNN's website: 

&lt;!-- (NOTE TO SELF: This quote may need to be removed as the license we are using allows for all parts of the document to be copied and I am not
sure if this being copied is legit in all ways?) --&gt;
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''NASA: Human error caused loss of Mars orbiter November 10, 1999'''&lt;br/&gt;
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Failure to convert English measures to metric values caused the loss
of the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that smashed into the planet instead of
reaching a safe orbit, a NASA investigation concluded Wednesday.
The Mars Climate Orbiter, a key craft in the space agency's exploration of the red planet,
vanished after a rocket firing September 23 that was supposed to put the spacecraft on orbit around Mars.
An investigation board concluded that NASA engineers failed to convert English measures
of rocket thrusts to newton, a metric system measuring rocket force. One English pound of
force equals 4.45 newtons. A small difference between the two values caused the spacecraft
to approach Mars at too low an altitude and the craft is thought to have smashed into the
planet's atmosphere and was destroyed.
The spacecraft was to be a key part of the exploration of the planet. From its station about
the red planet, the Mars Climate Orbiter was to relay signals from the Mars Polar Lander,
which is scheduled to touch down on Mars next month.
``The root cause of the loss of the spacecraft was a failed translation of English units
into metric units and a segment of ground-based, navigation-related mission software,&quot;
said Arthus Stephenson, chairman of the investigation board.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story illustrates the importance of being aware that different systems of units exist. Furthermore, we must be able to convert
between systems of units!

== Choice of Units ==

There are no wrong units to use, but a clever choice of units can make a problem look simpler. The vast range of problems makes it impossible
to use a single set of units for everything without making some problems look much more complicated than they should. We can't
easily compare the mass of the sun and the mass of an electron, for instance. This is why astrophysicists and atomic physicists use
different systems of units.  

We won't ask you to choose between different unit systems. For your present purposes the SI system is
perfectly sufficient. In some cases you may come across quantities expressed in units other than the standard SI units. You will then
need to convert these quantities into the correct SI units. This is explained in the next section.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to Change Units ==

Firstly you obviously need some relationship between the two units that you wish to convert between. Let us demonstrate with a
simple example. We will consider the case  of converting millimeters (mm) to meters (m)&amp;mdash;the SI unit of length. We know that there are 1000 mm in 1 m which we can write as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1000 \mbox{ mm} = 1 \mbox{ m}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

Now multiplying both sides by 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1000\mbox{ mm}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

we get 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}1000 \mbox{ mm}=\frac{1}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}1 \mbox{ m}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;


which simply gives us

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}1=\frac{1 \mbox{ m}}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

This is the conversion ratio from millimeters to meters. You can derive any conversion ratio in this way from a known relationship between two units. Let's use the conversion ratio we have just derived in an example:


'''Question''': Express 3800 mm in meters.


'''Answer''':


&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}3800 \mbox{ mm} &amp; = &amp; 3800 \mbox{ mm} \times 1\\&amp; = &amp; 3800 \mbox{ mm} \times \frac{1\mbox{ m}}{1000 \mbox{ mm}}\\&amp; = &amp; 3.8 \mbox{ m}\\\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;


Note that we wrote every unit in each step of the calculation. By writing them in and canceling 
them properly, we can check that we have the right units when we are finished. We started with mm and multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{mm}}&lt;/math&gt;

This canceled the mm leaving us with just m&amp;mdash;the SI unit we wanted to end up with! If we wished to do the reverse and convert metres to millimeters, then we would need a conversion ratio with millimeters on the top and meters on the bottom.

We conclude each section of this book with a discussion of the units most relevant to that particular section. It is important to try to understand what the units mean. That is why thinking about the examples and explanations of the units is essential.

If we are careful with our units then the numbers we get in our calculations can be checked in a 'sanity test'.

=== What is a 'sanity test'? ===

This isn't a special or secret test. All we do is stop, take a deep breath, and look at our answer. Sure we always look at our answers&amp;mdash;or do we? This time we mean stop and really look&amp;mdash;does our answer make sense?

Imagine you were calculating the number of people in a classroom. If the answer you got was 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 people you  would know it was wrong&amp;mdash;that's just an insane number of people to have in a classroom. That's all a sanity check is&amp;mdash;is your answer insane or not? But what units were we using? We were using people as our unit. This helped us to make sense of the answer. If we had used some other unit (or no unit) the number would have lacked meaning and a sanity test would have been much harder (or even impossible).

It is useful to have an idea of some numbers before we start. For example, let's consider masses. An average person has mass 70 kg, while the heaviest person in medical history had a mass of 635 kg. If you ever have to calculate a person's mass and you get 7000 kg, this should fail your sanity check&amp;mdash;your answer is insane and you must have made a mistake somewhere. In the same way an answer of 0.000&amp;nbsp;01 kg should fail your sanity test.

The only problem with a sanity check is that you must know what typical values for things are.
In the example of people in a classroom you need to know that there are usually 20&amp;ndash;50 people in a classroom. Only then do you know that
your answer of 1&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp;000 must be wrong. Here is a table of typical values of various things (big and small, fast and slow,
light and heavy&amp;mdash;you get the idea):

&lt;!-- NOTE TO SELF: Add to this table as we go along with examples from each section. --&gt;

Now you don't have to memorise this table but you should read it. The best thing to do is to refer to it every time you do a calculation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Temperature ==

We need to make a special mention of the units used to describe temperature. The unit of temperature listed in Table 1.1 is not the everyday unit we see and
use. 

Normally the Celsius scale is used to describe temperature. As we all know, Celsius temperatures can be negative. This might suggest that any number is a valid temperature. In fact, the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles that make up the gas. As we lower the temperature so the motion of the particles is reduced until a point is reached where all motion ceases. The temperature at which this occurs is called absolute zero. There is no physically possible temperature colder than this. In Celsius, absolute zero is at -273.15 °C. 

Physicists have defined a new temperature scale called the ''Kelvin scale''. According to this scale absolute zero is at 0 K and negative temperatures are not allowed. The size of one unit kelvin is exactly the same as that of one unit degree Celsius. This means that a change in temperature of 1  kelvin is equal to a change in temperature of 1 degree Celsius&amp;mdash;the scales just start in different places. Think of two ladders with steps that are the same size but the bottom most step on the Celsius ladder is labelled -273, while the first step on the Kelvin ladder is labelled 0. There are still 100 steps between the points where water freezes and boils on either ladder. 



                          |----|   102 °C    |----|  375 K
                          |----|   101 °C    |----|  374 K
  water boils  ---&gt;       |----|   100 °C    |----|  373 K
                          |----|    99 °C    |----|  372 K

                          |----|    -1 °C    |----|  272 K
                          |----|    -2 °C    |----|  271 K
                                              .
                                              .
                                              .
                          |----|  -269 °C    |----|  4 K
                          |----|  -270 °C    |----|  3 K
                          |----|  -271 °C    |----|  2 K
                          |----|  -272 °C    |----|  1 K
  absolute zero ---&gt;      |----|  -273 °C    |----|  0 K
  


(NOTE TO SELF: Come up with a decent picture of two ladders with the labels --water boiling and freezing--in the same place but with different labelling on the steps!)

This makes the conversion from kelvins to degrees Celsius and back very easy. To convert from degrees Celsius to kelvins add 273. To convert
from kelvins to degrees Celsius subtract 273. Representing the Kelvin temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt; and the Celsius temperature by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}T_K &amp;=&amp; T_{oC} + 273\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

It is because this conversion is additive that a difference in temperature of 1 degree Celsius is equal to a difference of 1 kelvin.
The majority of conversions between units are multiplicative. For example, to convert from metres to millimetres we '''multiply''' by 1000. Therefore a
change of 1 m is equal to a change of 1000 mm.

== Conclusion ==

In this chapter we have discussed the importance of units. We have discovered that there are many 
different units to describe the same thing, although you should stick to SI units in your
calculations. We have also discussed how to convert between different units. This is a skill you must acquire.

      <comment>/* Dynamic disks, USB */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">You may consider looking at the following site that tells you how to hack windows 2000 or windows xp to allow software raid 0 and 5. 

http://members.home.nl/rvandesanden/raid3.html

I started to try this but hit the wall when I realised that external USB disks cannot be converted to dynamic disks. So as suggested in the wiki, I will mount both disks on an IDE inteface and see what I see after I remount them in the USB enclosures.

== It works ==

I've tried creating a dynamic disk plugged into a PC under Win2k, and then placing this disk in an external USB enclosure.

Initially the drive came up with a red symbol in disk administrator, but I was able to right-click and select &quot;Reactivate Disk&quot; and this then displayed succesfully.  Dynamic disks under USB2 work just fine.


Second confirmation: I did this also, and it didn't even require &quot;reactivate&quot; (this is under XP Pro with the RAID-enabling hack). It did complain that it wasn't able to update the boot.ini file properly because the &quot;SCSI controller&quot; (haha) for the USB drive &quot;wasn't responding&quot; -- but that just means it probably won't boot from the USB drive, which is fine.

== I have done this pretty successfully ==


I did this maybe 2.5 years ago with some limited success, and just decided to plug it in again a few days ago.

I bought 10 911 firewire bridges.  Made the registry hack.  For an enclosure I bought a metal toolbox, and filled it with 10 120gb drives (at the time 120gb drives were the best capacity per dollar).  Basically, I drilled holes in the back of the toolbox and mounted the drives on one side, with the interface side facing upwards.  I then mounted an Antec power supply in the middle of the toolbox (and cut a vent in the back for the fan of the power supply. I had to short one of the pins on the power supply, so it would be always &quot;switched on&quot;.  I used Y-connectors to power all the drives and bridges.  This seemed like it would be much cheaper and easier than buying and powering a lot of firewire enclosures.

Net result, was a dynamic spanned XP volume with about 1.1TB of space for roughly $2700, which was an excellent deal at the time (quite terrible now, of course).  

I used it for quite some time, but it was never really stable.  I thought it was because I was using just loose bridge boards, or figured my cabling was weak somewhere, but never quite figure out the reliability problems.  I kept getting delayed-write failures.  I googled to no avail.

It turns out since then, that there has been 2 proposed resolutions for that problem.  One is a firmware upgrade for the Oxford chip.  The second, is upgrading to SP2.  As I am no longer running anything other than SP2, just out of curiosity I grabbed the thing out of the closet and plugged it in.  Since then it has worked perfectly.  I also ran across the Tom's Hardware article the other day and upgraded the disk to use RAID-5 rather than spanned.  It does seem a lot slower now :)

Anyway, if any one is interested I could probably snap a few pictures.  It's pretty funny looking, closed it's hard to tell from all but one side, it's anything other than a red metal toolbox.  If it had worked better at the time, I would have probably taken pictures and posted on Slashdot and declared myself a genius.  

CU

== poor results w/ initio 2340l ==


under windows 2000 server i wanted to put 3 pata drives in an enclosure and run software Raid 5.

i get a blue screen before i finish regenerating.  something about memory management.  i'll look into it more later but it seems that there is very little info out there on initio (a.k.a inic) 2430L or 2430.  

am i correct that with oxford drives under windows software raid 5 that when you restart the drives are immediately online and do not show as failed and require a reactivation.

any other resources out there for win sw raid 5 w/ external enclosures.

thanks.

== Diskpart ==

Using Diskpart does not work - the command line follows the same policy setting as the GUI Disk Manager and will not allow you to convert a USB volume into a dynamic disk. Microsoft admits this is by policy (1), and not due to any hardware limitation, due to them believeing it to be too unreliable.

1. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/300415

== Dynamic disks, USB ==

&quot;I think WindowsXP only puts &quot;dynamic&quot; drives into a RAID array.&quot;

All Windows versions (except NT4) allow RAID only on dynamic disks.

Could a USB disk be converted to dynamic by cloning to it an existing dynamic disk ?</text>

== Scientific Notation, Significant Figures,Rounding and Chi Squared Test ==

If you are only sure of say, both digits of a two-digit number, and put it in a formula and get a long series of numbers to the right of the decimal place, then those digits are probably not very accurate. This is the idea of significant figures.

Take 10 and divide by 3. If you are not sure that the number 10 is perfectly accurate, then you do not need to write down 3.333... and can get away with  something like 3.3 or 3.33. Usually, in Biology, we only need figures to 1 decimal place, but sometimes we need them to 2 places.

The main situation in which we would need to be careful and accuate with our numbers is in statistics. In particular, we would need figures to 2 decimal places if we wanted to use the Chi (pronounced Ki) Squared Test (abbreviated as X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; test) to decide whether a result is significant or not.

== Introduction ==

Imagine you had to make curtains and needed to buy material. The shop assistant would need to know how much material was
required. Telling her you need material 2 wide and 6  long would be insufficient-- you have to specify the '''unit'''
(i.e. 2 ''metres'' wide and 6 ''metres'' long). Without the unit the information is
incomplete and the shop assistant would have to guess. If you were making curtains for a doll's house the dimensions might be 2 centimetres wide
and 6 centimetres long!

It is not just lengths that have units, all physical quantities have units (e.g. time and temperature).

The South African high school Biology curriculum is built around 3 Learning Outcomes - things that you need to show you can do. Each Learning Outcome has 3 Assessment Standards. These are the things the classroom teacher, or the exam board, will use to test whether you meet the Learning Outcomes.

== Learning Outcomes Overview ==

*Learning Outcome 1: Scientific Inquiry and Problem Solving Skills 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 1: The learner identifies and questions phenomena and plans an investigation. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 2: The learner conducts an investigation by collecting and manipulating data. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 3: The learner analyses, synthesises and evaluates data and communicates findings.


*Learning Outcome 2: Construction and Application of Knowledge
**Focus of Assessment Standard 1: The learner accesses knowledge. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 2: The learner interprets and makes meaning of knowledge in Life Sciences. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 3: The learner shows understanding of how Life Sciences knowledge is applied in everyday life.


*Learning Outcome 3: Life Sciences, Technology, Environment and Society
**Focus of Assessment Standard 1: The learner explores and evaluates the scientific ideas of past and present cultures. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 2: The learner compares and evaluates the uses and development of resources and products and their impact on the environment and society. 
**Focus of Assessment Standard 3: The learner compares the influence of different beliefs, attitudes and values on scientific knowledge.


Learning Outcome 1 is testing whether or not you have practical skills. See  [[../Useful Information|Useful Information]] for details of the skills you will need to develop.

Learning Outcome 2 is testing your knowledge of Biology.

Learning Outcome 3 is testing whether you can apply your knowledge to real life situations.

== What do I need to know for the exam? ==

In school, each Learning Outcome is covered through using the same subject material in different ways. Because of that, this textbook is based on the subject material, and not the Learning Outcomes. In each section we aim to explain how the material should be used, and what skills should be learnt, to meet each of the Learning Outcomes.

The 4 subject areas are:
*Tissues, cells and molecular studies
*Structure, Control and Process in basic life systems of Plants and Humans
*Environmental Studies
*Diversity, Change and Continuity

Read each section through carefully. You can only really start to show that you have certain skills if you know the subject material properly.

We aim to cover everything you should learn from Grade 10 through to Grade 12, since each year builds upon the foundation of the previous year. However, the balance of our explanations will be focused on the Grade 11 and 12 work, since this will not have been tested externally.

Good luck!

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Biological Nomenclature &amp; Taxonomy ==

Nomenclature simply means to name. In Biology, there is a standard way of naming organisms. This is based on a grouping, or classification, system designed by Carolus (or Carl) Linnaeus. Grouping organisms is called Taxonomy, and the people who do this are called taxonomists.

Taxonomy involves putting all living things into groups based on the characteristics they have in common. These groups, or taxa, can be further divided into smaller and smaller groups, until every single organism is described and named. 

For example, dogs and cats are in the same group at one level, because they both eat meat, have fur, 4 legs, and give birth to live young. However, on the next level down they are no longer in the same group, because dogs cannot pull their claws back into their paws, while cats can retract (pull back) their claws. (This is not the only reason they are in different groups, but we don't have the space and time to give all of them.)

Each level of grouping has its own name. In order of decreasing size they are: Kingdom, Phylum (or Division), Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. (You can remember this order using this poem: &lt;u&gt;K&lt;/u&gt;ing &lt;u&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;hilip &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;ame &lt;u&gt;O&lt;/u&gt;ver &lt;u&gt;F&lt;/u&gt;or &lt;u&gt;G&lt;/u&gt;randma's &lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;oup.)

Using this system, every organism has a binomial (or two part) name, which are always written in italics (or underlined if handwritten). The first part of the name is written with a capital letter and shows which genus the organism is in. The second part is always written with a small letter and shows the species.

=== How does it work? ===

There are 5 Kingdoms - Animals (Animalia), Plants (Plantae), Fungi, Protists (Protista, but now often called Protoctista) and Bacteria (often called Monera). Most taxonomists these days divide the Bacteria Kingdom into two and say there are 6 kingdoms, but in school level Biology we ignore that division and say there are only 5.

&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt;
A lot of the names used seem to have odd endings or spellings. That's because they come from Latin, which was the main language spoken when Linnaeus started developing this system. A lot of the words we use in Biology have been changed slighly from their original Latin. Instead of saying Kingdom Animalia (for example), which is Latin, non-Biologists will often say Animal Kingdom. You need to practice using both.

e.g. a Lion belongs to the Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Chordata (which means it has a backbone), Class Mammalia, Order Carnivora, Family Felidae, Genus &lt;i&gt;Panthera&lt;/i&gt; and species &lt;i&gt;leo&lt;/i&gt;. If you simply use &lt;i&gt;Panthera leo&lt;/i&gt;, anyone anywhere in the world who has studied Biology will know which organism you are talking about, and why it belongs to that group. This is very useful if you are trying to communicate with someone who doesn't speak your language!

{{wikipedia|math.h}}

The &lt;code&gt;&lt;math.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header contains prototypes for several functions that deal with mathematics. In the 1990 version of the ISO standard, only the &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; versions of the functions were specified; the 1999 version added the &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt; versions. To use these math functions, you must link your program with the math library. For some compilers (including GCC), you must specify the additional parameter &lt;code&gt;-lm&lt;/code&gt;.

The functions can be grouped into the following categories:

== Trigonometric functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;acos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;acos&lt;/code&gt; functions return the arccosine of their arguments in radians, and the &lt;code&gt;asin&lt;/code&gt; functions return the arcsine of their arguments in radians.  All functions expect the argument in the range [-1,+1]. The arccosine returns a value in the range [0,π]; the arcsine returns a value in the range [-π/2,+π/2].

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float asinf(float x); /* C99 */
 float acosf(float x); /* C99 */
 double asin(double x);
 double acos(double x);
 long double asinl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double acosl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; functions return the arctangent of their arguments in radians, and the &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt; function return the arctangent of &lt;code&gt;y/x&lt;/code&gt; in radians. The &lt;code&gt;atan&lt;/code&gt; functions return a value in the range [-π/2,+π/2] (the reason why ±π/2 are included in the range is because the floating-point value may represent infinity, and atan(±∞) = ±π/2); the &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt; functions return a value in the range [-π/2,+π/2]. For &lt;code&gt;atan2&lt;/code&gt;, a domain error may occur if both arguments are zero.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float atanf(float x); /* C99 */
 float atan2f(float y, float x); /* C99 */
 double atan(double x);
 double atan2(double y, double x);
 long double atanl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double atan2l(long double y, long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tan&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;cos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sin&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;tan&lt;/code&gt; functions return the cosine, sine, and tangent of the argument, expressed in radians.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float cosf(float x); /* C99 */
 float sinf(float x); /* C99 */
 float tanf(float x); /* C99 */
 double cos(double x);
 double sin(double x);
 double tan(double x);
 long double cosl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double sinl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double tanl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Hyperbolic functions ==

The &lt;tt&gt;cosh&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;sinh&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tanh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the hyperbolic cosine, the hyperbolic sine, and the hyperbolic tangent of the argument respectively. For the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions, a range error occurs if the magnitude of the argument is too large.

The &lt;tt&gt;acosh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the argument. A domain error occurs for arguments less than 1.

The &lt;tt&gt;asinh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of the argument.

The &lt;tt&gt;atanh&lt;/tt&gt; functions compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the argument. A domain error occurs if the argument is not in the interval [-1, +1]. A range error may occur if the argument equals -1 or +1.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float coshf(float x); /* C99 */
 float sinhf(float x); /* C99 */
 float tanhf(float x); /* C99 */
 double cosh(double x); 
 double sinh(double x);
 double tanh(double x);
 long double coshl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double sinhl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double tanhl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float acoshf(float x); /* C99 */
 float asinhf(float x); /* C99 */
 float atanhf(float x); /* C99 */
 double acosh(double x); /* C99 */
 double asinh(double x); /* C99 */
 double atanh(double x); /* C99 */
 long double acoshl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double asinhl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long double atanhl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Exponential and logarithmic functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;exp2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;expm1&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' exponential function of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (''e''&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;). A range error occurs if the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is too large.

The &lt;code&gt;exp2&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-2 exponential function of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (2&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;). A range error occurs if the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is too large.

The &lt;code&gt;expm1&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' exponential function of the argument, minus 1. A range error occurs if the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is too large.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float expf(float x); /* C99 */
 double exp(double x);
 long double expl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float exp2f(float x); /* C99 */
 double exp2(double x); /* C99 */
 long double exp2l(long double x); /* C99 */
 float expm1f(float x); /* C99 */
 double expm1(double x); /* C99 */
 long double expm1l(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;frexp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;modf&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;scalbn&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;scalbln&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

These functions are heavily used in software floating-point emulators, but are otherwise rarely directly called.

Inside the computer, each floating point number is represented by two parts:
* The significand is either in the range [1/2, 1), or it equals zero.
* The exponent is an integer.
The value of a floating point number &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt;v = {\rm significand} \times 2^{\rm exponent}&lt;/math&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;frexp&lt;/code&gt; functions break the argument floating point number &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; into those two parts, the exponent and significand.
After breaking it apart, it stores the exponent in the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ex&lt;/code&gt;, and returns the significand.
In other words, the value returned is a copy of the given floating point number but with an exponent replaced by 0.
If &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; is zero, both parts of the result are zero.

The &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt; functions multiply a floating-point number by a integral power of 2 and return the result.
In other words, it returns copy of the given floating point number with the exponent increased by ex.
A range error may occur.

The &lt;code&gt;modf&lt;/code&gt; functions break the argument &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; into integer and fraction parts, each of which has the same sign as the argument. They store the integer part in the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;*iptr&lt;/code&gt; and return the fraction part.
The &lt;code&gt;*iptr&lt;/code&gt; is a floating-point type, rather than an &quot;int&quot; type, because it might be used to store an integer like 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 which is too big to fit in an int.

The &lt;code&gt;scalbn&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scalbln&lt;/code&gt; compute &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; × &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is the base of the floating-point system; if it is 2, the functions are equivalent to &lt;code&gt;ldexp&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float frexpf(float value, int *ex); /* C99 */
 double frexp(double value, int *ex);
 long double frexpl(long double value, int *ex); /* C99 */
 float ldexpf(float x, int ex); /* C99 */
 double ldexp(double x, int ex);
 long double ldexpl(long double x, int ex); /* C99 */
 float modff(float value, float *iptr); /* C99 */
 double modf(double value, double *iptr); 
 long double modfl(long double value, long double *iptr); /* C99 */
 float scalbnf(float x, int ex); /* C99 */
 double scalbn(double x, int ex); /* C99 */
 long double scalbnl(long double x, int ex); /* C99 */
 float scalblnf(float x, long int ex); /* C99 */
 double scalbln(double x, long int ex); /* C99 */
 long double scalblnl(long double x, long int ex); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

Most C floating point libraries also implement the IEEE754-recommended nextafter(), nextUp( ), and nextDown( ) functions.
[http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/nextafter.html]

=== The &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log1p&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;log10&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' natural ('''not''' common) logarithm of the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative. A range error may occur if the argument is zero.

The &lt;code&gt;log1p&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-''e'' natural ('''not''' common) logarithm of one plus the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is less than -1. A range error may occur if the argument is -1.

The &lt;code&gt;log10&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the common (base-10) logarithm of the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative. A range error may occur if the argument is zero.

The &lt;code&gt;log2&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the base-2 logarithm of the argument and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative. A range error may occur if the argument is zero.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float logf(float x); /* C99 */
 double log(double x);
 long double logl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float log1pf(float x); /* C99 */
 double log1p(double x); /* C99 */
 long double log1pl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float log10f(float x); /* C99 */
 double log10(double x);
 long double log10l(long double x); /* C99 */
 float log2f(float x); /* C99 */
 double log2(double x); /* C99 */
 long double log2l(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;ilogb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;logb&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;ilogb&lt;/code&gt; functions extract the exponent of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a signed int value. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is zero, they return the value &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGB0&lt;/code&gt;; if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is infinite, they return the value &lt;code&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/code&gt;; if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is not-a-number they return the value &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGBNAN&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, they are equivalent to calling the corresponding &lt;code&gt;logb&lt;/code&gt; function and casting the returned value to type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;. A range error may occur if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is zero. &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGB0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;FP_ILOGBNAN&lt;/code&gt; are macros defined in &lt;code&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is a macro defined in &lt;code&gt;limits.h&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;logb&lt;/code&gt; functions extract the exponent of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; as a signed integer value in floating-point format. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is subnormal, it is treated as if it were normalized; thus, for positive finite &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, 1 ≤ &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; × &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;sup&gt;-logb(x)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt; &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; . &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is the radix for floating-point numbers, defined in the &lt;code&gt;float.h&lt;/code&gt; header.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 int ilogbf(float x); /* C99 */
 int ilogb(double x); /* C99 */
 int double ilogbl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float logbf(float x); /* C99 */
 double logb(double x); /* C99 */
 long double logbl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Power functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;pow&lt;/code&gt; functions compute &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; raised to the power &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and return the result. A domain error occurs if &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is negative and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is not an integral value. A domain error occurs if the result cannot be represented when &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is zero and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is less than or equal to zero. A range error may occur.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float powf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double pow(double x, double y);
 long double powl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the positive square root of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result. A domain error occurs if the argument is negative.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float sqrtf(float x); /* C99 */
 double sqrt(double x);
 long double sqrtl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;cbrt&lt;code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;cbrt&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the cube root of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result.

 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float cbrtf(float x); /* C99 */

 long double cbrtl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;hypot&lt;code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;hypot&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the square root of the sums of the squares of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, without overflow or underflow, and return the result.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float hypotf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double hypot(double x, double y); /* C99 */
 long double hypotl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Nearest integer, absolute value, and remainder functions ==

=== The &lt;code&gt;ceil&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;ceil&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the smallest integral value not less than &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result; the &lt;code&gt;floor&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the largest integral value not greater than &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result.

 double ceil(double x);
 long double ceill(long double x); /* C99 */
 float floorf(float x); /* C99 */
 double floor(double x);

&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;fabs&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;fabs&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the absolute value of a floating-point number &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and return the result.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float fabsf(float x); /* C99 */
 double fabs(double x); 
 long double fabsl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;fmod&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;fmod&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the floating-point remainder of &lt;code&gt;x/y&lt;/code&gt; and return the value &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; - ''i'' * &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, for some integer ''i'' such that, if &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is nonzero, the result has the same sign as &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and magnitude less than the magnitude of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is zero, whether a domain error occurs or the &lt;code&gt;fmod&lt;/code&gt; functions return zero is implementation-defined.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float fmodf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double fmod(double x, double y);
 long double fmodl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;nearbyint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rint&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lrint&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;llrint&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;nearbyint&lt;/code&gt; functions round their argument to an integer value in floating-point format, using the current rounding direction and without raising the &quot;inexact&quot; floating-point exception.

The &lt;code&gt;rint&lt;/code&gt; functions are similar to the &lt;code&gt;nearbyint&lt;/code&gt; functions except that they can raise the &quot;inexact&quot; floating-point exception if the result differs in value from the argument.

The &lt;code&gt;lrint&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;llrint&lt;/code&gt; functions round their arguments to the nearest integer value according to the current rounding direction. If the result is outside the range of values of the return type, the numeric result is undefined and a range error may occur if the magnitude of the argument is too large.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float nearbyintf(float x); /* C99 */
 double nearbyint(double x); /* C99 */
 long double nearbyintl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float rintf(float x); /* C99 */
 double rint(double x); /* C99 */

 long int lrintf(float x); /* C99 */
 long int lrint(double x); /* C99 */
 long int lrintl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llrintf(float x); /* C99 */
 long long int llrint(double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llrintl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lround&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;llround&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;round&lt;/code&gt; functions round the argument to the nearest integer value in floating-point format, rounding halfway cases away from zero, regardless of the current rounding direction.

The &lt;code&gt;lround&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;llround&lt;/code&gt; functions round the argument to the nearest integer value, rounding halfway cases away from zero, regardless of the current rounding direction. If the result is outside the range of values of the return type, the numeric result is undefined and a range error may occur if the magnitude of the argument is too large.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float roundf(float x); /* C99 */
 double round(double x); /* C99 */
 long double roundl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long int lroundf(float x); /* C99 */
 long int lround(double x); /* C99 */
 long int lroundl(long double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llroundf(float x); /* C99 */
 long long int llround(double x); /* C99 */
 long long int llroundl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;trunc&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;trunc&lt;/code&gt; functions round their argument to the integer value in floating-point format that is nearest but no larger in magnitude than the argument.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float truncf(float x); /* C99 */
 double trunc(double x); /* C99 */
 long double truncl(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;remainder&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;remainder&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the remainder &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; REM &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; as defined by IEC 60559. The definition reads, &quot;When ''y'' ≠ 0, the remainder ''r'' = ''x'' REM ''y'' is defined regardless of the rounding mode by the mathematical reduction ''r'' = ''x'' - ''ny'', where ''n'' is the integer nearest the exact value of ''x''/''y''; whenever |''n'' - ''x''/''y''| = ½, then ''n'' is even. Thus, the remainder is always exact. If ''r'' = 0, its sign shall be that of ''x''.&quot; This definition is applicable for all implementations.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float remainderf(float x, float y); /* C99 */
 double remainder(double x, double y); /* C99 */
 long double remainderl(long double x, long double y); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

=== The &lt;code&gt;remquo&lt;/code&gt; functions ===

The &lt;code&gt;remquo&lt;/code&gt; functions return the same remainder as the &lt;code&gt;remainder&lt;/code&gt; functions. In the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;quo&lt;/code&gt;, they store a value whose sign is the sign of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; and whose magnitude is congruent modulo 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; to the magnitude of the integral quotient of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;, where ''n'' is an implementation-defined integer greater than or equal to 3.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float remquof(float x, float y, int *quo); /* C99 */
 double remquo(double x, double y, int *quo); /* C99 */
 long double remquol(long double x, long double y, int *quo); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

== Error and gamma functions ==

The &lt;code&gt;erf&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the error function of the argument &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^x e^{-t^2}\,\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;; the &lt;code&gt;erfc&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the complimentary error function of the argument (that is, 1 - erf x). For the &lt;code&gt;erfc&lt;/code&gt; functions, a range error may occur if the argument is too large.

The &lt;code&gt;lgamma&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma of the argument (that is, log&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;|Γ(x)|). A range error may occur if the argument is a negative integer or zero.

The &lt;code&gt;tgamma&lt;/code&gt; functions compute the gamma of the argument (that is, Γ(x)). A domain error occurs if the argument is a negative integer or if the result cannot be represented when the argument is zero. A range error may occur.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;math.h&gt;
 float erff(float x); /* C99 */
 double erf(double x); /* C99 */
 long double erfl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float erfcf(float x); /* C99 */
 double erfc(double x); /* C99 */
 long double erfcl(long double x); /* C99 */
 float lgammaf(float x); /* C99 */
 double lgamma(double x); /* C99 */
 long double lgammal(long double x); /* C99 */
 float tgammaf(float x); /* C99 */
 double tgamma(double x); /* C99 */
 long double tgammal(long double x); /* C99 */
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
In our previous chapters we explored the use of using a single variable in research; however, much of the research done in psychology involves the use of several variables. This is because there are few instances where researchers can use a single variable to explain human behaviors. Our previously learned material covered using one independent variable. In reality, more often research questions will involve the use of more than one independent variable.

This chapter will explore the use of the '''two variables between-subject design''', and the statistical method used to measure this type of design is known as the '''two-way ANOVA'''.


== Advantage of the Two-variable Design ==

In research using a two-variable design offers many advantages over using a one-variable design. The first advantage is increased efficiency. This is because the two-variable design contains all of the elements of using two, one-variable designs. From this, using one, two variable design is more cost-effective than researching two, one-variable design experiments.

Another advantage is that we can analyze the interaction of the two variables in the design. This helps us understand how combinations of variables influence behavior. In particular, it allows us to understand and analyze the interactive effects between the two independent variables on the dependent variable. In this, '''interaction''' means that the effect of one independent variable is influenced by another independent variable; or, interaction means that the relationship between an independent variable is different at various levels (types) of another independent variable. 

For example, the researchers Cohen, Nisbett, Bowdle, and Schwaz (1996) conducted an experiment where they examined the reaction of white male participants who had just been insulted versus those who had not been insulted using males from the Northern and Southern regions of the United States. They measured their testosterone level creating an operational definition for their level of aggression. This is because testosterone is easily measured through saliva samples and correlates with arousal, especially aggression.  The hypothesis is that the participants who had been insulted would show a higher level of testosterone than do participants who had not been insulted; however, there was a second independent variable: regional background of the participants. In fact, the researchers selected half of the participants from Northern regions and the other from Southern. The researchers thought that the men from the South, who had a &quot;culture of honor”, would show a greater increase in testosterone levels than the males from the North. This is because men in the South are raised to protect their character when attacked through insults or violence, whereas men in the North are not, or less so. They thought that a man from the South being insulted would show more arousal. 

This example shows how the variable of culture (Northern or Southern male) influences the variable aggression (in the form of testosterone levels), and it also shows how the being insulted affects aggression levels. There can be an interaction between the two variables if the effect of one variable is not consistent across all levels of the other variables. For example, if the results of the study showed that the Northern males’ testosterone levels did not rise when insulted but the Southern males did, there would be interaction. Remember, it is interaction between the Independent variables; therefore, the variables of being a Southern male and being insulted interact with each other to produce the effect of increased aggression, while being a Northern male and being insulted produces a different interaction as to prevent increased aggression.

The last advantage of using a two-variable design ANOVA is an increase in statistical power. If you recall, power is the ability to confidently reject a false NULL hypothesis. This type of research design increases statistical power because the within groups variance tends to be smaller than the within-group variance of a comparable one-variable study (two, one-way ANOVA's). If you recall, the smaller the variance the less fluctuation in measure; therefore, the smaller the F-ratio; therefore, the smaller the confidence interval which means that we are more likely to have chosen a smaller range of possible values which, in turn, restricts the range of possible values for statistical significance; thus, greater statistical power in correctly rejecting a false NULL hypothesis.

=== Summary ===
The advantages of using a two-variable design via Two-Way ANOVA:
*Decrease in cost
*The ability to analyze the interaction of two independent variables
*Increased statistical power due to smaller variance

== The Logic of Two-Variable Design ==

The first concept to consider with a two-variable design is the concept of a treatment combination. Initially, when we design a two-variable study, we select the number of levels we want to use for each variable. Because we combine the two variable into one study, we create something call a '''factorial design'''. A Factorial design represents a study that includes an independent group for each possible combination of levels for the independent variable. For example, in the Cohen et al. (1996) experiment, there are two levels of the insult condition and two levels of participant background. Because of this, the study uses a 2*2 factorial design. This design creates 4 independent groups, because it takes each level of each independent variable and multiplies them. In the Cohen experiment, there are 2 levels for the independent variable insult (control, and insulted) and two levels for the independent variable culture (Northern or Southern); therefore, there are 2 independent variable with 2 levels each. Thus, it is a 2*2 factorial design. An example below:

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
|+ Cohen et al. 2*2 factorial design
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;Background of Participant 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Factor A&lt;br/&gt;Insult Condition
|-
! Control a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
! Insult a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Northern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|-
| Southern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|}

Each combination of levels for the independent variable creates a treatment condition or cell. A 2*2 factorial design creates 4 treatment conditions or cells. If a study has 3 levels of one independent variable and 4 levels of another independent variable, then this study creates 12 treatment conditions or cells.

When both variables are between-subjects variables, we can conclude that the individual cells are independent groups. Independence means that the data collected for one cell do not correlate with the other cells.
B.General linear model

When we discussed the one-way ANOVA, we learned that the logic under one-way ANOVA is the general linear model. We learned that each observation is the sum of the baseline grand mean plus treatment effect and plus the random error within group.

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ij}= \mu + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{ij}\,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\sum \alpha_i=0\,&lt;/math&gt;

The logic of the two-way ANOVA is also the general linear model. However, in the general linear model for the two-way ANOVA, there are two more components:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{ijk}= \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j+ (\alpha\beta)_{ij}+\epsilon_{ijk}\,&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\sum \alpha_i=0,\ \sum \beta_j=0,\ \sum (\alpha\beta)_{ij}=0,\ \,&lt;/math&gt;

That is, individual observation Xijk is the sum of the baseline grand mean, the effect of independent variable A at level i, the effect of independent variable B at level j, the joint effect, called interaction,  of A at level i and B at level j, and the random error within the group of the combination of A at level i and B at level j.
It is common practice to note a specific mean by replacing the index of averaging by a dot. The total of grand mean, the average over all indices, is then indicated by:

:&lt;math&gt;M = X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The estimates for the effects, i.e. the parameters &amp;mu;, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and  (&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;)&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;M=X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_i=X_{i..}-X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b_j=X_{.j.}-X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(ab)_{ij}=X_{ij.}-X_{i..}-X_{.j.}+X_{...}\,&lt;/math&gt;

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;
|+ Cohen et al. 2*2 factorial design
|-
! rowspan=&quot;2&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;Background of Participant 
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Factor A&lt;br/&gt;Insult Condition
|-
! Control a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
! Insult a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
| Northern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Northern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|-
| Southern b&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
| Control + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| Insult + Southern (a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;b&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|}

For example, for the first subject in the first cell (X1jk), the observed score would be the sum of the grand mean (M), the difference between mean score for all subjects in the control group (Ma1) and the grand mean (M), the difference between mean score for all subjects from northern (Mb1) and the grand mean (M), the difference between the mean score in the first cell (Ma1b1) and the mean scores of the two independent variables at particular levels, and the difference between the observed score and the mean score in the first cell (which represents the within group random error).

	X1jk = M + (Ma1-M) + (Mb1-M) + (Ma1b1- Ma1- Mb1+M) + (X1jk - Ma1b1)

=== C. Components of sum of square ===

To test the significance of the mentioned effects, the total variance is analysed, i.e. decomposed in appropriate parts, concerning the various estimates:
:&lt;math&gt;SST=\sum (X_{ijk}-X_{...})^2=
\sum (X_{ijk}-X_{ij.}+X_{ij.}-X_{i..}-X_{.j.}+X_{...}+X_{i..}-X_{...}+X_{.j.}-X_{...})^2=  \,&lt;/math&gt;

::=&lt;math&gt;\sum (X_{ijk}-X_{ij.})^2+\sum (X_{ij.}-X_{i..}-X_{.j.}+X_{...})^2+\sum (X_{i..}-X_{...})^2+\sum (X_{.j.}-X_{...})^2= &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;= SSE + SSAB + SSB + SSA \,&lt;/math&gt;

If we rearrange the above equation, we get:

	'''X1jk - M= (Ma1-M) + (Mb1-M) + (Ma1b1- Ma1- Mb1+M) + (X1jk - Ma1b1)'''

We can see that the deviation of each observation from the grand mean is sum of the deviation of the mean score of the first independent variable at one particular level from the grand mean, the deviation of the mean score of the second independent variable at one particular level from the grand mean, the deviation of the mean score of the combination of two independent variables from the mean scores of the two independent variables at particular levels, and the random error.

If we square all the parts of the equation and sum the deviations for all the subjects, we get:

SStotal=SSA+SSB+SSAB+SSwithin

The above equation indicates that the sum of square of total can be decomposed into four parts, the sum of square between different levels of the first independent variable, the sum of square between different levels of the second independent variable, the sum of square between different combinations of the two independent variables (that is, between different cells), and sum of square within groups.

===D. Components of variance===

If we divide the sum of square with corresponding degree of freedom, we get five types of variance.
Total variance is the sum of square divided by total degree of freedom (N-1). Total variance is also called mean square of total.
The variance due to an independent variable is the sum of square of the independent variable divided by degree of freedom for this variable. The degree of freedom for an independent variable is the number of levels of the independent variable minus 1. Therefore, the variance due to insult condition in the above example is SSA/(2-1) (dfA=j-1). The variance due to participant background is SSB/(2-1) (dfB=k-1). 

The variance due to the combination (or interaction) of the two independent variable is the sum of square of combinations divided by the interaction degree of freedom which is the product of two degrees of freedom of two independent variables, dfAB=dfA*dfB=(j-1)*(k-1).

The variance within is the sum of square of within divided by the degree of freedom within which is N-j*k.

== Main effects and interaction ==
A.Main effects
A main effect refers to the effect that one independent variable has on the dependent variable holding the effects of the other variables constant. Specifically, a main effect represents a special form of the between-groups variance of a single-independent variable.
In a two-factor ANOVA, there are two main effects, one for each factor. When we examine the data using an ANOVA, each main effect can be either statistically significant or not statistically significant. Consequently, there are four potential patterns of results:

1)A statistically significant main effect for Factor A but not for Factor B

[[Image:sign_maineffect_no_interaction.GIF|center]]

2)A statistically significant main effect for Factor B but not for Factor A

[[Image:sig_fact_b_not_a.gif|center]]

3)Statistically significant main effects for both factors

[[Image:sig_effect_both.GIF|center]]

The two lines are parallel and there is no interaction between the two independent variables. The relationship between on independent variable, for example, the relationship between insult condition and reaction, is not different at different level of the second variable, the backgrounds of the participants in this example.
4)No statistically significant main effects for both factors


B.Interaction
An interaction indicates that the effect of one variable is not consistent across all levels of the other variables. That is, the relationship between one independent variable is different at different levels of the other variable. All the above figures indicate situations of no interaction. When there is no interaction, the two lines are parallel. When there is interaction, the two will not be parallel. For a 2*2 factorial design, there are four possible interactions:
1) There is a statistically significant main effect for Factor A, the insult condition. But there is not statistically significant main effect for Factor B.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-

| 9.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 4.5
| 7.5
| 6.0
|}

			
There is a main effect for Factor A, the insult condition. That is, without considering the background difference, there is significant difference between the control group (M=4.5) and the insult group (7.5).
There is no significant main effect for Factor B, the background. That is, without considering the insult condition difference, there is no difference between the southerner (M=6.0) and the northerner (6.0).
There is interaction between the two factors. The southerner had greatly elevated testosterone levels after they had been insulted. By contrast, the northern participants’ testosterone did not change across the two insult conditions.
The hallmark of the interaction is that the two lines are not parallel.

2) There is statistically significant main effect for Factor B, but there is not statistically significant main effect for Factor A.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 6.0
| 3.0
| 4.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 6.0
| 9.0
| 7.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 6.0
| 6.0
| 6.0
|}
			
There is a main effect for participant background. Without considering the insult condition difference, the southerners have higher testosterone level (M=7.5) than do the northerners (M=4.5).
There is no main effect for the insult conditions. Without considering the background difference, the participants in the control group (M=6.0) have similar testosterone level as the participants in the insult group have (M=6.0). 
There is interaction between the two factors. The insult had opposite effects on the southern and northern participants. The insult caused the southern participant’s testosterone to increase whereas the testosterone for the northern participants decreased.

3) Both main effects are statistically significant and there is interaction.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 3.0
| 6.0
| 4.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 3.0
| 12.0
| 7.5
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 3.0
| 9.0
| 6.0
|}
				
There is statistically significant main effect of Factor A. Without considering the background difference, there is significant difference between the control group (M=3.0) and the insult group (9.0).
There is statistically significant main effect of Factor B. Without considering the insult background difference, the southerners have higher testosterone level (M=7.5) than do the northerners (M=4.5).
There is statistically significant interaction between the two factors. The insult condition raised the testosterone levels. In addition to that, southern participants had, overall, greater increases in testosterone levels than did the northern participants.
4)Neither main effect is statistically significant, but the interaction is.

{| width=&quot;605&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Factor B&lt;br/&gt;(Background)
! Control a1
! Insult a2
! Mean
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Northerner b1
| 3.0
| 9.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Southerner b2
| 9.0
| 3.0
| 6.0
|-
| style=&quot;text-align:left&quot; | Mean
| 6.0
| 6.0
| 6.0
|}

There is no main effect for the insult conditions. Without considering the background difference, the participants in the control group (M=6.0) have similar testosterone level as the participants in the insult group have (M=6.0). 
There is no significant main effect for Factor B, the background. That is, without considering the insult condition difference, there is no difference between the southerner (M=6.0) and the northerner (6.0).
However, there is statistically significant interaction. For southerners, insult increases the testosterone level. For northerners, insult decreases the testosterone level.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction===
Macromedia Flash is an animation program which utilizes vector graphics and  bitmap graphics, sound and program code and bidirectional streaming video and audio. The book will explain some of the program's basic functions.

[[Image:flashmx2004.png|thumb|300px|Macromedia Flash MX 2004]]


Could be a possible introduction bit confused on the picture though there is one on wikipedia which could be used

--

I would like to see a good walk-through section, detailing how to create a flash file (possibly a simple game) in such a manner that it encompasses all possible features (eg. buttons, action scripts etc) and describing what is happening as well as describing what to do. I am not a user of flash so am unfortunately unable to contribute but look forward to further developments.


=== Took out a Link===
Took out this,
New to Flash? 

&quot;Go to  [http://www.nystic.com www.nystic.com] and ask any questions you may have.&quot;

It seemed to be purely self promoting.  I went to the site in look for tutorials, or at least any questions asked.  I saw only one thread relating to Flash, and that does not deserve to be on Wikibooks.

== Macromedia -&gt; adobe ==

All references to Macromedia should be changed to adobe. Also there is a lot of scattered flash pages that should be brought together.</text>

==Early history==
Greece has been occupied for ten thousand years. The Greek archaeologist, Christos Tsountas (1857–1934) discovered a major Neolithic site at the modern day village of Sesklo in Thessaly (central Greece) which dates to the seventh millennium. The Sesklo site was occupied until 1500 BC. From the third millennium the Greek mainland was invaded by tribes of an Indo-European language speaking group who referred to themselves as Hellenes, which arrived in two separate waves and transformed the culture of the region. The first group formed the basis of the Mycenaean culture, which traded as far as Egypt and Lebanon/Syria and fought the Trojan War. The second group, which ultimately formed the Doric subgroup of Greeks, entered after the Trojan War, destroyed Mycenae, and started a dark age which ended with the efflorescence of Greek culture beginning around 600 BC.  In early Greek history 'Greece' as we know it today did not exist. Instead, it was a collection of warring city-states (called ''poleis'', singluar: ''polis'') unified only by shared language, religion and culture. Two of the more important poleis were Athens and Sparta, speaking different dialects of Greek; Doric and Ionian, and having different cultural bases and histories. Ultimately, these differences expressed themselves as different forms of government.

===Early Athens===

The founding of Athens is not well documented. It is known that Dorians originally founded the town, a northern tribe that invaded Greece and later settled (introducing the horse). Therefore, Athens maintained a few tribal customs, such as the popular assembly (the basis of the later Athenian democracy). Early Athenian society boiled down into two classes: the peasants, and the rich 'Hippes'. The peasants would borrow grain from the Hippes to plant and pay it back out of their harvest. While all matters were settled through a vote, there were two assemblies: one in which everyone could participate, and one reserved for the Hippes. This gave the Hippes the majority of the political power in early Athens. The society continued in this manner until the Mediterranean slave trade reached Athens. Once this happened, the peasants began to use surplus wealth to buy slaves and use them to farm their land. The Hippes, fearing that the peasants could begin to rival their wealth, began to enslave peasants who were late in repaying their debts. This sparked a long and bloody civil war, which continued for almost twenty years between the Hippes and the recurring peasant militias. These militias requested aid from Sparta, another powerful city-state, which deposed the Hippes and enforced a few laws governing Athens, which included freedom from slavery for all Athenian citizens (while slavery was still legal). The Athenians went on to build a powerful army and eventually aid the Ionians in revolt against the Persians.

===Early Sparta===
[[Image:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|250px|Painting of Alexander the Great.]]
Sparta was one of the most militarily powerful city-states in Greece. While Sparta had existed for a considerable time prior, Spartan history really begins with Lykurgos. Lykurgos was a Spartan aristocrat who enacted a number of reforms to spartan society which brought it to its recognizable form. Some of Lykurgos' reforms included a prohibition on any currency other than iron, a requirement that all men eat all meals in public mess halls, and that all ceilings be finished with an axe rather than carved. The Spartans proceeded to attack their neighbors to acquire helots (slaves) to farm the land while they concentrated on military matters. They later joined the Athenians in their war against the Persians.

==Triumphs and contributions==

Even though the Greek civilization was not the first to develop many studies of the arts and sciences, they were among the first &quot;western&quot; people to do so, and set up lasting techniques and methods which would be used as a basis until the Renaissance. Their architecture, along with the Romans, have inspired many architects and engineers. One kind of example is the Parthenon, a temple dedicated to the Greek goddess of wisdom, Athena.

==Beginning of the End==

The Greek civilization with its independent city states such as Athens, Thebes, Sparta and its loose confederations were no match, however, against the military stratagems of Philip of Macedon or his son Alexander. They were a forerunner of the rising power of Rome, which under its generals would eventually come to conquer Greece.  But if Greece were conquered, the Romans would adapt the Greek culture, keeping it alive.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Beekeeping bee brush.jpg|thumb|right|A Bee Brush]]

A bee brush is a soft bristled brush that can be used to gently, and harmlessly, remove bees from a surface. The bee brush is best used in small scale to move fewer bees per session, if the desired goal is to move bees quickly, in quantity the [[Beekeeping/Bee Blower| bee blower]] may be the proper tool.
Bee brushes are made with long, soft, non-ridged bristles, which are gentle enough for moving bees off of delicate comb and firm enough to remove bees from old frames, equipment or the beekeeper. When used properly, a bee brush will not injure bees. 

==Usage==
To remove bees from a surface, carefully and quickly brush the bee brush perpendicular from the surface to be cleaned. Do not press to hard, especially on open brood cells and open honey cells, as you may either injure brood or make a mess of the honey. 

Bee brushes may be used to clear honeycomb of bees, so to harvest the honey, however this may be a time consuming and difficult task. If the intention is to remove bees quickly from the [[Beekeeping/Honey Super| honey super]] there exist sever options including use of a [[Beekeeping/Bee Blower| bee blower]], a [[Beekeeping/Fume Board| fume board]], or a [[Beekeeping/Bee Escape| bee escape]].

==Selecting a Bee Brush==
Though useful, some beekeepers stay clear of a ready-made brush, and use a clump of grass, leaves or large feathers. Despite the bee brush’s many available competitors, having a ready to use bee brush at an instants notice is indispensable.

==Buying a Brush==
Don't be tempted to purchase other generic brushes to be used as a bee brush. Bee brushes are made with very soft bristles so as not to harm bees. Know the approximate firmness of a brush before purchasing one.

==Maintenance==
*Occasionally a bee brush will come in to contact with [[Beekeeping/Honey| honey]] or  [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]], in such a case it is advised to clean it with warm water and a gentile detergent, such as Dawn, if necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image: Beekeeping mouse guard.jpg|thumb|right|Metal Mouse Guard]]

Mouse guards serve the purpose of restricting access to a beehive by pests such as [[Beekeeping/Mice| mice]] and [[Beekeeping/Skunks| skunks]]. Some can simultaneously be used like a [[Beekeeping/Entrance Reducer| entrance reducer]] and control traffic, temperature and ventilation within a hive.

==Usage==
Most often, mouse guards are used prior to the onset and during the winter months to prevent mice from choosing a beehive as a hibernation spot. It is also not uncommon for mouse guards to be used year round in some locales to help in the control of pests.
Mouse guards are often designed to be nailed or stapled across the entrance of a hive, between the [[Beekeeping/Bottom Board| bottom board]] and the lower [[Beekeeping/Hive Body| hive body]].

==Selecting an Entrance Reducer==
When selecting an entrance reducer, be sure that it is made of a material that a mouse or other pest cannot chew through. Mice will gleefully chew through wooden or thin plastic guards; thus, metal is often the best option.
Some mouse guards are similar in design to small [[Beekeeping/Queen Excluders| queen excluder]]; using one of these means that not only is the [[Beekeeping/Queen Bee| queen]] stuck inside the hive, but so are the [[Beekeeping/Drone Bee| drones]]. Dead and dying drone bodies can easily seal up the entrance and prevent worker bees from transiting to complete their necessary business.

==Maintenance==
*Entrance reducers may need to be occasionally scraped of [[Beekeeping/Propolis| propolis]] but should otherwise not need any real maintenance.
*Be sure to regularly clean dead bees from the entrance reducer and the opening to the beehive; this will help to prevent the hive from accidentally being sealed.

[[Image:Strucla sweet bread02.jpg|right|thumb|poppy seeds on [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]]]
'''Poppy seeds''' are tiny blue-grey oily seeds. They are about 1 [[Cookbook:mm|mm]] across at most.

Poppy seeds can be added to almost any [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] recipe by sprinkling or rolling the [[Cookbook:Dough|dough]] in the seeds before baking it, much as one might do for [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]].
Poppy seeds are especially popular on [[Cookbook:Bagel|bagels]].

==Warning==
Eating poppy seeds can cause people to fail drug tests. 

According Encyclopædia Britannica Online: &quot;tiny dried seed of the opium poppy, used as food, food flavouring, and the source of poppy-seed oil. Poppy seeds have no narcotic properties, because the fluid contained in the bud that becomes opium is present only before the seeds are fully formed.&quot;

However it is proven that eating poppy seeds does give false positives on drug tests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the beginning, there was nothing but Chaos. Out of the chaos, Night and Erebus (The personification of Death and Shadow) materialized. They gave birth to Love, who in turn created Light and Day. Then came Gaea (earth), and Tartarus (the deepest pit in the world).  Gaea first bore Uranus (heaven), and  then she brought forth terrible creatures: The hundred-handers, who had a hundred hands and fifty heads, the Cyclopes, enormous creatures with only one eye, and the Titans.  Uranus hated the Hundred-handers, and imprisoned all of them in Tartarus.  Gaea didnt like this.  She decided to have Cronus (one of the Titans) castrate his father with a jagged sickle.  Cronus threw the severed members behind him and from the bloody drops earth conceived the Furies and Giants.   

Cronus then began to fear for his own life when he was given a propecy that one of his own children (birthed by Rhea, who was his sister and wife) would overcome him as he did with his father.  So he ate them one by one as they were delivered by Rhea. When Zeus was born, however, Rhea hid him in a cave on Crete, and gave Cronus a rock wrapped in a blanket instead. Cronus swallowed the rock, thinking that it was Zeus.

&lt;pre&gt;
The furies of the Gods
attend to mortals,
to keep us in our place.
Oh, the stories they tell!

Of mother Rhea
hiding her youngest son
in a cave in the island of Crete, 
defying Cronus the Titan.

Zeus, full-grown,
rescues Poseidon and Hades
from his father`s vomitus
with Hestia, Demeter and Hera.

The Titans fall before
their children;
father vanquished
imprisoned in Tartarus.

Spoils shared by brothers;
Hades the Underworld,
Poseidon the Sea,
Zeus the Sky and Earth.

The story retold in Genesis
as the God of Earth and Sky
Creates his children,
Yet dares them to defy
His dicta.

Adam and Eve,
striving for immortality,
oppose His will,
thus freeing theirs.

But oh, the price of
knowledge
in the presence 
of their mortality;
only half Gods,
the abyss immutably
beckons.

Yet among them,
the fearless,
from Lascoux to
Argentuil;
The Artists who draw
Courage
from their Creations
and thus become
immortal. 

Deabler, V.T.
&lt;/pre&gt;
When Zeus became fully grown, he forced Cronus to vomit out his brothers and sisters. After this, they went to war with the Titans. The Gods, with the help of the hundred-handers, who they released from Tartarus, eventually won over the Titans and threw all of them into Tartarus, with the exception of Atlas, who was condemned to hold the world up for eternity.
The Gods, however, faced more challenges to their authority. Gaia had given birth to a terrible monster named Typhon, who rose up against the gods. Zeus managed to strike Typhon down with a lightning bolt. Afterwards, the Giants, who had arose from Uranus's blood, also rose up against the Gods. Zeus defeated them too, and threw them into Tartarus. After this, when all threats to the Gods' authority were crushed, Zeus and his two brothers, Poseidon and Hades, drew lots to see what part of the world each would rule. Zeus ended up ruling the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the underworld.

&lt;big&gt;'''The Creation of Man'''&lt;/big&gt;

The Greeks created many accounts of how man was created. These were the two most popular:

In the first account, it is said that Prometheus and his brother, Epimetheus, decided to create living creatures on the Earth. Epimetheus created animals, but gave them all of the best gifts, such as fur, feathers, strength, and cunning, leaving nothing for mankind. Prometheus then created man, and decided to still make mankind superior to the animals by giving them fire, which he stole from Olympus.
In the second account, the Gods created mankind. First, they made mankind out of gold. This golden race lived a life without toil and worry. However, they were mortal, and eventually they died out. After this, the Gods created mankind out of silver. They were very stupid, and ended up killing each other. In the third attempt, the Gods made mankind out of Brass. They enjoyed war, and built up strong armies. Eventually, they destroyed themselves through war. The last race was made out of Iron. They were very evil, and are the race that now inhabit Earth.

This is the '''traditional pie crust'''. To ensure a flakey crust (considered desirable), you need to use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] and you need to keep the lard from melting. It's best to use a cold stone [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] and surface, and to generally keep everything in the refrigerator until used.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
*[[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*[[Cookbook:Lard|lard]]
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
# Sift 775 g (a pound and a half) of flour, and take out a quarter for rolling cut in it 110 g of lard (a quarter of a pound), mixed with water and roll it out; cut 110 g (half a pound) of butter, and put it in at two rollings with the flour that was left out.
# For making the bottom crust of pies, put 110 g of lard into 450 g of flour, with a little salt, mix it stiff, and grease the plates before you make pies; always make your paste in a cold place and bake it soon. Some persons prefer mixing crust with milk instead of water.

'''Pie crust''' is the shell which forms the outside of a [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]]. Old-style pie crusts are made of [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]]. They are usually bland, flakey, and somewhat greasy. Many modern pies use crumb crusts, consisting of [[Cookbook:Cookie|cookies]] crumbs or [[Cookbook:Graham Cracker|graham cracker]] crumbs held together with [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. Crumb crusts are generally sweeter and more flavorful than pastry ones.

The underside of a pie is always covered. The top may be uncovered (open-topped), fully covered by a crust, or covered by a lattice top crust, which covers some areas while leaving the spaces between the lattices exposed. A non-crust pie topping is a [[Cookbook:Crumb_Pie_Topping|crumb pie topping]], which is a rich topping made of loosely blended ingredients, and which, unlike pastry, has little structural integrity.

[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]] which have a pastry or biscuit covering on top, but not on bottom, are called crisps or [[Cookbook:Cobbler|cobblers]].

'''Sour cream''' is [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] that has been [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] with lactic-acid bacteria to make it sour.

Sometimes it is mixed with bits of [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]], or [[Cookbook:Chive|chives]]. Sour cream can be used as a dip, often with additional ingredients mixed in.

'''Bread crumbs''' are bits of stale [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]. They are primarily used to coat food prior to [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] or [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep-fat frying]]. They are also used to hold together meatballs.

Make bread crumbs just as you would imagine, or buy them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In social psychology, impression management is the process through which people try to control the impressions other people form of them. It is usually synonymous with self-presentation.

The goal is for one to present themselves the way in which they would like to be thought of by the individual or group they are interacting with. This form of management generally applies to the first impression.

Impression management (IM) is the goal-directed conscious or unconscious attempt to influence the perceptions of other people about a person, object or event by regulating and controlling information in social interaction. If a person tries to influence the perception of her or his own image, this activity is called self-presentation. Strategic interpersonal behavior to shape or influence impressions formed by an audience is not a new field; it has a rich history. Plato spoke of the &quot;great stage of human life&quot; and Shakespeare crafted the famous sentence &quot;All the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players&quot; in the seventeenth century. Goffman (Goffman, 1959) also followed in his seminal book &quot;The presentation of self in everyday life&quot; a dramaturgical analogy. Impression management (IM) is situated in social psychology.

The audience can be real or imaginary. IM style norms, part of the mental programming received through socialization, are so fundamental that we usually do not notice our expectations of them. While an actor (speaker) tries to project a desired image, an audience (listener) might attribute a resonant or discordant image.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Theory==
'''Ethnomethodology''' is a perspective within sociology which focuses on the way people make sense of their everyday world. People are seen as rational actors, but employ practical reasoning rather than formal logic to make sense of and function in society. The theory argues that human society is entirely dependent on these methods of achieving and displaying understanding. The approach was developed by [[w:Harold Garfinkel|Harold Garfinkel]], based on [[w:Alfred Schütz|Alfred Schütz's]] [[w:phenomenology|phenomenological]] reconstruction of [[w:Max Weber|Max Weber's]] [[w:verstehen|verstehen]] sociology.

Like [[w:Durkheim|Durkheim]], the fundamental sociological phenomenon for ethnomethodologists is the social fact.  But, unlike Durkheim, the social fact is not external of the individual.  The social fact is the product of the social member's methodological activities; it is their understanding of their everyday world.  Members, here, are understood not simply as individuals but any social entity (i.e., individuals and organizations) that can produce a social fact.  In short, members of society (individuals and organizations) make sense of and function in society by creating social facts or understandings of how society works. In this sense, ethnomethodology is at the same time both macro and micro oriented in that members can produce social facts at either level, for either the personal structure (the individual's level of everyday meaning) or the organizational/institutional structure (the organization's level of everyday meaning).

One of the key points of the theory is that ethnomethods or social facts are ''reflexively accountable''.  ''Accounts'' are the ways members describe or explain specific situations.  ''Accounting'' is the process of describing or explaining social situations or how members make sense of their everyday world. Ethnomethodologists are interested in both the account and the method by which the account is made meaningful to the recipient of the account, and tend to emphasize the latter.  The interest is not in determining if the account is accurate or otherwise judging the account but rather in exploring how the account is conveyed. For example, the explanation given by a husband for arriving home late at night is an account.  The ethnomethodologist is interested in both the account and the methods used to convey that account to the recipient, in this case, the wife. Whether the account is factual or not does not interest the ethnomethodologist.

Sociology, generally, seeks to provide accounts of society. Ethnomethodologists view such accounts - sociological ones - the same way they view the account given by the husband above.  In other words, ethnomethodologists break down the accounts given by other sociologists (and other scientists, for that matter) the same way they break down the accounts of interpersonal interaction in romantic relationships.  Ethnomethodologists are not interested in whether or not the accounts given by sociologists are accurate but rather are interested in the accounts that are given and the methods used to develop and convey those accounts.

The accounts people use to explain their behavior or help them understand social interactions are generally taken for granted (e.g., you don't have to ask permission to use the restroom in your own home).  To illustrate how these accounts are usually taken for granted, ethnomethodologists have used research methods in the past that 'breach' or 'break' the everyday routine of interaction in order to reveal the work that goes into maintaining the normal flow of life. Some examples include: 
*pretending to be a stranger in one's own home
*blatantly cheating at board games
*attempting to bargain for goods on sale in stores

In most of these situations, the individuals who are unaware that the researcher is intentionally breaching social norms attempt to explain the ''breacher's'' behavior by providing accounts for them.  These interventions demonstrate the creativity with which ordinary members of society are able to interpret and maintain the unspoken social order that ethnomethodologists study.      

==Impact of Ethnomethodology==
While ethnomethodology is often seen as being removed from more mainstream sociology, it has proven to be influential. For instance, ethnomethodology notes that words are reliant for their meaning based on the context in which they are used; they are ''[[w:indexicality|indexical]]''. This has led to insights into the objectivity of social science and the difficulty in establishing a description of human behavior which has an objective status outside the context of its creation. Ethnomethodology has also influenced the [[w:Sociology of Scientific Knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]] by providing a research strategy that precisely describes the methods of its research subjects without the necessity of evaluating their validity. This proved to be useful to researchers studying social order in laboratories who wished to understand how scientists conducted their experiments without either endorsing or criticising their activities. 

Ethnomethodology has had an impact on [[w:linguistics|linguistics]] and particularly on [[w:pragmatics|pragmatics]]. Ethnomethodological studies of work have played a significant role in the field of [[w:human-computer interaction|human-computer interaction]], informing design by providing engineers with descriptions of the practices of users. Additionally, ethnomethodologically informed management and leadership studies are newly emerging fields.

Worthy of separate mention, ethnomethodology has developed what is often considered a sub-field or perhaps an entirely new discipline, [[Sociological Theory/Conversation Analysis|conversation analysis]], which has its own chapter.

==Notes==
The Greek roots of Ethnomethodology literally mean ''the methods people use''.

The '''beet''', sometimes called '''beetroot''' to distinguish it from the less-commonly-eaten leafy green upper part, is a root crop with an intense purple-red color similar to veinous blood. Beet juice is commonly used for coloring or dyeing.

Beets may be [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]], but most beets are sold fresh (possibly peeled and pre-cooked) or canned. They have a uniquely strong, sweet flavor. They are a common source of refined sugar (known as &quot;beet sugar&quot;).

Beets are usually sliced and served as a [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] on one side of a plate. They are often used in Eastern European soups.

Young beets, about an inch and a ½-inch diameter are fine textured, tender, and excellent in salads. Medium and large size beets are good for cooking; very large roots are too woody for eating regardless of cooking method. Which ever size of beets you choose, look for smooth, hard, uniformly round beets that are free of cuts and bruises.

It’s best to store beets that have their tops chopped off in individual plastic bags in the coolest part of the refrigerator. These should last up to one week. The greens should be eaten as soon as possible.

Wash and scrub the beets before cooking. Beets peel best after cooking, so wear gloves if you wish to avoid stained hands.

You should cook the beet for about 50 minutes.
==Seasonality==

      <text xml:space="preserve">At first I took you for a vandal, but it seems you might be the original [[Cookbook:Marinera Sauce]] author. While &quot;7 handfulls&quot; is terribly vague, removing this hint makes things even more vague. I don't think I could do a very good job at cooking this as it stands, but without the &quot;7 handfulls&quot; hint I'd probably use just 1/2 teaspoon.

This archive page covers approximately the dates between January 2004 and January 2005.

==Main page appearance==

=== Remove of book listings on the front page?===
* Just too many books to list here
* When you click on a topic, the list of books under that topic are most likely different then the books on the front page (either the author adds it to the topic listing or directly to the front page). 

Lets just simplify it and put all the books on topic pages and have one or two books per day/per topic as &quot;books of the day&quot; for the front page--[[User:RobKohr|RobKohr]] 17:17, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

=== Book of the month ===
I would like to suggest a &quot;book of the month&quot;, similar to how it is working in the [[de:Hauptseite|German version of Wikibooks]], because it seems to work quite well there: Every month all registered Wikibook users can vote from a couple of nominated books for beeing next month's &quot;book of the month&quot;. I guess Wikibooks is maturing to allow for 12 excellent books to be displayed on the main page a year (similar to Wikipedia's &quot;Featured article&quot;). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 18:39, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: I would like to reserve at least a quarter of the main page for the [[Wikibooks:Book of the month|Book of the month]], to increase the value of this award. In the future this should preferably be a well-selected picture with some introductory text to the &quot;book of the month&quot;. In the last week of January, I would like to increase the interest in the vote by placing a '''picture of a big question mark''' '''&quot;?&quot;''' with the last call for voting. I will try to set something up during the next couple of days on my user subpages, and present it here first. If somebody could create a really cool kind of questionmark (maybe floating above a book, ...) that would be great! Otherwise, I would probably only contribute a very simple question mark. Also if you have other suggestions for this, let me know. (PS: Googling around, one can find a few very nice question marks, but I'm not sure whether I can just upload them to the commons?) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 08:15, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:: Here is my suggestion for the change of the main page: [[User:Andreas_Ipp/Main_Page_suggestion]]. If you have administrator right, all you have to do is put these three lines
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===Book of the month===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Book of the month}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both;&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- so that next header starts below picture --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: before this line. 
 &lt;nowiki&gt;===About Wikibooks===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:: (The main page has been locked just a week ago by [[User:Gentgeen]], and I don't have administrator rights). Thank you very much! --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 12:57, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

::: I just found out that the main page was not locked anymore, and I made the change by myself. :-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 13:17, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)

=== Change Featured Wikibooks to Most Active Wikibooks ===
* Since the book of the month (see above) would take the role of the &quot;Featured Wikibooks&quot;, I would suggest to rename Featured Wikibooks to &quot;Most Active Wikibooks&quot; - and list the, say, '''Top 5 of currently active Wikibooks''' (that means highest number of contributors in the last month (can be checked e.g. by &quot;Related changes&quot; or by a still to be defined [[m:Requests_for_queries|SQL query]]). 
* &quot;New Wikibooks&quot; is fine, as books get rotated through, but..
* &quot;Struggling Wikibooks&quot; is quite undefined. It is not clear who can add books to this category and who will take them away again. Either it should be also organized in a kind of rotating manner (add books with a date and delete the first in list), or by some kind of voting system.
* &quot;Wikijunior&quot; is just promotional, but to be fair it should contain a link to the [[m:Wikijunior|Wikijunior background]], stating that it is a project started by the Beck Foundation approaching the Wikimedia Foundation.  --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 19:17, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

I replaced Featured and Struggling Wikibooks by {{bad link|Wikibooks:Top active}}. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 20:24, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Here the last featured and struggling books:

'''Featured Wikibooks'''

=== Imitating the new page on Wikipedia ===
If someone has the time to dedicate this main English page could look a lot better if it imitated the clean, colored, outlined-box format of the [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia main page]]. Man this page does not look so nice to me in terms of the three pasty colored boxes (even though I helped design it) and the Wikipedia page looks very nice. We should of course keep the pretty icons .. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:I went ahead and did my best shot of redesigning the main page in the shadow of the 'Pedia. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:: I don't like it. I have to scroll down loads to get to the books I want. The blank space on the right looks bad. I would revert, but it is the main page of course, so I would like more opinions. It doesn't matter much to me, actually, because I just type &quot;LD&quot; or &quot;HSE&quot; into the top-left box and use the Go button. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 12:21, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)
:::I like it a bit - I agree there are problems , but I think they can be overcome. We have too many books to list them all on the first page now. I think we should list categories only. Languages in particular are a huge list. We could also have the book column wider than the community one. That should solve the problem of blank space on the LHS. I think it's a good idea to have our front page similar to wikipedia's. It lets users know visually that we are a sister project. It's branding. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:19, 10 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:My last edit should improve things a bit, making the book names flow accross the lines instead of having a line break after each one. Maybe we should get rid of the red dots too, using the top box to showcase the more completed books. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:What do y'all think ? Looking better ? 

: Should we include the little red (and yellow) dots again that indicate levels of completion ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
::I liked them.  They made it easy to check at a glance if a book was ready to read for reading's sake, or more under construction.  When a user goes to a book, they shouldn't expect it to be mostly done if it's just beginning.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 01:42, 19 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Finally, the Main (English) page looks nice because the rightmost side of the right column isn't cut off like it used to be sometimes in the past.  [[User:H Padleckas|H Padleckas]] 15:52, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)
:Thanks for that comment. It still is cut off, just not so blatantly. But also notice that ''this'' discussion is from February. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 21:18, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

=== Cologne Blue Skin ===

It looks like the Style Sheet for the Wikibooks has a little problem... 
On the Cologne Blue style underneath the logo pic, it still says &quot;The Free Encyclopedia&quot;, instead of the (i think proper) &quot;The free textbook project&quot;.  btw, this problem is the same with the other wikimedia pages as well  --[[User:Mobius|Mobius]] 08:44, 15 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== Centered change ===

I don't like it, I think it looks very ugly (sorry) - however, Karl still hasn't reverted it, meaning that at least he prefers it that way. Opinions? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 21:48, 23 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I changed it so it now has a buffer zone of 23% on the left, and 25% on the right. I think it looks better, but I'm not sure about how large the buffers on each side should be, as screen sizes differ from user to user. --[[User:Flonejek|flonejek]] 06:59, 30 Mar 2004 (UTC)

=== Logo design ===

It would be an improvement to see the slogan read &quot;Think freely. Learn freely&quot; rather than &quot;Think free. Learn free&quot; under the Wikibooks logo; someone coming here to learn something might be slightly put off by a source of knowledge which doesn't know the difference between an adjective and an adverb. [[User:Paul Clenton|Paul Clenton]]

I am thinking about modifying the logo to mimic the more elegant Wikipedia logo (as the designer of the current logo I feel confident in saying this). I am thinking of a smooth, gray version of the current. What kind of images could we put on the front of the top book that suggest learning / education / academia / textbooks ? eyeglasses, a feather in an inkwell, bust of Wm Shakespeare, human skeleton, strand of DNA, a sailing ship, a compass, a lightning bolt, a human brain, a radioactive physics-type symbol (as now), etc etc. Help me figure out what makes sense here. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

I don't like the sailing ship or lightning bolt. Apart from that any of the images you have in mind would be great. My ideas include Rodin's &quot;the thinker&quot;. A bust of any of the classical philosphers, a [[w:Mortarboard|mortarboard]], A scroll or something that looks like a diplomer. You could also put words along the spines of the books. It would have to be simple. Something like &quot;Quantum electrodynamics for dummies&quot; would be amusing but impractical. Something like maths, poetry, french, science on each of the spines would indicate the range of different subjects on offer. That's all I can think of at the moment. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:23, 11 Feb 2004 (UTC)
: I like the logo the way it is... I don't think it needs changing - it's simple and elegant and a little more interesting than it would be in plain grey. [[User:Karen Johnson|KJ]] 02:27, 23 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Besides the logo in the upper-left corner of each page, could we update the &quot;favicon.ico&quot; ? ( http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/FavIcon ) ? At the moment the Wikipedia &quot;favicon.ico&quot; is identical to the Wikibooks &quot;favicon.ico&quot;.

:I second the call for a new favicon. All that's needed is shrinking down the present logo. A unigue favicon would help people differentiate between Wikipedia and Wikibooks bookmarks in the Favorite Places or Shortcut Bar. -- [[User:Everlong|Everlong]]

Good job Karl. I like Theresas idea of 'The Thinker' and would like to see a simputer or PDA in there. Books have had it (well maybe in a few hundred years time . . .) I would suggest a pile of books with an 'explosive' Light - all the knowledge symbols coming out with a childs face behind as if reading a screen (perhaps wearing a mortar board) This is similar to the world jigsaw created in the wikipdea logo [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 10:41, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

=== Wikibook arrangement ===

I don't know if anyone else feels the same but I think the arrangement of wikibooks by developmental stages to be uneasy to the eyes. Also, when a wikibook progresses to the next stage, it is moved further up the listing which just adds to more unpleasantness. I think a fixed alphabetical arrangement would be best since the stage icon next to the wikibook link shows what stage it's at anyway. So when a wikibook progresses to the next stage, we only change the icon, no need to move the wikibook link around. Shuffling of the links is just not user friendly. I forgot what the technical term is... the principles of design... such as ease of readability, navigation, etc. What do the rest of you think? &amp;mdash; [[User:Mkn|Mkn]] 22:26, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I like the new images, but I don't like the idea of &quot;completed&quot; books. Can we come up with some other phrasing ? Usable perhaps ?  Complete gives the impression that there is nothing left to do. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:31, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:That's why I used &quot;edition&quot;; a &quot;complete edition&quot; means it's in a full, complete form, but can still be updated and made better.  It has attained 1.0-ness.  If you think it's too strong though, perhaps &quot;full&quot; or somehting like it.  I don't like &quot;being finalized&quot; for this reason; a &quot;complete edition&quot; shouldn't be a &quot;final edition&quot;.  &quot;Being touched up&quot; wasn't very professional, though.

:Actually, thinking about it again, &quot;Being touched up&quot; sounds like it's approaching finalization too.  I like &quot;completed initial draft&quot; and &quot;All topics covered&quot; for the final phase, though.

Also about the letter/images, I'm trying too keep the images as small as possible kinda inconspicuos, because I looked at the old version and I think the drowning out of the text was what ended the previous development status system.

:I've replaced &quot;guru&quot; with &quot;comprehensive&quot; as it seems be more reflective of the actual status of development (&quot;guru&quot; in this sense conveys a notion of omniscience, which is not the aim of any single Wikibook). In addition, the portion of text that indicates the completeness of various other Wikimedia projects has been omitted as the scheme is too subjective to be applied towards entire databases. --[[User:Taoster|Taoster]] 18:13, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)

::Just a prod at the descriptions - if you were to look at most red books, they have the structure but not the content. The [[lucid dreaming]] wikibook really is approaching completion and its structure has barely changed ''at all'' since the first few edits&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. HSE, among other yellow or red books, also has structure as well as content. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 22:58, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; I understand that lucid dreaming is a bit of an anomaly because it doesn't have much content (and won't even after all the reality check pages are finished)

The descriptions are subject to interpretation.. Perhaps a better system is &quot;testing&quot; a wikibook. Level 1 - Outline of the book; Level 2 - Most (ie. more than 50%) of all proposed pages have been drafted; Level 3 - All of the pages have been drafted and finally level 4 - all initally proposed pages written and checked. Maybe?

Also, I have updated the blobs to be have a transparent background so they look a bit nicer against the style of the Main Page

----

Given the nature of a wiki, the notion of &quot;completion&quot; labels seems fairly useless.  Granted there is an initial period during which the majority of the pages are written, but even established pages can still be edited and revised.  This is to say nothing of pages which may be affected by new technologies or discoveries.  The page revision history readily indicates whether the page is undergoing active development, and coupled with the page itself the stage of development can be ascertained.  I see no reason to append a subjective label.

Lastly, I think the inconsistent use (not all pages have labels) will be highly confusing.

--[[User:Eibwen|Eibwen]] 07:51, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

:I disagree. First, I tried to give all Wikibooks labels on the main page, but within Wikibooks, the labeling will vary greatly. I think all Wikibooks on the bookshelves have completion labels, and whenever someone adds a book without it, I add the label. Notice the explanation of the labels on the right side of the main page and at [[Template:Stages2]]. Note that nowhere does it say that pages shouldn't be edited and revised. Also, the labels don't say anything about how fast the book is progressing right now, but rather how much is done so far. If I wanted to learn some obscure language, and we didn't have completion labels, I would be severely disappointed to find just the introduction written. Again, if I wanted to see which foreign languages are the farthest completed, I wouldn't be able to tell as easily as with completion labels. No one wants to read a page from every language book to decide something we can decide for them. We want to make it easy for the reader - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 13:37, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

::It is entirely possible to browse the wiki without reading the Main Page, and thus have no idea as to the significance of the symbols, as was the case when I first encountered them.  Perhaps the symbols themselves could be linked to the explanation.  Having subsequently read about the symbols, I'd suggest changing the orientation of the intermediary symbols.  Two vertically stacked blocks can readily be confused with a 'B' or an '8'.  I'd replace it with two horizontal blocks -- which interestingly has the effect of appearing as a staircase when taken collectively:

===Time-stamped completion labels===
I created some new templates that should help to provide &quot;time-stamped&quot; [[Help:Development stages|development stages]]. As explained in [[Help:Development stages]], the template is easy to use ( &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage|100%|Jan 16, 2005}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{stage|100%|Jan 16, 2005}} ) and provides a descriptive text when you place the mouse above the picture. (template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{stage short|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{stage short|100%|Jan 16, 2005}} is without the small date next to it and can be used in books). This is meant to gradually replace the old images, and the date (&quot;time-stamp&quot;) helps to keep the stages up-to-date. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 18:27, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: &lt;nowiki&gt;*pokes&lt;/nowiki&gt; towards [[lucid dreaming]], a practical guide* An arts and crafts wikibook would require a ''huge'' amount of photographs and diagrams, and is therefore a major project.

:: Ouch, I think I may have made a boo-boo through my limited command of the English language, for which I apologise. 

:: What I meant was a category that collects practical knowledge about how to apply oneself in different arts and different crafts. I wasn't talking about pottery, weaving etc. as such, although that would of course also fit into such a category. My immediate goal was to write a text about authoring web pages.--branko


===Books: Arrange books by completion===

I think we should arrange the books within the bookshelves in the order of completion (finished books first), and alphabetize the ones at the same level. This would keep the new books that just happen to start with 'A' out of the first slot and, conversely, bring completed and mostly completed books up to the front. It would also encourage people to update the completion of the book (maybe even get more done to look better). Lastly, it would make it easier to see from a glance which bookshelves need the most work and which books are completed. What do you guys think? - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 21:36, 25 Jul 2004 (UTC)

===Books: What makes a Wikibook?===

Alright, I've been looking around various wikibook pages and discussions and can't figure out when something should be a wikibook project and when it should be done seperatly.  In particular I decided to start a wiki project to develop a universal pen-and-paper RPG engine ( http://www.invariant.org/media/ at the moment...if it takes off I will get a domain name.....yes yes I know shitty html pages puporting to have this aim pop up all the time but I want to see if doing this collaboratively with a wiki system allowing for nice layout and some good ideas can do better).  

I assumed at first that wikibooks was clearly an inappropriate place to put this project but while failing to find a list of third party MediaWiki run projects I noticed that there were wikibooks like &quot;Getting a Girl&quot;.  Not that I would object to a serious scientifically sound discussion of dating strategies but this book is filled with gems like, &quot;Ok, first, please forgive me to compare handling a girl's mind with jerking off a dog. The principle is the same. You want to get a girl feel horny / greedy for love.&quot;  If this is an okay wikibook maybe my project belongs here as well.  So I have two questions

First, would the project I described be best kept on my servers/account or get accepted as a wikibook.  I imagine it is best kept distinct (although this makes it difficult to attract eyes.....especially since there seems to be no obvious page indexing outside MediaWiki projects) and that only projects of a more concrete nature belong on Wikibooks (like textbooks, how-to manuals).  However, if Wikibook is going to allow things like this entierly unsubstantiated 'Getting a Girl' guide then why shouldn't my project take advantage of being hosted on wikibooks (BTW is there any page detailing the advantages/disadvantages with starting a whole project or being part of something like wikibooks). [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 11:45, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::Ohh, freegames is for computer games and doesn't use MediaWiki.  I'd still like a page listing all MediaWiki projects (if not least so people could find my project) even if freegames wouldn't be on there and isn't quite appropriate for my project (MediaWiki seems to be the only wiki engine which is visually appealing enough to have a hope of creating a succesfull pen and paper RPG.)

I agree on principal with what you are saying and started my [[Organic Chemistry]] book with something like you suggested, but stopped adding the navigation links after a while because I would change how the pages were linked together. My thought now is to put in navigation links later, when a book is more stable. Ideally, we will eventually have software that will do the navigation automatically for us. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

:Since the Wikibook I'm writing ([[Vietnamese]]) is still pretty new and unstable, I've just added a simple link back to the TOC on every article page, using this code:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;small&gt;&amp;amp;lt; [[Vietnamese: Contents|Contents]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:It doesn't require much work or maintenance, and I can other links next to it later on easily. &amp;ndash; [[User:Mxn|Minh Nguyễn]] 02:40, 25 Feb 2004 (UTC)

As they are they look pretty cool, however this system wouldn't work very well for more than the two levels I have now. Luckily lucid dreaming is a fairly small subject, if you exclude dream examples :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 00:02, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)

===Standards: Book structure===

Does anyone think that the books should follow a similar format or structure? Like the language books for instance, I like the idea of dividing them into level I, II, III sections and the title page for each book is a nice touch too. However, some of them have a bit of poor formatting. An example of a nicely formatted language book in my opinion, is the Norwegian text (I like the use of the green tables for key parts), should we think about making a common layout for these books? 

Another thing that is pretty evident - the way books are set up, using the book title prefix to prevent cross-articles from other books. IE: naming pages like Electronics:Circuit Diagrams or German:Types of Good Beer etc. Maybe we should come up with a way to do this automatically within books?

:I don't think our textbooks should try too hard to be similar to one another. Unlike with Wikipedia, we don't have any easy method of determining the best format for a book except by evaluating it as it's written. While it makes a text look &quot;polished&quot; to be so neatly broken down, it doesn't really help anyone study, and overloading the site with rules is probably only going to drag down people's drive to contribute. --[[User:Jwh|Jwh]] 04:57, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== New main page to mimic the english wikipedia ==

I have started a [[Main Page/test|proposed new main page]] to mimic the professional look of the english wikipedia. Please improve the test page as it is far from complete. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 02:30, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:For this format, we would need something catchy, like Wikipedia's &quot;In the News&quot;, &quot;Did you Know...&quot; and &quot;Featured articles&quot;. We could expand on the featured and new books (with a few pictures), but they aren't as exciting as the stuff on Wikipedia. If you could find some way to present the books in an attractive way, it might work, but I personally like it the way it is. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:49, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== Language books: Curse words? == 

What is your stand on teaching curse words in language books?

: Don't. Why should you? No usual language book does so. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 13:54, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: They are words just like any other, and not to mention Wikipedia has a large entry on the F-word...
::I think you are allowed to mention curse words. Go ahead. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 17:38, 11 Apr 2004 (UTC)

::Plus it is a way to add some humor on the subject, as I'm not even talking about the really terrible curse words. For instance, the Polish language has a phrase, when translated, is similar to: &quot;Your face resembles a Warsaw sidewalk&quot;. This is referring to the sidewalks which are normally caked in dog feces as owners do not usually pick up after themselves :)

:::Go for it IMO the fact that other language books don't do is their problem not ours. Make sure the words are in common use, and clearly mark them as curse words so that no mistakes can be made. Most people I know want to learn &quot;hello two beers please&quot; &quot;Can you tell me how to get to my hotel&quot; &quot;I like you very much, will you go to bed with me?&quot; and some varient of &quot;You like to have sexual relations with your parents&quot;,  &quot;Why don't you go and masturbate yourself&quot; or similar insults. But that probably tells you more about my friends (and myself) than how language ''should'' be taught ;-) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:48, 5 May 2004 (UTC)

&quot;Plus it is a way to add some humour on the subject&quot;: what is considered funny usually differs tremendously between cultures and even between individuals. Adding curse words is not a fail-safe way to inject humour. Having said that, I would like to say: go ahead, write as you like. If somebody disagrees, they are sure to change your text. That is, after all, the way a wiki works. :-)

:Regarding the cultural aspect. We don't actually have to cater to every culture in the English books - we only have to include the English-speaking ones. Other cultures have their own languages and corresponding books, so the problem is solved for us --[[User:Jwh|Jwh]] 05:05, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::But when learning a language, usually one would want to use that language in a realistic environment, such as visiting Germany or France after learning German or French. If we teach them a curse word and don't identify it as a curse word, or don't say that it only is a curse word in southern France and in northern France, means something totally seperate, etc., then we have a problem. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 14:12, 17 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::I agree entierly.  The goal should be language use in a realistic enviornment which happens to include fairly frequent use of curse words.  Of course it would be terrible not to identify them as curse words but I don't think anyone is suggesting this.[[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 16:56, 4 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I think it is absolutely essential to add the curse words.  First of all to get the same respect for a collaborative online project as with a more traditional medium you need to be more overly principled about your content.  Since a wiki project, by its very emphasis on encouraging cooperation, makes people more aware that the individuals writing the information are just as fallible as they are.  It might not be a warranted reaction but given this likely attitude I think it is a very bad idea to engage in anything that might even resemble censorship or subjectivity.  

Furthermore on a more pragmatic note I find wiki books MOST advantageous because they include so many practical tidbits left out of more staid and traditional publications.  Don't emasculate one of the major wikibook benefits just to avoid offending a few people.  This is also pragmatically quite difficult in a wiki-text as these sorts of words are quite likely to be added by people who decided not to respect your nicely worded plea not to include curses.  It certainly seems like a better solution to add a classy presentation of swears rather than let an immature teenager do it for you.  At best you could create all the curse word pages and lock them empty but this will hardly stop people from adding links to these pages and asking why they can't edit them.  Besides you now look like a ham-fisted censor instead of just happening to think these words didn't belong.  [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 22:04, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:This is a bad idea. We're not suggesting censorship as a solution, but rather not to mention curse words in foreign languages at all. It is a bad idea to censor material Curse words aren't at all 'practical tidbits', rather a hinder to our efforts. If people don't like it that we don't have curse words, that's what the discussion pages are for, to work out and resolve conflicts. If the general consensus is against curse words, but the user continues to persist, we can ban their IP address at worst.

:I think you view curse words too harmless. Way more than 'a few people' are offended by curse words. Many people don't use curse words (I honestly can say that I've never used one in my life, spoken or written). As for realizing fallibility, if I, or someone else like me, read something with curse words, the 'likely reaction' is to turn away from the material/project: not a positive reaction. Instead of what you're saying, the likely reaction is negative. If curse words aren't presented, then no one cares, and if they do, that's what the discussion page is for. It's not like people are *begging* to add pages on curse words. 'Respect' for the project doesn't come at all from curse words, rather from not having them.

:A question arises: What are curse words? Curse words vary degrees in English and foreign languages, so native speakers would be best to explain this. But the simplest explanation is a word that has a definition other than how one would use it and means something in that situation. For example, 'rats' is not a curse word because it doesn't mean anything in that situation.

:Teaching curse words is '''not''' a benefit. We have to ask ourselves, &quot;Do we ''want'' people to use curse words in other languages?&quot; - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 04:16, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::Look, whether you like curse words or not you have to admit they are extremely common parts of discourse.  It is just foolish to think that because ''you'' don't happen to use curse words they aren't important.  In fact someone who was completly unaware of curse words would have a great deal of difficulty understanding modern society, at the very least it is important to know the word ''is'' a curse word and whether it is a deadly insult or a friendly saluataion (I certainly call my friends fucker in a friendly manner on occasion...while in some cultures no doubt any use of a similar word is a deadly insult).  Whether you like it or not it is pratically important to know what the curse words are and their cultural position.

::As for the issue of censorship and respect.  The notion that we aren't censoring the curse words but just choosing not to include them is just linguistic sophistry.  I personally believe that including curse words is quite important (for a variety of reasons..some above some below) and you are straightforwardly advocating rolling back my edits if I was to include them.  Let try that again, you are suggesting that some additions to this language book be prevented not because of factual inadequacy, stylistic issues or even for being offtopic (or do you deny that curse words are a commonly used and occupy a unique linguistic position) but simply '''because someone is offended.'''  If this isn't censorship please tell me what is?

::How about the notion that this will give us a negative image?  I simply don't find it credible that a well-marked link to a curse word section would discourage many people from making use of the wikibook.  The oxford english dictionary certainly puts in it's fare share of curse words with just as detailed information and even m-w.com has 'fuck'.  These works decided the benefit of increase credibility outweighed the harms of a few offended individuals (and yes I really do believe it is few percentagewise).  Personally, I think it is a much better goal to create the most informative/usefull work you can than something fuzzy parents let their kids read.  Finally, I don't think this is information we can simply leave to the dictionaries (even assuming language dictionaries of that language carry swears).  More so than any other class of words the meaning/usage of swears is context/phrase dependent.

::Also, I '''really do''' want people using curse words (in english or otherwise).  I think it makes language more expresive and colorfull not to mention increased usage reduces the flak people who do use them take.  I respect the fact that other people may be offended by them and try to avoid them in public discourse (like here..except to discuss that word) despite the fact that I prefer using them.  Those who are offended by curse words should return the courtesy but not trying to stop others from using these words in there conversations(by denying them education/knowledge about them).  While one certainly doesn't need to rush out and put in swears in some begining language lessons a NPOV really does require that they have their own (well marked) link/pages.

::The issue of curse words may not be that significat but the precedent advocated here is very dangerous.  What happens when someone writes a wikibook about family planning and 'doesn't mention' (in the sense of rolling back updates which do mention) abortion.  The example may be extreme but it really is quite similar to the arguments presented against mentioning curse words.  Even more people may be quite offended by the mention of abortion.  You might object saying that abortion is surely practically relevant to family planning, however those who want to leave it out would disagree.  They would claim abortion is murder and is no more relevant to family planning than a guide about hiring hitmen to kill excess children would be.  Just like the curse words issue a group wants to avoid presenting certain information because it is offensive and want to discourage people from acting on that information (i.e. getting an abortion/using curse words).  Similarly there is a valid differnce of opinion (i.e. not a logical error but a differnce in basic value) over whether that effect is desierable or not.  Consequently the two cases really should have the same solution and I certainly find the notion of wikibooks witholding abortion information troublesome. [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 11:02, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:::If we ever do mention curse words in language books, it should be debated on the talk pages for the writers of that wikibook, not here. Since curse words vary in how harmful they are and how often they're used, I think this discussion should be continued when and where they occur. If the writers/authors of the wikibook take a vote or something similar, and come up with a solution, that should be the way it goes in that case. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 18:20, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)

::::Yes, I agree that the deciscion of a vote of the project members should decide the issue.  In so far as the question is 'should we go out and add in curse words' I agree this should be left up to the members of that particular book.  If the question is 'should we role back curse word additions' I'm not so sure if it shouldn't be decided by the wikibook community at large.  However, this is a differnt issue than the one we have been discussing (which since it affects many books seems reasonable to discuss here).  How disputes about the correct practice are resolved is a very differnt question.  For instance I would argue strongly that an ammendment prohibiting gay marriage is wrong and violates the basic principles this country was founded on yet I completly agree that it's adoption should be decided by a vote in congress and ratification by state legislators.  In other words I am offering up reasons why any such vote should turn out a particular way. [[User:Logicnazi|Logicnazi]] 02:01, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)

The page over there can be found at [[w:Wikipedia:School and university projects]].  I did a search here but didn't find a similar page, so we might want to consider starting one.  However, read wikipedia's page for the basic ideas.  The most important thing is to have the students create user names, so you as the instructor can easily track their contributions.

To see a user's contributions, just access their user page and click on the &quot;User Contributions&quot; link on the sidebar.

== Printing: Wikis for developing countries ==

The concept of Wikibooks is excellent, but to use Wikibooks in classrooms in developing countries is problematic: there are no computers.  Is there a way to print an entire book? Then paper copies could be made and distributed to students. --Steve

:Two things would help this: subdomains/categories for each book to define what's in it, and at least a way to print each page (&quot;Printable Version&quot;) like [[w:Main Page|Wikipedia]] had before MediaWiki 1.3. We also would have the problem of links being impossible on paper. See [[Wikibooks:Wikibook Press|Wikibook Press]], a printing suggestion. There will be many problems, though. Of course, most of our Wikibooks are not even ''close'' to getting done, so this is in many cases low priority. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 17:31, 24 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== Promoting free textbooks, how to change the world ==
This is great!  I am so happy to find Wikibooks, and to see it growing!  The down side is the way I found it:  After having a attending the &quot;home and school club&quot; (modern PTA) meeting for my son's elementary school and seeing the uphill battle of their fund-raising, I started thinking hard about how to cut costs in schools.  Something that floated to the surface rather quickly was the textbooks - textbooks are not cheap.  I very quickly thought, Open Source!  Open source textbooks, compiled online by teachers, students, whoever, is the answer.  Of course, getting these into elementary schools would be difficult (politics), but one might be able to break into community colleges and private schools...

So, as with any idea, I started searching the web to see if someone was already doing it.  There's the down side of Wikibooks - it took me a little while to find on Google (searching on &quot;free textbook&quot; and &quot;free college textbooks&quot; - I ended up here following a blog link).

So, here's the point of my writing:  This is a great project!  We can change the world!  Make education more affordable for everyone!  We need to promote the heck out of this!!!  But is what I'm describing part of Wikibooks' current vision?  If so, what promotion activities are underway already?  Who is the top Wikibooks Evangelist?  I want to help!  And if not, who do I have to convince?  Since printed books will be a staple of educational institutions for a long time to come (until every student has a laptop), a long term goal would be to either publish printed docs through a nonprofit, or minimally make Wikibooks available (which they sort of are already, through the copyleft license) for printing - but I think there will need to be a way to readily download whole books (as PDFs perhaps).

Hey, the philosophy wikibook is listed as 'struggling'.  Are there any people out there who want to struggle with me on this one?  At the moment we need authors who know what they are talking about, but hopefully soon we will need intelligent neophytes to assess how useful the work is.  I'm working on the logic section mainly.  This could even develop into an into an independent wikibook in its own right.  We could end up having a whole shelf of wikibooks on philosophy, but perhaps that is a few years off yet.

Nobody will deny that there is an unsightly mess of a large number of Wikibooks (most of which probably don't even qualify for a [[:File:25%.svg|25%]] rating. I propose that the main page be locked like on Wikipedia so that only those who have power granted to them can add Wikibooks to the front page (ie. When the book has enough content to be worth mentioning it is advertised on the Main Page). Some of the worst examples of empty wikibooks that are listed on the front page:

* {{bad link|Hydrology}}
* {{bad link|Forestry}}
* [[Environmental Science]]
* {{bad link|Snow Science}}
* [[Greek]]
* [[Piano]]

== And... Selected Wikibooks ==

The selected wikibooks is a great idea. But I feel that it takes up far too much room. There is a huge amount of space wasted to the left and to the right of the selected wikibooks.

Also, when I first joined Wikibooks there was '''one''' or '''two''' wikibook in each category of the selected wikibooks. I count up to ''nine'' now. Now that is excessive. Perhaps there should be some kind of waiting list to be added to the new &amp; struggling; and the books on it are changed on a month, week or even daily basis.
--[[User:Boit|Boit]] 00:15, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: Well, I pruned stuff which wasn't very new any more. Theoretically we could get stuff off the &quot;Struggling&quot; section by actually helping those books. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 08:50, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:: That's a good idea, '''in theory''' however not everyone has the knowledge or understanding to be able to help. For example, [[Introduction to Philosophy]] - I wouldn't even know where to start. I have never even used Linux in my life so thereofre I wouldn't be able to help in [[Linux-Compendium]] either. The same goes for the rest of the struggling textbooks.

== Languages on the Main Page ==

Why are there links to different languages in the community section on the main page? Aren't these a bit unnecessary. There are links down the LHS of the webpage anyway AND when you first visit Wikibooks you are presented with a huge list of different language versions.

:Done. -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 21:01, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Oh no not another suggestion! ==

Sorry, I seem to be posting the hell out of the talk page, but something else has bugged me from trying to browse the main page. There is so much wasted space around the Selected wikibooks area. Why can't we make a (perhaps red) cell in the table, put it above the community section which would mean there is more space for the '''huge''' number of bookshelves.

: Today I just found out about [[Main Page/test]] started by [[User:Perl]]. I've been trying to edit it to resemble Wikipedia. What does everyone think about this layout?
: Also the main problem is there's too many wikibooks now. So for the [[Main Page/test]] page, I removed the listing and replaced it with the [[Template:Bookshelves]] bar just under the welcome text. And just under this template I added a [[Wikibooks:Departments|Template:Bookshelves (all)]] link which leads to a page displaying all the wikibooks in their bookshelves (in other words, moved all bookshelves templates from the current Main Page to a separate page). -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 02:04, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::On Firefox for Windows XP the tables are not displayed correctly at all. Under IE, the test page renders fine (though I feel it's too crammed, aesthetically). However, since the page does not display properly I've reverted it instead of first discussing my aesthetic objections.

::In the following, let X be the green table and Y the &quot;selected wikibooks&quot; table. Properly displayed (as in IE) it would appear as: XY. Under Mozilla Firefox it looks like this:

  X_
  _Y

Where _ is just blank.

::Perhaps we shouldn't redirect the main page (or radically change the layout) at all until more people have seen it (and testing has been performed on Mozilla by the designer). --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 09:34, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== Graded Readers ==
It would be really nice if there were a graded readers section where kind members might consider rewriting short stories and great works of a fiction and non fiction using Enlgish that learners might be able to cope with (at various levels perhaps). Or is there such an attempt going on already?--[[User:Timtak|Timtak]] 09:16, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== no-table version ==

I've put together what I think is a close facimile of the main page without any tables at {{bad link|Main Page/css}}.  Please check it out, to see if it works on your browser and system. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 14:54, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)

:It looks fine. Great job :) -- [[User:Mkn|[[User:Mkn|Mkn]] ([[User_talk:Mkn|Talk]])]] 14:17, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)

ok, I'm going to move it to [[Main Page|Main Page (table free)]]. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:58, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== Main page locked ==

Somebody locked the main page just yesterday or a few days ago. I don't see any post announcing or explaining this procedure. I think the main page still needs to be changed and is less than optimal (e.g. The first paragraph is almost repeated in the &quot;About Wikibooks&quot; box - what a waste of space! I thought about changing this, but now I can not without admin rights. Where can I apply for temporary admin so that I can change the main page? --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 08:54, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:Sorry for not discussing it, but I locked the main page after it became a target for vandalism, due to a current VfD debate.  Once that is over, and our bruised ego friend goes away, then the page can be unblocked. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 09:03, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Follow up, I've protected the main page again, but this time it is only protected from page moves. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 06:37, 27 Jan 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;Study help desk&quot; links wrongly ==

The link on the left bar, &quot;Study help desk&quot;, links to [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board|Current events]] (which by itself is a redirect to [[Wikibooks:Bulletin board]]), instead of linking to the existing [[Study help desk]]. Either change the name or change the link. I'd prefer a link to a '''Wikibook community page''', whichever this might be. (Wikiversity seems like a project on its own, and doesn't give much help on Wikibooks which is for all age and knowledge levels, not just University related - see e.g. [[Wikijunior]] as part of Wikibooks, but not of Wikiversity..). I'd prefer &quot;Wikibook community&quot; or just &quot;Community portal&quot;, since this would give a familiar look across the wikis. (Study help desk seems related to studying problems, and not problems related to working at Wikibooks). --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 09:09, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</text>

'''Lady finger''' is an ambiguous term that can mean:

* [[Cookbook:Okra|Okra]], a green [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]] from [[Cookbook:African cuisines|Africa]].
* [[Cookbook:Lady Finger Cookies (Savoiardi)|Savoiardi]], a kind of small [[Cookbook:Sponge Cake|sponge cake]] cookie from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Italy]].
* In North America, &quot;ladyfinger&quot; typically refers to a more modernized, smaller, thinner cookie than the traditional savoiardi, from which its name is taken; the two are often used interchangeably, but are completely different in flavour and texture, with the newer more closely resembling uncoated chocolate fingers.
* The &quot;lady finger&quot; [[Bartending/Cocktails|cocktail]].

The '''Vegemite sandwich''' is a simple dish, which is known to frequent the lunchboxes of school children and the plates of casual breakfasters alike. The lunchbox variety often involves two slices of bread, whereas the breakfast variety usually only involves one, and is often toasted. Margarine may be used as a replacement for the butter, however in modern times it is becoming common for margarine/butter to be considered an optional ingredient.

==Ingredients==
* [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
* [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]]

== Procedure ==
# Spread butter thickly and unevenly on bread. (optional)
# Spread Vegemite a little less thickly, and unevenly on bread.
# A slice of cheese can be added at this point. (optional)

==Notes, tips and variations==
* A variation is to add avocado for an avocado and [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]] sandwich.
* Yet another variation is to spread Vegemite and then place sliced onions and a slice of cheese on toast and then place under a grill or toaster to melt the cheese.
* Some consumers assert that white sliced bread will give a superior result.
* Staples of school lunches, particularly from the Tuck Shop or school canteen, are Vegemite and Lettuce and Vegemite and Cheese Sandwiches. In each case, it's simply a standard Vegemite Sandwich with an additional ingredient added.
* Try to add ham and cheese as another idea, makes a very nice sandwich.
*Vegemite on toast is a favourite breakfast food.

Newspaper/garbage bags

Kitty Litter - Buy litter that comes in its own bucket.  Use the kitty shovel to form a depression in the litter so your contribution doesn't touch the side walls of the bucket.  Make your contribution.  Use your kitty shovel (or an inside out zip lock style baggy over our hand like a glove)to cover it up.  Either immediately lift it out or let it set up a bit.  Remove it from the kitty litter bucket with your kitty shovel or inside out zip lock style baggy worn like a glove over your hand.  Zip close the baggy and deposit it in a dumpster.  Drive with the lid closed on the bucket and placed so sudden stops won't tip it over.

The simplest method is to lay out some newspapers.  After defecating, wrap it in newspaper, then tie it up in a grocery bag.  Dispose of it in the nearest garbage can or dumpster.  

Newspaper method #2, wrap in newspaper with sawdust (to absorb moisture) and a handfull of soil, store outside where it can dry up w/o smelling, turns into a humanure compost burrito, yum!

Reclosable jug such as water or milk.  Ladies use a funnel which is rinsed clean with water before storing. 

Sawdust toilet

Several plans exist on the internet for making a toilet out of a 5 gallon pail.  

Portapotty

Gas station/fast food joints

Good for going to the bathroom, though frequently unclean and smelly

Grocery stores

RV toilet/blackwater system

Cassette toilet

Composting toilet.  It may be a little large, but there are [[http://www.nationalwatercenter.org/plans.htm plans for a cheap 55 gallon drum composting toilet]].

According to the Wikipedia entry &quot;[[wikipedia:Rich Internet Application|Rich Internet Application]],&quot;

 Rich Internet Applications (RIA) are a cross between
 web applications and traditional desktop applications,
 transfering some of the processing to the client end.

[[w:Macromedia|Macromedia]], the software company which makes, among other programs, Flash and Dreamweaver, is credited with introducing this term in a 2002 whitepaper.

RIAs represent a set of technologies that SLA researchers can use to create on-line environments. This section of the RIA Wikibook will present a specific set of technologies which may be used for research into individual, pair, and group second language acquisition.

== Relevant Technologies ==
=== Flash MX 2004 ===
Flash MX 2004 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Macromedia Flash|Flash]]&quot;) is an authoring program which allows users to create applications (often called &quot;movies&quot; in the Flash literature) with varied user interfaces ([[w:User interface|UI]]), featuring still and animated graphics as well as audio elements. It features drawing tools (e.g. lines, boxes, ovals, shading, paint brushes), an [[w:Animation|animation]] timeline, and a programming language, [[w:ActionScript|ActionScript]] (version 2.0), which is based on the proposed standard for version 1.5 of [[w:Javascript|Javascript]]. Applications authored with Flash are exported as Shockwave files (with .[[w:SWF|swf]] extension), which may then be run by the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in or a stand-alone player.

GUI resources include...
* text fields (both plain text and HTML)
* buttons
* movie clips
* audio and video display and capture objects
* custom mouse pointers
* pull-down menus

==== Example GUI Designs ====
'''Text Chat''': A collaborative application (see discussion of Flash Communication Server) may be easily authored using a multi-line text field (for display of the transcript), a single-line text field (for entry of messages), and a button (for sending a new message entered in the single-line text field).

'''Total Physical Response ([[W:Total_Physical_Response|TPR]]) Tasks''': A solitary activity might use a collection of so-called &quot;[[w:Drag-and-drop|drag-and-drop]]&quot; movie clips as items to be manipulated in response to text and/or audio prompts. Feedback would be provided when each item is moved to the proper location. For example, a learner might hear &quot;Place the table to the left of the chair.&quot; Placing the table anywhere except to the left of the chair would result in the application informing the user that the table had been misplaced.

'''Asynchronous Audio/Video [[W:email|Electronic mail]]''': Flash's audio and/or video capturing functions make it possible for learners to save their speech for later listening and viewing by others (i.e., partners or researchers).

=== Flash Communication Server ===
Flash Communication Server 1.5 (hereafter, &quot;[[w:Flash Communication Server|FlashComm]]&quot;) provides real-time audio, video, and data exchange between connected applications running in the [[w:Macromedia Flash Player|Flash Player]] plug-in from Macromedia. FlashComm servers may also interact with other FlashComm or [[w:Web server|web servers]] (e.g., the [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache server]]) in order to access dynamically generated data via a [[w:Scripting programming language|scripting language]] such as [[w:PHP|PHP]], [[w:Perl|Perl]], or [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]]. Such interaction is frequently used to retrieve, add, or update information to a database (e.g., [[w:MySQL|MySQL]] or [[w:PostgreSQL|PostgreSQL]]). Though this scripting and database interaction is also available to SWF files running in the Flash Player, routing the interactions through FlashComm may be preferable when the results of each interaction should update all clients or when extra layers of security are desired.

=== PHP ===
One of the possible readings of &quot;P&quot; in the common acronym &quot;[[w:LAMP|LAMP]]&quot; (the first three letters standing for &quot;Linux,&quot; &quot;Apache,&quot; and &quot;MySQL&quot;), [[w:PHP|PHP]] is a scripting language that features a broad variety of capabilities such as text searching, database connections, file management, and HTML form processing (via [[w:Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]). In general, the LAMP suite of software is popular because it is free for anyone wishing to set up their own web hosting, and it allows web hosting companies to offer very cheap (under six U.S. dollars per month) web hosting. As noted in in the Wikipedia entry for the LAMP acronym, &quot;Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, runs software that can be characterized as a LAMP application. Wikipedia's MediaWiki software is developed primarily under Linux, using the Apache HTTP Server, with its content being stored in a MySQL database, and the program logic being implemented in PHP.&quot;

==== AMFPHP ====
One particular technology built with PHP, AMFPHP (available for free at http://www.amfphp.org), is especially useful for RIA-enabled research. This collection of scripts decodes and encodes Macromedia's '''A'''ction '''M'''essage '''F'''ormat (AMF), a data format that allows for the exchange of almost every type of data object defined in ActionScript such as numeric and string variables as well as custom objects. In contrast to extensible markup language ([[w:XML|XML]]), also used to exchange a wide variety of data types, AMF is designed so that information may be transmitted quickly. An immediate benefit of this format is the time saved by not having to program conversions of the applications data into XML for transmission as well as conversion of XML from a server back into an application's data structures.

One of the most important reasons for using an implementation of AMF is the availability of AMF-compatible scripts libraries for the free scripting languages [[w:Perl|Perl]] and [[w:Python programming language|Python]] (the other possible readings of the &quot;P&quot; in the LAMP acronym) in addition to the native support for the format in Macromedia's proprietary [[w:ColdFusion|ColdFusion]] scripting language. This almost guarantees that the particular model in which an RIA is deployed may be changed (e.g., using Perl and PostgreSQL instead of PHP and MySQL) with minimal alteration of the Flash and/or FlashComm code.

=== MySQL ===
A free (for non-commercial use) database server, MySQL (or any other database) is primarily responsible for making Internet applications rich. The long-term, centralized, and rapidly searchable storage provided by a database enables an application to minimize, if not completely eliminate, the data it must contain within itself each time it is loaded. Once loaded and running in the Flash Player, for example, an application can request only those data sets which are needed at a given point in a user's interactions with the system. Free web-based utility applications such as [[w:PhpMyAdmin|PhpMyAdmin]], installed with most scripting- and database-enabled hosting services, make modifying, archiving, and moving database entries easy for most moderately skilled users, thereby insuring data integrity and security.

== Use of These Technologies ==
Because PHP communicates easily with Flash Player applications and with FlashComm via multiple connection methods (e.g., AMFPHP), these connections allow PHP to return information retrieved from a database (e.g., MySQL). This functionality may be used for a variety of SLA research purposes such as...
* presenting pre-prepared texts to users
* logging user behavior (e.g., quiz results or text from chat sessions)
* tracking user behavior over time
* matching users by common interests, languages, skill levels, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">All letters are consonants? What about the long vowels? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:13, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

:I'm far from an expert on Arabic (I've been taking an intro class at university for just over a month), so this interpretation/hypothesis should be taken with a grain of salt (see also [[w:Arabic alphabet]]): 
::* The &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻮ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|wāw}}) and the &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻱ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|yāʼ}}) both can be used as consonants (with English equivalents W and Y, as in &quot;wash&quot; and &quot;yawn&quot;) and thus are considered consonants. 
::* The &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﺎ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|ʼalif}}) is considered a consonant on occasion as a result of its historical use as a glottal stop (see [[w:Hamza]] on wikipedia).
::* Each of these three characters can be used to symbolize one of the short vowels when the short vowel's length is doubled (waaw turns to uu, or &quot;oo&quot; in English; yaa' to ii, or &quot;ee&quot; in English; and alif to aa, whose pronounciation I haven't been able to pin down). They can also be used as &quot;seats&quot; for the hamza.
::* The relationship between vowels and consonants have a different paradigm from in English. We native Indo-European language speakers have difficulty hearing the difference in ''consonant'' sounds between, for example, &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﺕ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|tāʼ}}) and &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻁ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|ṭāʼ}}), as (apparently) the native Arabic speaker does. Instead, we can only clue into the resulting difference in the vowel sounds, which are modified by the presence of alveolar consonants. 
::* In English, we have the luxury of being able to prounounce five vowels a number of different ways without changing the meaning (for example &quot;the&quot; can be pronounced &quot;thuh&quot; or &quot;thee&quot;; &quot;a&quot; as &quot;uh&quot; or &quot;ay/eh&quot;), and of having many different ways of spelling the same vowel sound. This makes it harder for us to learn a language where the pronounciation is more strict.
::* In addition, consonants like the &lt;font size=&quot;5&quot;&gt;{{Arabiyyah|ﻉ}}&lt;/font&gt; ({{Semxlit|ʻayn}}) sound to me like they should be vowels. However, the way we pronounce the letter &quot;r&quot; in English is more like a vowel than a consonant, as it is not rolled in English as it is in Spanish or German (or Arabic).
::* There are also plenty of diacritics which play around with consonant-like pronounciations, produce stops, make letters silent, etc. These are also not considered &quot;full letters&quot;.

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

In general, a derailleur is a mechanical means for moving the bicycle's chain from one cog to an adjacent cog, of a different size, so as to change the gearing of the bicycle. Bicycles equipped with derailleurs and multiple cogs - typically a group on the rear hub, and another group on the pedal crankset - allow for changing the gearing while the bicycle is in motion, which means that the rider can adjust the 'ease of pedaling' to suit the load being carried/pulled, to suit the immediate terrain, or to accommodate for other factors such as a headwind or the surface on which the bicycle is being ridden.

Changing to a different gear involves derailing the chain from the currect combination of front and rear cogs,  so that it runs over a different combination of cogs, and the change requires that the rider be pedaling (i.e. that the chain be moving) because the derailleur is, effectively, deflecting the chain from its current path to a new path, over a different cog

For the purposes of the following discussion, remember that, for either front cogs (chain-rings) or rear cogs (clusters, or cassettes), 'higher' gears involve cogs further out from the center line of the bicycle, and 'lower' gears involve cogs nearer to that center line. The size of the cogs, per se - whether at the front or the rear - does not relate regularly to the notions of 'high' and 'low': being in the highest gear on a derailleur-equipped bicycle means having the chain running over the largest cog at the front and the smallest at the rear.

Almost all derailleurs, both front and rear, incorporate a strong spring which, in the absence of a properly-connected shifter cable, moves the derailing mechanism, or 'cage', toward either the high-gear or low-gear extreme position. Whichever cog (sometimes referred to as 'gear') is involved will be considered, in the following, to be the default position for that derailleur.

Historically, the rear derailleur has typically been constructed so that the internal spring serves to move the chain to the high gear (the smallest cog, the cog furthest outboard), and the front derailleur constructed to shift the chain to the low gear (again, the smallest cog, but the furthest inboard). However, variations on this do occur; Suntour front derailleurs defaulted to shifting to the highest gear, and current 'mega-range' rear derailleurs default to the lowest gear.

When replacing derailleur cables, or replacing or servicing a derailleur, it's worthwhile noting the way in which the particular derailleur operates; with the cables disconnected and the rear wheel raised off the ground (e.g. with the bicycle in a repair stand), manually pedal the bicycle and note where the derailleurs move the chain, at both front and rear. The chain should, in the absence of a cable, move to the default position inherent in the design of the particular derailleur(s) in play.

In either case, front or rear, the derailleur should shift the chain to a cog, or gear, at the extreme inner or outer position. If either the front or the rear derailleur, in the absence of a cable, does not shift the chain to the extreme inner or outer cog, or overshoots that target throwing the chain off the drive train, then adjustment of the derailleur is called for.

On each derailleur, front and rear, will be found a pair of screws, usually closely-spaced and typically marked 'H' and 'L' - &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, respectively. These screws are the limit-stop screws; they serve to establish the physical limits of travel of the cage of the derailleur in question. Independant of whether one considers the front or the rear cogs, &quot;high&quot; gears involve the cogs further away (outboard) from the mid-plane of the bicycle's frame, and &quot;low&quot; gears involve the cogs closer to the center-line of the bicycle itself. Adjustment of the 'L' limit-stop screw will set the limit inward - toward the mid-plane of the bicycle - that that derailleur's cage can be moved to. Similarly, adjusting the 'H' limit-stop screw will set the limit outward - away from the mid-plane of the bicycle - that that derailleur's cage can be moved to, whether by the action of the built-in spring, or the action of shifting using a gear shifter pulling a cable.

N.B.: since the limit-stop screws are screws, it's the depth of each, in their respective holes, that determines the respective limit. The more each screw is 'tightened' - turned into the body of the derailleur - the more restricted is the movement of the derailleur's cage. Put another way: driving both limit-stop screws fully inward may restrict the movement of the cage of the derailleur to nil i.e. this particular setting may render (the cage of) the derailleur immobile, limiting you to the use of a single cog, or gear - at least for the cogs governed by that derailleur. This fact may be of use to you should a shifter cable break and you can't easily replace it or repair it; in the event that the default position (gear) of the affected derailleur does not suit you, or the terrain you're riding in, you may be able to adjust one of the limit-stop screws to temporarily force the affected derailleur to 'default' to a more convenient gear.

The particular manner in which the adjustment of these screws physically limit the range over which the derailleur cage can move varies from manufacturer to manufacturer; in general, however, the flat end of the threaded part of the screw is positioned, when adjusted during maintenance and setup, so that some part of the moving body of the derailleur abuts the screw and is prevented from moving further.

It's recommend that the limit-stop screws be adjusted initially with no cables installed; the presence of a cable, especially if improperly set up, can confuse matters.

The following description and discussion uses the rear derailleur as the focus. With the bicycle in a stand, or otherwise arranged to allow full movement of the pedals and the rear wheel, arrange to have the rear derailleur shift the chain to a cog other than the largest (lowest gear) or the smallest (highest gear). If you have a cable installed, use the appropriate shifter to do this and, once you've shifted to an intermediate cog on the rear cluster, locate and loosen the nut (sometimes bolt) that anchors the shifter cable on the rear derailleur, then pull the cable loose. If you do not have a working shifter and cable installed, manually shift the rear derailleur to an intermediate gear by manually pedaling the bicycle with your right hand, while hooking your left hand's forefingers behind the derailleur hanger and pushing inward on the body of the derailleur with your thumb. Practice this movement before attempting it while the chain is moving/the bicycle is being pedaled. 

Once the chain is running over an intermediate gear on the rear cluster, take up the necessary tool (usually a Philips screwdriver) and turn both the 'H' and 'L' limit-stop screws of the rear derailleur inward from their current positions - perhaps 2 or 3 full turns. Doing so will restrict the range of movement possible for the rear derailleur's cage to something less that it previously had. Put another way, this step is intended to ensure that the limit-stop screws are not set so as to allow the chain to be thrown off of the rear cluster - into the spokes on the inboard side, or into the space between the frame and the cluster on the outboard side.

Assuming that the rear derailleur exhibits no other problems or defects (e.g. bent derailleur hanger, excessive 'stiction' attributable to rust, or twisted jockey pulley cage), manually pedaling the bicycle at this point may result in the rear derailleur shifting the chain to another gear - possible one not at the extreme of the range of gears available. This is because the previous step of adjusting the limit-stop screws has (probably) restricted the range over which the cage can move - to something less than that necessary to accommodate all the gears on the rear cluster.

Once it's been established that one of the limit-stop screws is acting to too-severely restrict movement of the derailleur's cage to allow shifting to the extreme gear on the rear cluster - the default position, since we've removed the cable -, it may be worthwhile to determine that the same applies to the other limit-stop screw.

The derailleur should now be in the default position; on non-mega-range systems the chain should be on, or near, the high gear (smallest cog); you can manually shift such a derailleur using the thumb-and-forefinger technique described above.

While manually pedaling, carefully attempt to move the derailleur body so as to shift to the gear at the opposite end of the cluster. When you do pedal and shift manually as described, it should be that the derailleur can not be made to shift to the other extreme of the range you'd normally expect. This is to the good, as it ensures that further adjustment of the limit-stop screws (to made shortly) safely restricts the range of movement of the derailleur's cage to the minimum-sufficient to provide the full range of gears.

Given that the limit-stop screws have been set to provide a too-narrow range (as above), the next step is to gradually adjust the limit-stop screws (turning them outward, or 'loosening' them) by small increments until the chain just reliably settles on the relevant gear, or can be made to shift to it. The purpose of this method is to ensure that setting the limit-stop screws approaches the final settings from a safe, too-narrow range i.e. a range for the derailleur cage which does not run the risk of having the chain coming off of the gears and wedging inconveniently in the spokes or the frame.

Suppose that the rear derailleur in question defaults to the 'high' gear i.e. in the absence of a cable, the derailleur's spring tries to shift the chain to the outer-most gear on the rear cluster. With this type of derailleur, it's fairly easy to manually shift the derailleur using the forefingers-and-thumb technique described above.

While pedaling, manually shift the chain away from the default position i.e. shift the chain to any lower gear by forcing the body of the derailleur inboard. Releasing the derailleur should result in the chain snapping back to the default, either the outboard gear, or one near it. If the chain does not shift to the smallest cog, locate the 'H' limit-stop screw on the body of the derailleur, and turn it outward a half-turn or less. Repeat pedaling and manually shifting to lower gears, and then releasing the derailleur. The chain should, by virtue of the spring in the derailleur, shift slightly farther outward on the cluster of gears for each small change in the depth of the 'H' screw.  

Continue making small adjustments to the 'H' screw, the &quot;high&quot; limit-stop screw, until the derailleur just reliably snaps the chain back onto the high gear, and that the chain passing over the high gear cog makes no noise (e.g. a chatter).

Test that the limit-stop screw is properly adjusted: turn the 'H' screw inward a half- or quarter-turn; pedal manually and manually shift the rear derailleur to a lower gear; release the derailleur and note whether the derailleur smartly returns the chain to the high gear. You will probably find that the half- or quarter-turn of the 'H' screw has introduced sluggishness in the movement to the high gear, a chattering of the chain as it runs on the default gear, or both. If you turn the 'H' screw outward the same half- or quarter-turn and the result is that the chain does reliably return to, and silently run over, the smallest cog, then the limit-stop screw is properly adjusted.

Setting up each derailleur's high and low limit-stop screws involves the principles outlined in the algorithm above, mutatis mutandis.

Eh, OK. I guess I can see that somebody might think &quot;hard&quot; means like a coconut shell. Maybe &quot;as hard as a lemon&quot; would be better? Tomatos should be kept somewhat cool ''in storage''. Intense cooking heat was covered by the following sentence; I don't imagine that anyone would be tempted to use intense heat for storage. BTW, given your comments on my talk page against changing spelling, I find it interesting that you changed the spelling of flavor. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 16:33, 4 May 2005 (UTC)

Okay, but you would want to discourage people storing them on a sunny window sill, for example. I've changes it to a cool room temperature. As I've rewritten almost all of the first paragraph, I just went with what my spell checker suggested (but not in the next paragraph).

 '''pragma''' Atomic (''local_name'');

== Description ==

'''Atomic''' is a [[:Category:Ada Programming/Representation pragmas|representation pragma]] that can be used with types and variables to specify that the code generated must read and write the type or variable from memory atomically, i.e. as a single/non-interruptible operation. It implies pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile|Volatile]], the difference is that pragma Atomic is stronger: the compilation must fail if the variable cannot be updated atomically.

This is typically used in the context of interfacing with hardware registers, which must be written atomically and where the compiler must not reorder or suppress any redundant read or write. In some cases it can also be used for tasking, but for communication of Ada tasks [[#Incorrect usage|it is safer to use protected types]] or other synchronization primitives.

== Example ==

 Device_Status : Status_Register;
 {{Ada/pragma|Atomic}} (Device_Status);
 {{Ada/kw|for}} Device_Status'{{Ada/attribute|Address}} {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/package||System|Storage_Elements}}.To_Address (16#8010_FF74#);

== Incorrect usage ==

{{:Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic:3}}
== Portability ==

=== Compilers ===

Atomic is a standard pragma since Ada 95, defined in the Systems Programming Annex (Annex C). This is a specialized needs annex, therefore this pragma is not available in those compilers not implementing that annex.

=== Ada versions ===

* Available in Ada 95 and Ada 2005.
* In Ada 83 pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Shared|Shared]] produces similar effects than pragma Atomic (but it is obsolescent since Ada 95).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup 
 |      title = pragma Shared (was Ada is almost ....)
 |     author = Robert Dewar
 |       date = 1996-02-17
 |  newsgroup = comp.lang.ada
 |        url = http://groups.google.es/group/comp.lang.ada/msg/eeee3a7515837ea2
 | accessdate = 2008-05-28
 |      quote = pragma Atomic is QUITE different from pragma Volatile. pragma Atomic in Ada is essentially identical to pragma Shared in Ada 83. pragma Volatile in Ada is essentially identical to volatile in C, and is a feature that is not available in Ada 83. 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platforms ===

Atomic is a portability aid between different platforms. For example, when porting between a 64-bit to a 32-bit architecture, the compiler will detect portability problems thanks to this pragma.

== Interfacing ==

The effects of pragma Atomic can be achieved in C using the type &lt;tt&gt;volatile sig_atomic_t&lt;/tt&gt;, defined in [[Wikipedia:signal.h|signal.h]] (called &lt;tt&gt;volatile std::sig_atomic_t&lt;/tt&gt; in C++). It is worth noting that the only values that can be portably stored in this type are 0&amp;ndash;127,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |        url = https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/DCL34-C.+Use+volatile+for+data+that+cannot+be+cached
 |      title = DCL34-C. Use volatile for data that cannot be cached
 | accessdate = 2009-01-10
 |     author = Justin Pincar
 |       date = 2008-11-19
 |       work = CERT C Secure Coding Standard
 |  publisher = [[w:Computer Emergency Response Team|Computer Emergency Response Team]]
 |      quote = Integer values from 0 through 127 can be safely stored to a variable of type &lt;tt&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/tt&gt;.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the Ada pragma doesn't impose any specific limit (other than the type of the atomic object).

However, this C type is rarely known by programmers. Therefore, the C &lt;tt&gt;volatile&lt;/tt&gt; qualifier is the approach widely used both for volatile and atomic data, even if atomic access in required. Thus, when interfacing with existing C code, the programmer must first read the code to understand whether the data needs atomic load and stores or not. If needed, the data should be marked in the Ada side with pragma Atomic or [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Atomic_Components|Atomic_Components]]. Otherwise, pragma [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile|Volatile]] or [[Ada Programming/Pragmas/Volatile_Components|Volatile_Components]] should be added instead.

[[w:C++11|C++11]] and [[w:C11 (C standard revision)|C11]] incorporated atomic operations and types,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

They started to become available beginning in 2008 in the [http://www.boost.org/ Boost project] and other implementations. The ISO C++ atomics library also provides a C-compatible way to spell those types and their operations (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;atomic_int&lt;/tt&gt;), and these appear to be likely to be adopted by ISO C in the future. 
 | accessdate = 2009-01-10
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;, but differ from the semantics in Ada and are not compatible.

The mixed-model design gets its name because there are two types of variable, a between-subjects variable and a within-subjects variable.

== Research scenarios ==

===Example 1:===

An investigator is interested in the extent to which children are attentive to violent acts on television. An experiment is run with a sample of children: half boys and half girls. Each child views six scenes differing with respect to the level of violence. The dependent variable is a measure of attention during presentation of the scene.

The basic research question in this research scenario is the relationship between children’s attention to violent acts and the level of violence. A reasonable expectation is that children might be more attentive to scenes with a high level of violence. However, this relationship may depend on the gender. We might expect a stronger relationship between attention and level of violence for boys than for girls. To test these hypotheses, a mixed-model design is used:
The dependent variable is ‘attention’.

There are two independent variables: the level of violence (factor A), and gender (factor B).
Each participant views six scenes differing with respect to the level of violence. Therefore, level of violence (factor A) is a within-subjects variable.

There are two groups of participants: boys and girls. They are independent with each other. Therefore, gender (factor B) is a between-subjects variable.

If the relationship between one factor and the dependent variable depends on the other factor, or is at a different level of the other factor, we say there is a interaction between the two factor (A*B). If we graphically plot the relationship, we will find that the lines are not parallel and interact.

Therefore, just like in two-way ANOVA, we test three effects: the effects due to the within-subjects variable, the effects due to the between-subjects variable, and the interaction between the two factors. A hypothetical result of the research example is shown in the following figure:

[[Image:Mixed_model_2.gif|center]]

As indicated in the figure, there is a main effect due to factor A (Levels of violence). Increasing level of violence results in the increase of attention.
There might be a main effect of factor B (Gender). Overall, boys are more attractive to the violent acts.
There is a clear interaction between the two factors.

===Example 2:===

To compare three teaching methods, an experiment was conducted in which one group was taught probability by a standard instructional method (A1), a second group was given additional problems (A2), and a third group received additional problems from a computer that provided immediate feedback (A3). It is expected that the new teaching method (e.g., A3) will be more effective than the traditional teaching method (e.g., A1). However, people might ask the question about how long the comparative advantage of the new teaching method will last. It might be possible that at the beginning the new teaching method is better than the traditional one. But as time pass by, the new teaching method may lose its comparative advantage. Therefore, the effects of the three teaching methods are compared in multiple occasions. In this study, all three groups were tested at the end of the instructional period, and then once every 2 weeks until four different tests had been given. The following table presents a data set for this hypothetical experiment. Assume that the tests were equated for difficulty so that any differences could be attributed to the passage of time. This design permits us to compare the instructional methods (A) and also to see the time course (B) following the end of instruction for each method.

=== Data analysis using SPSS ===

1.The data structure

There must be one variable to define the between-subjects variable.

2.ANOVA analysis

To conduct the ANOVA analysis, click ‘Analyze’---‘General Linear Model’---‘Repeated Measures’.
In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures Defin..’, give the within-subject factor a name by typing in “Time”. Tell SPSS how many levels the within-subject factor has. In our case, we have 4 levels (B1, B2, B3, and B4). Therefore, in the box right to ‘Number of Levels’, type in “4”. Click ‘Add’, you will see ‘time(4)’ appears in the box. This tells you that the within-subject factor is named as “time” and it has 4 levels. Click ‘Define’.

In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures’, you will see a box under ‘Within-Subjects Variables’. This is where you define the levels of the within-subjects variable. Highlight ‘b1’ and click the black arrow to move to the right box. You will see that the SPSS defined ‘b1’ as the first level of the within-subjects variable ‘time’. Highlight ‘b2’ and click the black arrow to move to the right box. You will see that the SPSS defined ‘b2’ as the second level of the within-subjects variable ‘time’. Continue this until all the levels are defined.

In the left box, highlight the between-subjects variable ‘teaching’, click the black arrow and move to the box under ‘Between-Subjects Factor(s):’.
 
To ask SPSS to calculate the means or other descriptive statistics, click ‘Options’. In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures: Options’, highlight all the factors in the upleft box and move to the box under ‘Display Means for:’. Click ‘Continue’. (The means for the overall sample, for each teaching method, for each time series, and for each combination of teaching method and time series will be calculated.)

To plots the trends by teaching methods, click ‘Plots’. In the window titled ‘Repeated Measures: Profile Plots’, in the box under ‘Factors’ highlight the within-subjects variable ‘time’ and move to the box under ‘Horizontal Axis’. Highlight the between-subjects variable ‘teaching’ and move to the box under ‘Separate Lines’. Click ‘Add’. You will see that ‘time*teaching’ appears in the bottom box. Click ‘Continue’.

Finally, click ‘OK’.

[[Image:Tamarillo CDC.jpg|right|tamarillo]]

The '''tamarillo''' or '''tree tomato''' is related to the [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] and [[Cookbook:Tomatillo|tomatillo]]. It is egg-shaped and pointed at both ends. The skin is tough and bitter and may be red, purple, amber, or golden yellow in color. The outer layer of apricot-colored flesh is slightly firm and the inside is filled with dark edible seeds that are slightly harder than those of a tomato. The flesh is tangy and tart, but flavorful. Tamarillos are native to South America, but most tamarillos sold in the United States are imported from New Zealand. This fruit is popular in South and Central America, the Caribbean, parts of Asia, and Australia.

==Selection==
Select fruit that is firm, unblemished and is heavy for its size. When ripe, tamarillos should be fragrant and should yield slightly to gentle pressure. Tamarillos are available from May to October in specialty stores and some supermarkets. They can occasionally be found out of season.

==Storage==
Tamarillos may be ripened at room temperature, then stored in the refrigerator or eaten once they are ripe. They last up to ten days in the refrigerator if wrapped in a plastic. Tamarillos may also be frozen if they are peeled and wrapped individually.

==Preparation==
Tamarillos should be peeled before eating or cooking. Blanching in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes is often the easiest way to remove the skin if the fruit is not ripe. They are often eaten raw, when ripe. Dip in frozen orange juice concentrate to sweeten the fruit and add to fruit or vegetable salads. Tamarillos are also often made into jams, chutneys and relishes.</text>

[[Image:Tomatillo 01 cropped.jpg|right|tomatillo]]

The '''tomatillo''' is related to the [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] and [[Cookbook:Tamarillo|tamarillo]]. Tomatillos are small vegetables (botanically fruits) with enclosing husks. They resemble small unripe tomatoes and are usually green or yellow. The yellow color indicates ripeness, but tomatillos are most often used when they are still green. Green tomatillos are firmer and easier to slice. The husk that holds the fruit is paper-like and is light brown. The flesh is slightly acidic with a hint of lemon.

==Selection==
The condition of the husk is often a good indicator when selecting tomatillos. If the husk is dry or shriveled then the fruit is probably not in good condition. Select tomatillos that have an intact, tight-fitting, light brown husk. If you peel back a small part of the husk (rather rude before purchase), the fruit should be firm and free of blemishes.

Canned tomatillos are available at specialty markets and are often used when making sauces. Tomatillos are available year round in supermarkets and specialty markets. Domestically grown tomatillos are available from May through November.

==Storage==
Fresh tomatillos with the husk still intact may be stored in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. They are best stored in a paper bag. Tomatillos last a week longer in the refrigerator if the husks are removed and the fruit is placed in sealed plastic bags. Tomatillos may also be frozen after removing the husks.

==Preparation==
The husks must be removed before preparing. Wash the fruit with soap and water to remove the film left by the husk. Tomatillos may be used raw in salsas or salads or cooked for sauces. Cooking enhances the flavor and softens its skin, but the result is a soupy consistency since the fruit collapses after a few minutes.

==Recipes using tomatillos include==

[[Image:j0402474.jpg|frame|Model]]


A Model [http://www.bartleby.com/61/20/M0362000.html] is defined as a schematic description of a system, theory, or phenomenon that accounts for its known or inferred properties and may be used for further study of its characteristics. Examples are ''economic model''; ''instructional design model''; or ''instructional systems design model.'' A model can present complex information in a simpler way. Models can also provide frameworks for theory development and research. Models can be procedural (describing how something works) or conceptual (describing components and the relationships between these components). 

&lt;p&gt; Instuctional Design (ID) or Instructional Systems Design (ISD) Models are visual or verbal representations of the instructional design process that are used to guide and complete design in many training and educational settings (Seels &amp; Glasgow, 1998).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Those who are studying and/or practicing in the field of Instructional Technology are familiar with the basic instructional design model, the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation) model. Seels and Glasgow explain that this model is &quot;unlikely to be used without modification or elaboration&quot; (p. 8). In other words, many individuals customize the ADDIE model to meet their unique needs.  Seels and Glasgow present their discussion of the ADDIE model in The Generic Instructional Design Model with decision questions for each stage of the ADDIE model (Seels &amp; Glasgow, 1998). &lt;/p&gt; The following is a very basic description of the ADDIE components.&lt;/p&gt;
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: the initial information gathering activities which assess the what, who, how and why of the instructional activity 
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Design&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: designing the objectives and desired outcomes of the instructional activity and the overall plan such as timelines, strategies, lesson plans,etc
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Development&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: the actual making of the instructional materials including instructor guides
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: putting the plan and the instructional materials into action such as completing and offering a computer-based instructional module 
;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Evaluation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
: checking for the effectiveness of the instructional program both immediately and in the long run

'''''Criticisms of the Use of Models in Designing Instruction'''''
*Can be too linear
*Not flexible enough, too rigid
*Very costly process
*Rarely used in the &quot;real&quot; world
*Could be too specific i.e. only applies to one particular situation
*Could be too general i.e. hard to figure out how to apply to a particular situation
== ID versus ISD ==

Many IT students are struggling to best define and differentiate between Instructional Design (ID) and Instructional Systems Design (ISD). For the purpose of discussing automating instructional design approaches and limitations, Spector &amp; Ohrazda (2003) define ID as a set of interdependent and complex activities that include situation assessment and problem identification, analysis and design, development and production, evaluation, and management and maintenance of learning process and the ID effort (Gagne, Briggs, &amp; Wager, 1992). However, ISD defines the entire set of processes and activities associated with ID and development. 


== Dick and Carey Model ==

The Dick and Carey model prescribes a methodology for designing instruction based on a reductionist model of breaking instruction down into smaller components. Instruction is specifically targeted on the skills and knowledge to be taught and supplies the appropriate conditions for the learning of these outcomes.

==Morrison/Ross/Kemp Model==

The Morrison, Ross and Kemp model has nine basic steps in the systematic design process, or what MRK refer to as a &quot;comprehensive instructional design plan&quot; (MRK, p. 7):

# Identify instructional problems, and specify goals for designing an instructional program. 
# Examine learner characteristics that should receive attention during planning. 
# Identify subject content, and analyze task components related to stated goals and purposes. 
# State instructional objectives for the learner. 
# Sequence content within each instructional unit for logical learning. 
# Design instructional strategies so that each learner can master the objectives. 
# Plan the instructional message and delivery. 
# Develop evaluation instruments to assess objectives. 
# Select resources to support instruction and learning activities.

==School-Based Model==

==General Military Model==


==Beeson Model==
''under construction''

Otherwise known as the IDDF+ADDIE Comprehensive Model for Learning &amp; Documentation Development, Beeson (2007) embeds the concepts of the ADDIE model into a broad, comprehensive model for developing learning and learning-related documentation that is scalable and applicable to nearly every situation where an initiative to develop learner skills has been undertaken.

== The 4C/ID-Model ==

The 4C/ID-Model, developed by Jeroen van Merriënboer (van Merriënboer, 1997; van Merriënboer, Jelsma, &amp; Paas, 1992), is characterized by four interrelated components that are essential in blueprints for complex learning environment. The components are
# Learning tasks
# Supportive information
# Procedural information
# Part-task practice.
These tasks are sequentially ordered and are to be performed by learners in a simulated environment. Van Merriënboer and others (1997) discuss the 4C/ID-Model [http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/clark_4cid.pdfs] as a structure of training blueprint for complex learning and associated instructional methods.

== The Merrill's 5-Star Model ==


Merrill's 5-Star Model [http://id2.usu.edu/5Star/Workshops/5StarWorkshop1.PDF ] also known as The First Principles of Instruction [http://id2.usu.edu/5Star/Index.htm], assumes design principles apply regardless of the instructional program or practice prescribed by a given theory or model (Merrill, 2001). According to Merrill [http://cito.byuh.edu/merrill/] , the properties of the The First Principles of Instruction are three-fold.
# Learning from a given program will be facilitated in direct proportion to its implementation of first principle.
# First principles can be implemented in any delivery system or using any instruction architecture.
# First principles of instruction are design oriented rather than learning oriented.

&lt;p&gt; The 4 distinct phases of learning identified with this problem-based instructional model are
# Activation of prior experience
# Demonstration of skills
# Application of Skills
# Integration of these skills into real world activities. &lt;/p&gt;


According to Merrill (2001), current instructional models suggest that the most effective learning environments are those that are problem-based and involve the student in the above-stated phases. The prescription for this statement is derived from multiple sources. For example, it is reported that current work in cognitive psychology indicates that students learn better when they are engaged in solving real-world problems (p.5). Showing learners the task or problem they will be able to solve is found to be more effective than stating abstract learning objectives (p.5). Consequently, Merrill argues that at the top level, the instructional design prescriptions based on the first princples are:

# Problem-based: That is, learning is facilitated when learners are engaged in solving real-world problems. 

Some of the arguments/questions for this assertion are: How is the problem/task defined? What are the levels of difficulty in solving the problem? Is the problem simple or complex? How is instruction designed to solve simple or complex problems? Problem-based learning is well articultated in recent instructional models. Authors and reseachers in this area of study include Collins et al (1989); Schank et al (1999); Jonassen (1999); Savery &amp; Duffey (1995); Clark &amp; Blake (1997); and van Merriboer (1997).

== ADDIE in 3-D ==

Historically, instructional technology has taken a culturally neutral stance when it comes to the design of instruction. Recent research shows that culture has an enormous impact on how knowledge is conveyed, received and attained. Knowledge then is socially mediated and all socialization is grounded in culture. Because of this, Thomas, Mitchell and Joseph propose that Instructional Technology move from a systematic to systemic methodology. What’s the difference? Well, in a systemic system, practitioners would use a more integrated, holistic, multi-directional approach to the design of instruction.

The writers also contend that because culture is so much a part of the construction of knowledge that it must underpin not only the analysis phase, but all phases of the design process. Hence, ADDIE – The Third Dimension, which would, consists of three parameters: intention, interaction, and introspection. They go on to say that as culture is the heart of meaning making, it warrants exacting attention in the systemic design process. This way, we as ISD will be able to deliver more culturally sensitive products to an increasing global audience.


This new dimension is interesting and insightful. How have ADDIE, and other similar model structures embrace this concept of cultural sensitivity and similar neglected characteristics? Think of the GRE instructions and assessment. Not only GRE, but also SAT and other similar instructions and assessments designed to select qualified students worldwide.  Think of the new international student in the new educational and learning environment. Would there be a new paradigm shift to designing instructions?

== Instability: Not Always Bad? ==

Instability in systems is not always bad. Growth and evolution are both potential properties of unstable systems and can occur only when there is a net change in one or more system stocks.

;Growth:Growth, found in many forms, is essentially the change in the quantities of stocks (levels) within a system. Mostly thought of as a positive increase, growth is the change in the quantities of the system given the normal system structures, i.e. without changing the behavior of the system or the interaction of its components. Different forms of growth exist based on the system’s complexity. All that is required for the positive feedback loops to gain dominance is to have a very small net increase in the system. 

;Exponential Growth:The result of a dominance of positive feedback loops in a system is the exponential growth of its quantities. Exponential growth doubles the system stock quantities each period of time, regardless of the system size or complexity. This growth will continue within a system until it reaches the “carrying-capacity”. This capacity is the natural limits imposed on the system as to what it can sustain. As the limits are met, the negative feedback loops tend to gain dominance over the positive feedback loops. This slows the growth and even can cause decline in the system if the carrying-capacity limits were exceeded. 

== Limitations ==

Resources are not infinite, however. Eventually, real world systems must run out of the resources used to increase exponentially and may do so only after doubling the stocks a few times. Exponential growth in a system may be difficult to notice with only one or two iterations. As the time periods increase in the difference in the previous system state (i.e. the ability to notice change) will also double.

Note: To gain a conceptual idea of the true nature of exponential growth, see examples and explanations in pages 268-272 in Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, Sterman, 2000.

;S-Shaped Growth:Exponential growth continues until negative feedback loops (possibly in the form of resource restrictions) slow that growth. The slowing of this exponential growth in return to a stable system can produce the common pattern of an “S-Shaped Growth”. This pattern is dependent on the responsiveness of the negative feedback loop. Delays in the negative feedback loop allow the exponential growth to overshoot the equilibrium goal then create an oscillating graph pattern. Additionally, if the carrying capacity of the system is overshot due to this delay in negative feedback, the result will be a decline (collapse) of the system’s stock(s). This decline often remains until the system reaches the carrying capacity and regains equilibrium.

== Patterns of Growth ==

Growth in a system can occur in patterns other than the standard exponential or S-Shaped models. Linear growth, however, is often rare. What is thought to be linear is often a narrow field of view of a system’s growth. If widened, this narrow view often turns out to be exponential growth.

;Evolution:When the growth of a system changes the structure or behaviors of a system, instability will occur, if only briefly. Spontaneity in the system or just simply the release of non-advantageous components makes the system evolve. This evolution is the creation of a new generation of the previous system. Evolution of a system is driven by selection processes that effect the growth and stability of the system. These selection processes select against disadvantages in the system, rather than selecting for processes thought to be advantageous.

=== Example ===

Examine the growth of a plant over time. Eventually, the plant’s root system will expand to meet the needs of the plant. However, this root system did not grow in a direct manner. Rather, roots grew in various directions with some roots finding less nutrients and water than others. Thus, the plant naturally selects away from underproductive roots and the productive roots in the nutrient-rich areas thrive.

The example illustrates the process of evolution throughout the plant’s root system (a sub-system of its own). Evolution is a by-product of the system’s growth and periodic instability. As the system experiences periods of growth, the evolutionary choices allow the system to remain productive. Without evolution, the system would eventually be unable to compete with other systems for resources.

[[Image:ARS_HPSI47.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Uma&quot; guava]]
The '''guava''', also known as the '''bangkok apple''' or '''guayaba''', is an oval-shaped [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. It varies in size from a small [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]] to a medium [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. The thin skin may be yellow, red, purple or nearly black and the flesh ranges from a pale yellow to a bright red. Guava is sweet with a slight tart aftertaste. Its texture is firm; similar to an apple. Guava is native to [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]], but is now commonly grown in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]], Florida, Hawaii and most parts of Africa and tropical Asia.

==Selection==
Select fruit that gives to gentle pressure and is unblemished. Fresh guavas are often only available in the region near where they are grown, but may be ordered by mail. Canned guava products are available nationwide throughout the year in larger supermarkets.

==Storage==
Store ripe guavas in the refrigerator for up to a week. Green, unripe guavas should be stored at room temperature until ripe. Ripe guavas stored at room temperature will spoil quickly; normally within a couple of a days.

==Preparation==
The entire guava is edible. The rind and small seeds inside, along with the creamy flesh are often used in making [[Cookbook:Jelly|jellies]], [[Cookbook:Jam|preserves]], and [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. To be eaten raw, guava needs to be very ripe. Guava is typically sliced lengthwise into 5 or 6 slices and seeds discarded.</text>

[[Image:horned melon CDC.jpg|right|horned melon]]

The '''horned melon''', also known as the '''kiwano melon''' and '''African horned melon''', is an oval-shaped [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] with horns on its peel. It has a bright orange and yellow skin with a pale yellow-green pulp inside. The flavor of the pulp is sweet and a bit tart with a flavor mix of [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]]. Horned melon is native to southern and central [[Cookbook:African cuisines|Africa]]. Most imported melons are now from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] has began growing this melon, so a domestic product is available part of the year.

==Selection==
Select melons without any bruises or spots with a bright orange color. It is best to purchase a melon that has the horns intact, as damaged horns may be a sign of rough handling. Horned melons are available year round in specialty markets and supermarkets.

==Storage==
Unripe melons may be stored at room temperature for up to two weeks. Ripe melons will last about 3 to 4 days at room temperature. There is no need to refrigerate horned melon.

==Preparation==
There is no way to peel the skin off of the melon, so the fruit needs to be scooped out of the melon before using. The melon may be cut in half or into wedges to help extract the fruit pulp. The pulp may be eaten by itself, used as a topping for a sweet [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] or added to a fruit or green [[Cookbook:Salad|salad]]. The shell may be used as a serving dish once the pulp is removed, but the skin should not be eaten.</text>

''“Knoppix is… so astoundingly useful it's nearly impossible to overpraise” -- [http://www.slashdot.org/ slashdot.org]''
=== What is Knoppix? ===
==== Linux that runs from CD  ====
[[w:Knoppix|Knoppix]] is an astonishingly clever product. It is a single CD that runs Linux on your PC or laptop. It gives you a full graphical desktop with networking, sound, the lot (subject to suitable hardware). No installation is necessary.

Knoppix is excellent for demonstrations, system recovery, or just testing how well the hardware in a given PC is supported. The Knoppix CD is compressed. On-the-fly transparent decompression gives a remarkable 1,600 Mb of software on a single 700 Mb CD.

==== Can be installed on a Hard Disk or a USB key ====

You can '''optionally''' install Knoppix on your hard drive from the Knoppix LiveCD. Type '''knoppix-installer''' in a [[w:root console|root console]] when using Knoppix.

For installation on a USB key see http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/USB_Based_FAQ

==== How it works ====
Start the computer using the Knoppix CD.
The existing software on the hard disk will be bypassed. The hard disk may still be accessed read-only. When you have finished using Knoppix, restart and take the CD out. The regular operating system will run as normal.
==== Safe to run ====
Knoppix leaves your existing software untouched. In fact, Knoppix can run on a computer with no hard disk at all! After running Knoppix, simply take the CD out of the drive. The computer will behave as if nothing has happened.

The general philosophy of Knoppix is to access disks in read-only mode as much as possible. This is ideal for beginners, because it protects against accidents.
==== Personal ====
Settings and personal files can be saved to a disk, such as a removable USB hard drive stick. This lets you store a personalised Knoppix setup and take it with you everywhere.

==== Free ====
Most amazing of all, Knoppix is free. The latest version is always available from the Knoppix download page. Not only is Knoppix free as in no charge, it is also free as in freedom. Subject to certain conditions, you are entitled:
*To make unlimited copies.
*To use one copy on as many computers as you like.
*To give unlimited copies to your friends.
*To sell unlimited copies.
*To customise it to suit yourself.
*To redistribute your customised versions.
 '''Web link'''

=== What you can do with Knoppix ===
==== Learn Linux ====
This book is designed to help you run Linux for the very first time. Knoppix is perfect for newcomers. Linux isn't going away any time soon. That is why learning it is an investment in your time that will pay off for years to come.
This book is meant for people who are at least reasonably familiar with computers. For example, I assume you know your way around your computer's mouse, keyboard, CD drive, and so on.
==== Rescue and test ====
Knoppix is a wonderful tool for rescuing and testing PCs. I will provide enough information to be useful, without going into mind-bending detail. With Knoppix it is possible to:
*Read files from Windows formatted hard disks, even when the operating system installed on the hard disk cannot be started (unless the hard disk has an unrecoverable data error, or if it is physically damaged).
*Copy files onto other disks, such as removable USB drives, Zip drives, CD-RW blanks and network drives (given suitable hardware).
*Identify hardware, even when Windows cannot identify it (subject to certain limitations).
==== Use and explore ====
Knoppix is a complete desktop system. Use it:
*To print.
*To play music.
*To use a scanner or a digital camera.
*To connect to the Internet.
*To browse the Internet's World Wide Web.
*To send and receive Internet email.
*To try out the built-in office applications, graphics tools, sound playing, video playing, Internet applications and games.

==== Network ====
Knoppix is a child of the Internet. Knoppix does networking with its eyes closed. For security reasons, Knoppix does not automatically run any servers that could be accessed from the outside.
=== Where Knoppix comes from ===
Knoppix was created in Germany by Klaus Knopper. Knoppix is a volunteer, co-operative, community effort. It exists entirely on the Internet. At the moment Knopper is the man who does most of the work on the disk. He does get patches and some scripts from the community, but he is still the most important person.
The Knoppix project is hosted by LinuxTag, which is based in Germany at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern. The LinuxTag team runs conferences, workshops and exhibitions for everyone interested in Linux and Free Software.

 [http://www.knopper.net/ http://www.knopper.net/]
 The home page of LinuxTag (in German):
 [http://www.linuxtag.org/ http://www.linuxtag.org/]

=== Knoppix is Free Software ===
Knoppix is ''Free Software''. It is licensed under the ''GNU General Public Licence (GPL)''. Free Software is not freeware, and not shareware. Free Software means “free as in freedom”, not necessarily price. This means you are allowed to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve Knoppix at no charge.

The catch is that when you give (or sell) copies to other people, you must give them the same freedoms under which you received it. This limitation ensures that Knoppix is free now and will remain free forever.  For more details, see the license text at the end of this book.
 '''Web link'''
 The Free Software Definition: 
 [http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html]
=== Limitations ===
==== No warranty ====
First and most important of all, Knoppix is experimental software. There is no warranty. Use it at your own risk.
==== CD means slow ====
Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) drives are much slower than hard disk drives. This means that some applications on the Knoppix CD may take a long time to start; much longer than they would do on a full permanent Linux system. However, Knoppix has some clever (optional) tricks that can spectacularly speed things up.

Knoppix does not get very far on unreliable CD-ROM drives. Since everything has to be loaded from CD, it falls over pretty quickly if CD-ROM errors occur, or if the Knoppix CD itself is damaged. Knoppix has built-in tools for testing its own media.

==== Not everything works ====
Knoppix supports a huge range of common PC hardware, but not everything. Internal dial-up modems and external USB broadband modems tend not to work. AOL and Compuserve are completely incompatible. Certain cheap printers may be useless. Many cheap colour laser printers do not work. Support for wireless (802.11b) network adapters is limited at best. Certain types of multimedia audio and video files are unplayable. Most commercial DVD movie discs cannot be played. In general, Knoppix does not run Windows software.
==== RAM intensive ====
Knoppix works by loading everything into Random Access Memory (RAM). The more RAM you have, the better. For typical performance, you need 128 Mb of RAM.

If you are lucky enough to have 828 Mb of RAM or more, Knoppix has clever tricks to make good use of all the RAM in your computer. This can deliver blazingly fast performance.

If you have less than 128 Mb of RAM, Knoppix has the ability to use part of the hard disk as if it were RAM. This is called creating a ''swap file''. However, this technique does not work on all hard disks, and performance is much slower than real RAM.

Putting it all together is the work of the [[w:Debian|Debian]] project. The result is called the Debian ''distribution''. This means that Knoppix is Debian modified to run on a self-contained CD.
=== What is Linux? ===
Linux (pronounced &quot;lin-ucks&quot;) is a free [[w:operating system|operating system]]. An &quot;operating system&quot; is the base software that makes a computer useful.

Strictly speaking, Linux is the ''kernel''. The kernel is the core component of the operating system. Think of an operating system as a nut. The ''shell'' is the part that you use. The kernel is the core that talks to the computer's hardware.
 '''Note'''
 There are many different Linux ''distributions''.
 But there is only one current version of the [[w:Linux kernel|Linux kernel]].
 Therefore, every distribution contains Linux.
==== A little history ====
In the 1970s, computer ''programs'' were free. A program is a sequence of instructions that makes a “calculating machine” do something useful. The engineers who worked on these instructions became known as programmers. They shared their know-how with each other. They found that it made their work more pleasant.

Unfortunately, this co-operative spirit died under commercial pressures. Restrictive practices in the fast-growing “software industry” meant that sharing the most useful programs and some of the most vital technical information became largely impossible.

A man named Richard Stallman was greatly frustrated by this change. He wanted to bring back the spirit of the early days that he had known at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
He knew that he had the perfect skills to build a free operating system. He knew that if he didn't do it, no-one would. So he decided to do it, or “die trying”.

By the 1990s, Stallman's [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] had found or created nearly all the components of a free operating system. He called his creation “[[w:GNU|GNU's Not UNIX]]”.

The name is a joke designed to poke fun at the alphabet soup of computer acronyms. Some acronyms have other acronyms as part of their definition. The GNU acronym takes this one stage further - it has its own acronym as part of its definition. “Is Not” is a way of saying “is like” or “is compatible with”.

''UNIX'' refers to a family of operating systems that were used mainly in science, engineering and finance. Stallman chose to base his efforts on UNIX because it was tried and tested. It would also be convenient for other people to switch from UNIX to GNU.
===== How GNU grew =====
[[Image:Linus Torvalds talking.jpeg|right|thumb|Linux creator Linus Torvalds.]]
In 1991, the GNU project still lacked a kernel, the vital core component of an operating system. Luckily, a student in Finland called Linus Torvalds created one “as a hobby”.

In 1991, Torvalds produced a simple, basic system called “Freax”. He called it “Linux” privately but never meant it to be called that in public, because he didn't want to be too egotistical. He made it free because he wanted feedback. It was posted on the Internet by a friend.

Pretty soon, Torvalds began receiving email from places he'd dreamed of visiting, like Australia and the United States. Instead of cash, Linus preferred postcards. His sister Sara was suddenly impressed that her brother was somehow hearing from new friends far away.

Torvalds had used the Free Software Foundation's tools, so he decided to make it free likewise. This was a way to say “thank you”. He decided to put Linux under the Free Software Foundation's ''General Public Licence''. This meant that anyone could use, improve or sell Linux, but no-one could take overall control.
===== It's a GNU world! =====
From there, it snowballed in the most extraordinary way. It has catapulted Torvalds to accidental super-stardom. He has appeared on the cover of ''Time'' magazine. We should remember that Stallman started it all. That is why the full title of Linux is ''GNU/Linux''. In other words, Knoppix is a Linux-based GNU system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Knoppix for the first time ==
''“The most important design issue… is that Linux is supposed to be fun.” -- Linus Torvalds''
=== Overview ===
The purpose of this section is to get you started into Knoppix for the very first time. This section skips nearly all of the options for starting Knoppix. The options for starting Knoppix are explained later.
=== Hardware requirements ===
The recommended hardware is as follows:
*Pentium I 350 MHz processor (recommended minimum).
*128 Mb RAM.
*Either: IDE or SCSI bootable CD-ROM or DVD drive
*Or: 3.5&quot; floppy drive plus non-bootable CD-ROM or DVD drive.
*SVGA compatible graphics card (most cards supported).
*Monitor capable of 800x600 pixel resolution.
*Serial mouse, or PS/2 mouse, or USB mouse.

=== Starting Knoppix ===
There are two stages to starting Knoppix:
==== The first stage ====
The first stage is to get to the ''boot prompt''. The boot prompt lets you customise the Knoppix startup process. For example, you can specify at the boot prompt what screen resolution you want Knoppix to use. To reach the boot prompt, you use either the CD/DVD or the floppy disk. What about some instructions for use with USB???

==== The second stage ====
The second stage is to run Knoppix itself. This requires the CD/DVD. Knoppix follows the instructions given at the boot prompt to complete the startup process.

=== The first stage ===
==== Getting to the boot prompt ====
To get to the boot prompt, follow these steps:
#If the computer is already on, insert the Knoppix CD/DVD. If the CD/DVD drive is set to ''auto-run'', information explaining about Knoppix will appear. Restart the computer.
#If the computer is off, turn it on, then immediately insert the Knoppix CD/DVD. To play for time, press the Pause/Break key immediately after turning your computer on. On many PCs and laptops, this will [[w:pause|pause]] the BIOS, giving you more time to insert the CD/DVD. Then press the Pause/Break key again to resume startup.
#Most newer computers will automatically check for a bootable CD/DVD in the first drive. The Knoppix boot prompt should then appear. The [[w:boot|boot]] prompt is the last three lines at the bottom of the screen. If your computer can't display the white and blue Knoppix logo, you will get a blue background instead. &lt;br/&gt;
#On some computers, you must press a key for the “[[w:boot device menu|boot device menu]]”. The boot device menu is used to tell the computer which drive to boot from. A prompt saying which key will display the boot menu will appear on the screen just after you turn the computer on. For example, on some Dell desktop PCs, press F12 when prompted, press the Down Arrow key until “Boot from IDE-CDROM” is highlighted, then press Enter.
#At the boot prompt, press Enter to boot Knoppix accepting all the defaults (including the German keyboard/language.) If you do nothing for 60 seconds, Knoppix boots automatically. To boot Knoppix with another keyboard/language, see the section “Which language?” below.
 '''Tip'''
 If you have two CD/DVD drives, and one of them is a CD/DVD Re-Writable drive, 
 put the Knoppix CD/DVD in the other drive.
 Keep your writable drive empty if you can.
 This will let you try out the CD/DVD writing features in Knoppix easily at a later time.

==== Help at the boot prompt ====
Press F2 for the [[w:help screen|help screen]]. The help screen is a summary of the boot prompt options. Pressing F2 or any other key cancels the timer, so Knoppix will not automatically boot.
===== Quick help =====
'''Question: How do I get out of the boot prompt?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Take the disc out of the drive, then restart your computer.

'''Question: How do I use the boot floppy?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Turn off the computer. Insert the Knoppix boot floppy disk. Turn the computer back on. The computer should boot from the floppy drive. Then the Knoppix boot prompt should appear.

If that doesn't work, enter your computer's Basic In/Out System (BIOS) setup. The key to press that takes you into the BIOS setup is usually shown on the screen just after you turn the computer on. Visit the [[w:boot priority|boot priority]] screen (it may have another name such as ''boot device menu''). Set the BIOS to boot from the CD/DVD or floppy drive before the hard disk drive. If unsure, check with your motherboard or computer manufacturer.

'''Question: The computer has two CD-ROM drives. Why does the Knoppix disc boot in one drive but not the other?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Some BIOSes can only boot the ''first'' CD-ROM/DVD drive. To work around the problem, start up from the Knoppix boot floppy disk. Then you can put the Knoppix CD/DVD in either CD-ROM/DVD drive. If you are really determined, switch the CD-ROM/DVD [[w:drive order|drive order]] so the drive you want to boot from is the first drive.

=== The second stage ===
==== Starting Knoppix proper ====
To start Knoppix with the United Kingdom keyboard/language:
#Type this at the boot prompt: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=uk&lt;/code&gt;
#Press the Enter key on the keyboard.
#Knoppix will begin loading with the UK keyboard/language.
==== Which keyboard/language? ====
The most important option at the boot prompt is the [[w:keyboard|keyboard]]/[[w:language|language]]. More correctly, the keyboard/language option sets the [[w:locale|locale]]. A locale is a collection of regional settings including keyboard layout, language, time format, date format, currency format and paper size. Some language translations may be incomplete.

The locale options are named using the International Standards Organisation two-letter country codes (ISO 3166 and ISO 639). The locale options are:
{| border=1
!Code
!Keyboard/language
|-
|de
|German (default)
|-
|be
|Belgian
|-
|bg
|Bulgarian
|-
|ch
|Swiss
|-
|cn
|Simplified Chinese
|-
|cs ''or'' cz
|Czech
|-
|dk ''or'' da
|Dansk
|-
|es
|Spanish
|-
|fi
|Finnish (incomplete)
|-
|fr
|French
|-
|he ''or'' il
|Hebrew
|-
|it
|Italian
|-
|jp
|Japanese (limited)
|-
|nl
|Dutch
|-
|pl
|Polish
|-
|ru
|Russian
|-
|sl
|Slovenian
|-
|tr
|Turkish
|-
|tw
|Traditional Chinese
|-
|uk
|United Kingdom
|-
|us
|United States
|}

==== Automatic hardware detection ====
Knoppix will then try to detect the various items of hardware in your computer. How long it takes depends upon the speed of your machine. Here are some examples to give you an idea of what to expect:
{| border=1
!Processor
!RAM
!CD-ROM speed
!Time needed
|-
|Intel Pentium 4 (2.6 GHz)
|512 Mb
|48x
|40 seconds
|-
|AMD Duron (1 GHz)
|256 Mb
|32x
|45 seconds
|-
|AMD Athlon (600 MHz)
|128 Mb
|24x
|1 min 30 seconds
|}
==== The X Window System ====
Next, it will briefly say “INIT: Entering runlevel 5” and then Knoppix will try to start the [[w:X Window System|X Window System]]. The X Window System is the graphics display.

If you have a supported graphics card, you will see a black cross on a grey stippled background. This means the X Window System started successfully.
==== The K Desktop Environment ====
Knoppix will begin loading the ''K Desktop Environment''. KDE runs on top of the X Window System. The progress of loading KDE will be shown in the middle of the screen. When KDE has finished loading, the welcome page will be loaded.

When the welcome page appears, congratulations! You have started Linux, the X Window System, and the K Desktop Environment successfully.
==== Quick help ====
'''Question: Why does KDE come up in German?'''&lt;br/&gt;
You need to specify the [[w:keyboard|keyboard]]/[[w:language|language]] at the boot prompt. For example, for the UK locale, enter &lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=uk&lt;/code&gt; at the boot prompt.

'''Question: It says 'cloop: read error', what does that mean?'''&lt;br/&gt;
There is a problem reading the Knoppix CD. You either have a faulty CD-ROM drive or a damaged CD. To test the Knoppix CD, enter at the boot prompt:
 knoppix testcd
This will make Knoppix check the media for errors. If you know that the Knoppix CD is good, this error usually means a faulty CD-ROM drive.

'''Question: I get a blank screen when the X Window System comes up, why?'''&lt;br/&gt;
Knoppix is trying to use a [[w:screen resolution|screen resolution]] that your monitor doesn't support. For example, Knoppix may have detected your graphics card is capable of 1024x768 pixel resolution, but your monitor can't cope with that. Try setting a lower resolution at the boot prompt. For example, enter:
 knoppix lang=uk screen=800x600
This will make Knoppix use a screen resolution of 800 by 600 pixels when it starts the X Window System.

'''Question: Why does the screen go blank when the kernel boots?'''&lt;br/&gt;
This problem usually occurs with low cost TFT (flat screen) monitors. The kernel is using a ''framebuffer'' console, but the monitor is incompatible with it. Turn off the ''framebuffer console''. At the boot prompt, use the option “''vga''=normal”. For example, type:
 knoppix lang=uk vga=normal
This will turn off the framebuffer console and the penguin logo.

'''Question: Why doesn't the mouse work?'''&lt;br/&gt;
This could mean you are trying to use a PS/2 mouse in a 9-pin serial port through a PS/2-to-serial adapter. Some PS/2 mice do not work when plugged into a 9-pin serial port. Try a real serial mouse.

'''Question: It says “Initrd extends beyond end of memory”.'''&lt;br/&gt;
Your motherboard is reporting the RAM size incorrectly. Specify the amount of physical RAM in your computer at the boot prompt. For example, if you have 128 Mb of RAM, enter at the boot prompt:
 knoppix lang=uk mem=128M

'''Question: It says “Could not find the KNOPPIX filesystem, sorry. Dropping you to a (very limited) shell.”'''&lt;br/&gt;
Try booting with:
 knoppix ide2=0x180 nopcmcia
If that doesn't work, it means your PCMCIA CD-ROM drive is not supported. There is a workaround. In Windows, copy the directory called “KNOPPIX” from the ''Knoppix'' CD to the root of a local FAT formatted hard drive partition (''eg'': drive “C:”). The copy will take some time to complete. Then start ''Knoppix'' and specify the partition that you copied the KNOPPIX directory to, using the “''fromhd''=” boot parameter. For example, boot with:
 knoppix fromhd=/dev/hda1
If Windows is not available, use a single-floppy Linux such as “tomsrtbt” to do the copy, however that is beyond the scope of this book.

=== Getting out ===
Now that you've got Knoppix up and running, feel free to have a poke around. Everything is read-only, so you're unlikely to do any harm to your computer. To [[w:exit|exit]] Knoppix:
#Click the “K” menu in the bottom left corner.
#Click “Logout”. &lt;br/&gt;
#Knoppix will begin shutting down.
#The Knoppix CD will be ejected.
#Remove the CD and close the tray.
#Press Enter on the keyboard.
#Knoppix will attempt to turn off the computer automatically. If it doesn't turn off automatically, it is now safe to turn off the computer yourself using the power button.
 '''Tip'''
 For a quick exit, press Ctrl+Alt+Backspace. This “three finger salute” kills the [[w:X Window System|X Window System]].
 Killing the X Window System takes down KDE and all its open applications.
 Knoppix will then shut down automatically.

== The K Desktop Environment ==
[[Image:Konqi-klogo-official-400x500 b.png|thumb|right|Konqi: the KDE mascot]]
The ''K Desktop Environment'' is a modern, powerful and free [[w:graphical user interface|graphical user interface]] environment for UNIX compatible systems. Its name is a play on the ''Common Desktop Environment'' created by Sun Microsystems in the 1980s. This section explains what KDE has to offer.
 '''Web link'''
 The home page of the K Desktop Environment:
 [http://www.kde.org/ http://www.kde.org/]

=== Single click, not double-click ===
KDE looks familiar to Windows and Macintosh users because it takes some of the best elements from each. There is an important difference: everything is single click. Nothing needs a double-click to make it work. If you double-click, you'll end up with a program running twice, or something else you don't need. Just [[w:single click|single click]]. To revert this to what you may be used to, there is an appropriate setting under Peripherals -&gt; Mouse in the Control Center.
 '''Tip'''
 To [[w:select a file|select a file]] instead of opening it, hold down the Ctrl key and click the left mouse button.
 The icon will be selected, rather than opened.
 It is then safe to let go of the Ctrl key.

=== Context menus everywhere ===
Most icons have a [[w:context menu|context menu]]. To get the context menu for an icon, right-click on the icon.
You'll get a little pop-up menu of common actions for that icon. This also works on window edges, toolbars, and just about everything else.
 '''Tip'''
 Right-click to see the context menu for an item.

=== Hover the mouse for help ===
Like Macintosh and Windows, most icons have a tooltip. Hover the mouse pointer over an icon. A little yellow label will tell you what that icon does.
Tooltips only work in the current active window. This means that if you have two windows open, you will only get tooltips in the window that is at the front. To get [[w:tooltip|tooltips]] in the other window, you must click it to bring it to the front.
 '''Tip'''
 Not sure what an icon does? Hover the mouse pointer over it.

=== The Desktop ===
The main part of the screen is called the ''[[w:Desktop|Desktop]]''. This is where the application windows appear. There are also icons for each ''disk device'' in the system.

Here are device icons for two CD-ROM drives, a 1.44 Mb floppy drive, and a hard disk partition. Notice that the “hard disk partition” icon has the name “hda1”. Knoppix has its own way of naming disks and partitions. For details, see the section “Knoppix essentials”.
These icons are actually hyperlinks. In other words, they are just pointers to the place in the system where the files appear. You can't drag and drop files and folders onto Desktop device icons, as you can on the Apple Macintosh.
 '''Note'''
 Desktop icons are shortcuts. There are no files inside Desktop icons.
 Instead, Desktop icons are just pointers to the places where the files actually appear.
If you plug in a hot-pluggable disk device, such as a USB external hard drive, a new icon for it will appear on the Desktop. This behaviour will be familiar to Apple Macintosh users.

=== The Panel ===
At the bottom of the screen is the ''[[w:Panel|Panel]]''. The Panel is always visible. It contains various utilities and status information.

==== K Menu ====
In the far left corner of the Panel is the ''[[w:K Menu|K Menu]]'' which is just like the Windows “Start” menu. Click for a list of programs that are available on the system.

==== Quick launch ====
Next to the K Menu are ''[[w:Quick Launch|Quick Launch]]'' icons. These icons represent frequently used programs.
Hover the mouse pointer over the program icon for a description of what it does. Single-click on the icon to start that program. Be aware that the ''OpenOffice'' program may take several minutes to start, especially if you have a slower computer.

==== Desktop Guide ====
The ''[[w:Desktop Guide|Desktop Guide]]'' consists of four squares. Each square represents one desktop. You start off in the first desktop. Click in the Desktop Guide to switch between the four available desktops.
To move open windows between Desktops, click the Window Control Box at the top left corner of the window. Point at “To desktop”, then choose the Desktop that you would like to send the window to.

==== Taskbar ====
A button is shown in the ''[[w:Taskbar|Taskbar]]'' for each open window. This example shows three open windows; ''Konsole'', the ''Konqueror'' web browser, and the ''GIMP'' graphics editor.

==== System Tray ====
The ''[[w:System Tray|System Tray]]'' contains an icon for the current keyboard layout. To view the available keyboard layouts, right-click on the keyboard layout icon.

==== Clock ====
The [[w:clock|clock]] shows the time and date.

==== Hide Panel ====
At each end of the Panel is a ''Hide Panel'' button. Click the Hide Panel button to make the Panel shrink to that side of the screen. Click the button again to unhide the Panel. Drag the Hide Panel button to move the entire Panel from one side of the screen to another.

=== Left mouse button selects text, middle button pastes ===
To [[w:copy and paste|copy and paste]] text using a three button mouse:
#Select the text that you want to copy and paste with the left mouse button, so that the text is highlighted.
#Point to the place where you want the text to go.
#Click the middle mouse button. The last selected text will be pasted from the X Window System's ''copy buffer'' into the place where you clicked.
This also works in other window managers that run in X. If this method doesn't work, you can use the Ctrl+C&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;Ctrl+V or the Ctrl+Insert &amp;gt; Shift+Insert combination. The latter key combination is slightly older, but is supported in apps that don't support the former combinations.

== Alternatives to KDE ==
:''See also: [[Knowing Knoppix/Alternatives to KDE|Alternatives to KDE]]''
For whatever reason, you may you might want to try something other than KDE.  Several alternatives exist, such as [[w:GNOME|GNOME]], Xfce, and WindowMaker. GNOME, being an entirely separate desktop environment rather than a window manager, is distributed within [[w:Gnoppix|Gnoppix]]. For more info, see [[Knowing Knoppix/Alternatives to KDE|Alternatives to KDE]]. Once knoppix has loaded you can switch between the various alternatives.

In newer versions of Knoppix, [[w:Beryl (window manager)|Beryl]] may be supported (this depends on your hardware). Although using Beryl is almost identical to using KDE it must be specified at boot time with:
 knoppix desktop=beryl

''“If I ever met Bill Gates, there wouldn't be much of a meeting point. I couldn't tell him about business, and he couldn't tell me about technology.” -- Linus Torvalds''

This section contains important background information that will help you understand the rest of this book. If you are in a hurry, skip over this section. The terms explained in this section will be used often, so you may need to refer back to this page later.
=== File names ===
The following rules apply to file names in ''Knoppix''.
*'''Case sensitive.''' This causes the most problems for beginners. For example, “myfile.txt”, “MyFile.txt” and “'''MYFILE.TXT'''” are all different names.
*'''Long file names are allowed.''' File names can be up to 255 characters long.
*'''There is no “C:” drive.''' Instead, all files are arranged in a tree beginning with “/”, which is called the ''[[w:root directory|root directory]]''. The “root directory” is like “My Computer”. It is the starting point for everything stored inside in the computer.
*'''Forward slashes.''' For example, in Windows, part of the location of an image file might be:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;My Documents\My Pictures\duck.jpg&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In ''Knoppix'', the backslashes that represent the path to the file are written as forward slashes instead, like this:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;code&gt;My Documents/My Pictures/duck.jpg&lt;/code&gt;
 '''Note'''
 What's the difference between a directory and a folder? Not much.
 A folder is just the icon that is usually used to represent a directory.
 The words “directory” and “folder” are ''interchangeable''.
 Remember, a hard disk is like a filing cabinet.
 Partitions are like drawers, directories are like folders, and files are like individual documents.
=== Drive names ===
You may be used to Microsoft Windows' naming scheme for disk drives. For example, you may be used to “drive A:” for the first floppy drive; “drive C:” for the first visible hard drive partition, and so on. Knoppix has its own drive naming scheme. This section explains how the naming scheme works.
==== Disk types ====
The naming scheme starts with a two-letter code for the type of disk.
{| border=1
!Name
!Drive type
|-
|fd
|Conventional floppy drive
|-
|hd
|Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) drive
|-
|sd
|Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) drive
|}
==== IDE drives ====
[[w:IDE drive|IDE drives]] are the most common in desktop PCs and laptops. A single letter indicates how the drive is connected. Most PCs and laptops have two IDE ''channels'': [[w:primary|primary]] and [[w:secondary|secondary]]. Each channel can have up to two devices: [[w:master|master]] and [[w:slave|slave]].
{| border=1
!Name
!IDE drive 
|-
|hda
|Primary Master
|-
|hdb
|Primary Slave
|-
|hdc
|Secondary Master
|-
|hdd
|Secondary Slave
|}
==== SCSI drives ====
For [[w:SCSI drive|SCSI drives]], a single letter indicates its location. This is called its position in the ''SCSI chain''. Zip, USB and Firewire drives are also treated as SCSI drives.
{| border=1
!Name
!SCSI drive location
|-
|sda
|First SCSI drive
|-
|sdb
|Second SCSI drive
|-
|sdc
|Third SCSI drive
|}

==== Disk partitions ====
IDE and SCSI hard drives are divided into ''partitions''. Zip, USB and Firewire drives also contain [[w:partitions|partitions]]. A partition is like a compartment within a disk. There may be a single partition that covers the entire disk. There may be more than one partition. Each partition is indicated by a number.
{| border=1
!Name
!Drive
!Partition
|-
|hda1
|Primary master IDE drive
|First partition
|-
|hda2
|Primary master IDE drive
|Second partition
|-
|hda3
|Primary master IDE drive
|Third partition
|}
==== SCSI emulation for IDE CD-ROM drives ====
IDE CD-ROM drives are treated as SCSI drives. This is called ''SCSI emulation''. SCSI emulation is there so that CD burning applications can use the same language to talk to SCSI and IDE drives.
{| border=1
!Name
!CD-ROM drive
|-
|scd0
|First CD-ROM drive
|-
|scd1
|Second CD-ROM drive
|-
|scd2
|Third CD-ROM drive
|}
==== Conventional 1.44 Mb floppy drives ====
For ordinary [[w:floppy disk|floppy disk]] drives, a number shows the drive number.
{| border=1
!Name
!Floppy drive number
|-
|fd0
|First floppy drive
|-
|fd1
|Second floppy drive
|}
=== Drive detection ===
Knoppix automatically [[w:detect|detects]] all IDE and SCSI devices. The names of the devices are printed in the startup messages (Ctrl+Alt+F1). Here is an example:
 hda: [FUJITSU MPA3026AT]
 hdb: [LS-120 VER5 00 UHD FLOPPY]
 hdc: [HITACHI DVD-ROM GD-2500]
 hdd: [MATSHITA CD-RW CD-7586]
This example shows that the primary master is a Fujitsu hard drive. The primary slave is an Imation LS-120 SuperDisk drive. The secondary master is a Hitachi DVD-ROM drive. The secondary slave is a Matshita CD-RW drive.
=== Partition detection ===
''Knoppix'' automatically detects all [[w:partitions|partitions]] on all IDE and SCSI devices. For example, given a single Windows partition on the primary master IDE hard drive, the following ''device name'' will be created:
 /dev/hda1
This means the partition will be called /dev/hda1 in Knoppix.
 '''Note'''
 Some removable disks also have partitions, notably Iomega Zip disks.
 For the partitions on an Iomega Zip disk to be detected properly, you must insert the disk into the drive before you start Knoppix.
=== Mount points ===
Each device name has a ''[[w:mount point|mount point]]''. This is a special place where the files on a device appear. A mount point is created automatically for each device name. For example, given the Fujitsu drive above, the following mount point will be created:
 /mnt/hda1
This means the partition /dev/hda1 will be mounted to /mnt/hda1.
==== Auto-mounting of floppy and CD-ROM drives ====
Conventional floppy and CD-ROM drives are ''[[w:auto-mount|auto-mounted]]''. This means Knoppix takes care of mounting and unmounting them automatically. The auto-mount locations are:
*First floppy drive: /mnt/floppy
*Second floppy drive: /mnt/floppy1
*First CD-ROM drive: /mnt/cdrom
*Second CD-ROM drive: /mnt/cdrom1
=== Login accounts ===
When you start Knoppix, you are logged in automatically. No [[w:passwords|passwords]] are needed. All passwords are locked by default. Knoppix bypasses all the usernames and passwords of the operating system installed on the hard disk.
{| border=1
!Keyboard shortcut
!Virtual terminal
!Logged in as user account
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F1
|Console number 1
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F2
|Console number 2
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F3
|Console number 3
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F4
|Console number 4
|root
|-
|Ctrl+Alt+F5
|[[w:X Window System|X Window System]] (KDE)
|knoppix
|}
You can switch between the virtual terminals at any time. For example, to switch to the first console, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. The Knoppix startup messages will be displayed. To switch to the second console, press Ctrl+Alt+F2. To get back to the X Window System, press Ctrl+Alt+F5.
 '''Note'''
 The X Window System is on virtual terminal number 5.

=== User accounts ===
==== The user account ====
The Knoppix ''[[w:user|user]]'' account is called “''knoppix''”. This account is for all productivity tasks, including CD burning and printing. When the X Window System starts, you are logged in to that user account automatically, without a password.
==== The superuser account ====
The ''[[w:superuser|superuser]]'' account is for system administration tasks. The superuser account is called the ''root account''. When ''Knoppix'' starts, you are logged in as ''[[w:root|root]]'' to all four consoles automatically with no password. It is also possible to use the root account within the X Window System.
 '''Important'''
 As with other Linux distributions, use the ''user'' account for all your everyday tasks.
 Only use the ''root'' account when you need it.&lt;br/&gt;
 For example, when you are logged on as ''root'', you have the power to instantly delete every file on every disk with one simple command.
 When you are logged on as a ''user'', the system will not let you do that. This helps you to protect yourself against accidents.
 Get into the habit now and it will save you later!

      <text xml:space="preserve">3ds Max is a bulky application, and for game artists, many of the features go unused. This project is an attempt to strip down 3ds max 5 to the modeling, animating, unwrapping, and character setup minimum.

==Precautions==
Don't delete Max's components right off. Create a backup folder somewhere and ''move'' the files into that folder. That way, if anything screws up, you can easily retrieve the files without having to reinstall max. Common sense, but some people tend to be a tad trigger happy.

==Removable Plugins==
First of all, what one person believes is removable may be indispensable to your workflow, so make that discretion before getting rid of those plugins. 3ds max's architecture is plugin based, so the first place I headed to was the ''plugins'' directory.

Taking a look at Plug-in Manager, these are the plugins loaded on startup and what they do.

'''DLU'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLU files are Utility plugins.
They are basic utilities such as the Polygon Counter, advanced utilities such as Reactor, and even legacy utilities such as Dynamics.

COMSRVUI.DLU&lt;br&gt;
UVREMOVE.DLU&lt;br&gt;
COLLECTOR.DLU&lt;br&gt;
HSUTIL.DLU&lt;br&gt;

APOLLO3.DLV&lt;br&gt;

'''FLT'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLC'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLO'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLO files are Object plugins.
They create new objects. For example, if you install a &quot;antmodel.dlo&quot; file, it will allow you to create ants. Found on the Create Panel, in the dropdown list that says &quot;Standard Primitives&quot;. There it will show a new section that contains the object type that the plugin provides.

'''BMI''' - 2D Image File Format I/O&lt;br&gt;

'''DLR'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLR files are Render plugins.
They're pretty rare compared to the other types, but they're still a valid plugin. They will be found in the Render Scene window (F10) under the &quot;Current Renderers&quot; rollout. Click on the &quot;Assign...&quot; button and it will open a new window for you to choose the renderer you want to use. (by default there will only be one renderer showing, the &quot;VUE File Renderer&quot;, since the Default Scanline is already in use)

'''DLM'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLM files are Material plugins.
They will be found in the Material Editor as new material types (where it says Standard, Raytrace, Multi/Sub-object, etc., there will be more)

'''GUP'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLT'''&lt;br&gt;
.DLT files are Texture plugins.
They will be found in the Material Editor as well, but will be as Maps, such as Brick, Speckle, Noise, etc. (usually the maps are the same name as the plugin)

'''BMS'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLZ'''&lt;br&gt;

'''DLI''' - 3D File Format Importer&lt;br&gt;

'''DLE''' - 3D File Format Exporter&lt;br&gt;

'''FLT'''

The majority of the words listed here are either wrong or not really translations at all just the indian dialect of english,

:This is not exact. Remember that modern Hindi accepts English words. While the textbook will tell you that bussines is व्यापार, most people, especially young, will just use बिज़निस. I agree that the page contains real errors. First, किधर must never be transliterated as KID-HAR, but as KI-DHAR, because ध=DHA is a single character. It is the very same mistake as if you would write &quot;nowhere&quot; as NOW-HERE. Moreover, किधर can only refer to direction. Sentence: &quot;Where are you going?&quot; can be translated as &quot;तुम कहाँ जा रहे हो?&quot; or &quot;तुम किधर जा रहे हो?&quot; However, &quot;where are you&quot; can only be written &quot;तुम कहाँ हो&quot;, किधर must not be used here. The more honorific variants with आप are correct too. It will need more work to make everything right. --[[User:Icebearsoft|Zdeněk Wagner (ज़्देन्येक वाग्नेर)]] ([[User talk:Icebearsoft|talk]]) 16:48, 6 November 2008 (UTC)

==Pronounciation Key==
You need a pronounciation key for every language page. Without it, the words and phrases will still be meaningless.--[[Special:Contributions/63.3.2.130|63.3.2.130]] ([[User talk:63.3.2.130|discuss]]) 13:51, 5 May 2011 (UTC)

[[Image:water_chestnut_CDC.jpg|right|water chestnut]]
The '''water chestnut''', also known as the '''Chinese water caltrop''', resembles a [[Cookbook:Chestnut|chestnut]] in color and shape. It is a tuber commonly associated with [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] cooking, but also appears in other ethnic meals.

Originating from Southeast Asia, water chestnuts are actually roots of an aquatic plant that grows in freshwater ponds, marshes, lakes, and in slow-moving rivers and streams. These roots are commonly grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Taiwan|Taiwan]], China, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thailand]], and sometimes in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. Water chestnut harvesting is laborious, making them somewhat expensive to purchase. Processed and canned water chestnuts are widely found in most supermarkets. Fresh water chestnuts are more difficult to find, but are becoming more available.

If you find fresh water chestnuts, select those that are firm with no signs of wrinkling. These will need to be peeled prior to eating and cooking. Fresh tubers may be stored wrapped tightly in a plastic bag for up to one week.

Canned, unopened water chestnuts will store indefinitely. Once opened, they keep up to one week in a bowl of water. Be sure to change the water daily for the &quot;freshest&quot; product.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">As discussed in the Overview, the AMFPHP scripts allow Flash movies and Flash Communication Server applications to communicate with PHP scripts. These scripts can receive, process, and return data to the requesting movie or application. In the context of SLA research, perhaps the most useful function of such scripts is database interaction involving the inserting, updating, and retrieving of information.

== Setting Up AMFPHP ==
After downloading the AMFPHP scripts from http://www.amfphp.org and unzipping them, the ''gateway.php'' file should be placed in a directory of the web server; be sure that it is a directory in which the execution of scripts is allowed by the web server. On many servers, this is within the ''cgi-bin'' directory or a subdirectory thereof. The AMFPHP ''flashservices'' folder is typically installed within the ''cgi-bin'' directory. Then, a subfolder for access by the individual Flash movie (or FlashComm application) should be created. Into this subfolder should be placed ''gateway.php''; normally, this file should not require any editing. For this tutorial, the subfolder will be named ''mysql_amfphp''.

Finally, a subfolder named ''services'' should be created in the ''mysql_amfphp'' folder. The ''services'' folder will contain the PHP file that accesses the database. For this sample application, a file named ''MySQLQuery.php'' should be created and the following code should be placed within it using a basic text editor (Notepad on Windows, vi or emacs on UNIX/LINUX, for example).

 &lt;?php
 class MySQLQuery{
   function MySQLQuery(){
     $this-&gt;methodTable = array(
       &quot;inRecord&quot; =&gt; array(
         &quot;description&quot; =&gt; &quot;Inserts the passed argument into the database&quot;,
         &quot;access&quot; =&gt; &quot;remote&quot;, // available values are private, public, remote
         &quot;arguments&quot; =&gt; array (&quot;arg1&quot;, &quot;arg2&quot;)
       ),
       &quot;outRecord&quot; =&gt; array(
         &quot;description&quot; =&gt; &quot;Echos the passed argument back to Flash (no need to set the return type)&quot;, 
         &quot;access&quot; =&gt; &quot;remote&quot;, // available values are private, public, remote
         &quot;arguments&quot; =&gt; array (&quot;arg1&quot;)
       )
     );
   }
   function inRecord($fName, $lName){
     $dbc =  mysql_connect(&quot;DBNAME&quot;, &quot;USERID&quot;, &quot;PASSWORD&quot;);
     mysql_select_db(&quot;amfphp_test&quot;);
     $sql = &quot;INSERT INTO people ( UID , firstName , lastName ) &quot;
            . &quot;VALUES ( '', '$fName', '$lName' )&quot;;
     $result = @mysql_query ($sql); // run the query
     return &quot; *-* &quot; . $lName . &quot;, &quot; . $fName . &quot; *-* (&quot; . $result . &quot;)&quot;;
   }
   function outRecord($message){
     $dbc =  mysql_connect(&quot;DBNAME&quot;, &quot;USERID&quot;, &quot;PASSWORD&quot;);
     mysql_select_db(&quot;amfphp_test&quot;);
     $result = mysql_query('SELECT * FROM people');
     while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {
       $nameList .= $row['lastName'] . &quot;, &quot; . $row['firstName'] . &quot;; &quot;;
     }
     return $message . &quot; ^**mysql_amfphp**^ &quot; . &quot;\n&quot; . $nameList . &quot;\n&quot;;
     }
   }
 ?&gt;

== Setting Up the Database ==
In the example code, the values ''DBNAME'', ''USERID'', and ''PASSWORD'' should be changed to reflect the specific database server to be accessed. Furthermore, the database should contain a database named ''amfphp_test'', which contains a table named ''people''. The table ''people'' should, in turn, contain two columns: ''firstName'' and ''lastName''.

== Creating the Flash Movie ==
Using the components window in Flash MX 2004, create a user interface with the elements shown in the image.
[[Image:Flash-amfphp-ui-setup.png|none|350 px|thumb|The User Interface]]
The UI elements above should be given the following names:
*top text area: 'show_txt'
*''list records'' button: ''callButton''
*''clear textfield'' button: ''clearButton''
*''firstName'' text line: ''inFirstName''
*''lastName'' text line: ''inLastName''
*''insert record'' button: ''insertButton''

These names will match the following ActionScript code, which should be placed in the first frame of the main timeline of the Flash movie:

 // Necessary class (needed for AMFPHP)
 #include &quot;NetServices.as&quot;
 // just for debugging purposes
 #include &quot;NetDebug.as&quot; 
 // Create the AMFPHP gateway and connect to the server.
 // The gateway.php file points to the services folder (see below,
 // where the service is actually called with getService(&quot;MySQLQuery&quot;)
 NetServices.setDefaultGatewayUrl(&quot;http://www.MYSERVERNAME.com/cgi-bin/mysql_amfphp/gateway.php&quot;);
 conn = NetServices.createGatewayConnection();
 //Result handler
 request = new Object(); 
 request.onResult = function(result) {
   show_txt.text = result;
 }
 // Call the service; name of service (MySQLQuery) must be the same
 // as the pre-extension name of the file in the &quot;services&quot; folder: &quot;MySQLQuery.php&quot;
 service = conn.getService(&quot;MySQLQuery&quot;);
 // Buttons 
 callButton.onPress = function(){
   service.outRecord(request, show_txt.text);
   show_txt.text = &quot;&quot;;
 }
 clearButton.onPress = function(){
   show_txt.text = &quot;&quot;;
 }
 insertButton.onPress = function () {
   service.inRecord(request, inFirstName.text, inLastName.text);
 };
 stop();

After exporting the movie, a user should be able to insert first- and last-name pairs into the database. The PHP code returns a confirmation message both when inserting and retrieving database information. When inserting information, the first and last names will be returned; when retrieving, whatever text is in the upper window will be sent and added to the beginning of the returned information, followed by a list of the names (in ''last name, first name'' order) in the database.

= Possible Uses =
The sample application above illustrates how a Flash movie might access a database. Such access might be used for login authentication, creating a new user account, or saving textual information for future retrieval and study.

It is worth noting that information in a database needn't be accessed exclusively by the AMFPHP code or Flash movie that created it. If, for example, the transcript of a text chat were saved as a database entry, another Flash movie could be used to retrieve it for review by a researcher. A PHP script, likewise, could retrieve the transcript and perform text manipulation operations on it (e.g., placing the HTML tags for bold text, &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt; &amp; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, around words not in the 1000 most frequent words/word families in English).

In the next section, a sample application will be used to demonstrate how text from a chat application might be saved for later retrieval.

[[Image:bitter_melon_CDC.jpg|right|bitter melon]]
'''Bitter melon''' is also known as '''foo qua''', '''balsam pear''', and '''bitter gourd'''. It is actually a member of the [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] family and resembles a [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] with bumpy skin. When first picked, a bitter melon is yellow-green, but as it ripens, it turns to a yellow-orange color. The inside of the melon is filled with fibrous seeds. Bitter melon is used mostly in [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|Asian]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] cooking. Bitter melon plants are considered an invasive weed in Florida.

Bitter melon has some interesting effects on humans. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment for diabetes and to cause abortions. It impedes many things: viruses, bacteria, tumors... and the immune system. It lowers blood cholesterol. It is a laxative.

Bitter melon has lots of potassium and vitamin C. The ripe orange fruit has lots of beta-carotene, and the intensely red ripe seeds have lots of lycopene.

==Selection==
Select firm, unblemished melons that are from 5 to 12 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] in length. Choose melons that are still green for a more bitter flavor and a yellow-orange melon for a milder taste. 
==Storage==
Store melon loose in a paper or plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days. Slice the melon immediately before use.

==Preparation==
Cut in half and discard the seeds and fibrous core. It is indeed 'bitter', even if grilled; not a pleasant taste. To reduce the bitterness, blanch in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. The skin is edible and the melon is not typically peeled. The seeds are also edible, unless very hard, and are included in some recipes. Bitter melon is commonly stuffed, curried or [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]]. It can also be used in [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fry]] and [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] and may be [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]]. [[Cookbook:Garlic|Garlic]] or [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] are often added to recipes with bitter melon to offset the bitter taste.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Bitter Melon|1|1|1|3|3|3|3|3|3|1|1|1}}

Bitter melons are available fresh from April to September in most Asian markets and can occasionally be found in larger supermarkets. They are primarily grown in tropical climates, including East Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and South America. Some markets are beginning to carry bitter melons year round. They may also be purchased canned or dried. [http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/5ADay/month/exotic_vegetables.htm][http://www.bittermelon.org/]

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Setting Up AMFPHP ==
As in the example of basic database interaction, the AMFPHP scripts from http://www.amfphp.org should be unzipped, and the ''gateway.php'' file should be placed in a directory of the web server. Also, the AMFPHP ''flashservices'' folder should be installed within the ''cgi-bin'' directory. Then, a subfolder which will be accessed by the Flash movie (for login purposes) and the FlashComm application (for saving chat text) should be created. Into this subfolder should be placed ''gateway.php''; normally, this file should not require any editing. For this tutorial, the subfolder will be named ''AMFPHPChat''.

In the ''AMFPHPChat'' folder, a subfolder named ''services'' should be created. The ''services'' folder will contain the PHP file that accesses the database on behalf of both the Flash movie and the FlashComm application. For this sample application, a file named ''DBServices.php'' should be created and the following code should be placed within it using a basic text editor (Notepad on Windows, vi or emacs on UNIX/LINUX, for example).

[[Image:calabaza_CDC.jpg|right|calabaza]]
'''Calabaza''' or '''calabaza squash''', also known as the '''West Indian pumpkin''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]-like [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] that is round in shape and varies in size. It can be as large as a [[Cookbook:Watermelon|watermelon]] or as small as a [[Cookbook:Cantaloupe|cantaloupe]]. The color of calabaza can also vary and may include greens, tans, reds and oranges. Some squash are all one color while other calabaza are multi-colored and may include all of colors listed above. This squash is popular in the Caribbean as well as Central and South America.

==Selection==
Calabaza is often sold already chopped into chunks in many Latin markets. This is because of the difficulty many have in chopping the whole squash. Select pieces with a fresh, moist and unblemished flesh. Soft or wet spots means the squash is beginning to spoil. The color of the flesh should be a bright orange. Whole squash are more difficult to find, but if you find one, select one that still has the stem attached and is heavy for its size. You should avoid purchasing a squash with bruises, cuts, or soft spots. Calabaza is available year round.

==Storage==
Whole calabaza may be stored in a cool, dry space for up to 6 weeks. Cut calabaza should be wrapped tightly or placed in a covered container in the refrigerated for no more than one week.

==Preparation==
Whole calabaza may be difficult to slice. Slicing through the tough rind often calls for a heavy cleaver or a very sharp knife. If the squash resists slicing, remove the stem and place the knife or cleaver blade along the squash’s length. Gently tap the blade with a hammer until the squash falls open. Scoop out the seeds, peel and prepare!

Calabaza has a sweet flavor and its texture is firm. This is similar to the taste and texture of more familiar varieties of squash, such as [[Cookbook:Butternut Squash|butternut]] or [[Cookbook:Acorn Squash|acorn]]. Calabaza may be substituted in recipes calling for those more common types of squash.

Calabaza is most commonly [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], either cut in sections or in cubes. Its seeds may also be roasted in a similar way as pumpkin seeds. Simply place on a [[Cookbook:Baking Sheet|baking sheet]] coated in [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] until brown and crisp, optionally with a bit of [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] on top.</text>

[[Image:chayote_CDC.jpg|right|chayote]]
'''Chayote''', also called '''mirliton''' or '''choko''', is a gourd-like [[Cookbook:Squash|squash]] that is about the size and shape of a very large [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]. The skin is pale green and smooth with slight ridges that run lengthwise. Many compare the color to a light green [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]]. The flesh is white and there is one soft seed in the middle. Chayote is grown in the US in several states including California, Florida, and Louisiana, and throughout South and East Asia, where they are harvested much larger than in the Americas, but it is native to Latin America. Historically, this squash was one of the primary foods of the Aztecs and Mayas.

==Selection==
Select squash that are small, firm and unblemished; just as you would select a pear. Choose squash that is heavy for its size. Tender skin, skin that reacts to pressure, often means poor quality. Chayote is commonly found in supermarkets during peak season (December to March), but may be found in larger supermarkets and specialty markets throughout the year. It is common to score the flesh of the squash with one's fingernails to test for ripeness, so be wary of such marks when selecting a squash. 

==Storage==
Refrigerate whole chayote in a plastic bag for up to one month. Cut chayote may be refrigerated in a covered container or tightly wrapped for 3 to 5 days. It is best to use chopped chayote immediately, as it can gather flavors from other foods stored in the refrigerator.

==Preparation==
Chayote has a bland-tasting flesh that may be used in several ways. It may be prepared in similar ways to other summer squash, such as [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]], but may require peeling and a bit more seasoning. Chayote is most commonly used in side dishes, [[Cookbook:Stew|stews]], and [[:Category:Casserole recipes|casseroles]]. It may also be sliced in half and [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] or [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] whole and eaten plain. It is also used in mild curries in [[Cookbook:Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian cuisine]]. The soft seed is edible, but many choose to remove it.

[[Image:Have-23.jpg|thumb|right|star fruit]]
The '''star fruit''', sometimes called the '''carambola''' or '''star apple''', is a tropical fruit that is gaining popularity. This fruit acquired its name from the five pointed star shape when cut across the middle of the fruit. It has a waxy, golden yellow to green color skin with a complicated flavor combination that includes [[Cookbook:Plum|plums]], [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapples]], and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]]. It is usually quite sour.

Two types of star fruit are grown, tart and sweet. Tart varieties typically have narrowly spaced ribs, while sweet varieties tend to have thick, fleshy ribs. The tastes between the two are hardly distinguishable. The fruit is readily available July through February.

==Selection==
Select firm, shiny skinned, even colored fruit. Star fruits will ripen at room temperature and have lightly brown edges on the ribs when it’s ripe. Avoid purchasing star fruit with brown, shriveled ribs. This delicious fruit is also available dried.
 
==Storage==
Non-ripe star fruit should be turned often, until they are yellow in color and ripe with light brown ribs. Store ripe star fruits at room temperature for two to three days or unwashed, and refrigerated, in a plastic bag for up to one week.

==Preparation==
Star fruits are great to eat out of hand as these tropical delights do not need to be peeled or seeded before eating. Simply wash the fruit, remove any blemished areas, cut crosswise to get the star shape, and eat!</text>

== Setting Up The Timeline ==
In Flash MX 2004, create a timeline with the following layers, keyframes, and labels.
[[Image:AMFPHPChat-timeline-setup.png|none]]
Note that the ActionScript for this movie will be placed in the ''CSAS'' layer.

== Creating the User Interface ==
=== Login Keyframe ===
Add user interface elements to the ''UI'' layer so that your movie resembles this image.
[[Image:AMFPHPChat-login-frame-UI.png|none]]
Name the interface elements as follows:
*''user name'' text area: ''username_txt''
*''password'' text area: ''password_txt''
*''Enter'' button: ''enter_pb''
*bottom text area: ''output_txt''

=== Wait Keyframe ===
Add a line of text as in this image.
[[Image:AMFPHPChat-wait-frame-UI.png|none]]

=== Chat Researcher Keyframe ===
Add user interface elements to the ''UI'' layer so that your movie resembles this image.
[[Image:AMFPHPChat-chat researcher-frame-UI.png|none]]
Name the interface elements as follows:
*AudioConference communication component: ''audioChat_mc''
*SetBandwidth communication component: ''bw_mc''
*''Ring Bell'' button: ''bell_pb''
*UserColor communication component: ''userColor_mc''
*large text area: ''chat''
*single line text area: ''chatIn''
*''Send'' button: ''chat_bt''

Set the click handlers for the following buttons:
*''Save Text'' button: ''writeSSText''
*''End Session'' button: ''endSession''
*''Ring Bell'' button: ''dingDong''
*''Send'' button: ''addText''

=== Chat Subject Keyframe ===
Follow the instructions for the Chat Researcher keyframe, with the exception of the ''Save Text'' and ''End Session'' buttons, which should be omitted. The movie should resemble this image.

=== Chat Subject Keyframe ===
'''NOTE''': The ''chat_subject'' keyframe can use the same code as the ''chat_researcher'' keyframe because the text-writing and session-ending code cannot be accessed without the UI buttons in the ''chat_researcher'' keyframe.

=== Synchronization and Status Handler Code ===
'''NOTE''': The following code should be placed in a file named ''synchAndStatusHandler.as''. This code is useful for debugging in the Flash MX 2004 authoring environment. It reports all synchronization messages (e.g., successes and errors) and status messages. Code could be added to respond to specific events such as errors in connecting or unexpected disconnections.

 // AMFPHPChat
 // *TEMPLATE* synchAndStatusHandler - CSAS/SSAS - &quot;#include&quot; file
 //
 onSyncTemplate = function (info) {
   trace(&quot;Data Synchronizing&quot;);
   // 
   // This structure may be used as a prototype for onSync handlers.
   //
   // First, loop through the array of objects with the IN operator
   // 
   for (name in info) {
     trace(&quot;[sync] Array Object #&quot;+name+&quot;  code(&quot;+info[name].code+&quot;,&quot;+info[name].name+&quot;)&quot;);

[[File:Pyrus pyrifolia.jpg|thumb|Asian pear]]
'''Asian pears''' are related to the pears that are typically seen in grocery stores, but this fruit is similar to an apple and its many names reflect that characteristic. Other names that this fruit goes by are: '''Chinese pear''', '''Japanese pear''', '''Sand''', '''Nashi''', and '''apple pear'''.

Asian pears are usually round, firm to touch when ripe, and ready to eat after harvest. Asian pears reach prime quality when they ripen on the tree, like apples and peaches do. Asian pears will be crisp, juicy, and slightly sweet with some tartness, especially near the core.

There are several Asian pear varieties available. Japanese pears are more round in shape, while the Chinese pears are more oval or pyriform (pear-shaped).

In the United States, the Japanese type of Asian pear called 20th Century or Nijisseki is the most popular. It is easily identified with its round shape and smooth yellow skin. Other common varieties include the Japanese bronze-toned Hosui pear and the pear-shaped Ya Li, a pale-green Chinese variety.

==Selection==
Select the most fragrant and unbruised fruit with little to no brown spots. Ripe Asian pears are hard and do not soften. They are ready to eat when purchased.

==Seasonality==
[[File:Pyrus pyrifolia var culta2.jpg|thumb|211x211px|Flowers appear early in spring]]
{{Seasonality|Asian Pears|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|1|1|1}}
The harvest season in the northern hemisphere usually begins in mid July, in southern regions, and lasts until mid September, when Asian pears are harvested in regions further north. [http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-1131/]

==Storage==
Asian pears are known for keeping well. Store pears a week at room temperature or up to three months in the refrigerator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The TeX for this page was a bit broken, and it also made use of \Re for representing the reals whereas the remainder of the text contributed to this effort appears to make use of the doublestruck R for representing the reals. There are other style changes that I would make, but I do not think that it is my place to make such decisions for the author-- who in all likelihood will be responsible for finishing what has been written--and I am not currently in a position to usurp the responsibility.

Oh yes you are in that position.  &quot;Be bold&quot; or whatnot.

The &quot;Numbers and Algorithms&quot; section should be junked.  It is redundant, considering that the previous section introduces numbers.  The introductory material should be left to that section too.</text>

[[Image:nectarine_CDC.jpg|right]]
[[Image:Stewed nectarines.JPG|thumb|right|Stewed nectarines]]
The '''nectarine''' is a stone fruit related to the [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]], [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricot]], and [[Cookbook:Peach|peach]]. Nectarine flesh tastes and feels somewhat like [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]] flesh, and almost identical to peach flesh. Freestone nectarines have flesh that separates easily from the pit. Cling nectarines have flesh that clings to the pit.

Choose nectarines with a strong and pleasant smell. Nectarines will soften if left around, but will not gain a nice ripe taste and smell. Do not refrigerate nectarines.

Use peach recipes with nectarines.</text>

[[Image:prickly_pear_CDC.jpg|right|prickly pear]]
The '''prickly pear''' is a cactus fruit. It is 2 to 4 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long and shaped like an [[Cookbook:Avocado|avocado]]. Its skin is coarse and thick, not unlike an avocado's and it ranges in color from yellow or orange to magenta or red. Tubercles with small prickly spines can be found on the prickly pear’s skin. This fruit’s flesh, which ranges in color also from yellow to dark red, is sweet and juicy with crunchy seeds throughout. It grows covered with needles like the rest of the cactus. When purchased at the grocery store, these should already have been removed. It's still wise to handle the fruit carefully because some of the smaller nearly-invisible needles can remain on the fruit. The needles can get stuck in bare hands where they create a tiny, aggravating points of pain.

The fruit is firm, with an inedible rind, a watery interior and large, hard black seeds. It has a mild flavor similar to [[Cookbook:Watermelon|watermelon]]. It can be eaten raw, or made into [[Cookbook:Jelly|jellies]] and syrups. Prickly pear syrup is available throughout the southwestern United States, and is often used in margaritas. The prickly pear can be diced like [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] and used as a topping on [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]] or [[Cookbook:Cereal|cereal]] or blended into a smoothie.

[[Image:edible_cactus_CDC.jpg|right|edible cactus]]
'''Edible cactus''' is also known as '''nopales''' (no-PAH-les), '''nopalitos''', '''cactus paddles''', or '''cactus pads'''. This vegetable is popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and other Central American countries, parts of [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]], the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]], North Africa and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]]. Its popularity is increasing in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], where it can be found at Mexican grocery stores, specialty produce markets and farmer’s markets.

Edible cactus is characterized by its fleshy oval leaves (typically called pads or paddles) of the nopal ([[Cookbook:Prickly Pear|prickly pear]]) cactus.

With a soft but crunchy texture that also becomes a bit sticky (not unlike [[Cookbook:Okra|okra]]) when cooked, edible cactus tastes similar to a slightly tart [[Cookbook:Green Bean|green bean]], [[Cookbook:Asparagus|asparagus]], or [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|green pepper]].

Cactus pads contain beta carotene, iron, some B vitamins, and are good sources of both vitamin C and calcium. 

==Availability, Selection, and Storage==
Edible cactus is available year-round with a peak in the mid-spring and the best season from early spring through late fall. When buying edible cactus, choose small, firm, pale green cacti with no wrinkling. Be sure to pick cacti that are not limp or dry. Very small paddles may require more cleaning because their larger proportion of prickers and eyes.
Edible cactus can be refrigerated for more than a week if wrapped tightly in plastic.

Edible cactus is also sold as:

* Canned — [[Cookbook:Pickling|pickled]] or packed in water
* Acitrones — candied nopales, packed in [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] syrup and available in cans or jars.

==Preparation==
The edible cactus you buy should be de-spined though you will need to trim the “eyes” to remove any remaining prickers, and outside edges of the pads with a vegetable [[Cookbook:Peeler|peeler]]. Trim off any dry or fibrous areas and rinse thoroughly to remove any stray prickers and sticky fluid.

Edible cactus can be eaten raw or cooked. To cook, [[Cookbook:Steaming|steam]] over [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] water for just a few minutes (if cooked too long they will lose their crunchy texture). Then slice and eat! Cactus can also be cut and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]] in [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] or [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] for a few minutes.

Steamed cactus can be added to [[Cookbook:Scrambled Eggs|scrambled eggs]] and [[Cookbook:Omelet|omelets]], or diced fresh and added to [[Cookbook:Tortilla|tortillas]]. They can also be substituted for any cooked green in most dishes.

The pads can be served as a side dish or cooled and used in [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]]. They taste especially good with Mexican recipes that include [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]], [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|hot peppers]] and fresh [[Cookbook:Corn|corn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px;&quot;&gt;
{{user language|en|0|category=}}
{{user language|en|1|category=}}
{{user language|en|2|category=}}
{{user language|en|3|category=}}
{{user language|en|4|category=}}

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
This page explains the {{tlx|user language}} template, which is a framework for displaying the language abilities of users on their user page. This helps with communication by listing which languages, and how much of each, users can understand. 

To find someone who speaks a particular language, see [[:Category:Users by language|users by language]], and follow the links. For the most part, the two and three letter codes are taken from [[w:ISO 639|ISO 639]], but see the list below for a comprehensive guide.
{{clear}}

==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{user language|fr|N}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Copy and paste the example code above, and replace &quot;fr&quot; with the desired language's code (see the list below) and &quot;N&quot; with one of the following characters representing your fluency level:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Level
! Description
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 0
| The user cannot communicate at all in that language.
|-
! 1
| Elementary; the user is able to write very simple questions and statements, and might be able to understand more complex sentences with difficulty. Their vocabulary is limited (excluding understanding based on similarity with other languages).
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 2
| Intermediate; the user can participate in simple discussions using simple sentence constructions, but needs help with more advanced vocabulary or structures. 
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 3
| Advanced; the user can effectively participate in discussions with native speakers, and can participate in technical discussions with relative confidence. They have a good grasp of grammar and their errors virtually never interfere with understanding.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 4
| Near native; the user can read and write fluently and accurately at all levels of normal discussion, including technical discussions. The user can reasonably pass off as a native speaker in written discussion, and makes few errors.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! N
| Native speaker; the user has spoken the language from birth, and has a large vocabulary and an intuitive understanding of grammar. The user can participate in all levels of discussions with ease, and can understand most errors in others' writing.
|}

==Customizing the format==
It is possible to customize the behavior and appearance of the template with the following override parameters (for example, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{user language|fr|N|align=left}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! align
| Set the alignment on the page. Possible values are left, center, and right (default). This also sets appropriate clearing, so that the boxes will stack automatically in that position (you can override this with the &quot;css-box&quot; override below).
|-
! css-box
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the box.
|-
! css-left
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the left cell.
|-
! css-right
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the right (main) cell.
|-
! category
| Setting this parameter to empty (&lt;code&gt;category=&lt;/code&gt;) displays the language box without categorizing the page. For the opposite effect, categorizing the page without displaying the box, see the {{tlx|User language/category}} template.
|}

==Using with userboxes==
You can use top and bottom templates to group the user language template(s) and other [[Wikibooks:Userboxes|userboxes]] together. Format: {{tlx|Userboxtop}}&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{user language|xx|#}}{{user blah}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;{{tlx|Userboxbottom}}

==Languages supported==
The languages supported by the template are listed alphabetically by their [[w:ISO 639|ISO 639]] code.

== Cantonese Romanization ==
Seeing how I am the first big contributor to this wikibook, I felt I had to make a decision about the romanization system (otherwise no one could begin editing the lessons!).  So I chose [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]] because it's promted by the [[w:Linguistic Society of Hong Kong|Linguistic Society of Hong Kong]] and aspires to be a standard. Well, I am into writing the first lesson and I am beginning to have regrets:  

# Out of all the Cantonese references I have, not one uses Jyutping.  I have two books bought in Hong Kong just a couple months ago from Greenwood Press (pub. 2004) that use a modified [[w:Yale romanization|Yale]] (same as the system used by Matthews and Yip in their 1994 Intermediate Cantonese book).  Another character glossary (first pub. 1987 with another pub. date in 2004) uses the Sidney Lau system.  The Lonely Planet phrasebook uses the author's own creation.  Yet another coursebook uses a mainland Chinese system based on [[w:Hanyu Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]].  I believe the Foreign Service Institute textbook (published in the 70's) that I had before used the Yale system.
# Even with good familiarity of the material, I still find this romanization scheme confusing.  It's not intuitive for many English speakers.  For instance the &quot;J&quot; of &quot;Jyutping&quot; is '''not''' a &quot;j&quot; sound at all.  It's exactly like the &quot;y&quot; in &quot;yard&quot;!  And so the &quot;yu&quot; sound then?  That's the high front rounded vowel in French &quot;tu&quot;.  From a linguists' prespective, Jyutping makes quite a bit of sense but not from the beginners' prespective!  (But I am a linguist and it still drives me nuts!)
# It has not been adopted as a standard as it was oringinally intended. As the books I have described above show, there has been no big shift (or any at all?) to Jyutping.  From my understanding, Hong Kong universities are currently using the Yale or a modified Yale system for teaching Cantonese to foreigners.  I don't believe that the Hong Kong government has ever declared any official romanization scheme (the one it uses for place names is quite ad-hoc and does not mark tones at all).
# The tone marks are not the best method for beginners.  Although Jyutping is easy to type because it doesn't require diacritics, I think the mixing of numbers and letters is really awkward for learners in my opinion.  English speakers do not mix numbers inside words and so we have a habit of ignoring numbers as &quot;garbage&quot;.  But the numbers are critical because they represent the tones.  The Yale system using tone marks similar to Hanyu Pinyin which I think is much more useful for beginners.  We give a lot more attention to diacritics then numbers mixed into the word.

As someone who loves standards, I am really saddened by this dilemma.  I thought that supporting  Jyutping would be the &quot;right&quot; thing to do but it seems that it never caught on.  Although Yale is slightly more troublesome to type, I think the tradeoff is worth it considering the learner's benefit '''and''' how popular it is in other Cantonese learning materials.  Hence I'm deciding to go to the modified Yale system used in the two recent Greenwood Publisher books I have.  This system is presented in [[Cantonese: Fundamentals of the language]].

Seeing how there is not many other people here yet, I guess I am just talking to myself.  However, I do believe the question &quot;Why did you pick X romanization scheme over Y or Z?&quot; is going to come up eventually.  And it's plausible with all the different romanization camps out there, this will be a big controversy...so I am posting my reasons now rather than later.

--[[User:Xingmu|Alissa]] 14:35, 22 May 2005 (UTC)

There is a dictionary called ''Dictionary of Cantonese with Mandarin Phonetic Symbol''(广州音字典 普通话对照)， published in 1983 by Canton People Publishing House. I will show some examples how the dictionary describes a word:

堞 die(e为第二声，我吾识打） [dib6碟] 城上如齿状的矮墙。 （dib6中的6表示广东音中六中基本声调中的去声，跟“事”或“食”相同）

燃 ran(a为第二声） [yin4言] ... （4为阳平声调，跟“时”相同）

I am not intended to say that this system is suitable to describe Cantonese. I am just telling the existence of this dictionary. It seems that it is useful for people who already known Mandarin to learn Cantonese.

--[[User:Hgneng|Cameron Wong]] 16:40, 15 Aug 2005 (time zone of Beijing)

I have read books that teach Japanese to speak Cantonese, however, I forgot their names. There are a lot textbooks that teach Japanese to speak and to understand cantonese, since there are a lot of Japanese working in Hong Kong. You may found a lot of books in &quot;Sogo&quot; Department store in Hong Kong. 

Forget the [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]]. The key for a good textbook is &quot;easy to learn&quot;, so don't stick to only one pronunciation system. If you have listen to [[w:Pimsleur language learning system|Pimsleur]]'s teaching materials, you'll find out that writing the pronunciation only help the reader to remember how they speak the language. The best way to teach pronunciation is to listen. 

However, if you have to record the pronunciation into written text, use the one that reader  understand.

For instance, in [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]], &quot;陳&quot; is represented by &quot;can&quot;. It is quite reasonable that English speakers preceive &quot;can&quot; as the first syllable of &quot;Canada&quot; instead of the exact pronunciation of &quot;陳&quot;. On the other hand, the pronunciation of &quot;陳&quot; is close the second syllable of English word, &quot;merchant&quot; without the &quot;t&quot; sound. 

In addition, [[w:Jyutping|Jyutping]] is too hard for beginners. Personally, I don't think a standardized &quot;Romanization&quot; can help beginners to learn to speak cantonese quickly. Instead, &quot;Romanization&quot; always frightten beginners in their first language class. 

Using &quot;association&quot; is more effective in &quot;learning to speak&quot; as well as &quot;learning to listen&quot;. It is an alternative to represent the pronunciation of a word is to associate it to something readers have learnt before. 

For instance, you may represent the pronunciation of &quot;塵&quot; same as that of &quot;陳&quot;. 

If readers are asked to listen to the word &quot;陳&quot;, they will associate two different words, &quot;塵&quot; and &quot;陳&quot;.

== Contributors Guide ==

I stumbled upon this book a few weeks ago, and am interested in contributing to it.  When I first found it, I noticed that the yet-to-be-created lessons were modeled after the Mandarin WikiBook, but I have noticed that xingmu has added some new content in Lesson 2 as well as updating the &quot;How To Use This Textbook&quot; section.  It seems like the information that xingmu has added is pretty well organized as if it is part of a project that is well under development.  My question is, would you like others to contribute as stated on your user page, or do you have a pretty good plan for where this book is going?  I am by no means a linguist, but I have studied Cantonese for a few years and am interested in helping develop a good resource for learners.  Let me know if there is anything specific you would like me to add, or if there are things you are already working on (so I know what not to add).  If you would like others to help contribute, it would be good to create a contributor's guide.  Thank you!  I hope I can help out with this project.
--[[User:Rtaggart|Rtaggart]] 21:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

:I added on a Contributor's Guide to the main page, adapting it from the Mandarin version, excising the sections that don't apply to the Cantonese Wikibook. It mostly covers multimedia contributions (stroke order images, sound clips), so if you have anything else to add about regular contributions, feel free.

:Rtaggart, as for reservations about contributing, leave those behind. With the activity levels of most Wikibooks, an excess of content does not ever seem to be a problem. If you're concerned that effort may be lost through duplication or by a later change in book direction, then put your first efforts into fleshing out the plan. I'd say not to worry though. Grammar explanations and the like can easily be moved and reshuffled if the book structure needs to change. &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 04:33, 24 December 2006 (UTC)

I've expanded the page on [[SimCity]] quite dramatically, and given that you have contributed to it in the past, I'm wondering if you have any comments, suggestions, or anything else to contribute to it? [[User:AmishThrasher|AmishThrasher]] 15:48, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Poiuyt Man. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Poiuyt Man~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The '''rambutan''' is a tropical fruit from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thailand]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]].

It is closely related to several other edible tropical fruits including the [[Cookbook:Lychee|lychee]], longan, and mamoncillo

      <text xml:space="preserve">:&lt;i&gt;&quot;Mathematics is the mortar of the bricks of Physics.  Engineering is the house they build&quot;&lt;/i&gt; - Unknown

Physics, especially Calculus based Physics, is integral to the solving of engineering problems.  Without understanding the relationships between Current and Voltage, Electrical engineers are unable to solve problems to do with Power.  Civil engineers use density and volume to find the weight of an object.  Mechanical engineers rely heavily on dynamics in everything they do, which in turn is deeply rooted in differential equations and parametrization.

There are many more examples of the use of Physics in the world of engineering, and we can then think of engineering as a mix between applied physics and applied mathematics.

The text will try to provide an application to real world problems within the context of engineering, from a calculus based approach.  The Mathematics of engineering will be referred to in parts, and it is expected that those engineering students who are readers of the book have at least a basic grasp of both calculus and simple algebra.

[[Image:Passion_fruit_700.jpg|right|thumb|passion fruit]]
'''Passion fruit''' is a goop-filled tropical fruit. You're actually supposed to eat the seedy goop and throw away the outer part, not the other way around. The other strange thing is that wrinkled dehydrated-looking ones are considered best.

The seeds are edible so you can eat the orange goop straight from the shell. Passion fruit is more commonly sieved and its highly aromatic pulp and juice are used as a flavoring for beverages and [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauces]]. The pulp has an intense aromatic flavor, while the texture is [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]]-like and watery. The flavor is likened to [[Cookbook:Guava|guava]].
Native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Brazil|Brazil]], passion fruits are grown in Hawaii, Florida, and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]. These crops, along with imports from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]], keep passion fruit on the market all year.

==Selection==
Choose large, heavy, firm fruit. When ripe, it has wrinkled, dimpled, and often deep purple skin. Some fruit, particularly that of Hawaii, is yellow when ripe. Skin is old-looking, but does not mean the fruit is rotten. Mold does not affect quality and can be wiped off. Fruit color is green when they are immature, changing to shades of purple, red or yellow as they ripen. Leave at room temperature to ripen. The skin will wrinkle, but the fruit will not soften much. Once ripe, store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.

==Preparation==
Passion Fruit is generally eaten fresh but may be cooked for use in sauces and fillings. Begin by cutting the fruit in half and scooping out the fleshy pulp with a spoon. Spoon the pulp over [[Cookbook:Ice Cream|ice cream]] or other soft fruits. The pulp makes a delicious [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] and the seeds add a unique crunchy texture. To remove seeds: Strain in a non-aluminum sieve, or use cheesecloth, squeezing to extract the juice.</text>

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Mkbnett. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Mkbnett~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Notice that the answers in parts (a) and (b) are not equal. However, since indefinite integrals include a constant term, we expect that the answers we found will differ by a constant. Indeed
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin^{2}x}{2}-(-\frac{\cos^{2}x}{2})=\frac{\sin^{2}x+\cos^{2}x}{2}=\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

== What is USB? ==
USB stands for &quot;Universal Serial Bus&quot;. It is an industry standard developed in the mid-1990s that defines the cables, connectors and communications protocols used in a bus for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and electronic devices. USB was intented to standardize the connection of computer peripherals (including keyboards, pointing devices, digital cameras, printers, portable media players, disk drives and network adapters) to personal computers, both to communicate and to supply electric power. It has also become commonplace on other devices, such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles. USB has effectively replaced a variety of earlier interfaces, such as serial and parallel ports.

USB flash drives are memory devices that are inserted and powered by USB ports. They store information and data that needs to be easily accessed. These devices are portable and convenient for people on the go. USB ports are a common necessity for students as well as business employees or personnel. In addition to convenience, they range in storage capacities from 1GB to 64 GB, so end users are able to store as much information as small computers. 
[[File:USB Flash Drive and Card Reader.jpg|thumb|USB Flash Drive and Card Reader]]

USB connects several devices to a host controller through a chain of hubs. In USB terminology, devices are referred to as ''functions'', because each individual physical device may actually host several functions, such as a webcam with a built-in microphone. The hubs are special-purpose devices that are not officially considered functions. There always exists one hub known as the root hub, which is attached directly to the host controller.

These devices/functions (and hubs) have associated ''pipes'' (logical channels). The pipes are synonymous to byte streams such as in the pipelines of Unix. Pipes are connections from the host controller to a logical entity on the device named an ''endpoint''. The term ''endpoint'' is also occasionally used to refer to the entire pipe.

These endpoints (and their respective pipes) are numbered 0-15 in each direction, so a device/function can have up to 32 active pipes, 16 into the host controller and 16 out of the controller.

Each endpoint can transfer data in one direction only, either into or out of the device/function, so each pipe is uni-directional. Endpoint 0 is however reserved for the bus management in both directions and thus takes up two of the 32 endpoints — all USB devices are required to implement endpoint 0, so there is always an inward and an outward pipe numbered 0 on any given device.

In these pipes, data is transferred in packets of varying length. Each pipe has a maximum packet length, typically &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; bytes, so a USB packet will often contain something on the order of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 up to 512 bytes.

The pipes are also divided into four different categories by way of their ''transfer type'':

*''control transfers'' - typically used for short, simple commands to the device, and a status response, used e.g. by the bus control pipe number 0
*''isochronous transfers'' - at some guaranteed speed (often but not necessarily as fast as possible) but with possible data loss, e.g. realtime audio or video
*''interrupt transfers'' - devices that need guaranteed quick responses (bounded latency), e.g. pointing devices and keyboards
*''bulk transfers'' - large sporadic transfers using all remaining available bandwidth (but with no guarantees on throughput or latency), e.g. file transfers

When a device (function) or hub is attached to the host controller through any hub on the bus, it is given a unique 7 bit address on the bus by the host controller.

The host controller then polls the bus for traffic, usually in a round-robin fashion, so no device can transfer any data on the bus without explicit request from the host controller. The ''interrupt transfers'' on corresponding endpoints do not actually interrupt any traffic on the bus:  they are just scheduled to be queried more often and in between any other large transfers, thus &quot;interrupt traffic&quot; on a USB bus is really only high-priority traffic.

To access an endpoint, a hierarchical configuration must be obtained. The device connected to the bus has one (and only one) ''device descriptor'' which in turn has one or more ''configuration descriptors''. These configurations often correspond to states, e.g. active vs. low power mode. Each configuration descriptor in turn has one or more ''interface descriptors'', which describe certain aspects of the device, so that it may be used for different purposes: for example, a camera may have both audio and video interfaces. These interface descriptors in turn have one ''default interface setting'' and possibly more ''alternate interface settings'' which in turn have ''endpoint descriptors'', as outlined above. An endpoint may however be reused among several interfaces and alternate interface settings.

=== Host controllers ===
[[File:Type A USB connector.jpg|thumb|right|A USB Series “A” plug]]

The hardware that contains the host controller and the root hub has an interface geared toward the programmer which is called ''Host Controller Device'' (HCD) and is defined by the hardware implementer. In practice, these are hardware registers (ports) in the computer.

At version 1.0 and 1.1 there were two competing HCD implementations. Compaq's Open Host Controller Interface (OHCI) was adopted as the standard by the USB-IF. However, Intel subsequently created a specification they called the ''Universal Host Controller Interface'' (UHCI) and insisted other implementers pay to license and implement UHCI. VIA Technologies licensed the UHCI standard from Intel; all other chipset implementers use OHCI. The main difference between OHCI and UHCI is the fact that UHCI is more software-driven than OHCI is, making UHCI slightly more processor-intensive but cheaper to implement. The dueling implementations forced operating system vendors and hardware vendors to develop and test on both implementations which increased cost. During the design phase of USB 2.0 the USB-IF insisted on only one implementation. The USB 2.0 HCD implementation is called the ''Extended Host Controller Interface'' (EHCI). Only EHCI can support hi-speed transfers. Each EHCI controller contains four virtual HCD implementations to support Full Speed and Low Speed devices. The virtual HCD on Intel and VIA EHCI controllers are UHCI. All other vendors use virtual OHCI controllers.

=== Class Codes ===
The device descriptor of a USB device has a signature that tells what kind of device has been attached to the bus. This signature consists of class code, subclass code and protocol fields. Together, these identify what operating system driver should be used to communicate with the device. Additionally, each USB device interface descriptor contains the same signature fields. The interface signature allows multiple operating system drivers to simultaneously communicate with a single USB device (for example USB device with audio and video interfaces) and they also allow multiple instances of the same driver to communicate with separate interfaces of the same USB device (for example USB ethernet adapter with multiple ethernet ports)

Devices that attach to the bus can be full-custom devices requiring a full-custom device driver to be used, or may belong to a ''device class''. These classes define an expected behavior in terms of device and interface descriptors so that the same device driver may be used for any device that claims to be a member of a certain class. An operating system is supposed to implement all device classes so as to provide generic drivers for any USB device.

Device class codes are decided upon by the Device Working Group of the USB Implementers Forum. If the class applies to the entire device, the class code is assigned to the ''bDeviceClass'' field of the device descriptor, and if it is to be set for a single interface on a device, it is assigned to the ''bInterfaceClass'' field of the interface descriptor. It is also possible that multiple interfaces of the device are grouped by using an Interface Association Descriptor, in which case the class code is assigned to ''bFunctionClass'' fields of the descriptor. Class code is a single byte, so a maximum of 254 different device classes are possible (values 0x00 and 0xFF are reserved). If ''bDeviceClass'' is set to 0x00, the operating system will look at ''bFunctionClass'' for Interface Association Descriptors and ''bInterfaceClass'' for each interface to determine the device class. Each class also optionally supports a ''SubClass'' and ''Protocol'' subdefinition. These can be used as the main device classes are continuously revised.

The most used class codes (grouped by assigned class ID) are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usb.org/developers/defined_class USB Class Codes]&lt;/ref&gt;

; 0x00 - Unspecified Class (Device Descriptor) : The USB device has no assigned class code. The class codes of the device interface descriptors should be used to identify which drivers are supported by the device.
; 0x01 - Audio Class (Interface Descriptor) : The interface follows USB audio device class specification. This class code is used by sound card-like devices.
; 0x02 - CDC / Communication Device Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : USB communications device class (&quot;CDC&quot;), used for modems, network cards, ISDN connections, Fax.
; 0x03 - HID Class / Human Interface Device Class (Interface Descriptor) :USB human interface device class (&quot;HID&quot;), keyboards, mice, etc.
; 0x05 - Physical Device Class (Interface Descriptor) : ?
; 0x06 - Still Imaging Class (Interface Descriptor) : Still image capture device class, identical to the Picture Transfer Protocol as used across USB
; 0x07 - Printer Class (Interface Descriptor) : USB printer device class, printer-like devices.
; 0x08 - Mass Storage Class (Interface Descriptor) : USB mass storage device class used for flash drives, portable hard drives, memory card readers, digital cameras, digital audio players etc. This device class presents the device as a block device (almost always used to store a file system).
; 0x09 - Hub (Device Descriptor) : USB hubs.
; 0x0A - CDC Data / Communication Device Class Data (Interface Descriptor) : CDC-Data (Communications Class Device).
; 0x0B - Smart Card Class (Interface Descriptor) : Smart card readers.
; 0x0D - Content Security Class (Interface Descriptor) : Content Security.
; 0x0E - Video Class (Interface Descriptor) : USB video device class, webcam-like devices, motion image capture devices.
; 0xDC - Diagnostics Device Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : Class for diagnostics devices. This class has a single subclass for USB 2.0 compliance testing devices.
; 0xE0 - Wireless Controller Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : Wireless controllers, for example Bluetooth dongles. This class code is usually used only in interface descriptors, only bluetooth subclass allows use in device descriptors.
; 0xEF - Miscellaneous Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : ?
; 0xFE - Application Specific Class (Interface Descriptor) : ?
; 0xFF - Vendor Specific Class (Device or Interface Descriptor) : Custom device class - used to establish that a device or interface does not support any standard device class and requires custom drivers.

USB signals are transmitted on a twisted pair of data cables, labelled D+ and D&amp;minus;. These collectively use half-duplex differential signaling to combat the effects of electromagnetic noise on longer lines. D+ and D&amp;minus; usually operate together; they are not separate simplex connections. Transmitted signal levels are 0.0&amp;ndash;0.3 volts for low and 2.8&amp;ndash;3.6 volts for high.

=====Transfer modes=====
USB supports four transfer modes:
*Control
*Interrupt
*Bulk
*Isochronous

=====Transfer speed=====

USB supports three data rates:

* A '''Low Speed''' rate of up to 1.5 Mbit/s (187.5 kB/s) that is mostly used for Human Interface Devices (HID) such as keyboards, mice, and joysticks.
* A '''Full Speed''' rate of up to 12 Mbit/s (1.5 [MB/s). Full Speed was the fastest rate before the USB 2.0 specification and many devices fall back to Full Speed. Full Speed devices divide the USB bandwidth between them in a first-come first-served basis and it is not uncommon to run out of bandwidth with several isochronous devices. All USB Hubs support Full Speed.
* A '''Hi-Speed''' rate of up to 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s).

Hubs, even Hi-Speed hubs, serving a number of non-hi-speed devices, are likely to divide up a total bandwidth of 12 Mbit/s for such devices, which will slow them down unless the hub has transaction translator for each port. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/09/09/usb_technology/index.html Multi-TT Hub Goes Head-to-Head With Single-TT] at Tom's Hardware Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Hi-Speed devices are commonly referred to as &quot;USB 2.0&quot; and advertised as &quot;up to 480 Mbit/s&quot;, not all USB 2.0 devices are Hi-Speed. Hi-speed devices typically only operate at half of the full theoretical (60 MB/s) data throughput rate. The maximum rate currently (2006) attained with real devices is about half, 30 MB/s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barefeats.com/usb2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Most hi-speed USB devices typically operate at much slower speeds, often about 3 MB/s overall, sometimes up to 10-20 MB/s. The USB-IF certifies devices and provides licenses to use special marketing logos for either &quot;Basic-Speed&quot; (low and full) or Hi-Speed after passing a compliancy test and paying a licensing fee.  All devices are tested according to the latest spec, so recently-compliant Low Speed devices are also 2.0.

Hi-Speed devices are intended to fall back to the slower data rate of Full Speed when plugged into a Full Speed hub. Hi-Speed hubs have a special function called the '''Transaction Translator''' that segregates Full Speed and Low Speed bus traffic from Hi-Speed traffic. The Transaction Translator in a Hi-Speed hub (or possibly each port depending on the electrical design) will function as a completely separate Full Speed bus to Full Speed and Low Speed devices attached to it. This segregation is for bandwidth only; bus rules about power and hub depth still apply.

A hub will have one or more Transaction Translators and there is no standard way to determine the number of transaction translators a hub may have.  All low and full speed devices connected to one transaction translator will share the low/full speed bandwidth.  This means that hubs can have dramatically different performance depending upon the number of transaction translators and the devices plugged into their ports.  e.g. a hi-speed 7 port hub with only 1 transaction translator with 7 low/full speed devices plugged in, will act no differently than a USB 1.1 hub and all devices compete for the same low/full speed bandwidth.  If the hub were to have a transaction translator for each of the seven ports, then each device would have all the full/low speed bandwidth available to it and would only compete for the hi-speed bandwidth, which is much greater.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tomshardware.com/2003/09/09/usb_technology/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Data encoding ====

The USB standard uses the NRZI system to encode data, and uses bit stuffing for logic 1 transmission '''six''' bits long (put logic 0 after '''six''' bits of logic 1; the receiver ignores a 0 following '''six''' logic 1). Moreover, receiving a block of seven consecutive bits of logic 1 will be signaled as a bit stuffing error at the receiver.
The NRZI (non-return to zero, inverted) encoding method does not change the signal for transmission of a logic '''1''', but it inverts the signal level for transmission of each logic '''0'''.

====Mini-USB signaling====

Most of the pins of a Mini-USB connector are the same as those in a standard USB connector, except pin 4. Pin 4 is called &quot;ID&quot; and, in the Mini-A plug, is connected to ground, but in the Mini-B plug it is not connected. This causes a device supporting USB On-The-Go (with a Mini-AB socket) to initially act as host when connected to a USB Mini-A plug (the &quot;A&quot; end of a Mini-A– Mini-B cable). The Mini-A connector also has an additional piece of plastic inside to prevent insertion into a slave-only (B-only) device.

=== USB connectors ===
==== Connector types ====

There are several types of USB connectors, and some have been added as the specification has progressed.
From the original USB specification:

* Standard-A plug
* Standard-A receptacle
* Standard-B plug
* Standard-B receptacle

Added in the first engineering change noticed to the USB 2.0 specification:

* Mini-B plug
* Mini-B receptacle

Added in the ''Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification'':

* Micro-A plug (white)
* Micro-AB receptacle (gray)
* Micro-B plug (black)
* Micro-B receptacle (black)

Adapters, also from the ''Universal Serial Bus Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification'' (Note that no other adapters are allowed.):

* Standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug

[[File:MicroUSB_0115.jpg|thumb|Micro-USB plug]]
[[File:MicroUSB_0121.jpg|thumb|Micro-USB plug]]
* &quot;Micro-series USB technology will replace Mini-series USB in OTG products&quot; [http://www.usb.org/press/pressroom/2007_01_04_usbif.pdf] &quot;Beaverton, OR, 2007-01-04 -- The USB Implementers Forum, Inc. (USB-IF) today announced the completion of the Micro-USB specification, a new connector technology that will replace many of the Mini-series plugs and receptacles currently used in portable products.&quot; The Micro-USB plug is rated for 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles. It is about half the height of the mini-USB connector in widespread use today but features a similar width.

==== Cables and connectors ====

[[File:Male and Female USB Connectors.jpg|thumb|Series &quot;A&quot; plug and receptacle.]]

Cables have only plugs, and hosts and devices have only receptacles. Hosts have type-A receptacles; devices, if they have receptacles, have type-B. Type-A plugs only mate with type-A receptacles, and type-B with type-B.

The On-the-Go supplement allows a product to be either host or device, with a Micro-AB receptacle that accepts either a Micro-A plug or a Micro-B plug. Micro-A, Micro-B, and Micro-AB connectors are identified easily by color. The plastic inside Micro-A plugs and receptacles is always white, that in Micro-B connectors black, and that in Micro-AB receptacles grey.

There is a limited set of cables allowed by the USB specification. Cables fall into two categories — &quot;detachable&quot; and &quot;captive&quot;. All allowed USB cables have one type-A plug, either Standard-A or Micro-A. The other end of a &quot;captive&quot; cable is either not removable or it has a custom connector on the device end. If the cable is &quot;detachable&quot;, the other end of the cable must have a type-B plug. There also exists a special adapter cable that has micro-A plug and standard-A receptacle. 

Captive USB cable types:

* Standard-A plug to device. &lt;br&gt;This cable may have a custom connector on the device end.
* Micro-A plug to device. &lt;br&gt;This cable is not intended to be removed by the end user of the device.

Detachable USB cable types:

* Standard-A plug to Standard-B plug. &lt;br&gt;This is the most popular cable for connecting USB devices to host.
* Standard-A plug to Mini-B plug. &lt;br&gt;Used to connect older mobile devices to host.
* Standard-A plug to Micro-B plug. &lt;br&gt;Used to connect newer mobile devices to host.
* Micro-A plug to Micro-B plug. &lt;br&gt;Used to connect mobile devices to each other.
* Micro-A plug to Standard-A receptacle. &lt;br&gt;This is a special adapter cable that is allowed to be at most 150 mm long. It is needed in order to allow mobile devices to act as USB hosts for devices which are not using Micro-USB connectors.

Any cable with a receptacle (except the special case above) or with two &quot;A&quot; or two &quot;B&quot; connectors is, by definition, not USB.&lt;ref&gt;see http://www.usb.org/developers/whitepapers/cablew~1.pdf and http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ecn1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, many cable manufacturers make and sell USB-compatible (yet not strictly conforming) extension cables with a Standard-A plug on one end and Standard-A receptacle on the other end. Note that these non-conforming extension cables should not be mixed with conforming cables that contain a small bus-powered hub. Cables with two type A or even two type B plugs are available from more specialist suppliers.

Note that only &quot;full-speed&quot; and &quot;hi-speed&quot; devices use detachable cables. Compliant &quot;Low-speed&quot; devices only use captive cables, because the low-speed specification does not allow for the electrical characteristics of standard detachable USB cables.

The Mini-B, Micro-A, Micro-B, and Micro-AB connectors are used for smaller devices such as PDAs, mobile phones or digital cameras. The Standard-A plug is approximately 4 by 12 mm, the Standard-B approximately 7 by 8 mm, and the Micro-A and Micro-B plugs approximately 2 by 7 mm.

The connectors which the USB committee specified were designed to support a number of USB's underlying goals, and to reflect lessons learned from the varied menagerie of connectors then in service. In particular:

* The connectors are designed to be robust. Many previous connector designs were fragile, with pins or other delicate components prone to bending or breaking, even with the application of only very modest force. The electrical contacts in a USB connector are protected by an adjacent plastic tongue, and the entire connecting assembly is further protected by an enclosing metal sheath. As a result USB connectors can safely be handled, inserted, and removed, even by a small child. The encasing sheath and the tough moulded plug body mean that a connector can be dropped, stepped upon, even crushed or struck, all without damage; a considerable degree of force is needed to significantly damage a USB connector.
* It is difficult to incorrectly attach a USB connector. Connectors cannot be plugged-in upside down, and it is clear from the appearance and kinesthetic sensation of making a connection when the plug and socket are correctly mated. However, it is not obvious at a glance to the inexperienced user (or to a user without sight of the installation) which way round a connector goes, so it is often necessary to try both ways.
* The connectors are particularly cheap to manufacture.
* The connectors enforce the directed topology of a USB network. USB does not support cyclical networks, so the connectors from incompatible USB devices are themselves incompatible. Unlike other communications systems (e.g. RJ-45 cabling) gender-changers are almost never used, making it difficult to create a cyclic USB network.
* A moderate insertion/removal force is specified. USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle (without the need for the screws, clips, or thumbturns other connectors require). The force needed to make or break a connection is modest, allowing connections to be made in awkward circumstances or by those with motor disabilities.
* The connector construction always ensures that the external sheath on the plug contacts with its counterpart in the receptacle before the four connectors within are connected. This sheath is typically connected to the system ground, allowing otherwise damaging static charges to be safely discharged by this route (rather than via delicate electronic components). This means of enclosure also means that there is a (moderate) degree of protection from electromagnetic interference afforded to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (this is the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair must travel a distance in parallel). In addition, the power and common connections are made after the system ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for safe hot-swapping and has long been common practice in the design of connectors in the aerospace industry.
* The USB standard specifies relatively low tolerances for compliant USB connectors, intending to minimize incompatibilities in connectors produced by different vendors (a goal that has been very successfully achieved). Unlike most other connector standards, the USB spec also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug. This was done to avoid circumstances where a device complied with the connector specification but its large size blocked adjacent ports. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable which does.

However, the physical layer is changed in some examples. For example, the IBM UltraPort is a proprietary USB connector located on the top of IBM's laptop LCDs. It uses a different mechanical connector while preserving the USB signaling and protocol. Other manufacturers of small items also developed their own small form factor connector, and a wide variety of these have appeared. For specification purposes, these devices were treated as having a captive cable.

An extension to USB called USB On-The-Go allows a single port to act as either a host or a device - chosen by which end of the cable plugs into the socket on the unit. Even after the cable is hooked up and the units are talking, the two units may &quot;swap&quot; ends under program control. This facility targets units such as PDAs where the USB link might connect to a PC's host port as a device in one instance, yet connect as a host itself to a keyboard and mouse device in another instance. USB On-The-Go has therefore defined two small form factor connectors, the Mini-A and Mini-B, and a universal socket (Mini-AB), which should stop the proliferation of proprietary designs.

Wireless USB is a standard being developed to extend the USB standard while maintaining backwards compatibility with USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 on the protocol level.

The maximum length of a USB cable is 5 meters; greater lengths require hubs [http://www.usb.org/developers/usbfaq/#cab1]. USB Connections can be extended to 50 m over CAT5 or up to 10 km over fiber by using special USB Extender products developed by various manufacturers.

=== Power supply ===
==== Standard ====

The USB specification provides a 5 V (volts) supply on a single wire from which connected USB devices may draw power. The specification provides for no more than 5.25 V and no less than 4.35 V between the +ve and -ve bus power lines.

Initially, a device is only allowed to draw 100 mA. It may request more current from the upstream device in units of 100 mA up to a maximum of 500 mA. In practice, most ports will deliver the full 500 mA or more before shutting down power, even if the device hasn't requested it or even identified itself. If a (compliant) device requires more power than is available, then it cannot operate until the user changes the network (either by rearranging USB connections or by adding external power) to supply the power required.

If a USB device sees that the data lines of the USB bus have been idle for 3 milliseconds, the device must go into suspend state. Suspended devices are allowed to draw 500 μA. If the device was configured to use more than 100 mA of current, before the device was suspended, and the device was configured as a remote wakeup source, the device is allowed to draw 2.5 mA while suspended. The current limits during suspend are one second averages.

Note that '''On-The-Go''' and '''Battery Charging Specification''' both add new powering modes to the USB specification. 

If a bus-powered hub is used, the devices downstream may only use a total of four units — 400 mA — of current. This limits compliant bus-powered hubs to 4 ports, among other things. Equipment requiring more than 500 mA, hubs with more than 4 ports and hubs with downstream devices using more than four 100 mA units total must provide their own power. The host operating system typically keeps track of the power requirements of the USB network and may warn the computer's operator when a given segment requires more power than is available.

The '''macadamia''' is a [[Cookbook:Nut|nut]] native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], and cultivated in various countries. Despite being a native of Australia, the largest producer of macadamia nuts is Hawaii. 

Macadamias are crunchy and high-[[Cookbook:Fat|fat]]. They have a bit of a [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]-like taste. Macadamias easily go rancid.

==Ways to serve==

      <text xml:space="preserve">Blender can render radiosity, a method of calculating realistic lighting, in which light is emitted and transferred using a method similar to that by which heat is transferred.

==Tutorial, Introduction to Radiosity==
No tutorial as of yet.

==Terms Used for Blender Radiosity==

'''Element'''
:Light-receiving mesh, data to be lit. (Meshes with material's emit value set to zero will only be treated as elements.)

'''Patch'''
:Light-emitting faces of a mesh, where the material applied to that face has an emit value above zero.


''Note'' Once lit, elements will be used as patches, so that light can bounce a number of times.

Patches can also be lit by other patches and therefore treated as elements.

==Lighting Geometry==
In Blender detail in lighting is gained by subdividing the mesh, therefore baked meshes will usually have many more faces than the original.

Some facts about radiosity

#The centre of the face is used when emitting light.
#The area of the face will determine how much light it casts.
#Triangles often cause uneven subdivision, giving worse results and less even lighting. Use quads where possible.
#For best results when making a mesh for radiosity baking, long skinny faces will cause artifacts, triangles even more so.
#Radiosity is an iterative process that is continually refined until any of the user-set limits are reached (i.e. the smallest element or the maximum number of elements is reached.) You may stop radiosity calculation early by pressing escape at any time even though your limits are not reached.

==Radiosity Settings==
'''Hemires'''
:This adjusts the resolution of the Hemicube,
:The hemicube is a 3D Grid than spans the bounding box of all objects to which you are applying radiosity.
:This grid is used for calculating the path of light emitted from one object to another.
:The resolution is the number of subdivisions along the X,Y and Z axis, not related to Blender units, affecting how fine grained the light calculations will be.
:A low value may result in noisy scattering of colour, whereas a higher value will be smooth in tone.
:''Note'' that with smaller scenes that are less complex, a lower resolution may give good results much more quickly.

'''Max Iterations'''
:Limits the number of radiosity rounds, 0 is unlimited. If used, this value should be greater or equal to the total number of emitting faces. :''Hint'' It is probably best to keep this value at 0 to make sure all light-emitting faces are evaluated.

'''Add New Meshes'''
:Adds new radiosity baked meshes into active current layers.
:''Hint'' leave some empty layers to add the new mesh into, keeping the original meshes separate from the radiosity allied mesh.

'''Multi and Gamma'''
:Lighting adjustment, use after radiosity is baked.

'''Convergence'''
:Sets the threshold for light to keep bouncing. lower threshold will keep lower energy light bouncing.
:A high Convergence can prevent dim lights from being used at all.
:A higher value is faster.

'''Collect Meshes'''
:Collect selected meshes for radiosity computation.

'''PaMin'''
:This will effects 2 things,
:1) The Minimum size of faces that will be used as a light-emitting patch, and
:2) the minimim size to which a light-emitting face will be subdivided.


'''PaMax'''
:This will effects 2 things,
:The maximum size of faces that will be used as a light-emitting patch, and the maximum size at which an element may be used as a light, when it is subsequently lit by another patch.
:This is important because large faces my be evaluated as a single patch and light surrounding faces from the faces centre point, causing uneven lighting.


'''SubSh Patch and Element'''
:Sub Shoot Patch/Element effects how many times the face is tested for subdivision. More tests mean that it will incrementally subdivide, calculating the patch/element that needs the most detail each time, rather then performing subdivisions fewer times, resulting in a more uniformly subdivided area.
:The subdivisions are limited by the ElMin and PaMin, and will stop if all faces reach this size limit.
:A Zero value will for either of these makes the number of possible tests unlimited.

'''SubSh Patch'''
:Subdividing shoot patches is a way of having patches that are originally large patches subdivided so that lighting casts from each new subdivided patch, resulting in softer shadows.
:The subdivisions are limited by '''PaMin''', which sets how small patches may be before they stop subdividing.

'''SubSh Element'''
:Sub Shoot Patch effects how many times per shoot elements can be subdivided.
:Subdividing elements is the method used to add detail in what would otherwise be a flat area of colour.

'''MaxEl'''
:The total number of faces for the final result. This value is useful for limiting the quality and time taken for the final result. Use a lower value to start with. For meshes that are already highly subdivided you can even use 0 and have no subdivision.
:Also Note that sometimes a lower value will distribute polygons more effectively and give as good a result as a higher setting.

==Trouble Shooting==
'''Q.''' The result looks bad: tone is uneven, as if added in the wrong areas.

'''A.''' Its likely your mesh has skinny faces. Try make your mesh with even faces, quads where possible.


'''Q.''' The tone on areas that should be smooth is uneven and blotchy. 

'''A.''' Setting a higher Hemires will solve this problem.


'''Q.''' I'm getting light refracted white areas when one element reflects onto another.

'''A.''' Your PaMax setting is too high. Your element is reflecting light from the centre of an area that is too large. and will reflect light from a small number of large patches. Make the PaMax lower.

'''Tea''' is generally a drink made from [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] &quot;tea leaves&quot;, which are the leaves of the tea plant.
Sometimes other plants are used. Usually the leaves are not actually eaten; they are strained out of the broth before the broth is drunk.

Some people add [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]].

Tea may be chilled with ice to make a refreshing drink known as '''ice tea''' or '''iced tea'''.
In particular, chilled sweetened tea (or simply sweet tea) is a common beverage in the American south east

Tea is often sold in bottles with added sugar and [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]], to be chilled before use.

Tea is a popular drink mixer in some areas; when mixed with vodka, it is known as an Ice Pick.

----
The '''celery root''' is the main taproot that grows downward as [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] grows upward. Celery root is also known as '''celeriac''', '''turnip-rooted celery''', and '''knob celery'''. Normally a distinct variety of celery is used when growing roots for food. The root is used when it is about the size of a baseball or softball. Celery root is normally peeled and cooked. It is often mashed or used in casseroles and baked dishes. The celery root is routinely used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]] cooking and is seen throughout [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]]. Celery root tastes somewhat like celery and [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]].

Celery roots are available year-round with a peak during November through April. Select roots that look like they would be easiest to clean and peel; the roots can have lots of knobs and crevices full of dirt. Medium roots tend to be smoother and harder and these roots can be sold with or with out the celery tops. If you do buy the roots with the tops, trim the stalks and save them for soups and stews. The roots should be wrapped in plastic, stored in the refrigerator, and used within a week. Celery roots must be scrubbed, trimmed at the top and bottom, quartered, and then peeled before eating. Be sure to discard any spongy parts. Avoid overcooking celery root as it will go quickly from firm to mushy.</text>

The '''parsnip''' looks like a pale [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and is actually a relative of the carrot, [[Cookbook:Celeriac|celeriac]], and parsley root. Commonly found in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]], this root vegetable arrived to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] with the colonists. Popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries for its [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] flavor and [[Cookbook:Nut|nutty]] fragrance, this vegetable was often used in recipes that called for [[Cookbook:Calorie|caloric]] decadence.

Parsnips are available year round with a peak from fall into spring. They are often displayed with the parsley root, so be sure you know which is a parsnip. Parsley roots are typically sold with their feathery greens whereas parsnips are sold by the root.

Select medium sized roots with uniform creamy beige skin. Avoid limp, pitted, or shriveled roots. Store parsnips unwashed wrapped in paper towel, placed in plastic, and store in the vegetable crisper of the refrigerator for about 2 weeks.

Wash, peel, and trim parsnips as you would a carrot. If [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]], then the parsnips skins will slip off after cooking. If pureeing parsnips, then leave skins intact.

The '''turnip''' often looks like a large [[Cookbook:Radish|radish]], but this varies greatly. Both the root and greens are used.

Turnips are available year round with a peak in the fall and winter months. Select smooth surfaced roots that are firm and heavy with some root hairs at the bottom. In general, the smaller the turnip, the sweeter the taste. Turnips keep well; cut the greens and bag them separately from the root placing them in the crisper section of the refrigerator for up to a week. Turnips can be peeled before cooking, eaten raw, or sliced, diced, or julienned. When cooking this delicate root, cook only to the just tender point; avoid overcooking as sweetness will diminish.

The '''rutabaga''' is a cross between a [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] and a [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]]. People have avoided this root because it is a [[Cookbook:Brassicas|cruciferous vegetable]] that becomes more flavored and odorous when cooked.

Rutabagas are available year round with a peak in the fall and winter. These roots range from tan to violet in color and are much larger than turnips; choose smooth, heavy, and firm roots. Smaller rutabagas, 4&quot; in diameter, tend to have sweeter flavor. This root stores for about 2 weeks in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a week. Rutabagas are usually covered in wax, so it’s best to quarter the root, then peel the skin before cooking.

'''[[w:Horseradish|Horseradish]]''' is a member of the [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] family and is native to Eastern Europe, although it may have originated in Asia: [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Germany|Germany]], or the [[Cookbook:Mediterranean cuisines|Mediterranean area]]. The ancient [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greeks]] used it, so did the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Israel|Hebrews]] — it is one of the 5 bitter [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] of the Jewish Passover. The strong flavor of this root has an underlying sweetness and seems more like [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] than a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]].

Today, horseradish is commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cocktail Sauce|cocktail sauce]] and as a cheap [[Cookbook:Wasabi|wasabi]] substitute.

Horseradish roots are available year round but are plentiful during the fall and early spring. Buy roots that are hard. Avoid sprouting, greenish tinges, blemishes, and shriveling.

Store these roots in plastic bags and refrigerate up to a week or freeze grated root in an airtight container for several months. Scrub the root and peel the brown skin. Finely grate or food process the root.

'''Salsify''' is called '''vegetable oyster''' because of its faint oyster-like flavor. This name is used interchangeably to describe two roots. '''White salsify''' is pale, thin, forked, has rootlets at the bottom, while '''black salsify''' ('''scorzonera''') looks like a brown [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]] and is much smoother and longer looking. Popular in [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]] since the 16th century, this root has just begun to make its appearance in markets.

This root is available from fall to early spring. Select medium size roots that are smooth and firm. Larger roots are more fibrous and smaller roots have less meat. White salsify is sold in bunches with leaves still attached. Black salsify is usually sold without leaves and in plastic bags. Salsify will last 2 weeks wrapped in plastic and stored in the refrigerator. Prepare salsify by scrubbing with a brush, removing the skin, rootlets, and all dark spots. Trim the tops and bottoms and slice as you would a carrot or leave whole. Avoid overcooking this root as it will quickly turn into mush.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In Danish there are two genders of nouns, but they aren't &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; like other European languages. They're called common and neuter gender, and they are inflected differently. Every noun is associated with one gender, and the gender should be learned when learning the noun. 

About 75% of Danish nouns are ''common'' gender, and if the noun is a living thing such as '''hund''' (dog), chances are its going to be common gender.

However, there are not any clear rules as to what gender a noun is. To a native speaker, it comes naturally whether to use common or neuter gender, but to someone learning Danish as a second language, it often requires a lot of exercise and listening to native speakers.

===Singular nouns===
The Danish word for ''a'' is '''en'''. '''en''' is
the common gender indefinite article. The neuter article is '''et'''. Thus you say:

*'''en dreng''' = ''a boy''
*'''en pige''' = ''a girl''
*'''et hus''' = ''a house''
*'''et æble''' = ''an apple''

In English, when you want to refer to one particular person or item, you use
the article ''the'' instead of ''a'' or ''an''. In Danish you do this by
inflecting the nouns:

*'''drengen''' = ''the boy''
*'''pigen''' = ''the girl''
*'''huset''' = ''the house''
*'''æblet''' = ''the apple''

Example sentences:

*'''Jeg ser en dreng.''' = ''I see a boy.''
*'''Jeg ser drengen.''' = ''I see the boy.''
*'''Jeg læser en bog.''' = ''I read a book.''
*'''Jeg læser bogen.''' = ''I read the book.''
*'''Jeg spiser et æble.''' = ''I eat an apple.''
*'''Jeg spiser æblet.''' = ''I eat the apple.''

===Plural nouns===
Indefinite:
*'''drenge''' = ''boys''
*'''piger''' = ''girls''
*'''huse''' = ''houses''
*'''æbler''' = ''apples''

Definite:
*'''drengene''' = ''the boys''
*'''pigerne''' = ''the girls''
*'''husene''' = ''the houses''
*'''æblerne''' = ''the apples''


Here is the table for inflections of nouns:

&lt;table border=1&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th rowspan=2&gt;Gender&lt;th colspan=2&gt;Singluar&lt;th colspan=2&gt;Plural
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Indefinite&lt;th&gt;Definite&lt;th&gt;Indefinite&lt;th&gt;Definite
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Common gender&lt;td&gt;en dreng&lt;td&gt;drengen&lt;td&gt;drenge&lt;td&gt;drengene
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Neuter&lt;td&gt;et æble&lt;td&gt;æblet&lt;td&gt;æbler&lt;td&gt;æblerne
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Re: Dynamic Types ====

The statement about static array bounds in C is misleading if not
incorrect in its current form. At least since C99, I think. Consider

 float g(int n)
 {
   struct S {
     float fs[n];
   };
 
   // ...
 }

This is also o.K. by all my C compilers

===== C99 =====

True, C99 has dynamic arrays.  We might have to change the statement.

PS: you must have an exotic set of C compiler since all main stream compiler either have not implemented va arrays or still have them on the known bug list.

== Improvement of basics page ==
If the point of this &quot;basics&quot; page is to teach a newby Ada, then I think it's missed completely.  It seems to start in the middle, wanders through examples, using lots of terminology that's never explained, only to point out relatively unhelpful variations of some commands.

How about a more structured approach; give the explanation of a minimal Ada program, then flesh it out with the &quot;hello world&quot; example.

If a discussion of executible sizes is in order right away, the provide details on options to be used, or links to the mentioned projects.

This looks like a disorganized mess.

:The current status of the page is the confluetion of various collaborations with a divergent approach. You may be right in that the page may need a rework. The executable size section might be moved to [[Ada Programming/Tips]] with a link from here. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 11:09, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

:This page ''definitely'' needs changes, it is the entry point from the Wikipedia Ada page and should be in the best possible shape I think. I have moved some of the messy details to a &amp;lt;ref&gt; footnote, &lt;del&gt;but it is lost now! Can't we use footnotes, or have I made a mistake?&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Found it, my fault, sorry.&lt;/ins&gt; [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 22:51, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

:I'd like to see a few more things moved into footnotes, in particlar the excerpt from the Text_IO header!  It really interrupts the flow and is off-putting to the newbie. [[User:Gahs|Gahs]] ([[User talk:Gahs|talk]]) 20:50, 6 December 2007 (UTC)


Sorry not sure how to use the discussion page yet but should;
   Put(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
   New_Line;
   Put(&quot;I am an Ada program with package use.&quot;);
be replaced by
   Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
   New_Line;
   Put_Line(&quot;I am an Ada program with package use.&quot;);
please delete this once dealt with by experienced Ada programmer. Thank you.

== Compilation ==

It would be nice if you could point out how to compile hello world with gnat, e.g. gnatmake hello_world.adb. This is the basics page after all and just running gnat hello_world.adb produces unhelpful errors. See also http://www.adacore.com/wp-content/files/auto_update/gnat-unw-docs/html/gnat_ugn_2.html --[[Special:Contributions/139.19.14.55|139.19.14.55]] ([[User talk:139.19.14.55|discuss]])

: You are right. I have just discovered that the [[Ada Programming/Building]] page was not referenced inside the wikibook. It was only included on the final [[Ada Programming/All Chapters]] compilation. I have included a link to that chapter on this one. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ManuelGR|contribs]]) 18:29, 24 May 2011 (UTC)

== Input ==

It would be nice if you also added an example with text input. The &quot;What's your name?&quot; - Input - &quot;Hello, $Name$&quot; example. --[[Special:Contributions/139.19.14.55|139.19.14.55]] ([[User talk:139.19.14.55|discuss]])

Yes ... it would be nice to explain how to begin to compile this hello world, because sommething is missing to get it.</text>

{{fruit}} | [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]]
The '''ugli fruit''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]].

Ugli fruits are named after their appearance which is generally discolored, pot-marked and odd-shaped. However, it gets a bad rap; it really has a very sweet, citrus taste, is peeled easily and is seedless, making it a great snack or addition to salads. The outside is a greenish-yellow color and has a shape that is between an [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] and a [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]]. 

Ugli fruits are native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]] and have been propagated in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] since the 1930s. They are said to combine the best qualities of [[Cookbook:Tangerine|tangerines]], [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]] and Seville oranges. Ugli fruits have a very thick exterior, so you don't get as much pulp as you might expect from the size.

==Storage, Selection and Preparation==
Choose fruits that are heavy and have no sign of drying at the ends. The fruit should give with slight pressure much like grapefruit. Color is not important when choosing, and pot-marks and small dents are normal. Uglis can be kept at room temperature for about 5 days, or in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Uglis should not be cooked or it will lose flavor.</text>

The '''kumquat''' is a type of [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]].

Kumquats can appear in markets from October (at the earliest) through June, and during some unpredictable off-season times as well. Considered a winter fruit, their golden color is a welcome sight. Select fruits that are firm, not soft. Because of their skin, they tend to spoil more easily than thicker skinned fruits such as [[Cookbook:Orange|oranges]]. Kumquats will last a few days at room temperature or for up to two weeks in the refrigerator. The entire kumquat is consumed in a bite or two. Because of their size and color, they are also great as drink garnishes or as an addition to salads. Wash kumquats before serving.</text>

[[Image:CDC_sapote.jpg|right|sapote]]

The '''sapote''' is quite rare in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]]. Only a few acres in Florida and [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] are planted with this fruit. Sapote has a orange flesh that is unusually soft, juicy, creamy and has a sweet, mild flavor that hints at flavors such as [[Cookbook:Coconut|coconut]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]], and [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]. Sapotes are the size of a [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]] or [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]] and are bright green or brown in color. This fruit is a native of the highlands of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]], but has grown in California since the early 1800s. Varieties such as the mamey, black skinned, green skinned, yellow skinned and about half a dozen more uncommon varieties pop up in grocery stores and farmer’s markets from time to time.

==Selection, Storage, and Preparation==
Sapotes are generally on the market in fall and winter, but seasonality can vary from year to year. Select hard fruits and store at room temperature. However, they last only about 3 days. Chill briefly before serving. This fruit can be frozen as well; wrap the whole fruit and tuck into the freezer. To serve, half thaw in the refrigerator, and then scoop the rest out like sherbet.</text>

The '''pepino''' or '''pepino melon''' is also known as '''treemelon''', '''bush melon''', and '''mellowfruit'''. It is native to [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Peru|Peru]], but is now also grown in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]]. Pepinos are teardrop-shaped and have a smooth skin that is striped with yellow and dark purple. The flesh of this fruit is fragrant and combines the tastes of [[Cookbook:Cantaloupe|cantaloupe]] and [[Cookbook:Honeydew|honeydew]].

==Selection, Storage, and Preparation==
Pepinos are available late fall to mid-spring. Fruits with a light yellow or green skin are not ripe, while fruits with dark purple stripes are ripe. Ripen at room temperature until as firm as a slightly ripe plum, then refrigerate ripe fruit for up to 3 days.</text>

[[Image:CDC_cherimoya.jpg|right|cherimoya]]

The '''cherimoya''' is also known as the '''custard apple''' or '''sherbet fruit'''. It is large and pinecone-like in appearance with a green exterior. Cherimoyas are juicy with a creamy white flesh that tastes like a combination of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]], [[Cookbook:Mango|mango]], [[Cookbook:Papaya|papaya]], and [[Cookbook:Vanilla|vanilla]]. The large black seeds are numerous, but very easy to remove. The cherimoya is related to the [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|pawpaw]].

Cherimoyas are available November through May. Choose fruits that are yellow-green, firm and without blemishes. Dark spots and splotches should be avoided. Cherimoyas will ripen at room temperature for a few days until softened. They can then be tightly wrapped and refrigerated for up to 4 days. Once ripe, a cherimoya will spoil very quickly.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The present tense in Danish verbs is expressed by adding an '''r''' to the end.

The basic form of a verb is the ''infinitive''. In English these are words preceded by ''to'', such as ''to go'' and ''to be''. The Danish translation of ''to'' in this case is '''at'''. Danish infinitives usually end in '''e''', and you get the present tense by adding '''-r'''. 
There are two major groups of Danish verbs.  In one group, you add -de or -ede to the end of the infinitive to create the past tense and -et to the end to create the perfect tense.  In the other group, you replace the e at the end of the infinitive with -te to get the past tense, and remove the e from  the past tense to get the perfect.

You will experience a lot of examples where these rules doesn't apply, but they are the most general ones.

Note that several verbs in the table are irregular.

'''Note''': Imperative is the tense where you give a command like &quot;eat!&quot;, &quot;read!&quot;, &quot;listen!&quot; etc.

[[Image:CDC_blue.jpg|right|blueberries]]
The '''blueberry''' is a small sweet fruit.

Wild blueberries are smaller than cultivated ones. Blueberries have a protective light powdery coating on the skins and tend to last longer than other berry varieties. Nearly half of the cultivated blueberries grown are sold as fresh blueberries. Fresh blueberries are available for nearly eight months of the year from producers across the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]]. [[Cookbook:North American cuisines|North America]] is the world's leading blueberry producer, accounting for nearly 90% of world production. 

==Selection==
[[Image:Blueberry Macro 2.JPG|thumb]]
In general, berries should be dry, firm, well shaped, and eaten within a week after purchase. If you can’t eat them that soon, remember that berries freeze well! It’s best to buy berries that are ‘in-season’ as they’ll cost less and are more ripe and flavorful than ‘out-of-season’ berries.

Blueberries must be ripe when purchased, as they do not continue to ripen after harvesting. Stay away from containers of berries with juice stains which may be a sign that the berries are crushed and possibly moldy; soft, watery fruit that means the berries are overripe; dehydrated, wrinkled fruit that means the berries have been stored too long.

Select blueberries that are firm, dry, plump, and smooth-skinned. Berries should be completely blue (deep-purple blue to blue-black) with no tinge of red; reddish berries aren't ripe but can be used in cooking.

==Storage==
Keep blueberries refrigerated, unwashed, in a rigid covered container. Water on fresh blueberries hastens deterioration, so do not wash before refrigeration. They should last up to two weeks if they are freshly picked.

To freeze, first rinse then dry thoroughly. Discard immature or overripe berries. Store in airtight freezer containers, for up to one year.

==Cooking==
*Blueberries tend to change color during cooking. Acids, like [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]] and [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], make the blue in blueberries turn red. In an alkaline environment, such as a [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] with too much [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]], the blueberries may turn greenish-blue.
*To reduce the amount of color streaking, stir your blueberries (right from your freezer, if frozen) into your [[Cookbook:Cake|cake]] or [[Cookbook:Muffin|muffin]] batter last.
*When making [[Cookbook:Pancake|pancakes]] and [[Cookbook:Waffle|waffles]], add the blueberries as soon as the batter has been poured on the [[Cookbook:Griddle|griddle]] or [[Cookbook:Waffle Iron|waffle iron]]. This will make the pancakes prettier and they'll be easier to flip. If frozen blueberries are used, cooking time may have to be increased to be sure the berries are heated through.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Blueberry|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|3|3|2|1|1}}

Blueberry becomes available halfway through spring, with a peak in the summer. The North American blueberry harvest (responsible for most of the world's supply) runs from mid-April through early October, with peak harvest from mid-May to August.

[[Image:CDC_raspberry.jpg|right|raspberries]]
The '''raspberry''' is a small delicate berry. Raspberries have a similar structure to blackberries, but they are hollow. Red raspberries are the most common type but there are also golden, amber, and purple berries all similar in taste and texture. In the USA raspberries are often imported from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Chile|Chile]], while most of the fruit comes from [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]]. Raspberry season begins in June and lasts through October in the northern hemisphere.  In Europe raspberries are grown in most places and imported in large quantities from south eastern Europe, particulary Serbia and Bulgaria.

==Selection==
In general, berries should be dry, firm, well shaped, and eaten within a week after purchase. If you can’t eat them that soon, remember that berries freeze well! It’s best to buy berries that are ‘in-season’ as they’ll cost less and are more ripe and flavorful than ‘out-of-season’ berries.

Stay away from containers of berries with juice stains which may be a sign that the berries are crushed and possibly moldy; soft, watery fruit that means the berries are overripe; dehydrated, wrinkled fruit that means the berries have been stored too long.

Select raspberries that are unblemished and dry, in an unstained container. Raspberries should be medium to bright red, depending on the variety. Moisture will increase spoilage, so the berries themselves should be relatively dry. Shelf life for raspberries is short, and they should be consumed within 2–3 days of purchase. Eat at room temperature for fullest flavor.

==Frozen==
It is always best to buy fresh fruit but frozen produce is available and especially popular in the USA.

A 350 gram bag of whole frozen raspberries is equal to about 3 cups frozen berries.

Whole frozen berries destined for your [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods should be used frozen. Gently fold into [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]], [[Cookbook:Cake|cakes]] and [[Cookbook:Muffin|muffins]] just prior to use.

Store whole frozen berries in their unopened or tightly resealed packages in your freezer. If berries are to be served alone, thaw until they are pliable and serve partially frozen. Add sugar to taste — it brings out both the flavor and the luscious juices.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;background: #ffc; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

Making a simple sentence diagram is very easy! Let’s get started right now.

First, draw a base line:

{| style=&quot;width: 372px; height: 15px; border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|- style=&quot;border-bottom: solid black 3px&quot;
|
|-
|
|}

Then, cross the base line with another line:

{| style=&quot;width: 372px; height: 142px; border-collapse: collapse&quot;
|- style=&quot;height: 50%; border-bottom: solid black 3px&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; |
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; |
|- style=&quot;height: 50%&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; |
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; |
|}

We will draw the sentence diagram on top of these lines. Are you ready?

Let’s use a simple sentence:

  Marta plays.

This sentence has two parts: “Marta” and “plays”.

Write “Marta” on the first part of the base line, and “plays” on the second part.

{| style=&quot;width: 372px; height: 142px; border-collapse: collapse; font: bold 24pt Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: center; vertical-align: center&quot;
|- style=&quot;height: 50%; border-bottom: solid black 3px&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; | Marta
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; | plays.
|- style=&quot;height: 50%&quot;
| style=&quot;width: 50%; border-right: solid black 3px&quot; |
| style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; |
|}

In this sentence, “Marta” is the subject. In sentence diagrams, we write the subject on the first part of the line.

“Plays” is the predicate. We write predicates on the second part of the line.

Later, we will see how to diagram longer sentences.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Grammar is fun! ==
Grammar tells how we use words to talk and write to one another. 

We learn about grammar so we can understand other people, and so other people can understand us!

We use grammar every day, all of the time. We usually do not realize that we are using it.

Remember, grammar is fun, and learning about grammar is fun, too!

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Denmark|Danish Cuisine]]

The '''frikadeller''' - as [[w:Denmark|Danish]] as the [[w:Dannebrog|Dannebrog]].

This is standard Danish fare, made of ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] and [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]].  Traditionally served with [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]], [[Cookbook:Gravy|gravy]] and [[Cookbook:Rødkål|rødkaal]] ([[Cookbook:Braising|braised]] red [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]]). Originally, this dish was made so that the meat would feed more people, and thus, the possibilities as to what can be added are numerous. 

These can be frozen and reheated.

==Ingredients==
*250 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] (about 0.5 lbs) ground [[Cookbook:Veal|veal]]
*250 grams ground [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
*1 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]]
*20% by volume of [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]] (or approx 3/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]])
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] and [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] to taste

*[[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]] (optional)
*substitute bread crumbs with [[Cookbook:Wheat Germ|wheat germ]] and/or [[Cookbook:Oat Bran|oat bran]]
*ground [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] to taste
*Any ingredient will work. Many people add a quantity of milk also, and the mixture is then thickened again with more flour, bread crumbs and/or oat bran.

==Procedure==
#Mix all ingredients.
#Make small patties.
#[[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] in hot [[Cookbook:Skillet|skillet]] with (lots of) butter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;math&gt;z=a+bi= r \left ( \cos \phi \ + i\sin \phi \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''i'' is the [[w:Imaginary Number|imaginary number]] &lt;math&gt;\left (i\ = \sqrt{-1}\right )&lt;/math&gt;
* the modulus &lt;math&gt;r=\operatorname{mod}(z)=|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}&lt;/math&gt;
* the argument &lt;math&gt;\phi=\arg(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle formed by the complex number on a polar graph with one real axis and one imaginary axis. This can be found using the [[Algebra/Complex Numbers#Some_examples|right angle trigonometry]] for the trigonometric functions.

This is sometimes abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;r\left ( \cos \phi \ + i\sin \phi \right )=r\operatorname{cis}\phi&lt;/math&gt; and it is also the case that &lt;math&gt;r\operatorname{cis}\phi=re^{i\phi}&lt;/math&gt; (provided that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is in radians).  The latter identity is called Euler's formula.

Euler's formula can be used to prove DeMoivre's formula:  &lt;math&gt;( \cos \phi \ + i\sin \phi )^n=\cos(n\phi)+i\sin(n\phi).&lt;/math&gt;  This formula is valid for all values of n, real or complex.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Tablature (or tabs for short)''' is a way of notating music in a way that is easy to understand and easy to notate in digital form. Tablature is most common for guitar, bass (guitar), and drums, though tablature may exist for other instruments. One advantage of tablature is that it does not require the reader to be able to read standard music notation. There are, however, some pitfalls to tablature notation. For guitar, it doesn't usually show the rhythm or fingering of the song. So in order to be able to play a piece of music from tablature, it is essential to have heard the song before and be reasonably familiar with it.

== Notation ==

Tablature is written on lined paper similar to normal music paper (called a music staff). For guitar, each line corresponds to a string; thus there are 6 lines (4 for bass). Numbers are used to indicate which string to pick and which fret to stop. For example:
 e|-0---0---0---0---------
 B|-----------------------
 G|-----------------------
 D|-----------------------
 A|-----------------------
 E|-----------------------
Means you pluck the top E string 4 times on the open string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">redirect for now.  hopefully a mod will make it vice versa. [[User:69.42.5.52|69.42.5.52]] 02:52, 7 May 2005 (UTC)
:  Ok, I copied the drum tabs over to this page, they're (hopefully) a bit more organized now. --[[User:Njk|Njk]] 09:21, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

Apparently there was a WikiCities project on tablature but it was shut down due to copyright violation. See the talk page here: http://www.wikicities.com/wiki/Talk:Tablature  
So maybe we shouldn't include any copyrighted examples?  --[[User:Njk|Njk]] 14:12, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

There is a wiki for tab if your looking to post tableture in the wiki format or looking for more tabs to add to  wiki books [http://www.tabwiki.com tabwiki.com] --[[User:24.141.248.106|24.141.248.106]] 16:18, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

== Discussion From [[Talk:Tabs]] ==

Could this be renamed as '''Tablature'''? I wasn't clear as to what this book was about until I clicked on it. I was pleasantly surprised though, I'd love to help out with this. -[[User:Njk|Njk]] 17:54, 5 May 2005 (UTC)
::Sure, I think that would be a good idea.  [[User:69.42.5.52|69.42.5.52]] 02:45, 7 May 2005 (UTC)

===Copyright issues===
I used to have a [http://tablature.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page Tablature site] at [http://www.wikicities.com Wikicities] but it was taken down due to copyright infringement - making tabs is supposedly breaking copyright. I think that http://tabwiki.com is doing a fine job at the moment and more effort doesn't need to put into making pretty much exactly the same site. Especially since in the future the Administrators at Wikibooks may take down this section. [[Wikipedia:User:Jackhynes|Jack]] 11.23, 7 May 2005 (GMT)

===Tab Wiki===
I don't see why this module is needed, another tableture wiki already exists ([http://www.tabwiki.com www.tabwiki.com]) which has a much larger tab selection on it.  This might just be because I contribute to tabwiki but I just see a Tableture Module on WikiBooks as being redundant.
&lt;Br&gt;
PS. If any one wants to help out over at tabwiki we're always looking for more contributors :)

The '''cranberry''' is a small sour fruit. It is so sour that most people can't stand to eat fresh cranberries alone. Cranberries contain edible seeds and plenty of air. Cranberry juice has been shown to reduce bladder infections in a nursing home environment. Cranberries are popular as juice, dried fruit, and a [[Cookbook:Jam|jam]] or [[Cookbook:Jelly|jelly]] called [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|cranberry sauce]] — all with added [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] of course. One single growers' cooperative, Ocean Spray, controls 70% of the cranberry crop.

==Selection==
Ripe cranberries will bounce if they are in good condition. They should be shiny and plump and range in color from bright light red to dark red. Shriveled berries or those with brown spots should be avoided. Cranberries do not ripen after harvest.

==Storage==
Store fresh cranberries in a tightly-sealed plastic bag in the refrigerator. As with all berries, if one starts getting soft and decaying, the others will quickly soften and decay also. Be sure to sort out the soft ones if you plan to store them for more than a few days. Fresh cranberries may last up to 2 months in the refrigerator. Cooked cranberries can last up to a month in a covered container in the refrigerator. Washed cranberries may be frozen for up to 1 year in airtight bags.

==Preparation==
No matter what preparation method you choose, cook cranberries only until they pop; overcooking gives them a bitter taste. Since cranberries are almost 90% water, do not thaw frozen cranberries before cooking them. Thawing will cause the fruit to break down, resulting in soft berries. Cranberries may be baked with a [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]] to make a topping or [[Cookbook:Cranberry Sauce|sauce]]. They are also good chopped with [[Cookbook:Orange|oranges]] to make a relish.

For [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] goods, first slice the cranberries open. Add all [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] from the recipe, and probably quite a bit more. Let this mixture soak in the refrigerator so that the sugar gets into the cranberries.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Spherical Blend Texture ==

This technique maps a spherical blend texture to the outsides of an object.

Create a new material and name it something intelligent. Create a new texture for this material, change the texture type to Blend, and then in the texture properties, change the blend shape to &quot;Sphere&quot;.

[[File:BNTP img1.png]]


Back in the material buttons, go the &quot;MapInput&quot; tab and change the texture coordinates to Blank-Blank-Z and Nor and as demonstrated in the next screenshot:
[[File:BNTP_img2.png]]


Finally go the &quot;MapTop&quot; tab, and depress the Emit button and set the Texture Blending Mode to &quot;Add&quot;:

That's all there is to it, and here is how it looks:

This is a technique that a rather famous blender user called &quot;@ndy&quot; uses. Very simple and effective.

All you need to do is place a Hemi light BEHIND the object you want to light in respect to the active camera. 

Breakdown:
First add a Hemi lamp to your scene:


[[File:BNTP img10.png]]


Next, Select the lamp THEN press and hold down the Shift key, and select the Camera. Press Control-C to bring up the copy attributes menu, and copy location AND rotation.


[[File:BNTP img11.png]]


Now select JUST your lamp, press R to rotate it, then press the X key TWICE to rotate around the local X axis. Using your numpad, key in &quot;180&quot; to rotate the object 180Degrees.

All that remains to do is to press G to grab the lamp, then press Z TWICE to move along the local Z axis, and move the lamp until it is past and behind the object of interest.
your resulting setup should look something like this:

And here is the rendered result:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a database abstraction layer? ==
A database abstraction layer (dal) is a couple of functions or a class which deals with every aspects of database handling.

First of all you have a function to connect and to disconnect to/from the database. You also have some functions to submit a query, and to get the results and finally you need to have some error-handling functions too.

== Why to use a dal instead of the regular php funcitons? ==

Of course you do not replace the php-functions, you just connect them to get a better performance when you need to develop your code, validate the data, etc...

If you use a really flexible dal, then you do not need to change every line of your code if you switch from one database type to the other.

== How to write a dal? ==

Most users should not be writing their own DAL, since there are several ready-to-use open-source DALs available. One of the benefits of a DAL is to make code more reusable, and writing your own DAL (unless it achieves wide acceptance in the PHP community) is counterproductive. The most common one is the [http://pear.php.net/package/DB PEAR:DB] package which is already installed on the majority of web servers.

You can find some less sophisticated dals in the source files of some well written open-source CMS sites also.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{msg:GeneralChemTOC|prev=Redox Reactions/Oxidation state|next=Redox Reactions/Electrochemistry}}

== Redox ==

Redox reactions are chemical reactions in which elements are oxidized and reduced.

{{Info|1=
*''Losing'' electrons is '''oxidation'''.
*''Gaining'' electrons is '''reduction'''.}}

Specifically, at the most basic level one element gets ''oxidized'' by losing, or donating, electrons to the ''oxidizing agent''. In doing so, the oxidizing agent gets ''reduced'' by accepting the electrons lost, or donated, by the ''reducing agent'' (i.e. the element getting oxidized).

If it seems as though there are two separate things going on here, you are correct: redox reactions can be split into two '''half-reactions''', one dealing with oxidation, the other, reduction.

=== Mnemonic ===
Oil Rig

'''O'''xidation '''I'''s '''L'''oss. '''R'''eduction '''I'''s '''G'''ain

Alternatively:

LEO GER

'''L'''oose '''E'''lectrons '''O'''xidation. '''G'''ain '''E'''lectrons '''R'''eduction

=== Example ===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;20px&quot;
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Fe} + \hbox{Cu}^{2+} \to \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + \hbox{Cu}&lt;/math&gt;
| This is the complete reaction.  Iron is oxidized, thus it is the reducing agent.  Copper is reduced, making it the oxidizing agent.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Fe} \to \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^-&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the oxidation half-reaction.
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\hbox{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^-\to \hbox{Cu}&lt;/math&gt;
|This is the reduction half-reaction.
|}

When the two half-reactions are summed, the result is:

{{Helpful hint|hint=If you cancel out the electrons on both sides, you get the original equation.}}

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hbox{Fe} &amp; \to \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \\
\hbox{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- &amp; \to \hbox{Cu} \\
\hline
\hbox{Fe} + \hbox{Cu}^{2+} + 2e^- &amp; \to \hbox{Cu} + \hbox{Fe}^{2+} + 2e^- \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Balancing Redox Equations==

In a redox reaction, ''all electrons must cancel out''.  If you are adding two half-reactions with unequal numbers of electrons, then the equations must be multiplied by a common denominator.  This process is similar to balancing regular equations, but now you are trying to balance the electrons between two half-reactions.

=== Example ===

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\hbox{Fe}^{2+} &amp; \to \hbox{Fe}^{3+} + e^- \\
\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 + 2e^- &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- \\
\hline
\hbox{Fe}^{2+} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 + 2e^- &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- + \hbox{Fe}^{3+} + e^- \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The electrons don't completely cancel out.  There is one electron more on the left.  However, if you double ''all'' terms in the first half-reaction, then add it to the second half-reaction, the electrons will cancel out completely.  That means the half-reactions for this redox reaction are actually:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
2\hbox{Fe}^{2+} &amp; \to 2\hbox{Fe}^{3+} + 2e^- \\
\hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 + 2e^- &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- \\
\hline
2\hbox{Fe}^{2+} + \hbox{H}_2\hbox{O}_2 &amp; \to 2 \hbox{OH}^- + 2\hbox{Fe}^{3+} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Balancing Redox Equations in an Acidic or Basic Solution==
If a reaction occurs in an [[General Chemistry/Properties and Theories of Acids and Bases|acidic or basic]] environment, the redox equation is balanced as follows:

{{TextBox|1=
# Write the oxidation and reduction half reactions, but with the whole compound, not just the element that is reduced/oxidized.
# Balance both reactions for all elements ''except'' oxygen and hydrogen.
# If the oxygen atoms are not balanced in either reaction, add water molecules to the side missing the oxygen.
# If the hydrogen atoms are not balanced, add hydrogen ions until the hydrogen atoms are balanced.
# Multiply the half reactions by the appropriate number (so that they have equal numbers of electrons).
# Add the two equations to cancel out the electrons, as in the previous method, and the equation is balanced!}}

If the reaction occurs in a basic environment, proceed as if it is in an acid environment, but, after step 4, for each hydrogen ion added, add a hydroxide ion to both sides of the equation. Then, combine the hydroxide ions and hydrogen ions to form water. Then, cancel all the water molecules that appear on both sides.

{{Wikipedia|Oxidation state}}
'''Oxidation states''' are used to determine the degree of ''oxidation'' or ''reduction'' that an element has undergone when bonding.  The oxidation state of a compound is the sum of the oxidation states of all atoms within the compound, which equals zero unless the compound is ionic.

{{Info|1=
*''Gaining'' electrons is '''reduction'''.
*''Losing'' electrons is '''oxidation'''.}}

The oxidation state of an atom within a molecule is the charge it ''would'' have ''if'' the bonding were completely ionic, even though covalent bonds do not actually result in charged ions.

== Method of notation ==

Oxidation states are written above the element or group of elements that they belong to (when drawing the molecule), or written with roman numerals in parenthesis when naming the elements.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _0 \\ Al \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| aluminum
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{+3} \\ Al \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| aluminum(III), an ion
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

== Determining oxidation state ==

=== For single atoms or ions ===

Because oxidation numbers are just the sum of the electrons gained or lost, calculating them for single elements is easy.

{{Info|The oxidation state of a single element is the same as its charge.  Pure elements always have an oxidation states of zero.}}

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _1 \\ K^+ \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _0 \\ Br \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _1 &amp; _{-1} \\ Na &amp; Cl \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Notice that the oxidation states of ionic compounds are simple to determine.

=== For larger molecules ===

{{Helpful hint|hint=Remember that all the individual oxidation states must add up to the charge on the whole substance.}}

Although covalent bonds do not result in charges, oxidation states are still useful.  They label the hypothetical transfer of electrons ''if'' the substance were ionic.  Determining the oxidation states of atoms in a covalent molecule is very important when analyzing &quot;redox&quot; reactions.  When substances react, they may transfer electrons when they form the products, so comparing the oxidation states of the products and reactants allows us to keep track of the electrons.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ '''Examples'''
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{+1} &amp; _{-1} \\ H &amp; Cl \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| for hydrogen chloride
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{2(+1)} &amp; _{-2} \\ H_2 &amp; O \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; 
| for water
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix} _{+3} &amp; _{2(-2)} \\ Cl &amp; O_2 \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
| for the chlorite ion&lt;br&gt;
(notice the overall charge)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

{{Yellow Warning|Oxidation states do not necessarily represent the actual charges on an atom in a molecule. They are simply numbers that indicate what the charges would be if that atom had gained or lost the electrons involved in the bonding.  For example, &lt;math&gt;CH_4&lt;/math&gt; is a covalent molecule—the C has no charge nor does the H, however the molecule can be assigned a -4 oxidation state for the C and a +1 oxidation state for the H's.}}


DETERMINING OXIDATION STATES


The determination of oxidation states is based on knowing which elements can have only one oxidation state other than the elemental state and which elements are able to form more than one oxidation state other than the elemental state. Let's look at some of the &quot;rules&quot; for determining the oxidation states.

1.	The oxidation state of an element is always zero. 

2.	For metals, the charge of the ion is the same as the oxidation state. The following metals form only one ion: Group IA, Group IIA, Group IIIA (except Tl), Zn2+, Cd2+.

3.	For monatomic anions and cations, the charge is the same as the oxidation state. 

4.	Oxygen in a compound is -2, unless a peroxide is present. The oxidation state of oxygen in peroxide ion , O22- is -1.

5. For compounds containing polyatomic ions, use the overall charge of the polyatomic ion to determine the charge of the cation.
Here is a convenient method for determining oxidation states. Basically, you treat the charges in the compound as a simple algebraic expression. For example, let's determine the oxidation states of the elements in the compound, KMnO4. Applying rule 2, we know that the oxidation state of potassium is +1. We will assign &quot;x&quot; to Mn for now, since manganese may be of several oxidation states. There are 4 oxygens at -2. The overall charge of the compound is zero:
K Mn O4
+1 x 4(-2)

The algebraic expression generated is: 
1 + x -8 = 0

Solving for x gives the oxidation state of manganese:
x - 7 = 0
x = +7
K Mn O4
+1 +7 4(-2)

Suppose the species under consideration is a polyatomic ion. For example, what is the oxidation state of chromium in dichromate ion, (Cr2O72-)? 

As before, assign the oxidation state for oxygen, which is known to be -2. Since the oxidation state for chromium is not known, and two chromium atoms are present, assign the algebraic value of 2x for chromium:
Cr2 O7 2-
2x 7(-2)

Set up the algebraic equation to solve for x. Since the overall charge of the ion is -2, the expression is set equal to -2 rather than 0:
2x + 7(-2) = -2

Solve for x:
2x - 14 = -2
2x = 12
x = +6

Each chromium in the ion has an oxidation state of +6.
Let's do one last example, where a polyatomic ion is involved. Suppose you need to find the oxidation state of all atoms in Fe2(CO3)3. Here two atoms, iron and carbon, have more than one possible oxidation state. What happens if you don't know the oxidation state of carbon in carbonate ion? In fact, knowledge of the oxidation state of carbon is unnecessary. What you need to know is the charge of carbonate ion (-2). Set up an algebraic expression while considering just the iron ion and the carbonate ion:
Fe2 (CO3)3
2x 3(-2)
2x - 6 = 0 
2x = 6
x = 3

Each iron ion in the compound has an oxidation state of +3.
Next consider the carbonate ion independent of the iron(III) ion:
C O3 2-
x 3(-2)
x - 6 = -2
x = +4

The oxidation state of carbon is +4 and each oxygen is -2.

== Guidelines ==

Determining oxidation states is not always easy, but there are many guidelines that can help.  This guidelines in this table are listed in order of importance.  The highest oxidation state that any element can reach is +8 in XeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Element
!Usual Oxidation State
|-
| Fluorine
| Fluorine, being the most electronegative element, will always have an oxidation of -1 (except when it is bonded to itself in F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, when its oxidation state is 0).
|-
| Hydrogen
| Hydrogen always has an oxidation of +1, -1, or 0.  It is +1 when it is bonded to a non-metal (e.g. HCl, hydrochloric acid).  It is -1 when it is bonded to metal (e.g. NaH, sodium hydride).  It is 0 when it is bonded to itself in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
|-
| Oxygen
| Oxygen is usually given an oxidation number of -2 in its compounds, such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The exception is in peroxides (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) where it is given an oxidation of -1. Also, in F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O oxygen is given an oxidation of +2 (because fluorine must have -1), and in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where it is bonded only to itself, the oxidation is 0.
|-
| Alkali Metals
| The Group 1A metals always have an oxidation of +1, as in NaCl.  The Group 2A metals always have an oxidation of +2, as in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  There are some rare exceptions that don't need consideration.
|-
| Halogens
| The other halogens (Cl, Br, I, As) usually have an oxidation of -1.  When bonded to another halogen, its oxidation will be 0.  However, they can also have +1, +3, +5, or +7.  Looking at the family of chlorides, you can see each oxidation state (Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (0), Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (-1), ClO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+1), ClO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+3), ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+5), ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (+7)).
|-
| Nitrogen
| Nitrogen (and the other Group 5A elements, such as phosphorus, P) often have -3 (as in ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), but may have +3 (as in NI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or +5 (as in phosphate, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;).
|- 
| Carbon
| Carbon can literally have any oxidation state (from -4, as in CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, to +4, as in CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  It is best to find the oxidation of other elements first.
|}

In general, ''the more electronegative element has the negative number''.  Using a chart of electronegativities, you can determine the oxidation state of any atom within a compound.

== Periodicity ==

Oxidation states are another periodic trend.  They seem to repeat a pattern across each period.

'''Purpose: To demonstrate the object collision feature of Blender's Game Engine.'''

== Introduction to Object Collision ==

In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of object collision within the Blender Game Engine (BGE).  These physics simulations can be used for many things, from Blender games to use in animations, the bullet physics engine offers a massive number of possibilities, limited only by your imagination (and the amount of RAM your computer possesses).  The tutorials found within this wikibook on the subject of the BGE are generally focused on game creation, but the concepts taught within them can be applied to a multitude of situations.

With the mouse cursor over a 3D viewport, press NUMPAD-7 to switch to TOP view.

Press the spacebar and select Add &gt;Mesh &gt;Plane.  Press TAB to leave edit mode and enter object mode.
[http://img192.echo.cx/my.php?image=17bf.jpg]

Enlarge the plane by pressing S and dragging the mouse cursor away from the center of the plane. Click to stop re-sizing. The plane will serve as the 'floor'.

Add A UVSphere using the same sequence for adding the plane object.  Press TAB to enter object mode.  

With the mouse cursor over a 3D viewport, press NUMPAD 1 for Front view, then press G and move the sphere above the plane.  Click to exit Grab Mode.  You may need to scale the sphere down.  It will be the ball which collides with the floor.

Go to logic panel (move cursor over Button Viewport and press F4). 

Click on actor button (in the upper left corner of the logic panel), then Dynamic, then Rigid Body.  This activates physics properties for the sphere so it can bounce.

Change the value of &quot;Radius&quot; to 2.0. Notice the dotted line that appears around the sphere. This dotted line marks how big the physics engine thinks this sphere is. For now, set it back to 1.0.

Next, you want to add some colour to the sphere and the plane (see [[Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Quickie_Material]] for details), so you can tell the two apart during simulation.

Move the cursor over a 3D viewport and press P.  The sphere will drop down and collide with the plane.  Press ESC to end simulation

For fun, try rotating the plane in front or side (NUMPAD 3) view and press P again.  The ball will first hit the plane, then roll down.  Add several more planes rotated to differing angles and position them in the falling path of the ball to keep it going.

The '''gooseberry''' is a bittersweet little berry that the English have a passion for. Gooseberry wines, [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]] and [[Cookbook:Pudding|puddings]] were very popular in colonial days. Today most such recipes have all but disappeared from cookbooks.

Though this intriguing berry grows wild in many locations throughout the continental [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]], it's generally cultivated in tropical zones such as Hawaii, [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of South Africa|South Africa]], Asia, and Central and [[Cookbook:South American cuisines|South America]]. At first glance the cape gooseberry with its inflated, papery skin, looks somewhat like a Chinese lantern. The juicy berries that hide inside the skin are opaque and golden in color. Imported cape gooseberries are available from March to July.

Gooseberries are cultivated on a commercial scale in Oregon, but the vast majority of the crop is canned. Fresh berries are usually imported and are found in specialty produce markets. The popularity of gooseberries has been increasing over the past few years and fresh berries are becoming easier to find. The berries taste of a sweet tangy mixture of [[Cookbook:Pineapple|pineapple]] and [[Cookbook:Strawberry|strawberry]]. The fruits make an interesting addition to [[Cookbook:Salad|salads]], cooked dishes, and as a garnish.

==Selection==
Choose hard, dry berries, with a rich sheen. If you are looking for less tartness, head for the pinkish or purplish tones. Look for those with a bright golden color; green berries are not ripe. However, pick gooseberries green for pies and [[Cookbook:Jam|jams]].

==Storage==
Gooseberries store well and will stay fresh in the refrigerator for about two weeks. They should turn pinker and softer during their time in storage. Once they turn purple, the fruit is still good for purees for another week.

==Preparation==
Gooseberries vary in their bitterness. Some varieties are too bitter to eat raw, so taste one first. The less-bitter varieties of gooseberries are often added to fruit salads or used as garnish for [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] plates. To use the berries, peel back the parchment-like husk and rinse. Remove the stems and tops with scissors before eating or cooking. Gooseberries may be poached and eaten cooked or added to [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or syrup for a [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]]. To retain the shape of the berry, poach slowly. They are done when the seeds have escaped and the skins collapse.

==Varieties==
There are two types of gooseberries, the American and the [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]]. The European varieties have larger and more flavorful fruits.

*'''Pixwell:''' (American) This variety produces round 1/2-[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] berries that are light green, maturing to a soft pink.

*'''Welcome:''' (American) This variety produces a sweeter and darker fruit at maturity than the Pixwell and also produces a 1/2-inch berry.

*'''Clark:''' The most productive of the European gooseberry types. The berries are very large and red when ripe.

*'''Fredonia:''' (European) Available early mid-season. Ripens several days after Clark. Berries are also large and red when ripe.</text>

The pennywhistle, also known as the tin whistle or tin flute, is a traditional end-blown flute, similar to the recorder in appearance and use. Its origins are in Ireland, but it since has come into use in many branches of Celtic folk and traditional music, being among the most common melody instruments both in slow airs and in dance tunes such as jigs and reels. In contemporary Celtic music, it often adds a powerful accompaniment to vocal music, and it's high natural tone can provide a balance of range in multi-instrumental arrangements.  

This wikibook provides a tutorial on the basic method of the pennywhistle, as well as an introduction to ornamentation, improvisation, and playing in a seisiún (pronounced &quot;session&quot; in english; a sort of Irish &quot;jam session&quot;). This is especially designed to help someone who already knows a bit about music, such as different keys and scales, but even the musically uninitiated will find much useful information.

==Selecting an instrument==

Before you begin playing, it is critical to select an instrument that best fits your needs, abilities, and, of course, price range.  It is usually best to try out several whistles, either by purchasing or by borrowing them, before you decide which one to continue using.  In particular, don't give up whistling just because you don't like a specific whistle!  There are hundreds of reasonably priced whistles on the market.  Some are squeaky, shrill, and hard to handle, while others feel as natural as your own voice, so keep trying until you find the right one.  Here are some guidelines to set you on the right track. 

===Styles of whistle===

The construction of a pennywhistle is very simple, as the whistle consists of only two parts.  The first is the ''bore'', a tube about 2 cm in diameter.  Six holes are located on the bore; these are covered by the fingers to create different pitches.  The second part is the ''mouthpiece'', which is usually made of molded plastic and fixed to the bore (exceptions are listed below).  

The most popular pennywhistles on the market today are probably also the best choice for beginners: inexpensive, with plastic mouthpieces.  I highly recommend the Sweetone, which has a good sound and is available for five to six U.S. dollars from various online stores.

Another inexpensive choice is the Clarke whistle, which is made in England of a single sheet of metal wrapped in a semiconical shape, with a raw block of wood inserted as the mouthpiece.  This offers a soft, breathy sound that is appropriate for certain songs, but requires much more breath than a plastic mouthpiece, making long notes or phrases all but impossible.

Most low-cost whistles are not tunable, meaning that the pitch of each note is fixed and cannot be changed to match that of other instruments.  Other whistles, including some as inexpensive as $15, can be tuned by moving the mouthpiece.  A tunable whistle may be a good investment if you plan on playing with other musicians very often, and especially if you are accompanied by an instrument such as a piano that cannot be easily tuned to match your pitch.

It should be mentioned that it is in fact possible to modify low-cost non-tunable whistles. Whistles such as a Generation or a Walton have the fipple (''mouthpiece'') glued on. To modify such whistles carefully heat the fipple in hot water to soften the glue and remove the fipple. Clean the glue off both the fipple and the bore. Grease the inside of the fipple and the outside of the bore with vaseline or lip balm or similar and replace the fipple. This provides an airtight fit and allows the fipple to be eased up and down making it the whistle tunable.

The bore of most whistles is made of unfinished tin or brass. Some brands, however, also offer a &quot;blackwhistle&quot;, which has an opaque black finish on the bore.  This makes no difference except for looks, and should never cost more than an unfinished whistle.  

Another alternative to plain metal is the wooden whistle offered by the Sweetheart Flute Company.  These instruments offer a sweet, mellow tone and make it easy not to sound squeaky or shrill, though some may not like the deviation from the more piercing traditional sound.  They are without exception very expensive, starting around $100.  Unlike most whistles, which require that the musician half-cover holes to achieve sharps and flats, wooden whistles can have keys added to sharp certain notes for an extra charge.

The final and most unusual non-metal whistles, such as the Water Weasel brand, are made of PVC pipe.

===Keys===

As mentioned above, most whistles play in a specific key.  For example, a whistle in the key of D plays the notes of D, E, F#, G, A, B, and C# without requiring the musician to manually sharp any notes.  Any notes that are not on this scale must be created by half covering holes (unless your whistle has keys to sharp notes; see &quot;Styles of Whistle&quot; above.)  If you wish to play a natural C on a D whistle, for instance, you must half-cover the B hole to achieve a B#, which is also a C.  Some people find it easy to manually sharp notes; others prefer to buy whistles in several different keys.

Since the vast majority of Irish music is written in the keys of G and especially D, whistles in D and G are the most common, although it is also easy to find whistles in the key of C.  Each key of whistle has a different fingering.  For instance, when playing a C whistle, the lowest note-- that with all the holes covered-- is a middle qb; on a D whistle, the lowest note is the D just above middle C.  As a result, it can be very difficult to switch between keys.  It is really a personal decision whether this or manual sharps is more cumbersome.  Some people refuse to do either, and either play only tunes in their key or transpose other tunes into it.

One exception to these basic remarks is the low D whistle offered by many companies.  These whistles are fingered in the same pattern as a middle D whistle, but are much longer and wider so that they play an octave lower.  They are often made out of unconventional materials, such as PVC pipe, and usually have a wooden block instead of a molded plastic mouthpiece.  Low whistles have a deep, haunting sound that adds a nice variety to any whistler's repertoire.  

The disadvantages of low whistles are that they are more expensive than small whistles, take immense reserves of breath, and have very large, widely spaced holes.  Unless you have exceptionally large hands, you will probably need to cover the holes with the flat, fleshy part of your fingers between the second and third knuckles, rather than with the fingertips, which many people find difficult to get used to.  That said, this style of fingering is exactly the same as that of a bagpipe, so if you have played the pipes it will be second nature to you.

==Playing the whistle==

For this we assume that you are playing a whistle with the standard D tuning, which is the default whistle tuning.

There is a great tin whistle tutorial especially suitable for beginners at [whistleaway.com[http://www.whistleaway.com/whistletutorial.asp]].

'''Position of Whistle and Fingers'''

Hold the whistle so that it comes from your mouth at about forty-five degree angle. If you are right-handed, your right hand should be on the bottom- for left-handers it is reverse. Your thumbs hold the whistle up from below. Place the top pad the first three of your fingers (not the tip) over each corresponding hole, tight enough for no air to leak. This should require very little pressure if the fingers are correctly placed -if you find holding the position for long periods uncomfortable, you may be pressing too hard. The pinkies should be placed where ever is comfortable and out of the way. They are not used. When all the holes are covered, that is D position. If you lift up the lowest finger, you have E position. Lift the next lowest finger, and it is F. Lift the next one and it is G-- so on through A, B, until C has no holes covered. Because the whistle is held in place by 'pinching' the fingers and thumbs slightly, most whistlers will keep their bottom finger (right ring finger for right handed players) down whilst playing a C -this has no real effect on the tone.

When putting the whistle to your mouth, the mouthpiece should be held between the lips, but usually not protrude into the mouth far enough to bang into the teeth, which could damage both the mouthpiece and your teeth!

'''Blowing'''

Hold the whistle in D position. With a slow steady stream of air, exhale lightly. If you blow too softly the note will not be clear. If you blow too hard, it will either be D in a higher octave or it will just squeak. Practice until the note is a clear, low D. Practice with the other notes, as well, until they all are clear, low notes. Each note takes slightly more air pressure than the one below it.

For a higher octave, you only have to blow a little harder. However, it takes a lot of practice to keep these notes from squeaking. Has anybody heard about how practice helps?! You may not believe it but it's true!

'''Tonguing'''

Tonguing is performed by tapping the roof of your mouth with your tongue, as if sounding a 'T' or 'D', at the beginning of your breath -if you were using your vocal chords rather than playing the whistle, it would give you a 'tooo' sound. It has the effect of beginning the note with a sharp attack rather than a breathy opening. Whether you tongue some, all, or none of the notes you play is entirely a stylistic choice. Tonguing can also be used mid breath to punctuate playing, as it momentarily stops the breath. This can specifically be used to break up a run of identical notes.


'''Irish Ornamentation'''

Before you try ornamentation, make sure you can play fairly well and quickly. And remember- they are not rules about ornamentation that you should follow. What ever is easiest and sounds best is they method you should use. Everyone has their own style.

''The placing of Ornamentations''

Some Irish music provides ornaments, but the majority leaves the ornaments up to you. Using the following devices the song can be made prettier. When ever you think one of them would enhance the sound, use it. However, it is best not to go overboard. 

''The Grace Note''

The grace note is a very short note played before another, main note. For the notes D, E, and F, lift the finger that covers the A hole, and quickly set it down. Let's use an example to explain this a little clearer. You have a song, in which the sequence of notes goes like this: 

A G grace note E F grace note D

First play the A, then the G, then put you fingers in the position of E, but with the A hole uncovered, play, and quickly replace the A finger. (tongue only the grace note, not the main note). Next play the F, then form the D, with the A hole uncovered, play, and quickly replace the A finger.

For the notes G, A, and C, they same thing is done, only it is not the A hole that is uncovered for the grace note, but the B hole. You can use other holes as well for grace notes. Remember, there are not rules. What sounds best is best.

The length of a grace should be only long enough to be distinct. Keep it as short as possible without the tones blending.

''Strikes''

A strike is easy- just tap your finger on the hole below the note you are playing. Like the tonguing you can separate notes with a strike, which can be used well if there are two or more equal notes in row. For example A A A or G G.

''Cuts''

The cut is another way to separate notes. Instead of tapping the belower note as we do it in a strike, we are lifting one finger at a higher note to interrupt the airflow. Essential for this are the forefinger and the ringfinder of your left hand. To cut the notes D E and F you are lifting your left ringfinger and to for cutting the notes G A and B you take your left forefinger. You might ask what is meant with &quot;lifting the finger?&quot; and that is a quite important question. It is not a lifting at all but rather a really short flipping of your finger. As if a beetle is sitting on your finger and you want to chase it of. 

''Slides''

A slide is a gradual transition from one note to another, as opposed to the ordinary form of quickly moving to the next note.  Generally done by gently rolling the finger onto or off of the hole, as opposed to the tapping required in quicker melodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Note the word endings, and how they change in their plural forms:

Words ending in '''&quot;a&quot;''' or '''&quot;e&quot;''' get an '''&quot;s&quot;'''. casa-cases, note that the ending '''&quot;a&quot;''' '''always''' changes to '''&quot;e&quot;''' before the '''&quot;s&quot;'''

Words ending in '''&quot;à&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ans&quot;''' humà-humans

Words ending in '''&quot;è&quot;''' or '''&quot;é&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ens&quot;''' cinquè-cinquens 

Words ending in '''&quot;í&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ins&quot;''' camí-camins

Words ending in '''&quot;ò&quot;''' or '''&quot;ó&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ons&quot;''' camió-camions 

Words ending in '''&quot;ú&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;uns&quot;''' oportú-oportuns

Words ending in '''&quot;s&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ssos&quot;''' gos-gossos
 
Words ending in '''&quot;ix&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ixos&quot;''' baix-baixos

Words ending in '''&quot;tx&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;txos&quot;''' esquitx-esquitxos

Words ending in '''&quot;ig&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;itjos&quot;''' desig-desitjos

Words ending in '''&quot;aig&quot;''' - the ending becomes '''&quot;ajos&quot;''' assaig-assajos


And finally,
words ending in '''any other consonant''' - simply get an extra '''&quot;s&quot;''' curt-curts


However, be careful with the following orthographic changes.

-'''ca''' becomes -'''ques''' vaca-vaques

-'''ga''' becomes -'''gues''' euga-eugues

-'''qua''' becomes -'''qües''' Pasqua-Pasqües

-'''gua''' becomes -'''gües''' aigua-aigües (in order to preserve the [gua] sound

-'''tja''' becomes -'''tges''' platja-platges

-'''ça''' becomes -'''ces''' caça-caces

The elided form of the singular article, ''l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'', is used in the following cases:

* Before words starting with ''a'', ''e'', ''o'' or silent ''h'' followed by one of those letters

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Strong pronouns==

The strong pronouns serve as subjects and as objects of a preposition, as in &quot;'''Jo''' menjo una poma&quot; (''''I''' am eating an apple') and &quot;Dóna-me'l a '''mi'''!&quot; ('Give it to &lt;u&gt;'''me'''&lt;/u&gt; (and not to him/...)!'). They are also used as interjections or parts thereof, as in &quot;'''Jo''' no!&quot; ('Not '''me'''!').

Note that unlike in English, it is not necessary to supply a subject pronoun in Catalan, especially since subject person and number can be typically deduced from conjugated verbforms; that is, the notions behind the pronouns are &quot;built into&quot; the verbforms (e.g., the -''o'' of ''menjo'' alludes to ''jo''). In fact, subject pronouns are generally only used for emphasis or clarification, and so it is more normal to omit them. Therefore, &quot;I eat&quot;/&quot;I am eating&quot; is normally expressed as &quot;Menjo&quot; rather than &quot;Jo menjo&quot;, which normally expresses &quot;'''I''' (and not you/...) am eating&quot;.

Below is a table of the strong pronouns in Catalan with their literal English translations below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;
! colspan=2 | &amp;nbsp; !! Singular !! Plural

===Notes===
====First person====
* The form ''mi'' is only used after a preposition; some dialects and informal registers use ''jo'' instead
* The first-person singular majestic pronoun ''nós'' serves as the equivalent of the &quot;[[w:Royal we|royal ''we'']]&quot;; it behaves grammatically as plural

====Second person====
* As with many other continental European languages, Catalan has many equivalents of ''you'' that vary based on whom one is speaking to:
** ''tu'' is used to refer to social inferiors (including children), animals, friends, and strangers around one's age
** ''vós'' is traditionally used as a pronoun of courtesy, to refer to strangers elder than the speaker, for example
*** ''vós'' has been generally supplanted by ''vostè'' in most dialects
** ''vostè'' traditionally refers to those in honorable social positions, such as judges and doctors

* ''vós'' behaves grammatically as second-person plural
* ''vostè'' behaves grammatically as third-person singular while ''vostès'' behaves as third-person plural

* ''vostè'' and ''vostès'' may appear as ''vosté'' and ''vostés'' in Valencian texts

====Third person====
* ''ells'' is used to refer to groups made up of both men and women, no matter how many women make them up and no matter how few men make them up
* ''si'' is only used as the object of a preposition

==Weak pronouns==
The weak pronouns (''pronoms febles'') are the object and adverbial pronouns that attach to the front or end of a verb (or to other attached pronouns); they are termed ''weak'' because they do not receive stress (in the varieties of Catalan outlined in this textbook, at least) and are often subject to various reductions.

When attached to a conjugated verb in the indicative or subjunctive mood, they go before the verb; in other cases, they are attached to the end. Compare the following examples (pronouns and related orthographic devices are in bold):

* &quot;Dóna''''m''' la poma!&quot; ('Give me the apple!') = &quot;dóna&quot; (second-person singular informal imperative) + &quot;em&quot;
* &quot;Dóna'''-me-la'''!&quot; ('Give it to me!', the apple) = &quot;dóna&quot; (second-person singular informal imperative) + &quot;em&quot; + &quot;la&quot;
* &quot;donar'''-me'l'''&quot; ('To give it to me', 'Giving it to me' (concept), some object referred to with a masculine noun) = &quot;donar&quot; (infinitive) + &quot;em&quot; + &quot;el&quot;
* &quot;'''Em''' dónes dues pomes.&quot; ('You give me two apples.', 'You're giving me two apples') = &quot;em&quot; + &quot;dónes&quot; (second-person singular informal indicative)
* &quot;'''Hi''' ha dues portes.&quot; ('There are two doors.') = &quot;hi&quot; + &quot;ha&quot; (third-person singular indicative)
* &quot;'''Se n''''ha anat.&quot; ('He went/left.', 'He's gone/left.') = &quot;es&quot; = &quot;en&quot; + &quot;ha&quot; (third-person singular indicative)

Notice that although we say that they are attached to the left of the verb that they are not necessarily depicted as such in writing when they come before the verb. In respect to the sound system, however, pronouns attached to the left and their host verb count as a single word and are often actually pronounced as such; therefore, for example &quot;hi ha&quot; is pronounced connected as {{IPA|[ja]}} (&quot;yah&quot;) rather than the disjointed {{IPA|[i a]}} (&quot;ee ah&quot;).

===Object pronouns===
* Me = em (m') before the verb or me ('m) after the verb
* You (singular) = et (t') before the verb or te ('t) after the verb
* Him/her/it = es (s') before the verb or lo ('l)/la/ho/li after the verb
* Us = ens before the verb or nos('ns) after the verb
* You (plural) = us before the verb or vos('us) after the verb
* Them = se (s') before the verb or los ('ls)/les after the verb
(''Note''
*him/her/it: (Direct Object) lo ('l)/la/ho - (Indirect Object) li
*them: (Direct Object) los ('ls)/les - (Indirect Object) los ('ls) )

==Demonstrative pronouns==

Traditionally, Catalan distinguishes three grades amongst its demonstrative pronouns/determiners ('this', 'that', 'yon') and locative adverbs ('here, 'there', 'yonder'), but like most dialects of English, many dialects of Catalan have either reduced its forms so that only two degrees have distinct forms or are in the process of doing so. Dialects, such as Central Catalan, that do so typically extend their first-degree gendered pronouns and determiners (''aquest'', ...) to the second degree while also extending their second-degree neuter pronouns (''això'') and locative adverbs (''aquí'') to the first degree, resulting in the displacement of the forms whose territory was encroached upon.

The neuter pronouns correspond with the weak pronoun ''ho''.

Amongst the first- and second-degree forms, there are the &quot;reinforced&quot; forms that begin with &quot;aqu-&quot; as well as those that do not. The second set is found in various varieties of Western Catalan, including Valencian.

The third grade is somewhat akin to that conveyed by the English constructions &quot;that over there&quot; and &quot;over there&quot;. The third-degree gendered forms are, in effect, the strong third-person pronouns reinforced with &quot;aqu-&quot;.

What is expressed in English as 'like this', 'like that', 'thus', and 'so' (though not 'so' as in &quot;So, what do you want to do right now?&quot;) is normally expressed in Catalan with the adverbs ''així'' and ''aixà'' as in, for example: &quot;Per què parles així?&quot; ('Why are you talking like that?'), &quot;He menjat el peix, així que ara puc menjar les meves postres!&quot; ('I ate/have eaten the fish, so now I can eat my dessert!') The form ''aixà'' is '''''only''''' used in contrast with ''així''.

Finally, note that the form ''ahí'' is Valencian and that ''aquí'' in the Valencian system tends to be associated with the first rather than the second degree thanks to its use as first-degree in its northern and southern dialects.

The first table outlines the modern incarnation of the classical three-grade system, only used in very formal contexts. The second and third tables outline the typical systems found in Central Catalan and Valencian.

==Relative pronouns==
* el qual/la qual/els quals/les quals (which, who, whom)
* que - that, which, who
* què - what
* qui - who, whom
* on - where, when

==Interrogative pronouns==

The interrogatives of Catalan are as follows:

* quin? - which (one)?
* qui? - who?, whom?
* què? - what?
* com? - how?, what?
* on? - where?
* quan? - when?
* per què? - why?
* per a què - what ... for?

Note that Catalan prefers ''quin'' in some places where English would prefer ''what''. With ''ser'', in particular, ''què'' is avoided if it is technically possible to construe the question as a request for a definition (no matter how silly it may seem) rather than a selection of many possibilities. For example, one asks ''Quina és la teva opinió sobre l'economia d'Espanya?'' (&quot;What is your opinion on Spain's economy?&quot;) rather than ''Què és la teva opinió sobre l'economia d'Espanya?'' (c.f. the following absurd exchange: A. &quot;What is your opinion on Spain's economy?&quot; B. &quot;It's what I opine on that country's economy.&quot;).

''com?'' is often used rather than ''què?'' as a response to something one has not understood or heard well.

The pronoun ''quin'' is inflected as such:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;
|-
! !! Masculine !! Feminine
|-
! Singular 
| quin || quina
|-
! Plural
| quins || quines
|-
|}

==Indefinite pronouns==

* algú - somebody/someone
* cadascú - each one
* tothom - everyone
* un/una/hom/un hom - one, you
* tot = all
* quelcom = something
* alguna cosa = something

==Negative pronouns==

* ningú = no one
* res = anything, nothing
* (no) res = nothing
Examples: 
Res més? = Anything else?
No vull res més. = I don't want anything else.
No, res. = No, nothing.

[[Image:Grapefruit, half.jpg |thumb|A grapefruit, sliced in half]]
The '''grapefruit''' is a large [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] that is moderately sour and slightly bitter. It is well-known for causing dangerous interactions with drugs, so be sure to investigate this if you are taking any medication. Pink or red grapefruits tend to be sweeter and have more vitamins than the &quot;white&quot; (yellow) grapefruits.

To serve a grapefruit in the traditional manner, first cut it in half right across the axis. A small spoon may then be used to scoop out the pulp. You may wish to first cut around the center or around the edge, possibly using a bent serrated knife. You may wish to use a [[Cookbook:Grapefruit Spoon|grapefruit spoon]]. If the grapefruit is particularly sour, you might sprinkle some [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] on top.

An altogether different way to cut a grapefruit, preferred for use in salads or dessert dishes, is known as '''supreme'''. First both ends (poles) of the grapefruit are cut off, enough to expose the flesh. Then the skin and pith are cut away in strips (it is best to use a serrated knife to make curved cuts). Next the membranes are cut or peeled away from the flesh, leaving bare segments free of chewy membranes and bitter pith. This method is particularly useful for grapefruit and [[Cookbook:Pummelo|pummelo]] because the segments are so large compared to other citrus fruits.</text>

The '''citrus''' [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]] are semi-tropical fruits that are usually eaten raw without the peel. Shavings from the peel, called [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]], are sometimes used in cooking. The [[Cookbook:Juice|juice]] has various uses, especially as a beverage. Citrus fruits mix sweet and tangy together in a blend that no other ingredient can match.

Types of citrus fruit include:

The '''pummelo''' is a huge [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. It is the predecesor to the [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|grapefruit]]. Compared to a grapefruit, the pummelo is milder. It might be wise to assume that the grapefruit's well-known drug interaction problems apply to the pummelo as well. A pummelo can be served like a grapefruit.</text>

Many '''melons''' originated in the [[Cookbook:Middle Eastern cuisines|Middle East]] and gradually spread its popularity across [[Cookbook:European cuisines|Europe]]. Ancient [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Egypt|Egyptians]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Italy|Romans]] enjoyed cantaloupes or muskmelons. Melon seeds were transported to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] by Columbus and eventually cultivated by [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Spain|Spanish]] explorers in [[Cookbook:California cuisine|California]].

Melons are in the same [[Cookbook:Gourd|gourd]] family as [[Cookbook:Squash|squashes]] and [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]]. Most melons have similar structure to winter squash with thick flesh and inner seed-filled midsection. So what’s the difference between melons and squashes? It’s the way that they’re used. Squashes are considered [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], while melons are known as [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]] with sweet and juicy flavor.

Melons are a good source of vitamin C and potassium. They have high water content are relatively low in [[Cookbook:Calorie|Calories]], and also [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] and cholesterol free. 

==Varieties==
There are many melon varieties. Cantaloupe, honeydew, and [[Cookbook:Watermelon|watermelon]] are the most well known varieties.

&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_cantaloupe.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Cantaloupe''' &amp;mdash; Also called a '''muskmelon''', this familiar fruit with orange flesh and khaki netted colored skin provides the most beta-carotene in the entire melon family. Select melons that are slightly golden with a light fragrant smell (an indication of its ripeness). Cantaloupe is typically available year-round, with a June through August peak season.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Casaba''' &amp;mdash; Unlike the other melons, casaba melons do not have an aroma. This is a large melon that is pale yellow when ripe and has white flesh with a sweet taste. This melon peaks in the fall, but starts showing up in markets in July through December.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_crenshaw.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Crenshaw''' &amp;mdash; These melons can weigh up to ten pounds and deliver a unique sweet and spicy flavor. They are a hybrid between the casaba and Persian melon with a yellowish skin and [[Cookbook:Salmon|salmon]]-colored flesh. Peak season for Crenshaw melons is August through September, with the fruit season beginning in July and ending in October.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_honeydew.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Honeydew''' &amp;mdash; The sweetest of all the melons and averaging five to six pounds, honeydew melons have a creamy yellow rind when ripe and pale green flesh. It’s best from June through October, but is available year round.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_persian.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Persian''' &amp;mdash; This melon is quite similar to the Cantaloupe, but it slightly larger in size, has a greener rind, and on the outside it has finer netting. Persian melons peak in August and September with the season beginning in June and ending November.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_santa.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Santa Claus''' &amp;mdash; This melon is also known as the '''Christmas''' melon because it peaks during the month of December. This variety is similar to the watermelon with the green and gold stripes, but is about a foot long and isn’t as sweet as the other melons.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[[Image:melon_sharlyn.jpg]]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Sharlyn''' &amp;mdash; This melon tastes like a cantaloupe and honeydew combined. Sharlyn melons are sweet with netted outer layer, greenish-orange rind, and white flesh. The availability varies, so check your local supermarkets and farmer’s market.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Selection==
In general, melons should be shaped according to their variety. For example, cantaloupes should be round, etc. In addition, melons should not have cracks, soft spots, or dark bruises. You should look for a clean and smooth break at the stem and for most mature melons have a fruity fragrance (if not chilled).

==Storage==
Keep uncut melons at room temperature for two to four days or until fully ripe, then refrigerate for up to 5 days. Refrigerate cut up melon in a covered container up to 3 days. Remember that cut melons are aromatic and their smell will penetrate other foods.

==Preparation==
Always wash melons in warm soapy water before cutting to get rid of any impurity on the rind that might be carried from the knife blade to the flesh. Simply cut the melon in half and scoop out the seeds and strings. Melons can be cut into halves, quarters, wedges, cubes, or scooped into balls with a melon baller. Most melons will benefit from a squeeze of [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon or lime juice]] to enhance the flavor. Serve at room temperature.</text>

[[Image:CDC_pomegranate.jpg|right|pomegranate]]
[[Image:pomegranate_01.jpg|right|pomegranate]]
The '''pomegranate''' is a [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]] the size of a large [[Cookbook:Orange|orange]]. The leathery reddish-pink skin shelters the membranous walls and bitter tissue that house compartments or sacs filled with hundreds of seeds. A translucent red pulp that has a slightly sweet and tart taste surrounds these seeds. Pomegranates are grown in California and throughout Asia and the Mediterranean countries.

==Selection and Storage==
Pomegranates are available in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] from September through December. Select fruit that is heavy for its size with bright, fresh color and blemish-free skin. You can refrigerate whole pomegranates for up to 2 months or store them in a cool, dark place for up to a month. Pomegranate seeds packed in an airtight container and stored in the freezer will keep for up to 3 months.

==Uses and Preparation==
Pomegranates are a versatile fruit and can be used as a garnish on sweet and savory dishes or pressed to extract the juice. To use a pomegranate, cut it in half and pry out the pulp-encased seeds, removing any of the light-colored membrane that adheres. The seed pods tend to squirt when they pop, and you will invariably pop quite a few of them while handling a pomegranate. The juice will stain, so be sure to wear an apron or clothing that you don’t mind getting stained. 

The juice can also stain your walls or countertops; a good way to avoid the squirting juices is to handle the fruit completely submerged in a large pot of water. The seeds will sink to the bottom, and the membrane will float. Use a strainer to scoop out the membrane, then pour the rest through a collander to collect the seed pods.</text>

'''Putting music in your film''' can be potentially very complicated. There are several ways to go about this, but each depends on your skill, experience and budget.   It is important to note that most professional composers will charge a lot of money for you to have their music in your movie. Many people do not understand just how important music is so you definitely need someone with experience. 

==Things to consider==
*What kind of film are you making, and what kind of music would fit in best?
*How long does the music need to play during the scene?
*How loud should the music be? Should it drown out any dialogue, or should it be strictly in the background?
*Should it be constant?
*What effect are you trying to convey?

==Facing The Music==
===The professional===
Hiring a professional composer would probably be the easiest option in your array. These people know exactly what they are doing and have resources at their disposal. See the list of popular film composers in Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_music Film Music].  The downsides are that you must choose a composer who has experience in the genre you want. If you want orchestral music to play through your chosen scene, [[Wikipedia:Trent Reznor|Trent Reznor]] would probably not be the best choice. It is possible that you may not be able to find a professional who will be willing to work on your movie without blowing most (or all) of your budget, however.

===Doing it yourself===

There are many ways for filmmakers to create a musical score on a personal computer.

;1. Live Musical Instruments
:One way to create a film score is to use a '''DAW''' (Digital Audio Workstation) with live musical instruments.

;2. Midi Sound Modules.
:Another method is to use MIDI with '''Midi sound modules''' (audio hardware) which is then recorded into a computer with DAW software.

;3. Software Musical Instruments
:Yet another ways is to do the film score totally digitally using '''software instruments''' inside the computer and controlled by a MIDI controller.

====1. Old-fashion Analog = DAWs====

You can create a film score with a live musician playing a real musical instrument.  Recording live musical instruments is very straight forward.  

'''Multitrack recording''' When a motion picture is scored by the London Philharmonic, the orchestra conductor watches the movie screen and conducts the musicians who play real musical instruments, live and in sync with the action on the screen.  This music is recorded via a microphone into a computerized DAW which works like a multi-track tape recorder.  Later, all the tracks are mixed down and added to the film's sound track.  This is very fast but expensive.  Fortunately, you can do the same thing in a very simple way using your personal computer... if you have the correct software, a quiet computer, a professional-quality microphone which is connected to your computer usually through a tiny mixing board (or microphone preamp) which connects to the computer via USB, FireWire, or analog connection.

Using almost any computer (Windows or Macintosh), you can turn your computer into a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation), which is a very powerful multi-track tape recorder inside  your computer.  As an example, all Macintosh computers come with a free digital audio workstation program which is disguised as a music program called [[Wikipedia:GarageBand|GarageBand]].  Try it!

Basically, all you need to turn your computer into a multi-track recording system for film scoring is a computer program, a professional quality microphone, and a preamp.

;1.  The Software
:The computer program must be able to play a movie clip (usually just one scene of your movie as a QuickTime movie or a AVI movie) while the program records a single track of audio.  (Most modern music program are DAW programs.  Older programs only worked with MIDI but now audio recording features are included in almost all music programs.)  An example of a very simple music program is [http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ Apple's GarageBand].

;2. The Preamp
:This can be a preamp or tiny mixer board which connects to the computer via USB, FireWire or directly to the analog audio input of your computer.  A good example of preamp is M-Audio's low-cost USB device [http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FastTrackUSB-main.html FastTrackUSB].  This works with Apple's GarageBand and is sold at the Apple Store.  However, the reviews of this product at the [www.apple.com/store Apple Store] are not all favorable.  Similarly the M-Audio MobilePre USB Audio Interface also has unfavorable reviews at the [www.apple.com/store Apple Store].  A more expensive interface for FireWire is [http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FireWire410-main.html M-Audio's FireWire410].  A typical analog mixing board is the [http://www.behringer.com/UB1202/index.cfm?lang=ENG Behringer Eurorack UB1202FX Mixing Board].

;3. The Microphone
:And finally you need a professional microphone with XLR connectors.  See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone Wikipedia's Microphone]. [http://www.musiciansfriend.com/ Musician's Friend] has a [http://www.musiciansfriend.com/document?doc_id=99537&amp;g=home&amp;s=articles&amp;src=3SOSWXXA microphone buyers guide].  At the [http://aes.org Audio Engineering Society]'s convention, you can listen to many different microphones.  The next [http://aes.org/events/121 AES Convertion] is in San Francisco in October.

'''One track at a time.'''  Unlike the London Philharmonic which has a hundred musicians, you will probably have only one musician.  Hopefully, that one musician can play lots of instruments, one at a time.  So rather than record all the musical tracks for a scene at one time like the London Phiharmonic, you will record one track with each pass through the scene until you build up a complete musical score.  Each time you record a new track, the musician listens to the previously recorded tracks plus the audio from the movie and adds one more instrument to the mix.

;Side Note
:  If you are a filmmaker with no skill with a musical instrument, try creating a '''humming score'''.  Set up your computer so you can record audio in sync with your movie.  You can use programs like GarageBand, Final Cut Express or Final Cut Pro to record audio in sync with a movie.  iMovie also works but it can record only one track. To create a humming score, you watch your movie and make musical sounds with your mouth... including humming.  If you follow the usual procedures for creating a film score via a multi-track recorder, you will be amazed how good a humming score you can create.  To do this, start by recording a track with the melody.  An alternative is to start by recording a rhythm track instead of a melody.  Then simply watch the movie over and over again, adding more and more tracks as you make music with your mouth.  I know this sounds really dorky but it actually works well for a temp track and a guide for your film composer.

====2. Midi Modules = External Hardware====

External midi sound modules were very popular at one time.  Unfortunately, the sounds produced by these modules (such as the Proteus) were not natural and the external hardware took up a lot of space.  Now e-Mu sells a replacement for the Proteus which is [http://www.emu.com/products/product.asp?category=501&amp;subcategory=168&amp;product=15023 software].

====3. Midi with Software Instruments inside your Computer====

Thanks to the advancement of technology, it is entirely possible to simply create a digital musical score yourself using musical instruments that exist only inside your computer. The cost of this method depends on what instruments you want to have in the music. As and example, GarageBand is free with all new Macintosh computers.  

;Digital vs. Analog vs. MIDI
:Remember that while digital music is very easy to accomplish (using a midi keyboard and a guitar software instrument), if you wanted to have 'real' guitars or good-quality singing in your song, for example, you would have to purchase a USB interface, which would allow you to link up your guitar to the computer through it. You would then require some recording software such as [[Wikipedia:Cubase|Cubase]].  But also realize that another alternative is connecting a '''midi guitar''' to the computer via a '''midi interface''' (not analog) and use a software instrument which has the sound of guitar inside your computer.  You have lots of choices.

If you wanted to mix digital elements in with this, or even create an entirely digital song, you would need a program such as [[Wikipedia:Reason (program)|Reason]] and a [[Wikipedia:Midi Keyboard|Midi Keyboard]].  This method, while much cheaper than the previous, will still cost a fair amount of money - for a copy of ''Reason'', ''Cubase'', a ''USB Interface'' and a ''Midi Keyboard'' you could expect to pay around '''£580/£1097''', Apple computers are costly as well. Like most things, however, a lot of money could be saved by not using things such as ''Logic Pro'' (which is the industry standard). There is no use having brilliant music if your film is terrible, as it is most likely to be after spending your budget.  (Note:  Apple's Logic is designed for musicians... which is great but filmmakers who are not musicians will find it awkward to use.  Robert Purser in Digital Puppet magazine (Winter 2006) found Logic Express (the lit version of Logic) to be extremely poor for anyone who is not an experienced musician with electronic gear.

Fortunately, all [[Wikipedia:Apple_Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] computers come with [[Wikipedia:ILife|iLife]] software which has good resources, too, for digital music making and also for video editing.  With [[Wikipedia:GarageBand|GarageBand]] in iLife 06, you can create digital music using the built-in software instruments and your music will be in sync with your movie which you watch on the screen as you create your film score.  One advantage of GarageBand is you do not need a MIDI interface or a MIDI keyboard.  With the feature called &quot;Musical Typing&quot;, you can use the Macintosh computer's keyboard (which is not velocity sensitive) as you play and record the music, one track at a time, and then later go back and adjust the velocity of each note (still in GarageBand). While this seems extremely awkward for musician, computer nerds who are filmmakers will find it rather easy.

Note:  Robert Elliott of Wikiversity's free course in [[v:Filmmaking|film scoring for filmmakers]] recommends getting the optional Jam Pack: Symphony Orchestra for GarageBand from Apple Computer.  The natural musical instruments of the symphony orchestra are great for making musical sound effects which sound like a real film score.  (There are similar packages from other manufacturers such as Mark Of the Unicorn.)

===Film Scoring Theory===

The purpose of adding music to a scene is to create a '''mood'''.  That is the purpose of music in a film -- to create the moods that the director wants the audience to feel. Without the audience realizing it, your job is to get the audience to react to the movie as the director wants.

;Special Note - Music from Speaking Voices
:Every dramatic scene has music in it, long before you add a musical film score.  The actors' spoken words have music in them.  If you do not believe me, try reading a script in a monotone voice.  Gifted actors will have a three octave range in their speaking voices.  Therefore, for many scenes with dialog, you do not need any music, as long as the actors create the proper mood with their speaking voices.

:Look at very old classic movies which have no musical score such as '''Angels with Dirty Faces'''.  When you hear James Cagney and Pat O'Brien speak, their voices are very musical... almost like stage voices - both beautiful and melodic.  Listen to how many octaves their voices range in a single sentence. Then look at more modern motion pictures which have a more natural style of speaking.  With the old classics, they do not need any additional music. But with modern movies with more natural speaking voices, much of the music of the speaking voice is missing... so much of the necessary mood is missing.  The mood can be added only by having a film score.

'''Correcting the Mood''' Also be aware that sometimes, the actors' dialog creates a mood... but it is the '''wrong''' mood.   As an example, an actor might pretend to be happy but, in reality, he is crying inside.  The words of the actors are the opposite of the mood the director wants in the scene.  You must add music (or musical sound effects) to correct this and to create the proper mood.  Your music tells the audience what the real mood is.  Without your music in this scene, the audience can be confused.

=====Music Can Be Just Sounds=====

The most important thing to understand about film scoring is the music can be just sounds that create the mood. That is '''Musical Sound Effects'''.  Music does not need a melody, a rhythm, or anything special.  Since the music's only purpose is to create the proper mood, just one, two, or three notes is all you need most of the time.  Try creating the mood with musical sound effects which has the same impact but a whole lot cheaper.

Try using GarageBand and Apple's Jam Pack: Symphony Orchestra to create moods.  As an example, you can add a '''violin trill''' to a scary scene which give the feeling of danger, doom, and dread.  Just one note played expressively creates all the mood you need.

=====Music Must Follow The Mood=====

The second most important thing to understand about film scoring is the mood in a scene changes from sentence to sentence. When two people are talking and new information is being introduced rapidly, the mood is continually changing.  When the mood changes, the music must change to match the mood.  Songs cannot do this because a song has only one mood.

;Songs = One Continual Mood
:When there is a conversation, you cannot use a song for film score.  Songs have only one mood.  When the mood of the scene changes, a song cannot follow the mood changes.

There are only two times when songs are appropriate for a film score.  If you have an action scene (with no conversation) or a montage scene, the film score will need only one mood for the entire scene.  In this case, a song is ideal.   So if you wish, you can hire a local band or you can use pre-recorded songs... if you can afford it.

====Scoring for Background and Dialog====

There are basically two kinds of music in a scene which has dialog -- '''background''' music and '''narrative''' music.  Background music enhances the mood of the scene.  Background music must be very soft and thin.  It is heard faintly in the background.  Warning: If you write loud music for a scene with people talking, when it comes time to mix all the audio together, someone (usually the director) will turn down the volume of your music and no one will hear it clearly.  So when you write background music, make sure it is very simple (i.e., a single melody which is simple with no counter melodies and no strong rhythm such as drums).  For background music, it must be just a simple melody played by only one or two instruments.

Narrative music is music which tells a story (think &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;).  Therefore, narrative music must be inserted between the dialog of the actors.  Normally, the only way you can do this is to add gaps between the dialog when you edit the scene.

When people are talking, your music must NEVER step on the dialog.  The dialog is the most important part of the movie so when there is dialog, the music must be in the background.  So if you want to add music which helps tell the story, there must be gaps between the dialog for you to add the narrative music. These gaps are usually only one to three seconds long.  Once they are filled with music or musical sound effects, the audience does not notice the pause in the actor's dialog.  It all seems natural.  The music seems to become part of the conversation.

Therefore, it is best if the editor and the composer are the same person.  With personal movies, this is not a problem.  The same computer which edits the movie can help create the film score for the movie just by using different software.

===Practical Experience in Film Scoring===

Currently, there is no easy way to practice film scoring.  You cannot go to a website and download a scenes which needs a film score so you can practice film scoring.

Today, many motion pictures are edited with Final Cut Pro or other editing software for personal computers.  It would take only ten minutes to render a scene without music for people around the world to practice creating film scores with computer programs such as GarageBand.

This has never been done, even though it would be terrific publicity for a motion picture.  There could be a dozen scenes on a DVD-Video disk.  When budding film composers have completed a film score, they can post it on a website for other people to listen to and compare with all the other film scores for the same scene.

====Creating your Demo Reel====

If you want a job in film scoring, you need examples of your film scores to show film producers just how good you are.  That makes perfect sense.  How can you get hired doing film scoring of movies if you do not have any great scenes for your demo reel?

Currently, there are no websites where you can order scenes from television dramas and motion pictures that are all ready for you to score and then to put on a DVD-Video disk for your demo reel. There should be dozens of film distributors who offer this service.  And since you are promoting their motion picture, they should offer this service for free.

====Film Editing vs. Film Scoring====

The editing of a scene and the scoring of the scene should go hand in hand.  If you are curious about doing film scoring '''and''' film editing together, [http://www.starmovieshop.com Star Movie Shop] also sells a disk called '''&quot;Blindman's Bluff&quot;''' which shows how two scenes where edited and scored using just musical sound effects.  The second scene on this disk is extremely short.  By adding gaps between the dialog and adding narrative music, the entire mood of the scene changes and the scene becomes twice as long, yet all the dialog remains the same.

===Local Bands===

This is more of a sub-method than anything else. If you have no real musical talent, many local bands would be more than happy to write, record and perform music for your film in exchange for credit and a small amount of money.

===Public Domain===
Finally, it is possible to, like [[Wikipedia:Ed Wood, Jr|Ed Wood]], use music that is in the [[Wikipedia:public domain|public domain]]. This includes music from films or songs that were copyrighted before 1923. [http://www.pdinfo.com/ This site] is a good read.

==Spotting Session==

When you are hired as a composer on a motion picture, you will probably sit down with the director and/or the producer who will tell you what emotions they want in the movie.  This is called the '''spotting session'''.  Never rely on what the actors say in the movie.  The underlying mood is usually something different from the dialog.  Only the director can tell you what moods you need to create.

The biggest problem that a composer has with the director (and vise versa) is the lack of communication.  You need to ask the director what mood the audience is supposed to feel.  Don't be surprised if you get a blank stare and the comment, &quot;Isn't it obvious?&quot;.  Directors have been working with their vision for the movie for the last three to five years.  They assume that you automatically understand. Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Take a few minutes to find out EXACTLY what the director wants the audience to feel for each piece of dialog in the movie.

==Usage of music==
Okay, so you have your materials, your band is waiting and ready, your fingers are poised on your midi keyboard. What now? Well, before putting music into a scene it is important to think about what you want the audience to feel. Do you want them to be scared? Excited? If, for example, you have an action scene in which a juggernaut is speeding down a highway towards a roadblock, you would not usually wish to accompany this with soft classical music. A good idea when planning the inclusion of music into a movie is:
*Watch the movie all the way through.
*Stop the movie when you see parts that require music.
*Note down the number of the starting frame.
*Plan how long you would like the music to last.
*Note down the number of the frame where the music stops.
*Plan what kind of music you would like and how you would like it to behave - should it be low and constant, swirling in and out of earshot? Should it be loud, aggressive, constant? 
*If you get stuck on how the music should behave, go rent out some critically acclaimed movies and study how music is used.

==Introduction==
A common misconception is that the lipid bilayer is just that, a lipid bilayer. This is not true. The plasma membrane is filled with a group of proteins called membrane proteins. Some of these membrane proteins show only contact surfaces with either the inside or the outside of the cell and some of them stick out at both ends. Among other functions these proteins serve to anchor the cells cytoskeletal components to neighboring cells, can actively transport various molecules over the plasma membrane, receive signal molecules on the outside and relay the signal inside the cell. They form the connection with the outside of the cell. As is in the plasma membrane this feature is also documented in the membranes of cell organelles such as the endoplastic reticulum or the Golgi-complex.

==Protein requirements for membrane incorporation== 
What distinguishes membrane proteins from other proteins? All proteins are formed from 20 aminoacids with varying side chains (hydrophilic, hydrophobic, negatively/ positively charged). When the RNA transcript is translated into the primary structure, the side chains of the string of aminoacids form non-covalent bonds with other side chains in the molecule thus reaching its 3D structure and biological activity. Now, the inside of the cell, including the compartments in the organelles, are water based. For proteins to be active in this area they must be readily soluble and thus hydrophilic on the outside. So the outer side chains of the 3D structure must be hydrophilic. The same holds true for membrane proteins. They will function in a area where part of the protein must reside in hydrophobic conditions, namely the inside of the lipid bilayer. Thus, part of membrane proteins have hydrophobic residues sticking out on the surface to facilitate incorporation in lipid bilayers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[../Proteins and channels|&lt;&lt; Proteins and channels]] | Hydrophobicity | [[../Self-assembly|Self-assembly &gt;&gt;]]

Hydrophobicity literally means &quot;fear of water&quot;. The opposite of this is hydrophilicity which means &quot;love of water&quot;. These two terms denote the properties of molecules or parts of molecules to bond with water (hydrophilicity) or reject water (hydrophobicity). This effect is seen when one puts a drop of oil on water. The oil (hydrophobic) remains on the surface and sticks together in stead of mixing with the water (hydrophilic). 
In cells these properties are essential. Most of the cell is hydrophilic but there are hydrophobic borders (membranes) which compartmentalize the cell into different spaces and hereby separate reactions. Of course there must be some sort of interaction between compartments and this is facilitated by membrane proteins (look here to read up on membrane proteins).

These membranes are formed with molecules with hydrophobic properties, such as phospholipids, cholesterol and membrane proteins. The phospholipids and membrane proteins also have hydrophilic properties which stand in contact with the cytosol or the extracellular matrix.

[[File:Micelle Self-assembly.png|left]]
Self-assembly occurs due to the thermodynamics, if the phospholipids are in a water (or other polar solution) the tails will want to be 'away' from the solution. The could all go to the top (like oil on water), or they could have the tails point toward each other. With the tails pointing toward each other, this could form 2 different formations.

First would be a micelle which would like like a ball with the phospholipid heads on the outside and the tails pointing together like this or in the form of a lipid bilayer:

[[Image:CDC_greenbean.jpg|right|green beans]]
The '''green bean''', also known as the '''snap bean''' or '''string bean''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Bean|bean]] that is eaten with the pod. Green beans are normally eaten fresh or nearly fresh, not dried.

These beans are often called string beans because a fibrous string runs along the seam of the bean. The string becomes noticeable as the ends are snapped off. The snapping noise is the source of these beans' other name.

Fresh green beans are available all year, with a peak season of May to October. Green beans are also available canned and frozen.

==Selection and Storage==
It is best to hand-pick green beans from a market that sells them loose. To ensure uniform cooking time, select beans of similar size and shape. Choose slender beans (no thicker than a pencil) that are crisp and free of blemishes. The beans should be a bright green color. Do not purchase beans that are stiff or have the seeds visible through the pod because those beans will be tough.

Keep green beans dry in a perforated plastic bag in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for 4 to 5 days.

==Preparation==
Wash beans thoroughly in clear, cool water. Beans can be cooked whole, cut crosswise or diagonally, or [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|French]]-cut (i.e., cut along the length of the bean). If you want sweet tasting, crisp fresh beans, cut them as little as possible. Cut older, more mature beans in the French style (i.e., lengthwise).

[[Cookbook:Stir-frying|Stir-frying]] is one of the easiest ways to prepare green beans. This method maintains more nutrients than other cooking methods. Whatever cooking method you choose, remember to cook beans as little as possible, using the least amount of water possible.

[[Cookbook:Boiling|Boiling]], [[Cookbook:Steaming|steaming]], and [[Cookbook:Microwaving|microwaving]] are other common methods for preparing green beans. When boiling, beans may release some nutrients into the water, so try to re-use the bean water to regain some of the nutrients lost. For example, you can use the water to boil [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Creating it==
I volunteer to create this tutorial (I'll start work on it when home and have blender to work with directly). However, I think subsurf edge creases, as detailed in [http://www.blender3d.org/cms/Weighted_Creases_for_subsurfs.358.0.html Weighted Creases for Subsurfs], should be moved to an intermediate tutorial. But I can create this one as well if so desired. --[[User:Camel|camel]] 02:18, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

: Great!  Thanx for your help!  I wouldn't consider subsurf edges to be intermediate.  Since you're planning on helping out a bit around here, let me sort of explain what my vision is for the book.

: Beginner Tutorials focus on learning how to use the tools, hotkeys available in the blender.  this is mostly technical documentation 

: Intermediate Tutorials focus on the artistic use of the tools learned in the beginner tutorials.  Some people say that you can't teach somebody to be an artist.  I beg to differ.  The ability to become an artist is in the desire.  Artistic modeling, artistic lighting, artistic scene creation, artistic animation.

: Advanced Tutorials focus on the advanced functions of the Blender, such as python scripting for advanced animation, advanced modeling, etc.

: If you can see my vision here (and if you can agree with it), then you'll see why I want subsurf edges to be in the Beginner Tutorials.  Obviously a lot more tutorials will need to be created in the Beginning Tutorials part to make it comprehensive.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 21:56, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

: I didn't really see much effect from the bit about the subsurf creases . . . I'm not sure what was supposed to happen there. If this is an important tool, perhaps it would be useful to put in a tutorial page specifically dedicated to it? -- Glasnerven
== Great Work ==

I haven't been around for awhile, but I popped my head in today and saw this.  I want to congratulate those have have been working on this tutorial.  It looks great so far.  Keep it up!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 14:48, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I agree. Nice tutorial.

==Suggestions==
The article says &quot;On our Sharp Falloff mountain, the second one we did, select the first two edges on the right (starting from the point down).&quot; Maybe it's just me, but I find this sentence confusing and I don't know which edges it means. I suggest it be accompanied by a screenshot. I understand the page isn't finished, I just thought I'd suggest that. [[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 19:57, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

:I Agree. Some clearification would be appreciated. [[User:217.212.250.6|217.212.250.6]] 16:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

::Make sure you are in side view '''NUM3''' and then its easy to see which two edges, i.e. starting from the top point of the mountain select the first two edges on the right side (in side view there is only a &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; side of the mountain). --[[User:203.144.160.243|203.144.160.243]] 12:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

New version out- whole thing out of date- remove or re-do the choice is yours.

== First mountain &amp; Shaping the World sections. ==

I'm trying to change the radius of influence but NOTHING seems to be working. This is very frustrating because I went through this part of Noob-to-Pro many versions back and this part went smoothly. I'm pressing Gkey to grab the vertex, then rolling the mouse-wheel, pressing pgUP, pgDN, nothing is working. Yes, proportional edit falloff is on with 'smooth' selected. I've tried what the other note says also (ALT + NUM+ pgUP/pgDN) and that doesn't work. Could I get some clarification here?   ***I fixed the problem by restarting blender... ***

:I had the exact same problem and restarting blender fixed it.  I'll write this into the main article.  [[User:Khono|Khono]] ([[User talk:Khono|talk]]) 21:15, 25 August 2009 (UTC)

In the 'First mountain' section I think the ''radius of influence'' acts as a sphere rather than a circle, which if correct would be worth mentioning as sometimes vertices aren't affected as you would expect within the radius of influense from the 2D views, especially when playing around with a larger radii. This is, therefore, due to them not actually being within the 3D 'sphere of influence'.

I cannot make the radius of selection thing do a thing.  Not with ALT or whatever.  Not after a restart either.  Nothing, nada zilch.

==Miscellaneous Comments==

The 'Shaping the World' section doesn't seem very clear, i.e. we don't seem to be trying to acheive anything useful on the model. Perhaps a picture would help here. Maybe as an explanation the author could say he was aiming to make the moutains look a little more 'real' by making the vertices/edges less uniform through rotating them.

Great tutorials in general, very much appreciated by me &amp; I'm sure many others.
[user: mr_spoon, entry: 2/Jan/06].

I am enjoying this tutorial but would have appreciated something more on what to do with our hat wearing figure and the mountians. Such as how do we place it in the &quot;mountain range&quot;. I don't want to edit anything as I am SUCH a n00b right now (ie: went and bought a multi-button mouse for my mac last night!).

I would like to second that last point..(I am a complete Noob too). It woul be great if there were instructions on how we could insert our man/hat inot the mountain scence :)

:I took the first line to be a segway only (kind of a joke), not meaning that we would actually insert the man into the scene. --[[User:203.144.160.243|203.144.160.243]] 12:08, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

== 8-Bit? ==

Actually, anything 3D would be to powerful for an 8-Bit console. Even something as chunky as that. - A Guest that'll probably never post again

== Smoothing things out ==

&quot;On our Sharp Falloff mountain, the second one we did, select the first two edges on the right (starting from the point down).&quot; Which point down? Top? This is a bit confusing. 

Also, it seemed impossible to drag to get a value of 1 for the crease, no matter how far I zoomed out I couldn't get 1. Typing 1 worked fine though. '''Correction''' -- when using the menu that comes up when you hit space, the location of the mouse pointer is wherever the last menu choice is. So if you choose ''space-&gt;edit-edges-&gt;crease subsurf'' the mouse might be far away from the relevant edge. This will cause the effect of the mouse motion to be less pronounced, and more fine-grained, and it may not be able to get to the value of 1. 

Great tutorial in general! Thanks for all the hard work.

== Help him with changing radius of influence ==

Someone put this in the main page....&lt;br /&gt;

It took me a while to get the radius to change too.  What I didn't find clear from the page was the exact order of events:
# Select vertex/vertices
# Specify operation (e.g. G)
# THEN use the mouse wheel to adjust the radius of influence
# Make the operation (move the mouse, specify axis and amount, etc.)

== Naturalness? ==

At the very beginning of this section, you say &quot;select the second vertex from the top in the center&quot;. Could you just explain a little more which vertex you mean exactly and on what mountain (the one with the smooth falloff, or the one with the sharp falloff) this vertex exists? I think a picture for the vertex that should be selected may be a great help.

== About newbie notes ==

I'm starting to think that &quot;newbie notes&quot; should instead be called &quot;pro notes&quot;. The tutorial is meant for newbies anyway, so why call advanced tips &quot;newbie notes&quot;? Some &quot;newbie notes&quot; I've encountered also tend to confuse newbies rather than enlighten.

Considering the books &quot;Noob to Pro&quot; aspect, I think Pro notes would be better for any kind of note that adds insight to a concept, or presents another way to do something.  A few other tutorials I notice use the &quot;Noob Notes&quot; but I think the title best fits a note that highlights a common mistake made by newbies. --[[User:Vi3gamehkr|Vi3gamehkr]] ([[User talk:Vi3gamehkr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vi3gamehkr|contribs]]) 20:15, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== Append/Link ==

Some more clarification on appending/linking to the new project would be nice. I can't seem to get it to happen.

I agree, I've followed the steps multple times and nothing seems to happen when I click load library.

==Smoothing things out==

''Noob Henry: What I do is take the mountain, and then set a subsurf level of two. Then, I hit the 'set smooth' button, and use the individual vertices to make it look authentic.''
==Shaping the world==

[Noobie Roy says: Huh??? I don't understand what I'm supposed to be achieving here. What is supposed to happen when I rotate? As far as I can see, nothing at all happens. Can you maybe show us a before and after screenshot? Or maybe explain in more detail? Thanks!]
[Noobie Sean says: Roy, you made the mountains by using proportional editing with grab/move.  Moving one vertex moved its neighbours, within the proportional circle.  Rotate and scale also use proportional editing to rotate or scale about the selected vertex much like the grab/move operation.]

[Noobie Larry says: I tried rotating just that one point but nothing happens]

[One thing to watch out for is the range of affected vertices.  If the range is too small, then rotating will affect just the selected vertex.  If the range is too large, it will rotate everything together.  You can adjust the range by scrolling.]

[Dusty says: To answer Noobie Roy, the reason nothing may happen, is that the circle of influence may be only including the vertex that you have selected when you first hit R. After pressing R scroll the mouse wheel to increase the circle include the other vertices next to the one selected, then type 90 and you'll see the effect. Scroll the mouse wheel further more (to include more vertices) and you see the effect spread out.]

[Another newbie says: two things to keep in mind here: really weird things will happen here if you set the rotation/scaling pivot to &quot;3d cursor&quot; at this point (I assume the intention is to rotate around the single selected vertex, so the other pivot modes will all work, I think), and (as Dusty says) you must increase the effective radius quite a bit (use the scrollwheel after pressing '''RKEY''', just keep going until you are affecting half the plane to see what's going on). What makes it a bit confusing is that some vertices seem to be inside the initial affected region (with the radius you used to create the previous mountain) in the two-dimensional side view, but that affected region is actually a three-dimensional '''sphere''', so you cannot tell from just that side view what vertices are inside the affected region. I am not explaining this very well, but it helps to have more than one 3d view open so you can see that every vertex is outside the affected radius in at least one view (try splitting the main view into 4 equally sized parts so you can have a top, front, side and &quot;free&quot; 3d view open all at the same time).[Yet another noob says: if you are following the tutorial exactly, your proportional edit falloff will be at sharp at this point. This makes the effect of the rotation hard to see unless your circle of influence is quite large.]

[Dbproguy mentions: From what I am seeing, this effects the texture of the mountain, so it's not so plain.]

[hendric: Newbie, but I think I got the tutorial demonstrating what it should be doing.  I added screenshots of my full workspace and changed the wording to explain a little better. I am wiki-illiterate so any changes to prettify it are welcome.]

:First, thanks for working hard to create this tutorial, I really appreciate it, but I had some difficulty following this section. When we're told to rotate -90 degrees. I think it would be helpful to know which axis you're talking about, I assumed (based on the text) it was the side view (thus around the x axis), however the screenshots look more like it was rotated around the y axis. Also, Did the height of the mountains change somewhere? I cannot seem to get my view to look like yours no matter what combination of + or - 90 degrees around the x or y axis I try [[User:Lxxxv|Lxxxv]] ([[User talk:Lxxxv|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lxxxv|contribs]]) 22:08, 16 September 2011 (UTC)

== 14 Adding the Hat Guy, for noobies reading the book. ==

I followed the previous tutorials on modeling the simple person and his hat and his armature. This file is saved separately as suggested by this tutorial and commenced work on a new one. Later, when I bring in the hat guy into another layer, your tutorial needs to mention:
a. The person 'cube' as he's called,
b. The hat, called 'circle'
c. His armature,
all three have to be imported, and the parent-child relationship between the hat and the head need to be re-defined.
Then, the parent-armature relation has to be defined too. However, since the simple person is drawn at rest position
and the armature is in a pose, the import brings the two cutting-through each other. Thus, a parent&gt;armature creates
ugly and bizarre appendages to the limbs and other areas.

The section of appending the hat-person has to be expanded.
You need to mention a pre-append stage, where the armature has to be kept at the rest position before appending.
Then, a post-append stage mentions the simple step of how to move the three components into a new layer,
and then how to re-establish the parent&gt;child and parent&gt;armature relationships.
Finally, switch on the view on both layers, scale and shift the person to correctly stand on the terrain,
and add salt and pepper to taste.

niyam bhushan

==Naturalness - Proportional Editing==
I noticed in a &quot;noob note,&quot; a comment about proportional editing settings.  First off, if it is more efficient (doesn't create more vertices/mesh) why don't we just change that section of the tutorial to use it.  Secondly, where are the &quot;proportional editing settings?&quot; --[[User:Vi3gamehkr|Vi3gamehkr]] ([[User talk:Vi3gamehkr|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Vi3gamehkr|contribs]]) 20:20, 26 February 2011 (UTC)

== The Append Button ==

Where can you find the 'append' button. At the last bit you press Shift + F1, but i see no 'append'. I do see the 'link' button. A picture would be nice :)

== Keys ==

Do you seriously have to format the alphabet hotkeys like *KEY? Up until this tutorial, if you wanted to scale, it would have been just &quot;S&quot; not &quot;SKEY&quot;. I think it's really annoying.</text>

'''Baba ganoush''' is a common Middle Eastern and Mediterranean dip with a creamy, somewhat smoky flavor. It is usually eaten with [[Cookbook:Pita|pita bread]] although [[Cookbook:Naan|naan]] or a crispy [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] also work well.

==Ingredients==
* 1 medium-large [[Cookbook:Eggplant|eggplant]], any variety, 1 to 1&amp;frac12; [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] raw [[Cookbook:Tahini|tahini]]
* Juice of 1 [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] 
* 1 clove [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Olive oil|olive oil]]
* ½ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp]] [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* [[Cookbook:Paprika|Paprika]] or [[Cookbook:Cayenne_pepper|cayenne pepper]], as a garnish

==Procedure==
# Roast the eggplant. This can be done in a variety of ways, but the flesh should be fully cooked and the skin should be burned and falling off easily. An effective method is to prick the eggplant and place it a few inches under a broiler, turning it as the exposed skin blackens, about every 3-4 minutes. Place a pan underneath to catch the juices, and discard them. 
# Scrape off the eggplant skin. It's all right if you miss a few burned bits.
# Finely chop or blend the eggplant flesh with the rest of the ingredients. The consistency should be smooth. Reserve a bit of the olive oil, and drizzle that over the top. Sprinkle with some paprika or cayenne.(I use lemon instead of lime juice.)

[[Image:Asimina triloba red fern farm.jpg|thumb|right|pawpaw]]
[[Image:ARS_pawpaw.jpg|thumb|right|pawpaws]]
The '''pawpaw''' (also '''paw paw''' or '''paw-paw''') is a fruit that is 3 to 5 [[Cookbook:Inch|inches]] long. The pawpaw tree, ''Asimina triloba'', grows in the non-coastal parts of the southeastern quarter of the USA.
The pawpaw is related to the [[Cookbook:Cherimoya|cherimoya]] and soursop, not the [[Cookbook:Papaya|papaya]]. Pawpaws taste and feel somewhat like [[Cookbook:Banana|bananas]], and can generally be used in recipes calling for bananas.

Pawpaws are nutritious fruits, better in most ways than bananas. Pawpaws have more protein, fewer carbohydrates, more fat, and about the same amount of potassium. The fat is better, being more monounsaturated and less saturated. Pawpaws have much more iron, zinc, phosphorus, calcium, copper, and manganese. Unlike most plant foods, pawpaws contain all of the essential amino acids.

Fresh pawpaw is very perishable, lasting no more than 3 days at room temperature. It will keep for about three weeks at a temperature of 4°C to 7°C (40°F to 45°F).[http://www.crfg.org/pubs/ff/pawpaw.html]

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Pawpaw|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|1|1}}

Pawpaws ripen during a four week period in August/September, after which they are harvested, making them available from late August to October.

==Synopsis==

Living communally is beautiful.  For tens of thousands of  years humans lived together in tribes.  These tribes were necessary for the survival of fragile humans in a hostile environment.  With the environment conquered

Nowadays the standard unit is the family, or just the couple or many of us even live alone.  The sixties and seventies saw the first wave of experimental communes.  Many of these failed.  There were many reasons for these failures Power games, politics, hierarchies and bad ownership structures.  Yet the alternative of each of us living alone and alienated is just as unsatisfactory, 

Living communally is more efficient and puts less strain on our Planet's sorely stressed resources.  An appliance can be shared among many people - do 20 people really need 20 dishwashers.  We can share cooking, cleaning, childcare and can create together.  Living with others accelerates our growth as other people present a mirror

This manifesto outlines a vision for future communes and

It is time to draw lessons from the failures of past communal living experiments and try again.  Getting it right could make the difference.

{{attention}}

==Communal Living.==

I recently stayed in a Squat where close to 30 people were living communally.  The squat was semi-official - the owner knows they are there and has given them permission to stay for a couple of years. This quasi-legitimacy has encouraged those living there to put a lot of energy and juice into the place.  This living, sharing and creating together was really beautiful - it reminded me a lot of Rajneeshpuram and living there. There is something so beautiful about living together.  It is also really practical as sharing appliances, cooking, cleaning and childcare is a lot more efiicient than each having our own.

In the end I could not stay, there was not enough space and there were some politics so it did not work out.  It did however make me think of communal living and wonder if it is not time maybe to try again.  All Sannyasins carry scars from the failure of past communes especially from the huge wound that was the implosion of Rajneeshpuram.  This makes many of us reluctant to try again.  However if we learn from the mistakes of the past it is possible to create a commune which can work and survive.

So what are the mistakes of past communities and how do we avoid them?

==Governance==

Its tempting to think we are evolved enough to do everything by consensus and there is no need for the rigidity of formal structures.  This just abandons power to the alpha males and females of the group and means the quieter voices don't get a fair say.  Structure does not have to mean hierarchy.  Of course democracy creates politics but until we are all in perfect harmony it is the best system possible.

Governance is a *hard problem* as proved by the struggle so many countries, communities and societies have with it.  Democracy has however evolved and there are some good new styles of democracy which would work well in a community.

One such style is Direct democracy which comprises a form of democracy and theory of civics wherein all citizens can directly participate in the decision-making process.  Direct democracy in its traditional form is rule by the people through referenda. The people are given the right to pass laws, veto laws and withdraw support from a representative (if the system has representatives) at any time.

The main objection to Direct Democracy is that deciding all or most matters of public importance by direct referendum is slow and expensive, and can result in public apathy and voter fatigue.  The solution to this is Delegated Democracy.

In delegated democracy all people have a vote on all issues as with direct democracy but they can delegate their vote in any area to any other person.  If I vote on a topic my vote is counted if I do not bother to vote and I have delegated votes in that field to someone else then my vote is added to their tally.

Some examples:

- Nina is a great cook and nutritionist and I trust her with regards to running the kitchen and feeding us.  Therefore I delegate my votes on food buying and cooking to Nina thus if there is ever the need to vote in this area Nina will cast my vote on my behalf.
- My friend Naoise knows a lot about money and is trustworthy and I think has a good balance between investing and being too cautions. I would delegate my investment votes to him in most instances (although it is an areas which interests me a bit so at certain jey moments I may well vote myself). 
- If friends decided to delegate their votes to me on certain areas where I feel confident (community, governance :-), education) I would be honored to vote on their behalf.

Remember you can alwats still vote yourself and you can always move your vote from one person if you feel they no longer adequately rtepresent you.

==Ownership==

After watching many communes go down the tubes and seeing past effort go to waste many are understandably reluctant to commit energy and money to something without a clear idea of what might happen to it.  This is what makes communal ownership so important. 

If the commune is incorporated as a Limited Liability Partnership all those involved in it can legally have a share of it.  That way if one wishes to leave one can sell out or if it does not work and needs to be wound up any assets will be shared out among those who contributed

== Project information ==

For background information on the start of this wikibook, read this [http://kairosnews.org/node/4418 first] blog or the [http://kairosnews.org/node/4435 second] one by MattBarton.exe on [http://www.kairosnews.org Kairosnews].  As best as I can see it, it started as a class collaboration. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 18:25, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

We are also discussing this project at the computers and writing forum at mattbarton.net.

== Project Discussion ==

~I am thinking a handbook would be the place to start. After rifling through about a dozen of them, I really can't stand the thought of students paying 50 and now sixty bucks for these things. It only looks like it's going to get worse...

And I agree with Matt that it will be easier to put the theory aside for now and just work with the mechanics.

After some sifting then, I found a couple that had interesting ways of organizing or presenting
*The Everyday Writer by Andrea Lundsford
*Prentice Hall Reference Guide by Muriel Harris
*{other that are in my office, will post soon}

These seem to be the super-sized handbooks (they more resemble textbooks)&amp;mdash; maybe more than we need to cover, but maybe not

Boy, wouldn't it be great to have them involved in our project? Which reminds me, we do need to get a woman's voice in all of this, the sooner the better.

== Front-page image ==

New image seems to be taking. No complaints as of yet. - Luke

I think I speak for the class when I say that ''we want the front-page title image to stay.''  Some of the comments people in class have made are:

'''-It is a great introduction for the book.
-It sets the book apart from others.
-Makes the book more visually appealing.
-It defines the goal of our book.'''

I am putting the image back up.

:I personally, despite liking the Wikibook, thought the cover was cheesy. For a better cover, perhaps you could scan a sheet of paper, switch to Courier New, and type out the title?--[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 00:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

Currently, the following two images are being used. The light one is used in the print version of the book, the brown one on the front page. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:57, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

----
I propose a different image: [http://i36.tinypic.com/hrn254.jpg Link]
I made it using Inkscape, so there's an SVG source to it, and the pen is a public domain image from [http://openclipart.org/ openclipart.org]. If anyone's in favour of using it, I'll put up an SVG version in the public domain. --[[User:Rotw|Rotw]] ([[User talk:Rotw|talk]]) 17:21, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

== Suggestions ==
~
I've noticed that this project doesn't seem to be paying attention to the recent moves I've seen in composition away from writing prose that will earn an A in History 201 to really interrogating how we compose--always within a rhetorical context for an envisioned audience and not most effectively in the five-paragraph theme.  Why not make a move toward looking at multimodal composing from a rhetorical standpoint at least in addition to your current presentation?
~

== Discussion about the body who created this project ==

This is a really interesting class project. I'm wondering, what kinds of follow-on writing or discussions are you all having as a class? [[User:Electricbody|Electricbody]] 05:05, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

We've been discussing it in class quite regularly. Many of these discussions have been quite interesting and insightful, ranging from design issues to matters of tone and clarity. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 18:27, 30 November 2005 (UTC)
:This is absolutely fantastic. Thanks for all your work, and organizing it. This stage of the work may be even more interesting. How can your next class improve the work to an even higher level? Improving something that is already pretty good is more challenging than bringing something up to decent. Can a class, working together create a book better than any of the expensive textbooks out there? So far the results look great, without reading through the whole thing. Keep up the great work. - [[User:Taxman|Taxman]] 16:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)

--I sure hope so, Taxman. Only time will tell! ----[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 19:37, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

== Critiques ==
Bravo. I liked this Wikibook. I read a few pages and skimmed through. I instantly saw it had something more intelligent to say than other books on writing. --[[User:Cyberman|Cyberman]] 00:03, 3 August 2006 (UTC) (AKA: Kamisama@Writingforums.com)

== Page numbers on PDF version ==

The PDF version does not have page numbers. It is not part of the writing process, but still would be nice to have, if possible, thanks. [[User:Ervinn|Ervinn]] 14:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== PDF version seems corrupt ==
Repeated attempts to download the pdf gives only a 0 bytes file. This is the only book which I tried which did that.--[[User:Motorhead|Motorhead]] 04:07, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

== AP English ==

this is designed for first year college but would it work for me in AP English? [[User:Ugluk|Ugluk]] 03:07, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

I don't see why not. Might work even better in that context. --[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 16:51, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

== Another module to merge here ==
It seems that [[Media book:Writing a Press Release]] might be a good fit here. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 16:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

== PDF version seems corrupt ==
This book's PDF version doesn't work. It's a good book, so please do something... do anything![[NOt registered]]
15:51, 1 July 2007 (What is UTC?!)

I downloaded it recently, and it seemed to work fine. What's the problem, exactly?--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 22:05, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

== New Parts of book ==

I've added some new sections that will hopefully be completed soon. The teacher's handbook is meant to explain how to use this wikitext with students as well as general concerns about teaching writing. The Writing for the Web section should talk about blogs, discussion boards, and wikis, as well as more general advice about making web pages. It won't be specifics about how to use Frontpage or HTML code; just an introduction to these environments.--[[User:Mattbarton.exe|Mattbarton.exe]] 21:08, 4 October 2007 (UTC)

== SUGGESTION ==

I have been teaching composition and rhetoric at the college level for 15 years.  I am sick of the expensive and, usually, old school approach of many writing/reader textbooks. So, I am interested in using this wikibook next fall for my two english composition courses.  However, I use the writing as process with a portfolio, and I am trying to move to the e-portfolio to cut down on paper.  I noticed, however, that you don't have a section on portfolios.  Can you add a section on the portfolio in composition, but also as a learning assessment tool for any course?  I would love to help put it together.
Thanks,
Rebecca

None of the listed books matches in quality and scope Rhetoric and Composition. However, some have a different focus and different coverage. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:19, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

== Editing and revising ==

There has been a shift in the definition of the contrast between '''editing''' and '''revising'''. Quoting the current introductory chater[[Rhetoric_and_Composition/The_Stages_of_the_Writing_Process|[1]]]:

:You can't edit what hasn't been written. That's why editing comes after drafting. For our purposes, it's important to distinguish between deciding what needs to be improved and actually making the changes. We'll call the decision-making process &quot;editing&quot; and making the changes the &quot;revising&quot; process.

As I understand it, here, ''editing'' refers to the process of collecting issues while revising to the process of fixing issues.

The current setup of later chapters has a different concept, one, in which ''editing'' refers to making stylistic changes within the scope of single paragraph, including the choice of words and sentence structure, while ''revising'' refers to making larger changes such as changing the order of chapters, their division or focus.

Yet another [[Rhetoric_and_Composition/Revising|section]] of the book has three level model:
* '''revising''' - audience, organization, content, support, concision
* '''editing''' - usage, word choice, transitions, mechanics
* '''proofreading''' - spelling, punctuation, typography

Whatever the preferred concept, the parts will need to be aligned at some point.

== Merger of Writer's Handbook ==

From what I understand and can see in the page history, Writer's Handbook has been merged around December 2005 into this book, after this book has been written. It seems like an unfortunate decision to me, but what do I know.

The focus of Rhetoric and Composition was on the college writer, as suggested by the title, while the focus of Writer's Handbook was on anyone who writes for living, isn't it? There are overlaps between Rhetoric and Composition and Writer's Handbook. While the content of Rhetoric and Composition is outlined in detail on the front page, the Writer's Handbook, containing valuable material, is mentioned only as a single item.

I find it hard to imagine that someone would have the skill and time here to really merge and integrate the two materials together, instead of just concatenating them, one next to the other.

I don't know whether I should propose to divorce the two books again. In any case, even without the divorce, these two books are best viewed as separate ones. What I can imagine is that instead of the concatenation, the books can be continually enriched from one another, as if they were two forks of a past project, but each keeping its own structure.

Admittedly, though, Writer's Handbook has the coverage of mechanics, including grammar, punctuation, comma splice and the like, which Rhetoric and Composition does not have. So they indeed seem kind of complementary.

Well, said enough. I wonder what other views there are

--[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:05, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

: Looking again at [[Rhetoric and Composition/Detailed TOC]], the ''Writer's Handbook'' could be renamed to ''Grammar and Mechanics'', and given the space on the front page that it deserves. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:13, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

: As regards the proposed renaming, given ''mechanics'' refers to spelling and punctuation, we can safe the reader one new word to learn and name it ''Grammar, Spelling and Punctuation'', or ''Conventions'', as it is called somewhere, although I do not rememer where.

: This renaming would encourage a moving of the section on Citations and the section on Giving Feedback from the Writer's Handbook to the Rhetoric and Composition proper. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 10:32, 9 September 2008 (UTC)

==Renaming of &quot;Writer's Handbook&quot;==
I have renamed the &quot;Writer's Handbook&quot; part to &quot;Grammar and Mechanics&quot;, to let the title tell more about its contents. From what I understand, &quot;Writer's Handbook&quot; was the title of the part when it was a separate book, before it was merged into Rhetoric and Composition. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 12:11, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

== Ideas for New Sections - ENGL 656 ==

In looking at the big picture of this e-book, I wondered what everyone would think of adding more genres. Specifically, I think it would be valuable to add the topics of memoirs, reviews, commentaries and proposals. Within one semester, I will not be able to tackle all of these sections, but I could begin to develop skeletons and suggestions for each topics content. What do you think?

== Project abandoned? ==

Has development on this wikibook stopped? I'm looking at teaching composition next year, and I'd much rather use a free text than ask my students to shell out fifty bucks or more for a book they'll never finish anyway. I'd been hoping to use this book for my courses, as it's the best one I've found so far, but it's been &quot;incomplete&quot; for a long time now, and it looks like no fresh edits/revisions have been made within the last two years. Should I start looking elsewhere?

| A group of town counselors in a small city in a West African country met to discuss solutions to the challenges of a rapidly growing population.  Over the past few decades, high local birthrates had led to a doubling of the local population.  More people now wanted land to build homes, but land was also needed to grow more food.  Increased demand for clean water taxed the local sanitation systems, while increased competition for jobs meant employers could hire desperate workers for less money than they had been paying before.  Violent confrontations were becoming more common as people competed for scarce resources. 

While addressing the immediate concerns, town counselors realized they would need to find a way to reduce the high birthrates to avoid an even more challenging future.  They shared stories of other towns that had tried a variety of ways to reduce the birthrates.  Some passed laws prohibiting new births.  Others had freely distributed various types of birth control.  Still others tried public education programs that informed citizens of the ill effects of an ever-growing population.  None of the programs had been successful in reducing birthrates.  The local culture was very family centered.  Children were seen as both a blessing and a type of insurance that someone would care for you as you aged.

Finally, a young person who had just returned from taking Sociology classes at a nearby University spoke up. “I have learned of one method that is very successful in reducing birthrates, not only in Africa but in many other parts of the world.  It may not be immediately obvious as to why, but there are many studies that demonstrate its success.”  The town counselors were intrigued, and asked the student to tell them more.  “If you want to reduce birth rates... you need to provide women with opportunities to be educated and to get jobs.”

The reasons for this interesting recommendation are explored later in this chapter.

==Introduction==
[[File:Jiayuguan-029.JPG|400px|thumbnail|right|China is the world's most populous country, with over 1.3 billion people.  The Chinese government, like many other governments, has a number of policies related to fertility.]]

'''Demography''' is the study of human population dynamics. It encompasses the study of the size, structure and distribution of populations, and how populations change over time due to births, deaths, migration, and aging. Demographic analysis can relate to whole societies or to smaller groups defined by criteria such as education, religion, or ethnicity.

==Why study demography?==
Before proposing complex theories to explain sociological phenomena (e.g., [[w:World Systems Theory|World Systems Theory]]), especially at the macro and/or societal levels, sociologists should first turn to demographic indicators  for possible explanations.  Demographic analysis is a powerful tool that can explain a number of sociological phenomena.  

For instance, in examining the elements that led to the first [[w:World War I|World War]], most people turn to [[w:World war 1#Diplomatic and political origins|political and diplomatic conflicts]] but fail to consider the implications of expanding populations in the European countries involved.  Expanding populations will result in increased competition for resources (i.e., food, land, access to trade routes and ports, etc.). Expanding populations may not be the primary cause of World War I, but it may have played a role in the increased hostilities leading up to the war.  In this fashion, demographic indicators are often informative in explaining world events and should be turned to first as explanations.

==History==
The study of human populations has its roots, like sociology generally, in the societal changes that accompanied both the scientific and industrial revolutions.  Some early mathematicians developed primitive forms of [[w:life table|life tables]], which are tables of life expectancies, for life insurance and [[w:actuarial science|actuarial]] purposes.  [[w:Census|Censuses]], another demographic tool, were institued for primarily political purposes:
*as a basis for taxation
*as a basis for political representation

The development of demographic calculations started in the 18th century. Census taking, on the other hand, has a long history dating back close to 2,000 years among the Chinese and the Romans and even further back in history among some groups in the Middle East.  Most modern censuses began in the late 18th century.

==Data and Methods== 
Demography relies on large data sets that are primarily derived from [[w:census|censuses]] and registration statistics (i.e., birth, death, marriage registrations). Large data sets over long periods of time (e.g., the U.S. census is conducted every 10 years) are required to develop trends in demographic indicators, like birth and death rates.  

In many countries, particularly in developing nations, reliable demographic data are still difficult to obtain. In some locales this may be due to the association of ''census'' with ''taxation''.

===Demographic Indicators===
Because demography is interested in changes in human populations, demographers focus on specific indicators of change.  Two of the most important indicators are birth and death rates, which are also referred to as [[w:fertility|''fertility'']] (see also [[w:fecundity|fecundity]]) and ''mortality''.  Additionally, demographers are interested in migration trends or the movement of people from one location to another.  Some of the specific measures used to explore these elements of population change are discussed below.  While demography often provides useful portraits of social patterns, it is important to note that - especially in relation to minority groups - accurate numerical values are often difficult to achieve, and thus demographic understandings of social structures and patterns are continuously shifting in relation to the availability of more accurate data and measurement techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Dudley L. Poston, Michael Micklin.  2006.  Handbook of Population.  Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertility and Fecundity===
'''Fertility''', in demography, refers to the ability of females to produce healthy offspring in abundance.  '''Fecundity''' is the potential reproductive capacity of a female.  Some of the more common demographic measures used in relation to fertility and/or fecundity include:
*'''crude birth rate''': the annual number of live births per thousand people 
*'''general fertility rate''': the annual number of live births per 1000 women of childbearing age (often taken to be from 15 to 49 years old, but sometimes from 15 to 44). 
*'''age-specific fertility''' rate: the annual number of live births per 1000 women in particular age groups (usually age 15-19, 20-24 etc.) 
*'''total fertility rate''': the number of live births per woman completing her reproductive life if her childbearing at each age reflected current age-specific fertility rates
*'''gross reproduction rate''': the number of daughters who would be born to a woman completing her reproductive life at current age-specific fertility rates 
*'''net reproduction rate''': the number of daughters who would be born to a woman according to current age-specific fertility and mortality rates

Another important demographic concept relating to fertility is ''replacement level''. Replacement level fertility refers to the number of children that a woman (or monogamous couple) must have in order to replace the existing population. Sub-replacement fertility is a fertility rate that is not high enough to replace an existing population. Replacement level fertility is generally set at 2.1 children in a woman's lifetime (this number varies by geographic region given different mortality rates). Sub-replacement fertility is below approximately 2.1 children in a woman's life time. The reason the number is set to 2.1 children per woman is because two children are needed to replace the parents and an additional one-tenth of a child is needed to make up for the mortality of children and women who do not reach the end of their reproductive years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2009&quot;&gt;carr, deborah. 2009. “worries over a population implosion.” Contexts 8:58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, women don't have one-tenth of a child; this results from statistical averaging between women who have more than two children and those who have two or fewer children.

The chart below illustrates trends in childbearing by region of the world.  Fertility rates dropped earlier in the more developed regions of the world, followed by Asia and Latin America.  Fertility rates are just starting to decline in Africa.

[[Image:Trends in Total Fertility 1950-2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

The chart below highlights the varied fertility rates of specific countries as some have very low fertility rates, many have moderate rates, and some have very high rates.

[[Image:Total Fertility Rates for Select Countries-2005-2010.jpg|center|thumb|800px]]

The following chart illustrates the relationship between contraceptive use and the total fertility rate by regions of the world.  Increased contraceptive use is associated with lower numbers of children per woman.

[[Image:Scatterplot of contraceptive use and TFR by region 2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

One of the strongest predictors of fertility rates is women's [[Introduction_to_Sociology/Education|educational attainment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mare2006&quot;&gt;Mare, R.D., &amp; Maralani, V. (2006). The Intergenerational Effects of Changes in Women's Educational Attainments. ''American Sociological Review'', 71(4), 542-564.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost universally, higher levels of educational attainment result in lower fertility rates.  It is not, however, education itself that causes declines in fertility but rather its association with other factors that reduce fertility: women with higher levels of education delay marriage and are more likely to abstain from marriage and / or parenthood, have improved labor market opportunities, are more likely to use [[w:contraception|contraception]] during intercourse, and are less likely to adopt traditional childbearing roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mare2006&quot;/&gt;

Fertility rates are also closely related to a country's level of development, which influences other factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr2007&quot;&gt;carr, deborah. 2007. “the cost of kids.” Contexts 6:62.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, women who have kids in developed countries have increased opportunity costs, meaning they will make less money because of time spent outside the workforce raising kids.  This is true in developed countries because women are more likely to be highly skilled and well-paid (relative to women in developing countries). Additionally, delayed childbearing, probability of a child reaching adulthood, norms about ideal family sizes, and pervasiveness of contraceptives will all reduce fertility rates.  But one of the biggest factors is the cost of children.  In undeveloped and developing countries, children are often an economic asset to parents as they serve as cheap labor on the farm; they don't require pay, just food and shelter.  That is not the case in developed countries, where very few people work in agriculture (roughly 2% in the US).  Instead, children are an economic liability, meaning they cost money while not generating money for the parents.  The cost of raising a child from birth to 17 in a middle-income home in 2005 was $191,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr2007&quot;/&gt;  That cost goes up if parents pay for a child's college education, which averages between $12,000 and $30,000.  Thus, the cost of raising children in developed countries reduces fertility rates in those countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;carr2007&quot;/&gt;  Further, mothers (but not fathers) in developed countries typically experience wage penalties (e.g., receive less pay than male and non-parental female workers), which can further exacerbate the financial cost of parenthood for women in developed countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moller2013&quot;&gt;Stephanie Moller, Joya Misra, and Eiko Strader. 2013. “A Cross-National Look at How Welfare States Reduce Inequality.”  Sociological Compass. 7(2): 135-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortality===
'''Mortality''' refers to the finite nature of humanity: people die.  Mortality in demography is interested in the number of deaths in a given time or place or the proportion of deaths in relation to a population.  Some of the more common demographic measures of mortality include:
*'''crude death rate''': the annual number of deaths per 1000 people 
*'''infant mortality rate''': the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year old per thousand live births 
*'''life expectancy''': the number of years which an individual at a given age can expect to live at present mortality rates 

Note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression. For example, the number of deaths per 1000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries, despite standards of health being better in developed countries. This is because developed countries have relatively more older people, who are more likely to die in a given year, so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower. A more complete picture of mortality is given by a [[w:Life table|life table]] which summarizes mortality separately at each age.

This chart depicts infant mortality by region of the world.  The less developed regions of the world have higher infant mortality rates than the more developed regions.

[[Image:Infant Mortality Rates - 1950-2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

This chart depicts life expectancy by region of the world.  Similar to infant mortality, life expectancies are higher in more developed regions of the world.

[[Image:Life Expectancy at Birth 1950-2010.png|center|thumb|800px]]

According to recent research,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata2007&quot;&gt;Kolata, G. (2007). A Surprising Secret to a Long Life: Stay in School. The New York Times. Retrieved January 3, 2007. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/health/03aging.html]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the best predictors of [[w:longevity|longevity]] (i.e., a long life) is education, even when other factors are controlled: the more educated you are, the longer you  can expect to live.  A few additional years of schooling can add several additional years to your life and vastly improve your health in old age.  The mechanism through which this works is not the schooling itself, but schooling's influence on other health-related behaviors.  The more education someone has, the lower his/her likelihood of smoking and engaging in unhealthy and high risk behaviors.  Education also increases the probability of people engaging in healthy behaviors, like frequently exercising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolata2007&quot;/&gt;

Other factors associated with greater longevity include:
*wealth: money increases access to good healthcare, which improves health and increases longevity
*race: whites live longer than blacks, though this is due to other social disparities, like income and education, and not to race itself
*ability to delay gratification: with the ability to delay gratification people live healthier lives and engage in healthier behaviors (e.g., exercise)
*larger social networks: having a large group of friends and close relationships with relatives increases your [[w:social support|social support]], which positively influences health
*job satisfaction: people in more powerful and more satisfying jobs tend to be healthier than people in less satisfying jobs

==The Demographic Transition==
[[Image:Stage5.svg|right|thumb|300px]]

The '''demographic transition''' is a model and theory describing the transition from high birth rates and death rates to low birth and death rates that occurs as part of the economic development of a country. In pre-industrial societies, population growth is relatively slow because both birth and death rates are high.  In most post-industrial societies, birth and death rates are both low.  The transition from high rates to low rates is referred to as ''the demographic transition''.  This understanding of societal changes is based on the work of Thompson,&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson1929&quot;&gt;Thompson, W. C. 1929.  The American Journal of Sociology 34:959-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Blacker,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blacker1947&quot;&gt;Blacker, C. P. 1947. Eugenics Review 39:88-101.&lt;/ref&gt; and Notestein,&lt;ref name=&quot;Notestein1945&quot;&gt;Notestein, F. W. 1945. Pp. 36-57 in Food for the World, Editor T. W. Schultz. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; who derived the model based on changes in demographics over the preceding two hundred years or so.

The beginning of the demographic transition in a society is indicated when death rates drop without a corresponding fall in birth rates (usually the result of improved sanitation and advances in healthcare). Countries in the second stage of the demographic transition (see diagram) experience a large increase in population.  This is depicted in the diagram when death rates fall in stage two but birth rates do not fall until stage three.  The red line begins its rapid upward growth in stage two and begins to level off at the end of stage three.

By the end of stage three, birth rates drop to fall in line with the lower death rates. While there are several theories that attempt to explain why this occurs (e.g., Becker and Caldwell, who view children as economic commodities),&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker1960&quot;&gt;Becker, Gary S. 1960. &quot;An Economic Analysis of Fertility.&quot; Pp. 209-31 in Demographic and Economic Change in Developed Countries, Edited Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldwell1982&quot;&gt;Caldwell, John C. 1982. Theory of Fertility Decline. Sydney: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; why birth rates decline in post-industrial societies is still being evaluated.  Recent evidence from Mongolia, which underwent a demographic and economic transition in the 1990s and early 2000s, suggests that during this transition women begin pursuing education in order to obtain greater wealth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alvergne2014&quot;&gt;Alvergne, Alexandra and Virpi Lummaa. 2014. Ecological variation in wealth–fertility relationships in Mongolia: the ‘central theoretical problem of sociobiology’ not a problem after all? Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Volume 281, Issue 1796.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, fertility maximization (i.e., having lots of kids) was traded for the pursuit of status enhancement (i.e., having more money), suggesting that prior explanations for the demographic transition - namely, the cost of children - may have been at least partially correct. As a result of this transition, many developed countries now have a population that is static or, in some cases, [[w:population decline|shrinking]].

As with all models, this is an idealized, composite picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. Whether or not it will accurately depict changes in developing societies today remains to be seen. For more information on the demographic transition, see [http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/Demotrans/demtran.htm here].

==Population Growth and Overpopulation==
[[Image:Time Between Billions in World Population Growth.png|right|thumb|400px|The time it takes to introduce additional billions of people has decreased since the first billion mark was reached.]]

'''Overpopulation''' indicates a scenario in which the population of a living species exceeds the [[w:carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of its [[w:ecological niche|ecological niche]]. Overpopulation is not a function of the number or density of the individuals, but rather the number of individuals compared to the resources they need to survive. In other words, it is a ratio: ''population'' over ''resources''. If a given environment has a population of 10, but there is food and drinking water enough for only 9 people, then that environment is overpopulated, while if the population is 100 individuals but there are food and water enough for 200, then it is not overpopulated. Resources to be taken into account when estimating if an ecological niche is overpopulated include clean water, food, shelter, warmth, etc. In the case of human beings, there are others such as [[w:arable land|arable land]] and, for all but tribes with primitive lifestyles, lesser resources such as jobs, money, education, fuel, electricity, medicine, proper sewage and garbage management, and transportation.

[[Image:Population growth in more and less developed regions 1950-2100.png|right|thumb|400px|The majority of world population growth today is occurring in less developed countries.]]

Presently, every year the [[w:world population|world's human population]] grows by approximately 80 million.  About half the world lives in nations with [[w:sub-replacement fertility|sub-replacement fertility]] and [[w:population growth|population growth]] in those countries is due to immigration. The United Nations projects that the world human population will stabilize in 2075 at nine billion due to declining fertility rates.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN-pop&quot;&gt;http://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm&lt;/ref&gt; All the nations of East Asia, with the exceptions of Mongolia, the Philippines, and Laos, are below replacement level. Russia and Eastern Europe are dramatically below replacement fertility. Western Europe also is below replacement. In the Middle East Iran, Tunisia, Algeria, Turkey, and Lebanon are below replacement. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are similar to Western Europe, while the United States is just barely below replacement with about 2.0 births per woman. All four of these nations still have growing populations due to high rates of immigration. 

Much of the projected growth is expected to come from African countries where birth rates remain high.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost2009&quot;&gt;frost, ashley e., and f. nii-amoo dodoo. 2009. “men are missing from african family planning.” Contexts 8(1):44-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  While birth rates in most countries have fallen since 1990, in some parts of Africa birth rates have actually increased and the average woman has more than five children, well above the replacement rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;frost2009&quot;/&gt;

===Early Projections of Overpopulation===
Early in the 19th century, [[w:Thomas Malthus|Thomas Malthus]] argued in ''An Essay on the Principle of Population'' that, if left unrestricted, human populations would continue to grow until they would become too large to be supported by the food grown on available agricultural land.  He proposed that, while resources tend to grow arithmetically, population [[w:exponential growth|grows exponentially]]. At that point, the population would be restrained through mass famine and starvation. Malthus argued for [[w:population control|population control]], through ''moral restraint'', to avoid this happening. 

The alternative to moral restraint, according to Malthus, is biological and natural population limitation. As the population exceeds the amount of available resources the population decreases through famine, disease, or war, since the lack of resources causes mortality to increase. This process keeps the population in check and ensures it does not exceed the amount of resources.

Over the two hundred years following Malthus's projections, famine has overtaken numerous individual regions. Proponents of this theory, [[w:Neo-Malthusians|Neo-Malthusians]] state that these famines were examples of [[w:Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian catastrophes]]. On a global scale, however, food production has grown faster than population. It has often been argued that future pressures on food production, combined with threats to other aspects of the earth's habitat such as [[w:global warming|global warming]], make overpopulation a still more serious threat in the future. 

===Population as a Function of Food Availability===
There are some scholars who argue that human populations predictably grow and shrink according to their available food supply - populations grow when there is an abundance of food and shrink in times of scarcity. This idea is only slightly less problematic than the idea that human population growth is not guided by food production, as it suggestions that that every time food production is intensified to feed a growing population, the population responds by increasing even more. Some human populations throughout history support this theory, as consistent population growth began with the agricultural revolution, when food supplies consistently increased. 

Critics of this idea point out that birth rates are voluntarily the lowest in developed nations, which also have the highest access to food. In fact, the population is decreasing in some countries with abundant food supply. Thus, human populations do not always grow to match the available food supply. Critics cite other factors that contribute to declining birth rates in developed nations, including: increased access to contraception, later ages of marriage, the growing desire of many women in such settings to seek careers outside of childrearing and domestic work, and the decreased economic 'utility' of children in industrialized settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Becker1960&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caldwell1982&quot;/&gt; The latter explanation stems from the fact that children perform a great deal of work in small-scale agricultural societies, and work less in industrial ones; this interpretation may seem callous, but it has been cited to explain the drop-off in birthrates worldwide in all industrializing regions.

For some, the concept that human populations behave in the same way as do populations of bears and fish is hard to believe; for others it indicates a feasible solution to population issues. In either case, since populations are tied to the food they consume, discussions of populations should not take place without considering the role played by food supply.  There is a substantial body of research that has considered the ability of the planet to provide sufficient food for the world's growing population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godfray2010&quot;&gt;Godfray, H. Charles J. et al. 2010. “Food Security: The Challenge of Feeding 9 Billion People.” Science 327:812-818.&lt;/ref&gt;  This research suggests that the planet can potentially provide sufficient food for the projected peak population of humans of 9 billion people, but only if agriculture is carefully managed.  Factors that must be considered include: genetically modified crops, employing agricultural tools in correct, context-specific ways, aquaculture, and simultaneously working to limit harm to the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Godfray2010&quot;/&gt;

===Effects of Overpopulation===
In any case, many proponents of population control have averred that famine is far from being the only problem attendant to overpopulation.  These critics point out ultimate shortages of energy sources and other natural resources, as well as the importance of serious communicable diseases in dense populations and war over scarce resources such as land area. A shortage of arable land (where food crops will grow) is also a problem.

The world's current agricultural production, if it were distributed evenly, would be sufficient to feed everyone living on the Earth today. However, many critics hold that, in the absence of other measures, simply feeding the world's population well would only make matters worse, natural growth will cause the population to grow to unsustainable levels, and will directly result in famines and deforestation and indirectly in pandemic disease and war.

Some of the other characteristics of overpopulation include:
*Child poverty
*High birth rates
*Lower life expectancies
*Lower levels of literacy
*Higher rates of unemployment, especially in [[w:urban|urban]]
*Insufficient arable land
*Little surplus food
*Poor diet with ill health and diet-deficiency diseases (e.g. [[w:rickets|rickets]])
*Low per capita GDP
*Increasingly unhygienic conditions
*Government is stretched economically
*Increased crime rates resulting from people stealing resources to survive
*Mass extinctions of plants and animals as habitat is used for farming and human settlements

[[Image:Percentage of Population Residing in Urban Areas 1950-2050.png|center|thumb|800px|Urbanization results from both industrialization (increasing efficiency among farmers) and population growth.]]

Another point of view on population growth and how it effects the standard of living is that of [[w:Virginia Abernethy|Virginia Abernethy]]. In ''Population Politics'' she shows evidence that declining fertility following industrialization only holds true in nations where women enjoy a relatively high status. In strongly patriarchal nations, where women enjoy few rights, a higher standard of living tends to result in population growth.  Abernathy argues that foreign aid to poor countries must include significant components designed to improve the education, human rights, political rights, political power, and economic status and power of women.

===Possible Solutions to Overpopulation===
Some approach overpopulation with a ''[[w:survival of the fittest|survival of the fittest]]'', ''[[w:laissez-faire|laissez-faire]]'' attitude, arguing that if the Earth's ecosystem becomes overtaxed, it will naturally regulate itself.  In this mode of thought, disease or starvation are &quot;natural&quot; means of lessening population. Objections to this argument are:
#in the meantime, a huge number of plant and animal species become extinct
#this would result in terrible pollution in some areas that would be difficult to abate
#it obviously creates certain moral problems, as this approach would result in great suffering in the people who die

Others argue that economic development is the best way to reduce population growth as economic development can spur demographic transitions that seem to ''naturally'' lead to reductions in fertility rates. 

In either case, it is often held that the most productive approach is to provide a combination of help targeted towards population control and self-sufficiency. One of the most important measures proposed for this effort is the empowerment of women educationally, economically, politically, and in the family. The value of this philosophy has been substantially borne out in cases where great strides have been taken toward this goal. Where women's status has dramatically improved, there has generally been a drastic reduction in the birthrate to more sustainable levels. Other measures include effective [[w:birth control|family planning]] programs, local [[w:renewable energy|renewable energy]] systems, [[w:sustainable agriculture|sustainable agriculture]] methods and supplies, [[w:reforestation|reforestation]], and measures to protect the local environment.

[http://www.utne.com/web_special/web_specials_archives/articles/799-1.html David Pimentel], a Cornell University professor of ecology and agricultural sciences, sees several possible scenarios for the 22nd century: 
#a planet with 2 billion people thriving in harmony with the environment
#or, at the other extreme, 12 billion miserable humans suffering a difficult life with limited resources and widespread famine
Spreading awareness of the issues is an important first step in addressing it.

===Underpopulation===
Once countries pass through the demographic transition, some experience fertility rate decreases so substantial that they fall well below replacement level and their populations begin to shrink (as has Russia's in recent years, though emigration has also played a role in Russia's population decline).  A new fear for many governments, particularly those in countries with very low fertility rates, is that a declining population will reduce the GDP and economic growth of the country, as population growth is often a driving force of economic expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carr2009&quot;/&gt;  To combat extremely low fertility rates, some of these governments have introduced pro-family policies, that include things like payments to parents for having children and extensive parental leave for parents.  Such policies may reverse the low fertility rates, but they also seem to be shortsighted in light of the concerns associated with overall world population growth.

==Migration==
The likelihood of a given individual in the U.S. moving to another place in the U.S. in any given year has declined over the last 40 years.  Only about 1 in 10 Americans have moved in the last year, which is about half the proportion that changed residences annually in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;&gt;Roberts, Sam. 2008. “Data Show Steady Drop in Americans on Move.” The New York Times, December 21 http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/us/21mobility.html?_r=1 (Accessed December 1, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCensusPopSurvey2008&quot;&gt;Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, 2008 Annual Social and Economic Supplement&lt;/ref&gt;  The reduction in moves is attributable to aging populations (older people are less likely to move) and an increase in dual-career couples. Those who do move are generally driven by jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;

Close to 37% of Americans have never moved from the community in which they were born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;  There are wide variations in native inhabitants, however: 76% of Texans were born in-state while only 14% of Nevadans were born in-state.  Some states lose a large number of people who were born in the state as well, like Alaska, where only 28% of the people born in that state have remained there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts2008&quot;/&gt;
Immigration is often a controversial topic, for a variety of reasons, though many have to do with competition between those already living in the destination location and those arriving in that location.  One recent study finds that one type of competition between immigrants and non-immigrants may be overstated.  Some people have suggested that natives' opportunities to attend college are negatively impacted through competition with immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neymotin2009&quot;&gt;Neymotin, Florence. 2009. Immigration and Its Effect on the College-Going Outcomes of Natives. Economics of Education Review. 28, 5:538-550.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neymotin (2009) finds that competition with immigrants does not harm the educational outcomes of U.S. natives and may in fact facilitate college attending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neymotin2009&quot;/&gt; Additionally, recent research suggests that opposition to immigration is less about competition over jobs and more about how immigrants might change the identity of the society where the migrants move.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hainmueller2014&quot;&gt;Hainmueller, J., &amp; Hopkins, D. J. (2014). Public Attitudes Toward Immigration. Annual Review of Political Science, 17(1), 225–249. doi:10.1146/annurev-polisci-102512-194818&lt;/ref&gt;

==Urbanization==
'''Urbanization''' is the physical growth of [[w:urban area|urban area]]s as a result of global change. Urbanization is also defined by the United Nations as movement of people from [[w:rural|rural]] to urban areas with population growth equating to urban migration. The United Nations projected that half of the world's [[w:World population|population]] would live in urban areas at the end of 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;InternationalHeraldTribune2008&quot;&gt; http://web.archive.org/web/20080412005441/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/news/UN-GEN-UN-Growing-Cities.php The Associated Press. February 26, 2008. UN says half the world's population will live in urban areas by end of 2008. International Herald Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  Urbanization is closely linked to [[w:modernization|modernization]], [[w:industrialization|industrialization]], and the sociological process of [[w:rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]].

===Movement===
[[File:Urban_population_in_2005_world_map.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Percentage of population which is urbanized, by country, as of 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unicef2008&quot;&gt;http://www.unicef.org/sowc08/docs/sowc08_table_StatisticalTables.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As more and more people leave villages and farms to live in cities, urban growth results. The rapid growth of cities like Chicago in the late 19th century and [[w:Mumbai|Mumbai]] a century later can be attributed largely to rural-urban migration and the demographic transition.  This kind of growth is especially commonplace in [[w:developing country|developing countries]].

The rapid urbanisation of the world’s population over the twentieth century is described in the 2005 Revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects report. The global proportion of urban population rose dramatically from 13% (220 million) in 1900, to 29% (732 million) in 1950, to 49% (3.2 billion) in 2005.  The same report projected that the figure is likely to rise to 60% (4.9 billion) by 2030.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WUP2005/2005wup.htm World Urbanization Prospects: The 2005 Revision, Pop. Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, UN]&lt;/ref&gt;. Urbanization rates vary between countries.  The United States and United Kingdom have a far higher urbanization level than China, India, Swaziland or Niger, but a far slower annual urbanization rate, since much less of the population is living in a rural area.

===Causes===

[[File:Manila shanty.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Urbanization is not always attributed to high density. In [[w:Manila|Manila]], the cost of living has forced residents to live in low quality [[w:slum|slum]]s and [[w:shanty town|shanty town]]s]]

People move into cities to seek economic opportunities. A major contributing factor is known as &quot;[[w:rural flight|rural flight]]&quot;. In rural areas, often on small family farms, it is difficult to improve one's standard of living beyond basic sustenance. Farm living is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions, and in times of drought, flood or pestilence, survival becomes extremely problematic. In modern times, [[w:Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[w:agriculture|agriculture]] has negatively affected the economy of small and middle-sized farms and strongly reduced the size of the rural labour market. Cities, in contrast, are known to be places where money, services and wealth are centralized. Cities are where fortunes are made and where social mobility is possible. Businesses, which generate jobs and capital, are usually located in urban areas. Whether the source is trade or tourism, it is also through the cities that foreign money flows into a country. Thus, as with immigration generally, there are factors that ''push'' people out of rural areas and ''pull'' them into urban areas.

There are also better basic services as well as other specialist services in urban areas that aren't found in rural areas. There are more job opportunities and a greater variety of jobs. Health is another major factor. People, especially the elderly are often forced to move to cities where there are doctors and hospitals that can address their health needs. Other factors include a greater variety of entertainment (e.g., restaurants, movie theaters, theme parks, etc.) and better quality of education in the form of universities.  Due to their high populations, urban areas can also have much more diverse social communities allowing others to find people like them when they might not be able to in rural areas.  These conditions are heightened during times of change from a pre-industrial society to an industrial one. 

===Economic Effects===
As cities develop, effects can include a dramatic increase in costs, often pricing the local [[w:working class|working class]] out of the real estate market. For example, Eric Hobsbawm's book ''The age of the revolution: 1789–1848'' (published 1962 and 2005) chapter 11, stated &quot;Urban development in our period [1789–1848] was a gigantic process of class segregation, which pushed the new labouring poor into great morasses of misery outside the centres of government and business and the newly specialised residential areas of the bourgeoisie. The almost universal European division into a 'good' west end and a 'poor' east end of large cities developed in this period.&quot; This is likely due the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind, making the western edges of towns preferable to the eastern ones. Similar problems now affect the developing world; rising inequality results from rapid urbanization. The drive for growth and efficiency can lead to less equitable urban development&lt;ref name=&quot;Grant2008&quot;&gt;Grant, Ursula (2008) Opportunity and exploitation in urban labour markets [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/download/1969.pdf] London: [[w:Overseas Development Institute|Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Urbanization is often viewed as a negative trend, but can in fact, be perceived simply as a natural occurrence from individual and corporate efforts to reduce expense in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs, education, housing, and transportation. Living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity, diversity, and marketplace competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glaeser1998&quot;&gt;Glaeser, Edward. 1998. &quot;Are Cities Dying?&quot; The Journal of Economic Perspectives. 12(2):139–160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Effects===
One environmental concern associated with urbanization is the [[w:urban heat island|urban heat island]]. The urban heat island is formed when industrial and urban areas are developed and heat becomes more abundant. In rural areas, a large part of the incoming solar energy is used to evaporate water from vegetation and soil. In cities, where less vegetation and exposed soil exists, the majority of the sun’s energy is absorbed by urban structures and asphalt. Hence, during warm daylight hours, less evaporative cooling in cities allows surface temperatures to rise higher than in rural areas. Additional city heat is given off by vehicles and factories, as well as by industrial and domestic heating and cooling units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park1987&quot;&gt;Park, H.-S. (1987). Variations in the urban heat island intensity affected by geographical environments. Environmental Research Center papers, no. 11. Ibaraki, Japan: Environmental Research Center, The University of Tsukuba.&lt;/ref&gt; This effect causes the city to become 2 to 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; F (1 to 6&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C) warmer than surrounding landscapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-heat&quot;&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/ &quot;Heat Island Effect&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;. Impacts also include reducing soil moisture and intensification of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;gtresearchnews&quot;&gt;&quot;Heating Up: Study Shows Rapid Urbanization in China Warming the Regional Climate Faster than Other Urban Areas&quot; [http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/china-climate.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of urbanization may be an overall positive for the environment. Birth rates of new urban dwellers fall immediately to the replacement rate (2.1), and keep falling. This can prevent overpopulation (see discussion below). Additionally, it puts a stop to destructive subsistence farming techniques, like [[w:slash and burn|slash and burn]] agriculture. Finally, it minimizes land use by humans, leaving more for nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand&quot;&gt;Brand, Stewart. Whole Earth Discipline.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Effects===
In addition to the effects noted above, urbanization can influence how people feel about their environment.  For instance, one study found that people who live in large apartment buildings are less likely to know their neighbors.  Even so, they do not feel greater fear when they are walking around alone than do individuals who live in single-family homes.  However, when people in apartment buildings are home alone, they feel less fear than do people who are home alone in single-family homes.  One possible explanation is a &quot;fortress effect&quot;: that individuals in large apartment buildings feel isolated from those outside the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rollwagen2014&quot;&gt;Rollwagen, Heather. 2014. “The Relationship Between Dwelling Type and Fear of Crime.” Environment and Behavior 0013916514540459.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible explanation is that the close presence of people around us, even if we do not know them, tends to afford some degree of security.

===Changing Forms of Urbanization===
Different forms of urbanization can be classified depending on the style of architecture and planning methods as well as historic growth of areas.  In cities of the [[w:Developed country|developed world]] urbanization traditionally exhibited a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area.  Recent developments, such as inner-city redevelopment schemes, mean that new arrivals in cities no longer necessarily settle in the centre. In some developed regions, the reverse effect, originally called [[w:counter urbanisation|counter urbanisation]] has occurred, with cities losing population to rural areas, and is particularly common for richer families.  This has been possible because of improved communications and means of transportation, and has been caused by factors such as the fear of crime and poor urban environments. Later termed ''&quot;[[w:white flight|white flight]]&quot;'', the effect is not restricted to cities with a high ethnic minority population. When the residential area shifts outward, this is called [[w:suburbanization|suburbanization]]. Some research suggests that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown both in developed and developing countries such as India &lt;ref name=&quot;Sridhar2007&quot;&gt;Sridhar, K. 2007. Density gradients and their determinants: Evidence from India. Regional Science and Urban Economics 37(3):314-344&lt;/ref&gt;.

Urbanization can be planned or organic. Planned urbanization, (e.g., [[w:planned community|planned communities]]), is based on an advanced plan, which can be prepared for military, aesthetic, economic or [[w:urban design|urban design]] reasons. Organic urbanization is not organized and happens haphazardly. [[w:Landscape planning|Landscape planners]] are responsible for landscape infrastructure (e.g., [[w:public park|public park]]s, [[w:sustainable urban drainage systems|sustainable urban drainage systems]], [[w:Greenway (landscape)|greenways]], etc.) which can be planned before urbanization takes place, or afterward to revitalize an area and create greater [[w:livability|livability]] within a region. Planned urbanization and development is the aim of the [[w:American Institute of Planners|American Institute of Planners]].

: Pawpaw refers to both the widely distributed tropical fruit Carica papaya, as well as the American fruit, Asimina triloba.  In the US, &quot;pawpaw&quot; is A. triloba.  Outside of the US, pawpaw most likely would refer to C. papaya, although I believe &quot;papaya&quot; is the most common name (globally, for English speakers) for this fruit. I'm going to change &quot;pawpaw&quot; in this article to &quot;papaya&quot;, as I really doubt that A. triloba is the fruit being used in this dish. If A. triloba is in fact the intended fruit, please change it back.  If this defies a regional usage of &quot;pawpaw&quot; for C. papaya, and you are tempted to change it back, please add a note making it clear which fruit is being referred to.

==Clarification==

I'm a bit confused by this key. If you could, maybe add english words with the sounds. Are latin vowels constant? Does I always make the same sound? When is each sound used?



==Inaccuracy==

The table seems to be, grossly inaccurate. I cite http://www.jstor.org/view/00978507/ap020167/02a00150/0 or Allen's Vox Latina as evidence; the IPA representation of the long i is [i:] (triangle colon, of course, not an ordinary one), and similarly with the other Latin vowels; length, not tenseness is the issue. However, I am not sure what the current opinion in the field is, nor have I found any terribly explicit statement either way. I will edit the page when I am more certain.

==Moved from Module Page==

Note: this is very unfinished, but it's late and I'm tired.
To do: clean this up, add diphthongs and digraphs.  Redundancy (pointlessness?) in light of [[w:en:Latin phonemes|wikipedia article]]? Not that one's perfect, but it seems a waste to create two flawed documents rather than synthesize them into a better whole...

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is deadly: &quot;If using thermal paste, apply it only to the CPU die (the square piece of silicon in the middle of the CPU).&quot; First of all, there's no &quot;if&quot; about: thermal paste is compulsory for any CPU that takes a cooler and all modern ones do. Second, and much worse, the CPU surface on which paste goes is the flat metal face that shows after installation, NOT a &quot;piece of silicon in the middle . . . .&quot; The combination of this lingo and the pictures, which don't show the CPU, only the LGA grid, could cause a real disaster. Pictures should show socket with cap, socket open, cpu installed. Made preliminary change, someone with real expertise may want to repair. Also fixed a little grammar, added note on removing paste.

I changed small phillips to #2 phillips since that is more precise and the #2 is really what you want, not #1 which is too small.  If you use #1 you will likely end up stripping the screws and the driver.

----

&quot;and most of this can be averted by choosing a non-conductive floor surface such as floorboards, or tiles. Make sure you don't do this in an unfinished basement!&quot;

I would think you would want a conductive floor surface to help ground out any static charges that might build up. 
:If you see a mistake JUST FIX IT! -CarbonUnit

Also, I've worked in an unfinished basement before... Never had any problems with static.

Some RAM chips do not go in either way

== many faults ==

Many faults in this book:

Power Up: &quot;Then press the power button...&quot; should be double check everything (again) then press the power button...
Expansions and Connections: &quot;Next, close the case and take your computer to where you will be using it.&quot; Don't close the case until the system is confirmed working and that all fans are running, then you can close the case

In general the whole end of the guide is bad. PC building and testing... CPU (and heatsink/fan) -&gt; mainboard... ram -&gt; mainboard... Mainboard -&gt; chassis... video card -&gt; mainboard... power supply -&gt; mainboard and fans... monitor -&gt; video card... keyboard -&gt; mainboard... DO NOT CONNECT ANYTHING ELSE!... double check everything... power on system... wait for POST, if system has hardware monitoring go into the BIOS and check the numbers... unplug system, note that I did not say to power it off with the power button and then unplug it, you need to unplug it to drain the PSU.... Now you can connect your other stuff and then double check everything again and POST the system.

&quot;you should choose an area without carpet on the floor, as carpet tends to attract a lot of static, and most of this can be averted by choosing a non-conductive floor surface such as floorboards, or tiles. Make sure you don't do this in an unfinished basement!&quot;....... non-conductive floor surface WTF are you talking about. YOU WANT A CONDUCTIVE (preferably earth grounded) SURFACE! to prevent any voltage differentials (static) from building up

I'm going to have to rewrite this book and show you how to do it the old school way. My first self built was a 286, I've been doing this as a hobby and professionally for many many years.

== Grounding ==

I believe that regardless of an anti-static mat, that an anti-static strap should always be used, especially if the person is constructing a computer for the first time, I do not however want to change the artcle as I have no cited source to base my oppinion on. You can still damage components on an anti-static mat.

[[User:Tyler.szabo|Tyler.szabo]] 04:21, 24 June 2006 (UTC)yu

:It all depends on the type of anti-static mat, the static charge of the person and the conductivity of the workbench/surfaces in contact with the components. I have always built my own computers from components and never used any anti-static methods, at best I sometimes tried to make sure I gave the chance of any static to discharge before touching the components by contacting a grounded metal structure first.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:21, 15 July 2013 (UTC)

== Sequence of actions ==

Connecting Power supply is said to be the first thing to do. In reality it would obstruct the rest of assembly with its numerous cables hanging around and closing off access to processor. In fact, even mounting motherboard with power supply sitting there is ridiculously hard. The power supply should be installed after motherboard and processor (and fan), but before installing optical disk drive - it may be impossible/hard to connect power cables to motherboard if it is there (not a huge problem, but still). I propose the following sequence:
#Remove the freaking power supply
#Motherboard
#Processor
#Fan
#Memory, Expansion cards
#Power supply
#Connect cables to mb
#HD, CD, FD
#Connect all other cables

That was [[User:Grue|Grue]] 17:16, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

Installing the power supply *first* may not be the best action, but I think *removing* the power supply can be more hassle than it is worth.

I have seen some PC chassis form factors where the power supply blocked access to everything else.
On the other hand, I have been fortunate enough that most of the PC chassis I've worked on have been big enough that there was no overlap. One chassis I worked on has a hinge so that the motherboard would swing down, so you could install the CPU, RAM, etc. far away from the power supply. In those cases, removing the power supply would be an unnecessary hassle.

== images ==
How do I get the pretty image of a &quot;computer screw&quot; in

to show up in this article?

== clean room ==

I removed 

:A clean room is a better place to work on your computer or to build a computer. a type 100 or above is perfict you could use a clean room type 50 for that matter but if oyu want to open your hard drive up use a type 100 clean room..

While yes, a clean room would be adequate, it is overkill for putting together a computer.
Put a computer together in a room filled with cigaretter smoke, and it will work just fine.
Also, opening up a hard drive is not something I would recommend, unless you *want* to destroy it.

== Account Only? ==

Perhaps this should be made account editing only? Unlike most articles, if a vandal got in here and wasn't caught he could do hundreds or thousands of dollars of damage. I will give no examples of type as your average vandal is to lazy to go into much depth and might get bored and turn away, and examples here would tell him how. On the other hand, he/she might get lucky or persistent and get away with something serious.--[[Special:Contributions/70.15.4.226|70.15.4.226]] ([[User talk:70.15.4.226|talk]]) 22:05, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

Cookbook:Grilling is a disambiguation page. This is necessary, because there are at least 3 meanings of this term.

Cookbook:Barbecue follows the dictionary definition. Maybe you'd like to change the English language, but this isn't the place to do it. Go to http://m-w.com/ and look up barbecue please. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:45, 10 May 2005 (UTC)

We wouldn't need a disambiguation page if you didn't keep posting the wrong information.  Also, aren't disambiguation pages are marked 'Disambigusation Page'.  Dictionaries are inferior to encyclopedias, and since we're using Wikibooks, lets use Wikipedia's definition.  Unless ''you'd'' like to rewrite that.  Seriously, check out [[w:Barbecue]] and stop using an incorrect definition. [[User:207.171.167.101|207.171.167.101]] 10 May 2005

I checked it out, and you're still wrong. Why do you believe that &quot;The term barbecue is incorrectly used interchangably with grilling&quot;? Who are ''you'' to say that the most people are incorrect? Language is defined by usage, and so ''you'' are incorrect. If everybody else thinks that barbecuing is cooking with fire, then that's what it means. I'll use a dictionary to determine this, because maybe you wrote the Wikipedia entry. The dictionary agrees with what I've always thought, and what everybody I'd ever met used as the definition. You're the first person I've ever encountered who would defy the dictionary on this.

| I still don’t know what to make of it.  I was riding a public bus from my home in the suburbs to the downtown core of my home town.  Fresh out of college, I had scored a great job with a promising future in bank management, and was looking forward to spending the next few days in training downtown.  There was standing-room only as I grabbed onto the overhead rail towards the back of the bus and held on for the 30 minute ride.  The attractive scents of perfumes and colognes wafted from the men and women dressed in suits, ties, and other business attire.  People practiced the norm of what sociologist [[w:Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman]] called civil inattention: the conscious attempt to study something other than the strangers around you in a crowded space.  All eyes carefully studied the passing scenes of the street through the bus windows or studiously read drug store novels they had brought with them.

Then, “it” happened.  Two strangers, a man and a woman, were occupying the same seat just a few feet ahead of me.  The man, seated next to and looking out the window, suddenly gave out an incomprehensible yell at the top of his lungs that sounded something like:  “HIIIII-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA-YA!”  As he did, he turned his head from looking out of the window to the young woman sitting beside him.  When his yell ended, he simply turned his head again and continued looking out the window.

Me and all of the other passengers were completely dumbfounded.  We had no idea what had just happened or what caused this man to offer the shrill yell that pierced the hazy quiet of our morning bus ride.  What should we do?  I felt for the young woman sitting beside him, who must have died a dozen times while sitting beside him.  What was he going to do next?  Pull out a knife?  Attack the woman or someone else?  Something had to be done.

What happened next was just as fascinating as the man’s scream.  Nothing happened.  Not a thing.  The young woman didn’t move.  People on the bus kept their attention keenly focused on anything other than the man who had just yelled out.  Everyone, acting in concert, simply pretended as if nothing had happened at all!  Total silence and inattention was the collective, conspiratorial response.  I couldn’t believe it.  It wasn’t until years later that I learned that those with Turret’s syndrome sometimes yell out inadvertently.  Was that perhaps what caused the unusual behavior?  And even so, how could it be that all people on the bus would so conspicuously respond by totally ignoring what had just happened?

==Introduction==
The term '''Collective behavior''' refers to social processes and events which do not reflect existing [[w:social structure|social structure]] (laws, conventions, and [[w:institutions|institutions]]), but which emerge in a &quot;spontaneous&quot; way.  Collective behavior might also be defined as action which is neither [[w:Conformity|conforming]] (in which actors follow prevailing [[w:norm|norm]]s) nor [[w:Deviance|deviant]] (in which actors violate those norms).  Collective behavior, a third form of action, takes place when norms are absent or unclear, or when they contradict each other.  Scholars have devoted far less attention to collective behavior than they have to either conformity or deviance.  

Examples of collective behavior include: [[w:Revival meeting|religious revival meetings]] (like those depicted in the documentary [[w:Marjoe|Marjoe]]), a panic in a burning theater (e.g., the Kentucky [[w:Beverly Hills Supper Club fire|Beverly Hills Supper Club fire]]), a sudden widespread interest in a website (e.g., [[w:MySpace|MySpace]]) or clothing item (e.g., [[w:Stephen_Colbert_(character)#Non-fictional_elements|wriststrong bracelets]]), a collective social movement to improve the environment (e.g., [[w:Greenpeace|Greenpeace]]), or the rapid spread of [[w:rumors|rumors]] (e.g., [[w:Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Religion.2C_citizenship.2C_and_loyalty|that Barack Obama is Muslim or not a US citizen]]). These diverse actions fall within the area sociologists call collective behavior. 

Collective behavior differs from ''group'' behavior in three ways:
#collective behavior involves limited and short-lived social interaction while groups tend to remain together longer
#collective behavior has no clear social boundaries; anyone can be a member of the collective while group membership is usually more discriminating
#collective behavior generates weak and unconventional norms while groups tend to have stronger and more conventional norms

Traditionally, collective behavior in sociology includes four forms&lt;ref name=&quot;Blumer1951&quot;&gt;Herbert Blumer, &quot;Collective Behavior,&quot; in A. M. Lee, ed., ''Principles of Sociology,'' New York, Barnes &amp; Noble, 1951, pp. 67-121.&lt;/ref&gt;: the crowd, the public, the mass, and the social movement.  While there is a degree of debate over what should be included under the label of &quot;collective behavior&quot; among sociologists today, often included are additional behaviors like: rumors, riots, trends, and fads.

==Why Study Collective Behavior?== 
Aside from the intrinsic interest of understanding why large groups of people behave the way they do, there are practical reasons why the study of collective behavior is important. Two examples might illustrate the practical importance:

[[File:Who - 1975.jpg|right|thumb|200px| The Who following a performance in 1975.]]

{{quote box|
width 50%|align=center
|quote=&quot;On December 3, 1979, eleven fans were killed by compressive [[w:asphyxia|asphyxia]] and several dozen others injured in the rush for seating at the opening of a sold-out concert by English rock band [[w:The Who|The Who]]. The concert was using &quot;[[w:festival seating|festival seating]]&quot;, (also known as &quot;general seating&quot;), where the best seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Due to the festival seating, many fans arrived early. When the crowds waiting outside heard the band performing a late sound check, they thought that the concert was beginning and tried to rush into the still-closed doors. Some at the front of the crowd were trampled as those pushing from behind were unaware that the doors were still closed. Only a few doors were in operation that night, and there are reports that management did not open more doors due to the concern of people sneaking past the ticket turnstiles.&quot;
}}

Better architectural design and crowd management might have avoided this tragedy. How to redesign buildings and manage crowds are two types of knowledge that can result from the study of collective behavior. Understanding how people behave in riots, what sets them off, and how they can be rapidly concluded is also knowledge that can result from the study of collective behavior.  Additionally, understanding how humans react during natural disasters and ensure that the damage that occurs is entirely a result of the disaster and not the human response to it. 

Another motivation for studying collective behavior is in order to actually change elements of society.  This is the component of collective behavior known as &quot;social movements.&quot;  Again, an example may help illustrate this point:

[[Image:Bloody Sunday-Alabama police attack.jpeg|thumb|right|240px|Police attack civil-rights marchers outside Selma, Alabama, on Bloody Sunday, March 7, 1965.]]

{{quote box|
width 50%|align=center
|quote=&quot;On March 7, 1965, African American leaders led a march of 600 people to walk the 54 miles (87 km) from [[w:Selma|Selma]] to the state capital in Montgomery. Only six blocks into the march, however, state troopers and local law enforcement attacked the peaceful demonstrators with billy clubs, tear gas, rubber tubes wrapped in barbed wire and bull whips. They drove the marchers back into Selma. The national broadcast of the footage of lawmen attacking unresisting marchers seeking the right to vote provoked a national response. Eight days after the first march, [[w:Lyndon Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] delivered a televised address to garner support for the voting rights bill he had sent to Congress. In it he stated:

''But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome.''

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on August 6. The 1965 act suspended [[w:poll taxes|poll taxes]], [[w:literacy tests|literacy tests]] and other subjective voter tests. It authorized Federal supervision of voter registration in states and individual voting districts where such tests were being used. The act had an immediate and positive impact for African Americans. Within months of its passage, 250,000 new black voters had been registered. Within four years, voter registration in the South had more than doubled.&quot;
}}

Understanding how to organize a social movement to pursue social change is one of the areas studied by sociologists. Better understanding how to organize such a movement can provide movement members the tools they need to succeed.

Various forms of collective behavior are examined in detail in the following sections.

==Crowds==
A ''crowd'' is a gathering of people who share a purpose or intent and influence one another. Crowds are a common occurrence in modern life.  Most sporting events, concerts, and other performances result in the gathering of crowds.  Blumer (1951) differentiated four types of crowds:
*casual - loose collection of people with no real interaction (e.g, people at the mall)
*conventional - deliberately planned meeting (e.g., community meeting organized by political leaders)
*expressive - depicts a crowd at an emotionally charged event (e.g., a political rally or soccer game in Europe or Latin America)
*acting - a crowd intent on accomplishing something (e.g., fans rushing a stage during or after a concert)

When crowd behavior is directed toward a specific, violent end, the result is a [[w:ochlocracy|mob]].  Mobs tend to be highly emotional.  Examples of mob violence include the [[w:lynching|lynchings]] in the Southern U.S. during the 19th and 20th centuries.  Violent crowd behavior without a specific goal is a [[w:riot|riot]].  Because riots do not have a specific end, it is assumed that their intention is to express general dissatisfaction.

===Diffuse Crowds===
Collective behavior can also refer to behavior that is diffused or dispersed over large distances.  Not all collective behavior has to occur in the immediate vicinity of others (compact crowds).  This is especially true with the advent of mass media, which allows for the rapid distribution of information around the world.

===Theories of Crowd Behavior===
====Contagion Theory====
Originally proposed by Gustave LeBon (1896), ''contagion theory'' proposes that crowds exert a hypnotic influence on their members.  The hypnotic influence, combined with the anonymity of belonging to a large group of people, results in irrational, emotionally charged behavior.  Or, as the name implies, the frenzy of the crowd is somehow ''contagious'', like a disease, and the contagion feeds upon itself, growing with time.  This also implies that the behavior of a crowd is an emergent property of the people coming together and not a property of the people themselves. 

There are several problems with LeBon's theory.  First, contagion theory presents members of crowds as irrational.  Much crowd behavior, however, is actually the result of rational fear (e.g., being trapped in a burning theater) or a rational sense of injustice (e.g., [[w:2001 Cincinnati Riots|the Cincinnati race riots]]).  Second, crowd behavior is often instigated by and guided by individuals.  That the crowd seems to take on a life of its own is certainly true, but the influence of the individual should not be overlooked.

It is also worth noting that LeBon's book is from the perspective of a frightened aristocrat. He interprets the crowd episodes of the French Revolution as irrational reversions to animal emotion, which he sees as characteristic of crowds in general. Blumer sees crowds as emotional, but as capable of any emotion, not only the negative ones of anger and fear.

====Convergence Theory====
''Convergence theory'' argues that the behavior of a crowd is not an emergent property of the crowd but is a result of like-minded individuals coming together.  In other words, if a crowd becomes violent (a mob or riot), convergence theory would argue that this is not because the crowd encouraged violence but rather because people who wanted to become violent came together in the crowd.

The primary criticism of convergence theory is that there is a tendency for people to do things in a crowd that they would not do on their own.  Crowds have an anonymizing effect on people, leading them to engage in sometimes outlandish behavior.  Thus, while some crowds may result from like-minded individuals coming together to act collectively (e.g., political rally), some crowds actually spur individuals into behavior that they would otherwise not engage in.

====Emergent-Norm Theory====
''Emergent-Norm Theory'' combines the above two theories, arguing that it is a combination of like-minded individuals, anonymity, and shared emotion that leads to crowd behavior.  This theory takes a symbolic interactionist approach to understanding crowd behavior.  It argues that people come together with specific expectations and norms, but in the interactions that follow the development of the crowd, new expectations and norms can emerge, allowing for behavior that normally would not take place.

====Crowds as &quot;Gatherings&quot;====
More recent research into collective behavior has begun to change sociological thinking on crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;&gt;Schweingruber, David S. and Clark McPhail. 1999. A Method for Systematically Observing and Recording Collective Action. Sociological Methods and Research. 27:451-498.&lt;/ref&gt;  This new approach distinguishes what brings people together as a gathering from what they do once gathered.  Most gatherings are temporary and are formed by an assembling process.  Individuals who gather are often acquainted and invited or informed about the gathering.  Once gathered, the subgroups of individuals who already know one another tend to stay together throughout the gathering.  There are, of course, some solitary individuals as well.  

This line of research also dispenses with the idea that crowds impair judgment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;/&gt;  Alcohol and drugs, which can contribute to deviant behavior, certainly can impair judgment and influence the actions of crowds, but crowds themselves do not necessarily impair judgment.  The actions of individuals at gatherings also illustrate that individuals remain independent, sometimes responding to solicitations, sometimes ignoring them, sometimes interacting with their subgroup, and sometimes acting spontaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;/&gt;

Gatherings also exhibit dispersing processes that end the gatherings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweingruber1999&quot;/&gt; Sometimes these are emergency dispersal, as when authorities arrive and try to end the gathering.  Sometimes they are planned or the enthusiasm of the gathering wanes and people simply leave.  Perhaps the key point of the &quot;crowds as gatherings&quot; approach is that there is a great deal of variation in gatherings.

==Panic==
Panic is a sudden terror which dominates thinking and often affects groups of people. Panics typically occur in disaster situations, such as during a fire, and may endanger the overall health of the affected group. Architects and city planners try to accommodate the symptoms of panic, such as herd behavior, during design and planning, often using simulations to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit.

===Moral Panic===
A ''moral panic'' is a mass movement based on the perception that some individual or group, frequently a minority group or a subculture, poses a menace to society. These panics are generally fuelled by media coverage of social issues (although semi-spontaneous moral panics do occur and some moral panics have historically been fueled by religious missions, governmental campaigns, and scientific mobilizing against minority groups that used media outlets to further their claims), and often include a large element of mass hysteria. A moral panic is specifically framed in terms of morality, and usually expressed as outrage rather than unadulterated fear. Though not always, very often moral panics revolve around issues of sex and sexuality. A widely circulated and new-seeming [[w:urban legend|urban legend]] is frequently involved. These panics can sometimes lead to mob violence. The term was coined by Stanley Cohen in 1972 to describe media coverage of [[w:Mods and Rockers|Mods and Rockers]] in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.

Recent moral panics in the UK have included the ongoing tabloid newspaper campaign against pedophiles, which led to the assault and persecution of a pediatrician by an angry, if semi-literate, mob in August 2000, and that surrounding the murder of James Bulger in Liverpool, England in 1993. [[w:moral panic|(See this page for examples of moral panic.)]]

==Riots==
[[File:Protest 0112.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Confrontation between protesters and riot police during a Belizian riot, 2005.]]

A riot is a form of civil disorder characterized by disorganized groups lashing out in a sudden and intense rash of violence, vandalism or other crime. While individuals may attempt to lead or control a riot, riots are typically chaotic and exhibit herd-like behavior. Riots often occur in reaction to a perceived grievance or out of dissent. Historically, riots have occurred due to poor working or living conditions, government oppression, taxation or conscription, conflicts between races or religions, the outcome of a sporting event, or frustration with legal channels through which to air grievances. Riots typically involve vandalism and the destruction of private and public property. The specific property to be targeted varies depending on the cause of the riot and the inclinations of those involved. Targets can include shops, cars, restaurants, state-owned institutions, and religious buildings.

==Mass Hysteria==
''Hysteria'' is a diagnostic label applied to a state of mind, one of unmanageable fear or emotional excesses. People who are &quot;hysterical&quot; often lose self-control due to the overwhelming fear.

The term also occurs in the phrase ''mass hysteria'' to describe mass public near-panic reactions. It is commonly applied to the waves of popular medical problems that ''everyone gets'' in response to news articles, such as the [[w:yuppy flu|yuppy flu]] of the late 1980s. A similar usage refers to any sort of ''public wave'' phenomenon, and has been used to describe the periodic widespread reappearance and public interest in UFO reports, crop circles, and similar examples. 

Hysteria is often associated with movements like the [[w:Salem Witch Trials|Salem Witch Trials]], [[w:Red Scare|the Red Scare]], [[w:McCarthyism|McCarthyism]], and [[w:Satanic ritual abuse|Satanic ritual abuse]], where it is better understood through the related sociological term of ''moral panic''.

Mass hysterias can also exhibit themselves in the sudden onset of [[w:psychogenic|psychogenic]] illnesses, or illnesses that are the result of psychology and not an external source (e.g., like a pollutant or infectious agent).  A recent example of psychogenic illness resulting from mass hysteria occurred in [[w:Jilin|Jilin]], China in 2009 when hundreds of workers at an acrylic yarn factory began to fall ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacobs2009&quot;&gt;Jacobs, Andrew. 2009. “Chinese Workers Say Illness Is Real, Not Hysteria.” The New York Times, July 30 http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/30/world/asia/30jilin.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss (Accessed July 30, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  Doctors in China determined that, for most of those who fell ill, there were no physical indications of poisoning, which is what the workers claimed caused the illness.

==Fads==
A fad, also known as a craze, refers to a fashion that becomes popular in a culture (or subcultures) relatively quickly, remains popular, often for a rather brief period, then loses popularity dramatically. ([[w:fad|See this page for a list of fads.]])

==Rumors==
A '''rumor''' is often viewed as &quot;an unverified account or explanation of events circulating from person to person and pertaining to an object, event, or issue in public concern&quot; (p. 33)&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1951&quot;&gt;Peterson, Warren, and Noel Gist. 1951. Rumor and Public Opinion. The American Journal of Sociology. 57(2):159-167.&lt;/ref&gt;, though the definition can vary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendleton1998&quot;&gt;Pendleton, S.C. (1998), 'Rumor research revisited and expanded', Language &amp; Communication, vol. 1. no. 18, pp. 69-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumors generally involve some kind of a statement the veracity of which is not quickly or ever confirmed.

Rumors have three basic characteristics 
#they're transmitted by word of mouth
#they provide &quot;information&quot; about a person, happening, or condition
#they express and gratify the emotional needs of the community 

There are also various types of rumors, including:
#Pipe dream rumors, which reflect public desires and wished-for outcomes
#Bogie or fear rumors that reflect feared outcomes
#Wedge-driving rumors that intend to undermine group loyalty or interpersonal relations

As rumors travel they grow shorter, more concise, and more easily grasped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allport1951&quot;&gt;Allport, Gordon, and Joseph Postman. 1947. Psychology of Rumor. Russell and Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;  About 70% of details in a message are lost in the first 5 to 6 transmissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allport1951&quot;/&gt;  Negative rumors are more likely to be disseminated than positive rumors.

Rumors may be part of a collective explanation process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordia2004&quot;&gt;Bordia, Prashant, and Nicolas DiFonzo. 2004. Problem Solving in Social Interactions on the Internet: Rumor as Social Cognition. Social Psychology Quarterly. 61(1):33-49.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Bordia and DiFonzo found that 29.4% of statements on archived internet message boards are sensemaking statements that attempt to solve problems.  The rest of the discussion revolves around these statements.

[[File:ObamaSouthCarolina.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Two prominent rumors about Barack Obama circulated during his 2008 Presidential Campaign, that he was not born in the U.S. and that he is Muslim.]]

Rumors may also be political communication strategies. Media and particular cultural-historical conditions may facilitate a rumor's diffusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harsin2006&quot;&gt;Harsin, Jayson. 2006. The Rumour Bomb: Theorising the Convergence of New and Old Trends in Mediated US Politics. Southern Review: Communication, Politics &amp; Culture. 39(1):84-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, Jayson Harsin introduced the concept of the &quot;rumor bomb&quot; to describe the widespread phenomenon of rumoresque communication in contemporary relations between media and politics, especially within the complex convergence of multiple forms of media, from cell phones and internet, to radio, TV, and print. Harsin treats rumor as a particular rhetorical strategy. For Harsin a &quot;rumor bomb&quot; extends the definition of rumor into a political communication concept with the following features:
#A crisis of verification. A crisis of verification is perhaps the most salient and politically dangerous aspect of rumor.
#A context of public uncertainty or anxiety about a political group, figure, or cause, which the rumor bomb overcomes or transfers onto an opponent. 
#A clearly partisan even if an anonymous source (eg. &quot;an unnamed advisor to the president&quot;), which seeks to profit politically from the rumor bomb’s diffusion. 
#A rapid diffusion via highly developed electronically mediated societies where news travels fast.  

Examples of rumors include:
*the alleged removal of weapons of mass destruction from Iraq to Syria&lt;ref name=&quot;NYSUN&quot;&gt;http://www.nysun.com/foreign/saddams-wmd-moved-to-syria-an-israeli-says/24480/&lt;/ref&gt;
*sexual innuendo in [[w:The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film)#Controversy|The Little Mermaid]] adaptation by Disney
*sexual innuendo in [[w:The_Lion_King#Alleged_subliminal_messaging|The Lion King]], another Disney film
*sexual innuendo in [[w:Aladdin_(1992_film)#Controversies|Aladdin]], another Disney film
*that John McCain had an illegitimate black child &lt;ref name=&quot;BostonGlobe2004&quot;&gt;http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/&lt;/ref&gt;
*that Barack Obama is a [[w:Barack_Obama_presidential_primary_campaign,_2008#Obama.27s_name|Muslim]] and [[w:Barack_Obama_citizenship_conspiracy_theories|was not born in the U.S.]]

ISBN 0697075257&lt;/ref&gt; uses [[w:game Theory|game theory]] to suggest that even a panic in a burning theater can reflect rational calculation: If members of the audience decide that it is more rational to run to the exits than to walk, the result may look like an animal-like stampede without in fact being irrational. In a series of empirical studies of assemblies of people, McPhail (1991)&lt;ref name=&quot;McPhail1991&quot;&gt;McPhail, Clark. 1991. The Myth of the Madding Crowd. .Aldine. ISBN 0202303756&lt;/ref&gt; argues that crowds vary along a number of dimensions, and that traditional stereotypes of emotionality and unanimity often do not describe what happens in crowds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Network Plus Certification/Header|cur=Introduction|next_url=Objectives|next=Exam Objectives}}

The Network+ Exam is just one exam, and for those who took it before January 1st, 2011, it never expires. (Those taking the test after that date must either retake it at a set interval or submit proof of their continuing education in networking. The COMPTIA website has more details.) It has 100 multiple-choice &quot;situational and identification&quot; questions. Basically, if you know your hardware and software, as well as know what to do in a given situation, you should pass. You are given 90 minutes to take the exam, which should be plenty if you are fully prepared. It's recommended by CompTIA that you already have an A+ Certification under your belt and at least nine months networking experience, but the only prerequisite for taking the exam is paying the exam fee ($240 US). Minimum passing score is 720 on a scale of 100-900, but that doesn't really mean what you think it means: some questions are worth more than others. The test is available in English, German, Japanese and Korean.

While the A+ certification is definitely an industry standard and a prerequisite for many jobs, the Network+ is less so, but gaining in popularity. 

The goals of the Network+ Certification is to ensure that employers hire people who will not need to be trained in network fundamentals before being hired. A Network+ Certified tech should be able to make recommendations for installing or expanding a network, document and perform preventative maintenance on a network, and troubleshoot network problems as they arise. Having an A+ and Network+ Certification ''should'' mean that you are fully capable of being an on-site technical support person, a network administrator of a local area network, or a valuable asset to an enterprise-level networking team, but not exactly be running it.

==Scope of this Wikibook==

The scope of this book is to provide a solid foundation for network administration. It should include all of the information that is needed to pass the CompTIA Network+ Exam, and match its scope. In fact, the finished product ''should'' look like the official CompTIA Network+ exam objectives, but expanded with more information and explanation.

==Structure of this Wikibook==

This &quot;book&quot; is not a &quot;book&quot; per se, but rather a few introductory pages and, more importantly, a study guide with a collection of links to articles in Wikipedia and the most relevant information summarized for each concept. The reason for this is twofold: there is no need to &quot;re-invent the wheel&quot; when there are so many great articles that serve the purpose of explaining, say, the [[wikipedia:OSI model|OSI model]]. Two, a  person interested in this &quot;book&quot; is one that wants to take and pass the Network+ Exam, and this method may be better suited to them than a traditional book, allowing them to quickly review concepts just before the exam or delve into the details of anything not immediately familiar. 

==Exam overview==

The objectives of the Network+ exam are broken down into 6 categories: 

;[[Network Plus Certification/Technologies|Network Technologies]]
:Understand the protocols used over a network and the ports they use, the addressing systems used on a network, and how a network can be implemented via wireless technologies.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Media and Topologies|Network Media and Topologies]]
:Identify cables and connectors used to network computers together, understand the various manners in which a network can be physically laid out, and have knowledge of the standards used for communication within a network and between networks.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Devices|Network Devices]]
:Differentiate between the various devices used on a network and understand their function, installation, and configuration.  Have deeper knowledge of the functions of a switch and the factors to consider when setting up a wireless network.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Management|Network Management]]
:Understand the different conceptual layers in the networking model, the need for proper network documentation, the process of troubleshooting network problems, and the options for increasing network performance.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Tools|Network Tools]]
:Be aware of the command line, software, and hardware tools available for installation, testing, and troubleshooting networks.
;[[Network Plus Certification/Security|Network Security]]
:Know what hardware devices, software, and policies will ensure the security of the data and devices on a network and be aware of the corresponding threats they are designed to guard against.  Have knowledge of the methods users can use to securely access a network and how their identities can be verified before granting access in the first place.

# mussolini's agression was not necessarily 'foolish' - in principle it could have been bold and daring - he just didn't have the calibre and quantity of troops, mechanized divisions etc.
# battle of britian and russia - hitler had always been planning agression against the soviets. The whole idea of invading france after a pact with stalin was to avoid a war on two fronts. His plan was to sweep over western europe, including britain if he had to. His long term goal was always to invade russia, he didn't 'then turn to russia' after failing to conquer britain. After all, they were idealogical enemies. He greatly respected the british (a dubious honour for us), and didn't have any huge desire to invade them - that was arguably to prove his downfall. He never turned the full might of germany's war machine against the island. God knows what would have happened had he done so.
# &quot;The Worldwide Great Depression&quot; was naturally worldwide - that, in my experience, has always been taken as given. Is 'worldwide' really necessary? I have always read it simply as &quot;The Great Depression&quot;

The pacific theatre headings don't seem to cover the Burma campaign at all. Although I say US bias, I believe that there was US involvment there as well. In the UK it is often called the forgotten war. --[[User:David Woolley|David Woolley]] 13:53, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

'''Pan frying''' is [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] in a [[Cookbook:Pots and Pans|pan]]. Typically it implies that a [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] is used with either no oil or a 'shallow' amount of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]], compared to the depth of the food being fried.

When pan frying, the amount of oil in the frying pan can range from absolutely no oil (especially when the foods to be fried contain fat or oil), to an amount of oil that comes slightly up the side of the food being fried.  

Generally, quite a bit less than the bottom 1/3, up to 1/2, of the food will be in oil. The amount of oil is less that used in [[cookbook:deep frying|deep frying]], where the food is at least half, to completely immersed, in oil.

Pan frying can be similar to [[cookbook:sautéing|sautéing]], but in sautéing only the slightest amount of oil is always used and the ingredients are intended to be tossed or stirred while cooking.

One might distinguish pan frying from sautéing, stir frying, and deep frying in that, in pan frying, the food is not necessarily intended to be frequently stirred around, or turned repeated, but, rather, turned only once or twice during cooking.</text>

'''Red Pepper''' is an ambiguous term. It could be referring to...

*ripe [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|bell peppers]]
*powdered dried [[Cookbook:Cayenne Pepper|Cayenne peppers]]
*whole red [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|chili peppers]] (generally hot ones)
*pizza pepper, a seasoning made from large flakes of chili peppers and other peppers and typically available at pizza restaurants

      <text xml:space="preserve">A minor problem with 'Algebraic Operations on Sequences'

I believe that there is a problem with the 4th result (about quotient of 2 limits)
I reckon it is not enough that y_n is non-zero for all n, but believe that we also need to assume that the limit of the y's is also nonzero. Otherwise there would exist a counter-example where the y_n are alternatively positive and negative, while tending to zero.

Does anyone agree?

Yes, your correct, and now the article assumes the limit is not zero, but allows some of the y_n's to be zero. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:41, 5 January 2009 (UTC)


==Completeness==
There seems to be a general confusion here about the differences between the least upper bound property and completeness.  In particular some of the theorems stated are not equivalent to the least upper bound axiom, and hence could not be used as an axiom defining the real numbers. I think we should be a bit more careful about how we use the term completeness.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 15:45, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

The challenge in understanding limits is not in its definition, but rather in its execution. Successfully completing a limit proof, using the epsilon-delta definition, involves learning many different concepts at once—most of which will be unfamiliar coming out from earlier mathematics. This chapter will serve as a guide in navigating these proofs, as the skills here will serve you well in higher mathematics.

==Definition==
The definition of a limit, in ordinary real analysis, is notated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;

One way to conceptualize the definition of a limit, and one which you may have been taught, is this:  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; means that we can make f(x) as close as we like to L by making x close to c. However, in real analysis, you will need to be rigorous with your definition—and we have a standard definition for a limit.

The notation of a limit is actually a shorthand for this expression:

{{TextBox|'''Definition of &quot;ƒ approaches the limit L near c&quot;'''&lt;hr/&gt;Given a function ƒ; a limit ''L''; and an approaching value ''c'', &amp;forall;ε &gt; 0, there &amp;exist;δ &gt; 0 such that &amp;forall;''x'', &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; |x - c| &lt; \delta \implies |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.}}

This definition gives a lot of people a lot of trouble, but since it is so fundamental to higher mathematics, there are many ways to help solidify the definition down. This chapter will be a guide in solidifying the behavior of this definition and provide necessary insight into working with the definition, whereas the [[Real_Analysis/Limits_and_Continuity_Exercises|Exercises]] will help unravel the puzzle, solidify the concept, and enable you to execute this definition properly.

==Corollaries of Limits==
[[File:Limit-at-infinity-graph.png|thumb|alt=A graph which has a hump in the beginning, then a smaller valley, as it tapers off.|A graphical example of a function converging to a limit as it approaches infinity]]

It is very common, given limits, to work with the concept of infinity. However, the concept of infinity has yet to be well defined. Intuitively, we know that infinity represents endlessness and it is represented as {{math|∞|size=1.2em}}. Yet, infinity itself is not a number. The current limit definition will fail if we use infinity like a number. If you suppose some limit where {{math|size=1.2em|c &amp;#61; ∞}} and we use our original definition, it would mean that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;means that&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\forall M&gt;0: \exists \delta : 0 &lt; |x - \infty| &lt; \delta \implies |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;

Which is clearly nonsense!
# You cannot &quot;subtract by infinity&quot; - infinity isn't a number nor is it really a variable.
# Infinity cannot be bounded, yet by putting infinity in a &lt;math&gt;|a - b| &lt; x&lt;/math&gt; format, it implies boundedness.

So, the definition needs to be rewritten, which is done in the following chart. The definitions for when either the limit as ''x'' ''approaches'' positive or negative infinity; or the limit as ƒ(x) ''converges'' to positive or negative infinity are as follows:

{{Helpful hint|title=Note|hint=Yes, the ''approaching'' and ''converging'' distinction is important. You can look at it as either referencing the delta or the epsilon, respectively.}}

Take a note of the following variables:
# ''N'' usually notates a limit with infinity and is analogous to ε.
# ''M'' usually notates a limit with infinity and is analogous to δ.
We only use big ''N'' and ''M'' because the connotation associated with ε and δ is that they are small numbers. Big ''N'' and ''M'' has the opposite connotation.

==Conceptualization==
[[File:Límite 01.svg|thumb|The concept of a limit: Whenever a point x is within δ units of c, f(x) is within ε units of L.]]

#For all ε, only it, the ε variable, will be used to derive a δ.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This powerful statement basically states that δ is related to ε. To excuse mathematically rigorous language for a moment, δ can be imagined of like a function which outputs ε. This is actually important, as '''neither δ or ε are allowed to have variables, such as ''x'', be part of their formulation.'''&lt;/p&gt;
#ε and δ are supposed to represent bounds.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence the absolute value signs. They are mathematically equivalent to writing &lt;math&gt;-\delta &lt; x - c &lt; \delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\epsilon&lt; f(x) - L &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, which exemplifies their bound-like nature a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
#This limit definition is designed to ignore the value of f(c) and whether or not c is even in the domain of ƒ.&lt;!--
--&gt;&lt;p&gt;The requirement &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; provides the appeal in studying calculus, by removing the technicality of having to analyze the behavior at the point (which is usually undefined to begin with).  It is the mathematical implementation of the idea that the behavior of a function '''near''' a point shouldn't be affected by its behavior '''at''' the point.  Thus, f(x) need not be defined at c to have a limit there.&lt;/p&gt;

==Properties==
Given that limits are such a fundamental concept of calculus, it should be reasonable to expect that limits should have some intriguing properties to both warrant analysis as well as be a staple mathematical topic in both elementary, applied, and higher mathematics.

===Uniqueness===
A limit is ''unique'', in that there is always one and only one answer if the input is the same. This is commonly rephrased as &quot;a function cannot approach two different limits at ''c''&quot;. Limits having unique answers is very important, since if they don't, the use of limits will grow so complex that it will simply become unusable.

{{TextBox|'''Theorem'''
----
Suppose a function ''ƒ'' such that the limit as ''x'' approaches ''c'' converges to ''L''. If the limit of ''ƒ'' as it approaches ''c'' also converges to ''M'', then ''L'' &amp;#61; ''M''}}

===Algebraic Operations===
If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}g(x) = M&lt;/math&gt;, then:

By applying the corresponding theorems for sequential limits, we find that functional limits are both unique—they preserve algebraic operations and ordering—and that a corresponding &quot;Squeeze Theorem&quot; holds.

* If &lt;math&gt;\exists \delta: f(x) &gt; g(x) \forall x \in A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;L &gt; M&lt;/math&gt;.

* &lt;math&gt;L=M, f(x) \leq h(x) \leq g(x) \implies \lim_{x \rightarrow c}h(x) = L&lt;/math&gt;

* If L = 0 and h(x) is bounded, then  &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)h(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof====
For the various operations, the following proofs may require more or less knowledge of algebraic inequality manipulation.

=====Addition=====
Of the operations, the proof for addition is the most simple, as it relies on the least amount of inequality algebra.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof of Limit Addition'''
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | Suppose the limit of two functions ƒ and g as x approaches c. The equations will be as follows.
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta_1 \implies |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon_1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta_2 \implies |g(x) - M| &lt; \epsilon_2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Since both epsilon-delta descriptions reference the same variables ''x'' and ''c'' in {{math|size=1.2| &amp;#124;x - c&amp;#124;}}, we can combine both equations by ensuring the smallest bound is used in both inequalities (since the bound range will be true for both), through the {{math|size=1.2|min}} function.
| &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta_1 \text{ and } |x - c| &lt; \delta_2 \implies &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; |x - c| &lt; \delta = min(\delta_1, \delta_2) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Because, due to the constraints placed on δ, it is the case that the previous expression, by definition because of our statement that it is a limit, must imply the epsilon expression. However, since the previous expression encompasses both epsilons, it now implies both epsilons simultaneously.
| &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta = min(\delta_1, \delta_2) \implies &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon_1 \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \epsilon_2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| It should also be the case that, given that the entire delta expression is shared, that the epsilon value bounding both functions ƒ and g can also be bounded using the same epsilon. Specifically, an epsilon half as small as what you think of.
| &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon_1 \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \epsilon_2 \implies &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; |f(x) - L| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| We cannot force the epsilon inequalities together like we did for the delta inequalities because the variables in the absolute sign are not the same and thus do not represent the same variable. However, we know that {{math|size=1.2em|a + c &lt; b + d}} ([[Real_Analysis/Section_1_Exercises#Inequalities|Problem 1.II]]) and that {{math|size=1.2em|&amp;#124;x + y&amp;#124; &amp;le; &amp;#124;x&amp;#124; + &amp;#124;y&amp;#124;}} ([[Real_Analysis/Section_1_Exercises#Absolutes|Problem 1.I]]), so we can combine those two epsilon inequalities to form
| &lt;math&gt;|f(x) - L| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} \implies &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|f(x) - L| + |g(x) - M| &amp;&lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
|f(x) - L + g(x) - M| &amp;&lt; \epsilon \\
|(f(x) + g(x)) - (L + M)| &amp;&lt; \epsilon
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| The final statement can be expressed, using limit notation, as
| &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta \implies |(f(x) + g(x)) - (L + M)| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \text{ means } \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{f(x) + g(x)} = L + M &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt; \blacksquare &lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====Subtraction=====
Subtraction follows from the addition proof by imagining a function ''h'' that is the negation of the function ''g'' beforehand. In other words, imagine the function ''g'' in the proof as a variable for a negated function.

&lt;p align=right&gt;&lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=====Multiplication=====
Of the operations, the proof for multiplication is the most complex, as it relies on the greatest amount of inequality algebra. It also requires a seemingly contrived lemma to operate. We will start by proving the lemma, which is simply an algebraic relationship between inequalities, similar to that of the binomial theorem relates a summation of terms and a product.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Lemma Proof'''
| style=&quot;width: 10em;&quot; | The lemma states that
| &lt;math&gt;\text{If } |a - c| &lt; \min\left(1, \frac{x}{2(|d| + 1)}\right) \text{ and } |b - d| &lt; \frac{x}{2(|c| + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{then } |ab - cd| &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;, for any number ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d''; and ''x'' &gt; 0.

|-
| Then, rephrase the main function so that it will allow substitution.
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}|ab - cd| &amp;= |a(b - d) + d(a - c)| \\ &amp;\le |a||b - d| + |d||a - c| \\ &amp;&lt; (1 + |c|) \cdot \frac{x}{2(|c| + 1)} + |d| \cdot \frac{x}{2(|d| + 1)} \\ &amp;&lt; \frac{x}{2} + \frac{|d|}{|d| + 1} \cdot \frac{x}{2} \\ &amp;&lt; \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} \\ &amp;&lt; x \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As you can see, the lemma itself describes a simple to prove and &lt;u&gt;valid&lt;/u&gt;, yet very contrived and unnatural-looking relationship between numbers. But, this relationship is very attractive to be applied blindly for limits, because any value of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' inputted (even 0's) works, and that ''x'' &gt; 0 is a condition that matches the ε variable.

As you will see below, we will apply this lemma for multiplication.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof of Limit Multiplication'''
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | Suppose the limit of two functions ƒ and g as x approaches c. The equations will be as follows.
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta_1 \implies |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon_1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta_2 \implies |g(x) - M| &lt; \epsilon_2 &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Since both epsilon-delta descriptions reference the same variables ''x'' and ''c'' in {{math|size=1.2| &amp;#124;x - c&amp;#124;}}, we can combine both equations by ensuring the smallest bound is used in both inequalities (since the bound range will be true for both), through the {{math|size=1.2|min}} function.
| &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &lt; \delta_1 \text{ and } |x - c| &lt; \delta_2 \implies &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; |x - c| &lt; \delta = \min(\delta_1, \delta_2) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Now, supposing that ε's equate to the following formulas, you can see that the epsilons are numerical in nature, so that the original function bears no relationship (which is good), and that they now are of the same form and condition of the lemma previously proved above (As a reminder, the epsilon value for the limit of ƒ and g individually need not equal epsilon, but the end result should).
| &lt;math&gt; |f(x) - L| &lt; \min\left(1, \frac{\epsilon}{2(|M| + 1)}\right) \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2(|L| + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\because |x - c| &lt; \delta = \min(\delta_1, \delta_2) \implies &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon_1 \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \epsilon_2&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Therefore, you can apply the lemma to state that the relationship has been proven.
| &lt;math&gt; |f(x) - L| &lt; \min\left(1, \frac{\epsilon}{2(|M| + 1)}\right) \text{ and } |g(x) - M| &lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2(|L| + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\implies |(f(x)g(x) - LM| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \text{which means } \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{f(x)g(x)} = LM &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====Multiple=====
The proof for multiples of some function ƒ follow from the proof on multiplication. It however relies on the limit of a constant proof. Because of the proofs reliance on two previous proofs and that those proofs this one relies on are robust (they account for things like 0's), this proof is just as robust, even working when ''a'' = 0.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof of Limit Multiple'''
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | Given a function ƒ and a constant ''a'', the limit can be simplified first using the multiple of the limit, then using the limit of a constant function.
| &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{(a \cdot f(x))} &amp;= \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{a} \cdot \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{f(x)} \\ &amp;= a \cdot \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{f(x)} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====Reciprocal=====
Of the operations, the proof for the reciprocal is similar to that of multiplication. It too requires a seemingly contrived relationship between some mathematical statements in order to function, and relies on the argument that the formula or concepts attached to assuring that epsilon and delta's boundedness is maintained is what defines a valid limit. Anyways, let us begin with the &quot;contrived relationship&quot;.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Lemma Proof'''
| style=&quot;width: 10em;&quot; | The lemma states that
| &lt;math&gt;\text{If } b \ne 0 \text{ and } |a - b| &lt; \min\left(\frac{|b|}{2}, \frac{x|b|^2}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{then } a \ne 0 \text{ and } \left|\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}\right| &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;, for any number ''a'', and ''b''.
|-
| The first part is to break the min function into two cases. The first case can be simplified in this manner.
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} |a - b| &amp;&lt; \frac{|b|}{2} \\ |b| - |a| \le |b - a| = |a - b| &amp;&lt; \frac{|b|}{2} \\ \frac{|b|}{2} - |a| &amp;&lt; 0 \\ \frac{|b|}{2} &amp;&lt; |a| \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Asserting that ''a'' will not equal 0 (''a'' &amp;ne; 0), the reciprocal definition can be asserted for the inequality
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \frac{|b|}{2} &amp;&lt; |a| \\ \frac{|b|}{2|a|} &amp;&lt; 1 \\ \frac{1}{|a|} &amp;&lt; \frac{2}{|b|} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Focusing back onto the end goal inequality statement, we will now apply both the second case and the fact we have just derived to reach our conclusion.
| style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \left|\frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}\right| &amp;= \left|\frac{b - a}{ab}\right| \\ &amp;= \frac{|b - a|}{|ab|} \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{|a|} \cdot \frac{|b - a|}{|b|} \\ &amp;&lt; \frac{2}{|b|} \cdot \frac{x|b|^2}{2|b|} \\ &amp;&lt; x \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As you can see, the lemma itself describes a simple to prove and &lt;u&gt;valid&lt;/u&gt;, yet very contrived and unnatural-looking relationship between numbers. But, this relationship is very attractive to be applied blindly for limits, because any value of ''a'', and ''b'' inputted (not including 0's) works, and that ''x'' &gt; 0 is a condition that matches the ε variable.

As you will see below, we will apply this lemma for the reciprocal. Note that the proof is a simple assertion statement.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof of Limit for Reciprocals'''
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | Given a limit of the reciprocal of the function ƒ, we can assert that epsilon's relationship is like the lemma proven in the previous table. From there, you can draw the same conclusion.
| &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; |x - c| &lt; \delta \implies |f(x) - L| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \text{Assert } \epsilon = \min\left(\frac{|L|}{2}, \frac{\epsilon|L|^2}{2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; |f(x) - L| &lt; \min\left(\frac{|b|}{2}, \frac{x|b|^2}{2}\right) \implies \left|\frac{1}{f(x)} - \frac{1}{L}\right| &lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====Division=====
The proof for division of the function ƒ by g is a corollary based on the proof done for limits of multiplication and limits of reciprocals.

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof of Limit Division'''
| style=&quot;width: 20em;&quot; | Given a function ƒ and g, the limit can be expressed as a multiplication between the denominator and the reciprocal of the numerator. From there, the result is as depicted.
| &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}} &amp;= \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{f(x)} \cdot \lim_{x \rightarrow c}{\frac{1}{g(x)}} \\ &amp;= L \cdot \frac{1}{M} \\ &amp;= \frac{L}{M} \end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| colspan=2 align=right | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

As always, this proof has the obvious restriction that ''M'' cannot be 0.

===Limits of Functions===
Here, we will prove the answers to many of the functions you may commonly see. As always, the following chart for quick recall is provided below.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|+ List of Algebraic Operations for Limits
! Name
! colspan=2 | Meaning
|-
| Constant
| colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{a} = a&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Linear
| colspan=2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{z} = c&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that for the linear function, we used ''z'' instead of the usual ''x'' because the variable name ''x'' is already defined and is being used by the limit notation.

===Limits of Sequences===
{{Helpful_hint|title=Note|hint=The following heading requires knowledge of [[Real_Analysis/Sequences|Sequences]].}}

Consider the sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_n) = (\frac{1}{n}), (y_n = (\frac{-1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;.  Each converges to zero, but &lt;math&gt;(f(x_n)) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(f(y_n)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and these have different limits as &lt;math&gt;n \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus the limit does not exist.

===Limits of Discontinuity===
{{Helpful_hint|title=Note|hint=The following heading requires knowledge of [[Real_Analysis/Continuity|Continuity]].}}

We'll be giving many more examples in the section on continuity. Although discontinuity is more sensibly important using continuity (which is covered in the [[Real_Analysis/Continuity|next chapter]]), the definition of discontinuity is actually defined in regards to limits.

====Point Discontinuity====
An example of point discontinuity would be the functions

: Example 1&lt;div style=&quot;display:inline; padding-left:2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x) =
\begin{cases}
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x = 0 \\
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x \not= 0 \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
: Example 2&lt;div style=&quot;display:inline; padding-left:2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{x(x-1)}{x-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For the following functions,

: Example 1&lt;div style=&quot;display:inline; padding-left:2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
: Example 2&lt;div style=&quot;display:inline; padding-left:2em;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 1} f(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The proof of which is the following:

====Jump Discontinuity====

* Let &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
0 &amp; \mbox{if }x\leq 0 \\
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x &gt; 0 \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;  does not exist.

====Asymptotic Discontinuity====

===Limits of Unusual Functions===
Many of the examples here may seem a bit contrived and appear quite nasty, with even more nastier proofs, but if done correctly, these examples (and the associating exercises) will solidify not only the methodology of a limit proof, but of how mathematics can, using verified theorems and behaviors, solve some seemingly unsolvable problems.

Our first example, often given as a demonstration of just how nasty functions can get (and how far a definition can take you), is

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
1/q &amp; \mbox{if }x \text{ is rational, and thus } x = p/q \\
0 &amp; \mbox{else} \\
\end{cases}, \forall x \in (0, 1)
&lt;/math&gt;

For the function ƒ, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all numbers in the domain. Yes, really.

The first step in understanding the proof of this statement is to stop imagining limits and continuity as the same - that is, if the first step of this problem is to imagine the graph of this function and in a sense, zoom in until an answer can be deduced graphically. Do not be saddened if this is how you thought about how to work out this problem; this method is a simplified explanation of limits commonly taught in elementary mathematics and would thus be ingrained in you anyways.

This proof demonstrates a method of mathematical proof through manipulating theorems instead of manipulating numbers or variables to form the epsilon-delta model, which in turn implies the limit's validity; the existence of a limit. It also shows how a limit proof is actually an exercise in trying to relate two easily malleable inequalities together using valid theorems.

{| style=&quot;margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;&quot;
|+ '''Proof that the limit equals 0'''
|-
| Assert the definition of a limit is valid by validating (through derivation) of each aspect. First, we can assume ε &gt; 0 as it is also assumed in the limit definition. We can also use the approaching number ''c'', the limit ''l'', and the function ƒ. From here, we will assign another variable ''n'' in relation to epsilon, as depicted in the adjacent column.
| &lt;math&gt;n &gt; {1}/{\epsilon} \implies \epsilon &gt; 1/n&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
# Now, suppose the set ''S'' composing of every rational number greater than 0, less than 1, and whose denominator cannot exceed ''n''. These requirements are commonly depicted as the set represented to the left (although this particular depiction is more-so used as an example of a set whose elements cannot equal one another).
# Plus, we will add the clause that if ''c'' is a rational number, it won't be in this set either. The explanation of this clause will come later.
| &lt;math&gt;S = \left\{\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}, ..., \frac{1}{n}, ..., \frac{n - 1}{n}\right\} \backslash \{c\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| From here, the property that this set is finite is apparent through the set &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;'s enumeration definition (it is mathematically shown because the set is bounded through the numerator, denominator, and combination of numerator and denominator). This set, as it is a set, also contains a unique list of numbers. From here, you can find some number ''k'' with the following property. In other words, you can find the smallest distance.
| &lt;math&gt;\exists k \in S : |k - c| \text{ is minimized}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
# We will define the variable ''δ'' as the following. This implies the following relationship.
# From here, you can see why the set cannot have the variable ''c'' in it. If it is in there, the delta relationship will be broken and thus our proof. Thus, we removed it from play, and in effect, we will always have some non-zero δ.
| &lt;math&gt;\delta = |k - c| \implies 0 &lt; |x - c| &lt; |k - c| = \delta&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| The consequence of this definition is not just that ''x'' must be less than ''k''. If ''x'' is irrational, then the method of deriving a delta from an epsilon value though a proxy variable ''n'' is valid and that the following limit interpretation is also valid.
| &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; |x - c| &lt; |k - c| = \delta \implies |f(x) - 0| = 0 &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 1/n&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Likewise, if ''x'' is rational, then ''x'' cannot be a member of the set ''S'' by definition and therefore means that the method of deriving a delta from an epsilon value though a proxy variable ''n'' is valid and that the following limit interpretation is also valid.
| &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; |x - c| &lt; |k - c| = \delta \implies |f(x) - 0| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 1/n&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; colspan=2 | &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The next example, of a similar vein, is

{{Helpful_hint|title=Note|hint=This function is also [[Real_Analysis/Continuity|not continuous]] at any point of its domain.}}

:&lt;math&gt;g(x) = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \mbox{if }x \in \mathbb{Q} \\
0 &amp; \mbox{else} \\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

For the function ''g'', &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c} g(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist for any &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given &lt;math&gt;x \in R&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be any rational number in the interval &lt;math&gt;(\frac{-1}{n},\frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; be any irrational number in the same interval (&lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt; are gauranteed to exist by density of the rationals and irrationals).  Given any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0, |x_n - 0| &lt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y_n - 0| &lt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;(x_n),(y_n) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.  However, (g(x_n)) = 1 and (g(y_n)) = 0, so their limits are 1 and 0.  Since these are not equal, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{y\rightarrow x} g(y)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

==Appendix==
Here, we will expose more topics in regards to limits. First, we will give a review on the nature of functions. Recall that a function from a set X to a set Y is a mapping &lt;math&gt;f: X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; such that f(x) is a unique element of Y for every &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.  In analysis, we tend to talk about functions from subsets &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

The definition for the limit of a function is much the same as the definition for a sequence.  In fact, as we will see later, it is possible to define functional limits in terms of sequential limits.  For the moment, however, let us reevaluate the definition of a limit for a function ƒ given a generalized-enabled function:

Given a subset &lt;math&gt;A \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0: \exists \delta: 0&lt;|x-c|&lt;\delta \implies |f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

===Sequential Limits===
One curious result of thinking about real numbers as built upon natural numbers and the like (as we have structured our section on numbers in this wikibook) is that the definition of a limit, which we have used the real number version for real functions all this time, can be derived using sequential limits instead of axiomatically, as so:

Given a subset &lt;math&gt;A \subset \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;f:A\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, we say &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = L&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall (x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_n \not= c, \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(x_n) = c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(x_n)) = L
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the requirement &lt;math&gt;x_n \not= c&lt;/math&gt; corresponds with the requirement &lt;math&gt;|x - c| &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  

As an exercise to test your understanding, prove that these two definitions are equivelant.  Note that taking the contrapositive gives a good criterion for determining whether or not a function diverges:

If &lt;math&gt;\exists (x_n), (y_n): (x_n)\rightarrow c, (y_n)\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(x_n)) \not= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(y_n))&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.

===Definition on an Arbitrary Metric Space===

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(Y,d_2)&lt;/math&gt; be metric spaces. And let &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;

The limit as &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;a \in X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;L \in Y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\forall \epsilon &gt; 0 \text{ }\exists \delta \text{ such that if }
0&lt;d_1(x,a)&lt; \delta \text{, } d_2(f(x),L) &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

This is denoted &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} f = L&lt;/math&gt;

'''Chocolate truffles''' are soft chocolate balls. This recipe makes about 24.

==Ingredients==
*8[[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (227[[Cookbook:g|g]]) bittersweet/plain [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] (chopped into small pieces)
*6 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (likely Imperial ones: 108 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]], 7.2 US tablespoons, or 2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] shy of 1/4 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]]) [[Cookbook:Double Cream|double cream]] (48% fat)
*[[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
*[[Cookbook:Icing sugar|Icing sugar]]

In the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|USA]], try using 2 tablespoons unsalted [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] with 5 1/3 tablespoons heavy cream.

==Procedure==
# Put the chocolate in a bowl and set over (a [[Cookbook:Double Boiler|double boiler]]).
# Heat until melted and smooth, stirring occasionally.
# Remove from the pot of hot water.
# Add the cream and stir well.
# Leave to cool.
# Cover and refrigerate for 35 minutes or until the mixture is just firm enough to hold its shape.
# [[Cookbook:Sifting|Sift]] a layer of cocoa powder and icing sugar together onto a plate.  The icing sugar is to make sure the cocoa powder isn't too bitter.  
# Take a heaped [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoonful]] of the chocolate mixture and shape it into a ball.
# Roll each truffle in the cocoa powder/icing sugar to coat all over in an even layer.  Shake off the excess and set on a tray.
# Continue shaping and coating the remaining truffles. Set on a tray, making sure they don't touch each other.
# Cover and refrigerate. Remove 15 minutes before serving.


=== Variations ===
* Vanilla Truffle - Use White chocolate, reducing the icing sugar to preference. Add about 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract.

* Citrus Zest - Use white chocolate, reducing icing sugar content to prefernece. Add about 1 to 3/4 of a tablespoon of diluted lime coridial, and a couple of pinches of ground zest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Religious Development===
--
The most general sociological theory of the formation of religions so far is contained in R. Stark &amp; W. S. Bainbridge's book &quot;Theory of Religion&quot;. This theory is outlined roughly below:

Most religions start out their lives as cults or sects, i.e. groups in high tension with the surrounding society. Over time, they tend to either die out, or become more established, mainstream and in less tension with society. Cults are new groups with a new novel theology, while sects are attempts to return mainstream religions to (what the sect views as) their original purity. Mainstream established groups are called denominations. The comments below about cult formation apply equally well to sect formation.

There are four models of cult formation: the Psychopathological Model, the Entrepreneurial Model, the Social Model and the Normal Revelations model.

According to the Psychopathological Model, religions are founded during a period of severe stress in the life of the founder. The founder suffers from psychological problems, which they resolve through the founding of the religion. (The development of the religion is for them a form of self-therapy, or self-medication.)

According to the Entrepreneurial Model, founders of religions act like entrepreneurs, developing new products (religions) to sell to consumers (to convert people to). According to this model, most founders of new religions already have experience in several religious groups before they begin their own. They take ideas from the pre-existing religions, and try to improve on them to make them more popular.

The Social Model emphasises not the founder of the religion, but rather the early religious group. According to this model, religions are founded by means of social implosions. Members of the religious group spend less and less time with people outside the group, and more and more time with each other within it. The level of affection and emotional bonding between members of a group increases, and their emotional bonds to members outside the group diminish. According to the social model, when a social implosion occurs, the group will naturally develop a new theology and rituals to accompany it.

The Normal Revelations model was added to the theory by Stark in a latter work. According to the Normal Revelations model, religions are founded when the founder interprets ordinary natural phenomena as supernatural; for instance, ascribing his or her own creativity in inventing the religion to that of the deity.

Some religions are better described by one model than another, though all apply to differing degrees to all religions.

Once a cult or sect has been founded, the next problem for the founder is to convert new members to it. Prime candidates for religious conversion are those with an openness to religion, but who do not belong or fit well in any existing religious group. Those with no religion or no interest in religion are difficult to convert, especially since the cult and sect beliefs are so extreme by the standards of the surrounding society. But those already happy members of a religious group are difficult to convert as well, since they have strong social links to their pre-existing religion and are unlikely to want to sever them in order to join a new one. The best candidates for religious conversion are those who are members of or have been associated with religious groups (thereby showing an interest or openness to religion), yet exist on the fringe of these groups, without strong social ties to prevent them from joining a new group.

Potential converts vary in their level of social connection. New religions best spread through pre-existing friendship networks. Converts who are marginal with few friends are easy to convert, but having few friends to convert they cannot add much to the further growth of the organization. Converts with a large social network are harder to convert, since they tend to have more invested in mainstream society; but once converted they yield many new followers through their friendship network.

Cults initially can have quite high growth rates; but as the social networks that initially feed them are exhausted, their growth rate falls quickly. On the other hand, the [[exponential growth|rate of growth is exponential]] (ignoring the limited supply of potential converts): the more converts you have, the more missionaries you can have out looking for new converts. But nonetheless it can take a very long time for religions to grow to a large size by natural growth. This often leads to cult leaders giving up after several decades, and withdrawing the cult from the world.

It is difficult for cults and sects to maintain their initial enthusiasm for more than about a generation. As children are born into the cult or sect, members begin to demand a more stable life. When this happens, cults tend to lose or de-emphasise many of their more radical beliefs, and become more open to the surrounding society; they then become denominations.

The goal or dream of most founders of religions is to convert their entire society; but of the myriad religions founded throughout history, few have been very successful. Most of the world's religious people adhere to one of a few major religions (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism). It is very difficult for a religion to grow to this size.  Most of these religions (especially Christianity) became established when they were adopted by politically powerful individuals. The religion of the common people took much longer to change (sometimes centuries).

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Dutch Cuisine]] | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]

This is an old [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the Netherlands|Dutch]] recipe for a very 'powerful' chocolate pie.

== Ingredients ==

=== Crust ===
* 2-3 packs of 'marie' biscuits (also known as 'rich tea' biscuits)
* cold black coffee or other taste makers

=== Filling ===
* 150/200 gram [[Cookbook:Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]]
* 150/200 gram [[Cookbook:Granulated_Sugar| granulated sugar]]
* 250-500 [[Cookbook:g|grams]] of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] (use about 750grams or something for more then 2 layers of biscuits, and adjust cocoa/sugar amount to match or adjust to taste)
* some [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (about 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]])

=== Topping ===
* chocolate sprinkles 

=== Tools ===
* A dish of some sort with high enough edges (this is important too, an apple pie baking mold or similar '[[Cookbook:Springform Pan|springform]]' will probably do. about 26[[Cookbook:cm|cm]] in diameter)
* A cooking pot that can take all the filling ingredients
* A spoon (preferably a [[Cookbook:Wooden_Spoon|wooden spoon]])

== Procedure ==
# Take a wide/big pan and melt the butter
# Add the sugar and stir/dissolve this into the butter
# Stir the cocoa through the sugar/butter mixture. optionally make this a little more liquid with some milk (not too much!!)
# Take the biscuits and dip them into the cold black coffee. put these on the bottom of the dish.
# After creating a layer of biscuits pour/smear the chocolate mix on top of it then make another layer with dipped biscuits and pour/smear another layer of chocolate
# Repeat this until you run out of chocolate/biscuits.
# Finally place the chocolate sprinkles on top and put it in the fridge until it's hard enough to consume.
# Enjoy!

== Notes, Tips, and Variations ==
* Measurements shouldn't be taken to be precise, play with the amounts to your likings
* Milk is optional, too much will make the cake less solid
* Coffee is optional. Addition is to taste.
===Vegan Variation===
Remove the milk, remove the chocolate sprinkles(unless you have vegan ones) and replace the butter by 2/3 [[Cookbook:Soy|soy]] butter and 1/3 [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], or just all margarine.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

===Conjugation of Double Bonds===
A diene is said to be conjugated when its double bonds are not directly next to each other, but rather separated by a single bond in between them (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  

Conjugated dienes are particularly stable due to the delocalization of the pi electrons along sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized orbitals, and they also tend to undergo reactions atypical of double bond chemistry.  For instance, chlorine can add to 1,3-butadiene (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CH-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to yield a mixture of 3,4-dichloro-1-butene (ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CHCl-CH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 1,4-dichloro-2-butene (ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH=CH-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl).  These are known as 1,2 addition and 1,4 addition, respectively.  1,2-addition is favored in mild reaction (irreversible) conditions (the kinetically preferred product) and 1,4-addition is favored in harsher reaction (reversible) conditions (which results in the thermodynamically preferred product).  

Another interesting conjugated diene reaction is the Diels-Alder reaction, in which a conjugated diene reacts with an alkene (called a  &quot;dienophile&quot; in this case) in order to yield a cyclic product. In Diels-Alder type reactions, the substituent on the dienophile will go into either an exo or endo position in the final product.  (&quot;''Endo''&quot; in this case meaning ''trans to the substituents on the ends of the diene'', and &quot;''exo''&quot; meaning the same thing, only ''cis''.)

[[Image:01-rhubarb_stalks.jpg|thumb|right|storebought rhubarb stalks]]
Rhubarb is a relative of buckwheat and has an earthy, sour flavor. Rhubarb thrives in cold climates and originated in Western [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Tibet|Tibet]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mongolia|Mongolia]], [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Siberia|Siberia]] and neighboring areas. The traditional role was medicinal &amp;mdash; the dried root was a popular remedy for a wide range of illnesses. Its primary function was to induce vomiting, although rhubarb is also a mild astringent. This medicinal role caused the price of the dried root to rise. In 1542, rhubarb sold for ten times the price of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of France|France]] and in 1657 rhubarb sold for over twice the price of opium in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of England|England]] (Schneider, 2001). Beginning in the eighteenth century, rhubarb began to be consumed in foods, primarily drinks and [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]] [[Cookbook:Stew|stews]].

Botanically speaking, rhubarb is considered a vegetable, but it's most often treated as a fruit — though it's rarely eaten raw. Just like fresh [[Cookbook:Cranberry|cranberries]], rhubarb is almost unbearably tart on its own and needs the sweetness of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]], or fruit juice added to it to balance out the acidity. Rhubarb's nickname is the &quot;pie plant&quot; because that is the primary use for this vegetable.

Rhubarb was introduced to the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United States|United States]] at the end of the eighteenth century. Today most rhubarb is frozen for commercial and institutional use; only about a quarter of the crop is sold fresh.

==Selection==
Hothouse, or strawberry, rhubarb appears in markets as early as January and continues to be stocked through April. Field-grown, or cherry, rhubarb begins to arrive in markets in March and can continue to arrive through the summer (depending on the area where it is grown). Spring stalks are the juiciest and most-tender.

Fresh stalks are flat, not curled or limp. When stalks that have been pulled-not cut-from the field are available; choose them. Pulled stalks dry out less rapidly. Size is no indicator of tenderness. Deep red stalks are sweeter and richer.

==Storage==
Wrap rhubarb in plastic wrap and store it in the coldest part of the refrigerator for up to one week. Cooked and raw rhubarb both freeze well.

==Preparation==
Cut off and discard and leaves (see warning below). Rinse and trim from base and tip. You may peel or cut with the skin intact. Remember to cook only in non-aluminum pots only due to the acidic nature of rhubarb.

==Warning==
Never eat rhubarb leaves, cooked or raw. Eating the leaves can be poisonous because they contain oxalates. This toxin, plus another unknown toxin also found in the leaves, has been reported to cause poisoning when large quantities of raw or cooked leaves are ingested.

Rhubarb stalks are also rich in vitamin K, important to note for people taking bloodthinners.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">From Hatfield, Elaine. Equity Theory and Research. Blumberg, Herbert H. Small Groups and Social Interaction.  John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.; 1983.
Four Propositions:
1: Individuals will try to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes equal rewards minus punishments)
2a: Groups (or rather the individuals comprising these groups) can maximize collective reward by evoloving accepted systems for equitably apportioning resources among members.  Thus, groups will evolve such systems of equity, and will attempt to induce members to accept and adhere to these systems.
2b: Groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish members who treat each other inequitably.
3: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they will become distressed. The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress they will feel.
4. Individuals who discover they are in inequitable relationships will attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity.  The greater the inequity that exists, the more distress they will feel, and the harder they will try to restore equity.

equity is in the eye of the beholder

only two ways to alter equity - altering their own or their partner's relative gains

applies to: exploiter/victim relationships, philanthropist/recipient relationships, business relationships, and intimate relationships

Notes:  
lot of problems with this theory:
-still isn't deterministic; there is no way of knowing if a person will try to resolve the inequity and, if so, how
-completely subjective - everyone's definition of equity is unique

Formula:
&lt;math&gt; \frac{(O_A-I_A)}{(|I_A|)^{k_A}} = \frac{(O_B-I_B)}{(|I_B|)^{k_B}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
*&lt;math&gt;I_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_B&lt;/math&gt; designate a scrutineer's perception of Person A's and Person B's inputs
*&lt;math&gt;O_A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_B&lt;/math&gt; designate his or her perception of Person A's and Person B's outcomes
*and &lt;math&gt;|I_A|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|I_B|&lt;/math&gt; designate the absolute value of their inputs

      <text xml:space="preserve">Trying to get a Wiki book book started on Iraq WMD. If there is support it will go forward as a wiki project otherwise ill take it offline and do it as a personal (c) project. If enough rational people collaborate here great. 

I am only retaining copyright for reasons that will be obvious to anyone who reads copyright discussion threads but knee jerk immature ultraleftist probably will (1) not understand and (2) use as a basis to attack my sincerity and credibility. At least that is what they have done in the past.

I will post a personally copywrited article based on the opening quote, and once I have done that I will back revise the post with the credit.

I have studied the issue in depth and my peculiar take on it is this -  I was opposed to the invasion and highly sceptical about all of the big issues - the aluminum tubes, yellowcake etcetera.

However, I have also studied somewhat the history of the saddam wmd in the 90's .

Anyone who does that, a whole new picture emerges. 

Then it is apparent that the right, while getting carried away, was not a glaringly unreasonable as the left believes.

Thus, I am right down the center on many aspects of the issue.

Based on my experience on the web, it is almost impossible to have a NPOV discussion of this issue on either side.

I hope this works...</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Old Text=

(User:- This tutorial, though still under construction, is very helpful because it addresses what I believe is a new panel, 'Links and Pipeline', in 2.42. A lot of the other tutorials seem to date before this addition. It is also very explanatory which helps a lot. Thanks.)

Below is old text for this page.  I want to preserve it to use elsewhere.  Please disregard for now.
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Materials are what gives an object its basic colour and 'feel'.  For example, plastic is quite hard and smooth so it reflects light well, while cotton is soft so it mostly only reflects ambient light.
&lt;/p&gt;

=Adding A Material=
&lt;p&gt;
To add a material, select your object, and click the Shading button (a shaded sphere) or press F5.
In the Material box, click &quot;add new&quot;.  (If you can't see this button, your object already has a material.) Your object now has a material and you can change lots of settings.  The most interesting ones are Textures (see next page), the Colour and Alpha (transparency) sliders in the same box, and the next two boxes, Shaders and Mirror Transparency.  Your material will be called something like Material.001.  You can change this name by clicking on the name box.  Naming things is good!  It makes things much less confusing later on.
&lt;/p&gt;

=Shaders=
&lt;p&gt;Shaders are what makes the difference between the way light behaves on cotton, plastic and many other objects.  The reflectivity slider controls how much ambient light is reflected (move it and watch the preview).  The Halo button turns your object's vertices into points of light.  Specularity controls how much light bounces directly off objects (think sunlight reflecting off the sea), and hardness controls the angle at which specularity is noticible.
Translucency is used to light a surface if the side facing away from the eye point is receiving light. Ambient colour sets the amount of global ambient color the material receives.
Emittivity will make the material glow in the dark (good if a particular object is too dark).
&lt;/p&gt;

=Mirror Transparency=
&lt;p&gt;
The mirror transparency tab is used to control reflections and transparency.  You should have raytracing turned on on the render tab to use these settings (Ray button after you press F10).&lt;br&gt;
Reflectivity makes your object reflect other objects.  Press Ray Mirror to turn it on and the slider to control the amount.  Depth controls how many times a reflection can bounce before it reaches the camera (if two reflective objects are next to each other, they will only reflect each other this number of times).  
Ray Transparency is used to make objects see-through.  The Alpha slider on the materials tab controls how transparent the material is; IOR stands for Index of Refraction - how much light bends when it passes into or out of the object.  (If it is 1, light passes straight through and the object often looks fake.  Glass has a typical IOR of 1.5, and water is about 1.33.)  ZTransp does not rely on raytracing, but Ray Transp looks much better.  The object will not be transparent without ZTransp or Ray Transp checked.

EDIT: Translucency will make the object translucent. 
translucent means:
Transmitting light but causing sufficient diffusion to prevent perception of distinct images.
(clear)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

I am updating the text so it fits 2.59 I have done the first part until Specifying Colors &lt;s&gt;and hope to do the rest asap.&lt;/s&gt; --&gt; done!

[[Image:NCI_flour_tortillas.jpg|thumb|right|Flour tortillas]]

[[Cookbook:Tortilla|Tortillas]] are a type of [[Cookbook:Flatbread|flatbread]] popular in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexico]] and [[:Category:Central American recipes|Central America]] commonly made from [[Cookbook:Flour#Wheat Flour|wheat flour]] or [[Cookbook:Corn Masa|masa]]. This recipe is for the wheat flour variety.

== Ingredients ==
* 4 cups (950ml) unbleached all purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening
* 1 1/2 cups (360ml) warm water, more if needed
* 4 teaspoons baking powder (optional, for thicker and chewier tortillas)

== Procedure ==
# In a large bowl, stir together the flour, salt and baking powder. 
# With a pastry blender, a fork, or your hands, gradually work in the lard or shortening until it is all incorporated. 
# Add enough warm water to make a soft but not sticky dough. 
# Turn out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 5 minutes.
# Divide the dough into 1/4 cup (3 oz / 90g) portions and form them into balls.
# Roll each ball into a flat round about 6 inches (15cm) in diameter and 1/8 inches (0.3cm) thick.
# Heat a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. 
# Place the tortillas one at a time into the dry (or very lightly oiled) hot skillet; cook until browned in spots on one side, then turn and brown the other in spots side. (about 1 minute/side, see image)
# Remove from the skillet and keep warm in cloth towel.

The '''snow pea''' is a type of pea that is eaten whole, immature, and still in the pod. It is commonly [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]] in [[Cookbook:East Asian cuisines|East Asian cuisine]]. They can also be eaten as sprouts.

Snow peas should be shiny and flat, with very small peas that are barely visible through the pod. Smaller pods are the sweetest and the most tender.

It is best to serve fresh peas the day they are purchased. If they must be stored, place them in a perforated plastic bag in the refrigerator. Do not wash them before they are stored.

Rinse snow peas before use. To trim snow peas, cut the tips from both ends of the pod. This can be done with kitchen shears.</text>

After added the Stucci texture and affected it with the normal, an aliased shadow will appear in our rendered work. I fixed it by pressing 'Nor' button in the 'Map To' tab again, so the text 'Nor' turns yellow.

i cant seem to apply this tutorial to the blender 2.61 version that &quot;spotty&quot; button that your supposed to press is not on my blender program or has another name that isnt spotty button so i cannot complete this tutorial wich i really wish i could.

While topics in contract law may be universal,  this book will focus primarily on the American (USA) law of contracts.

This book discusses the legally binding obligations that parties can voluntarily enter into and how the courts deal with enforcing those obligations.  

Note: This is an extremely early version and is likely to contain mistakes. This page is not a substitute for legal representation. Also, this is a general overview of contract law as it is practiced and enforced in the United States. The details may be different depending on which State(s) is(are) involved.  Nevertheless, the writers encourage every person to acquaint themselves with the principles of a legal system that governs nearly all sales and transactions.  The world is, after all, a &quot;global marketplace.&quot;



=Legal Theories of Contracts=
==What is a Contract?==

      A working definition of Contract comes from the American Law Institute's 
      Restatement 2nd:

      § 1. Contract Defined:

      A contract is a promise or a set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, 
      or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.

Another definition comes from the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which specifically
covers contracts for &quot;Goods&quot; (instead of services):

      § 1-201(11) [Revised § 1-201(11)]: 

      “Contract” means the total legal obligation which results from the parties’ 
      agreement as affected by this Act and any other applicable rules of law. 

Both of these definitions make clear that not all promises or agreements are contracts. The promises or agreements that are contracts are the ones the legal system will enforce. That definition certainly appears circular: which ones will our legal system enforce?

That enforcement mechanism kicks in when a contract has been formed and it has been breached. The legal system is then asked to supply a remedy. These concepts of formation, breach, and remedy will play a large part in our discussion. While not always taken in that order, those are also the major topics around which your Contracts course is organized. And they form the basis for a claim for breach of contract, as we will now see.

==Economic Analysis==

=Was There a Breach of Contract?=
These three elements of a claim for breach of contract reflect the major topics of Contract Law:

      The first element is called Formation.

      The second element is called Performance and Breach.

      The third element is called Remedies.

The only other major topic in Contracts is Third Parties. Contracts is so much fun that one person is a party! It takes two to make a contract, however, so the first two parties are the parties to the contract. The &quot;Third Party&quot; is a party who is not a party to the contract.

It is clear that the parties to a contract have certain rights and obligations towards each other as defined in the contract. Sometimes third parties can have rights and obligations by virtue of the contract as well. The parties to the contract may have intended for the contract to benefit a third party, in which case the third party would be a beneficiary of the contract (third party beneficiary). The parties to the contract might also seek to assign their rights under the contract or to delegate their duties under the contract to a third party (assignment and delegation).

To succeed, the plaintiff must prove that all the elements of a claim are satisfied. To defeat the plaintiff's claim, the defendant needs to knock out only one element. You will find it helpful when analyzing Contracts cases to figure out which element the defendant is contesting.

==Sources of Contract Law==

Contracts always involve the future. Problems frequently arise because events did not turn out as one or both of the parties had anticipated and they look to contract law to provide the solution for that particular situation. Where do we go to find the rules to resolve contract disputes?

There is a hierarchy of sources. [Insert chart here.]

The principal state statute you will deal with in Contracts is the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC or Code). The Code has a number of parts, called Articles, that apply to different transactions. You will be concerned with Article 1, which contains General Provisions that apply to the whole Code, and Article 2, Sales.

The UCC is an odd duck. One of its principal goals, expressed in § 1-102(2)(c) [Revised § 1-103(a)(3)], is “to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions.” You would think the easiest way to make the law uniform would be to enact a federal law. But that is not the way of the Code. The Code is promulgated by two groups, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law (NCCUSL), and the American Law Institute (ALI). After both of these groups have approved proposed statutes that are drafted by a committee of experts, NCCUSL then takes the proposal to each state, asking the state to enact it. If every state enacts the same law, then the law is uniform. NCCUSL and the ALI have had tremendous success with the UCC, getting most of it enacted in every American jurisdiction.

However, the UCC is not entirely uniform. Legislatures are of course free to change the proposed version in the course of enacting the law, and most legislatures have taken advantage of that freedom. The CALI lessons will cite to the Uniform version of the Code, but you should be aware that your state may have a nonuniform provision.

====Application of UCC Article 2====

The subject matter of UCC Article 2 is, as expressed in § 2-102, “transactions in goods,” and generally, the sale of goods. So whenever your facts indicate that the contract involves the sale of goods, you should go to UCC Article 2 for the rule. But what are “goods”?  Section 2-105(1) provides this definition:

      (1) &quot;Goods&quot; means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are movable
          at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in
          which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8) and things in
          action. &quot;Goods&quot; also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and
          other identified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to
          be severed from realty (Section 2-107).

So goods are movable. All well and good. But if a transaction is a hybrid, involving both goods and non-goods, do we apply Article 2? One approach to this problem, from the case of Bonebrake v. Cox, 499 F.2d 951 (8th Cir. 1974), asks us to determine whether the sale of goods was the &quot;predominant purpose&quot; of the transaction. If it was, then Article 2 is applied to the entire transaction.

====The Common Law====

What if we have a sale of goods (please double check this info as it is not as 'good' as it would appear), but we find no rule in Article 2 that addresses our issue? For example, Farmer claims that because he was drunk when he made the agreement with Cereal Company, the agreement is not binding. UCC Article 2 has no rule on whether agreements a person makes when drunk are enforceable. Where do we go to find the applicable rule? UCC § 1-103 (Revised § 1-103(b)) tells us:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 1-103. Supplementary General Principles of Law Applicable. 
Unless displaced by the particular provisions of this Act, the principles of law and equity, including the law merchant and the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent, estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake, bankruptcy, or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its provisions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where do we find these “principles of law and equity”? In a few states, notably Louisiana, which has a French Civil Code tradition, and California, which adopted the Field Code developed by law reformer David Dudley Field in the 19th century, general principles of law, including contract law, are found in statutes. These statutes, however, are often broadly stated and will not answer your question. For example, if you were researching in California whether agreements a person makes when drunk are enforceable, you would find this applicable statute in the Civil Code:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 39. Conveyance or contract; rescission; rebuttable presumption.

(a) A conveyance or other contract of a person of unsound mind, but not entirely without understanding, made before the incapacity of the person has been judicially determined, is subject to rescission ....
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In most jurisdictions, general principles of contract law are a matter of common law; that is, the tradition of judge-made law handed down in judicial opinions. In a state where contract law is found in a code, like California, there is still a strong common law tradition because the courts must interpret the code to determine whether it is applicable to a particular situation.

In theory, if you wanted to know what the common law rule is, such as whether an agreement made by a person when drunk is enforceable, you would have to read all the cases on point and attempt to distill the rule from them.

In practice, someone has already done that work for you. Enter the Restatement. The Restatements are another project of the American Law Institute. As suggested by the title, a Restatement represents a distillation of the principles of law into “black letter” rules that can be easily, perhaps too easily, stated. We are blessed with an excellent Restatement in our area, the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.

CALI Contracts lessons will occasionally refer to a section from the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (and since it is the only Restatement we will refer to, we may often just call it &quot;the Restatement&quot;). But don’t assume that just because the Restatement states a rule that it is “the law.” Each Restatement is written by a committee of lawyers, judges, and law professors. It reflects the opinion of the authors as to what the general principle is or should be. It is not mandatory authority because it is not enacted by a legislature, and it may not reflect the rule in a particular jurisdiction.

====Federal Courts, State Courts, and the Applicable State Law====

Sometimes the contracts cases you study have been decided by a federal court. In those cases, it is helpful to ask how the court got jurisdiction. Frequently (but not always) the cases are in federal court because of diversity jurisdiction; that is, the federal court takes jurisdiction when the plaintiff and the defendant are citizens of different states.

====Default Rules and Freedom of Contract====

Have you studied Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 305 U.S. 673 (1938), in Civil Procedure yet? For our purposes, the gist of it is that the Supreme Court declared that there is in general no federal common law of contracts. Whether a case is heard in federal court or in state court, the court will apply the law of the relevant state.

Which state’s law will the court apply? That question is answered by the choice of law rules. You may eventually study that subject in a course called Conflicts of Law. According to the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws (yes, there is a Restatement for that, too), the general rule for choice of law in a contracts case is found in § 188:

      § 188. Law Governing In Absence Of Effective Choice By The Parties

      (1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in § 6.

      (2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties (see § 187), the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of § 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:
            (a) the place of contracting, 
            (b) the place of negotiation of the contract, 
            (c) the place of performance, 
            (d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and 
            (e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties. These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.

      (3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in §§ 189-199 and 203.

According to Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 188, the general rule is that the local law of the state that &quot;has the most significant relationship to the transaction&quot; will govern. There is an even narrower rule for contracts involving the sale of chattels (goods). Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 191 provides:

      § 191. Contracts To Sell Interests In Chattel

      The validity of a contract for the sale of an interest in a chattel and the rights created thereby are determined, in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties, by the local law of the state where under the terms of the contract the seller is to deliver the chattel unless, with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in § 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied. 

We’re not going to go into those rules in detail, but we will use this opportunity to emphasize the important principle called Freedom of Contract. Contract law is generally not regulatory. It is facilitatory -- it facilitates the making of agreements between the parties. When we speak of the rules of contract law, we don’t mean rules in the sense of inflexible commandments. We are generally speaking of “default rules” -- the rules that apply in the absence of the parties’ agreement. In fact, this point is nicely captured by the caption to Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws § 188: Law Governing In Absence Of Effective Choice By The Parties.

Unless it is a formation rule or a matter of policy is involved, the parties are generally free to use freedom of contract to change the default rule. This principle is stated in UCC § 1-102(3) [Rev. § 1-302(a)], which provides that &quot;The effect of provisions of this Act may be varied by agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Act. &quot;

==Valid Contract Formation==

===Basic Vocabulary===

'''Agreement''' 

An agreement consists of an offer and an acceptance, this sometimes referred to as mutual assent.

'''Offer''' 

According to the Restatement of Contract Law, &quot;an offer is a manifestation of an intent to be contractually bound upon acceptance by another party.&quot;  In other words, when a potential party to a contract makes others aware that he wants to enter into a contract, an &quot;offer&quot; has been made.  

An offeror must spell out enough terms such that the offeree can merely say &quot;I accept.&quot;  For example, &quot;I'll buy your house&quot; isn't enough to constitute a valid offer.  At a minimum, a price and boundaries for what land will be sold must be included within the offer.  However, there are jurisdictions in which an advertisement stating that a car will be sold for a certain price is considered legally binding on the advertisers.

Offers can be made with an expiration date on them.  If an offer is made with no explicit expiration date, the courts will create one based on local business customs, how the parties have handled in the past, and the nature of the contract.

Separate agreement can be made to extend the length of time of previous offers.  The agreements, usually called &quot;option contracts&quot;, bind the original offeror to keep his offer valid and exclusively available to the original offeree for some period of time, usually in exchange for some amount of money.

It is important to distinguish between an offer and merely an invitation to treat.  An invitation to treat is generally an offer to the world, such as goods on display in a shop, or an advertisement in a newspaper.  Where an invitation to treat occurs, it is the one wishing to purchase a product that makes the legal 'offer' to the owner who then 'accepts'.

'''Acceptance'''

Accepting the terms of the offer.

'''Consideration'''

This element is broken down into two parts: First, the consideration given in return for the promise or performance must be of legally sufficient value. It may be money, an action the party has no legal duty to do, or not taking an action the party has a legal right to take. Second, the consideration must consist of bargained-for exchange. This element distinguishes contracts from gifts. This is a continuance of the concept of mutual assent, a meeting of the minds between offeror and offeree. Note that &quot;legally sufficient value&quot; does not save either party from an unwise contract. Under the doctrine of '''freedom of contract''', people are free to bargain and contract as they wish. Just because one party may think their offer or acceptance is unequal to the value of consideration they got in return does not void the contract.

Consideration is something of sufficient, but not necessarily adequate, value that is exchanged between the parties.  As long as the consideration has sufficient value to the offeror then this is deemed to be sufficient consideration.

Past consideration generally is not acceptable.  This is that the consideration must take place in light of the offer and acceptance.  As with English law there is always the exception.  In cases such as a window cleaner, past consideration is necessary (a window cleaner will clean the windows first then ask for payment later in respect of the performance that has already occurred).

===The Bargaining Process===
This section deals with the essential elements of the bargaining process. There are basically two requirements: (1) Assent and (2) Definiteness. 


====Assent====
Mutual assent to be bound is an essential element of contract formation. Parties may achieve mutual assent through a bargaining process which involves an offer and an acceptance. So, identifying the offer and acceptance can be the method by which mutual assent is established.

There are three essential elements to an offer. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 24. All must exist before there can be a legally valid offer.

Once you decide that an offer has been made, next determine if the offer is revocable. An offer can become irrevocable by formation of an option contract, Res. 2d Contracts sec. 25, by beginning to perform under an offer that looks to acceptance by performance only, Res. 2d Contracts sec. 45, by detrimental reliance, Res. 2d Contracts sec. 87(2), by statute, including a firm offer under U.C.C. 2-205, and by a writing signed by the offeror which recites a purported consideration and proposes a fair exchange. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 87 (a). 

If the offer can be terminated before acceptance, you must next consider whether an offeree's power of acceptance has been terminated by revocation, rejection (including a counteroffer), lapse, or death or incapacity of the offeror or offeree. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 36. If the offeree's power of acceptance has been terminated, no acceptance is possible. If it hasn't then consider if there has been an acceptance. A valid acceptance requires that there be a manifestation of present intent to accept, and that the acceptance be made in the manner invited or required by the offer. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 50. An offer can require that the offeree can accept only by making a promise. If it does, then no other means of acceptance is possible. Similarly, if the offer requires a performance only, then no other means is possible. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 30.
=====Objective vs. Subjective Assent=====

The cases are legion that require a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; for the formation of a valid contract. If taken literally, it would require that all of the parties to a valid contract must simultaneously intend to bind themselves to the contract. Does modern contract law require a &quot;meeting of the minds?&quot; If so, what exactly does it mean?

'''The Offer''' An offer is defined as a manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain so made as to justify another person in understanding that her assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it. Res. 2d Contracts sec. 24. A legally sufficient offer requires a manifestation of present intent. Because of the nature of this objective test of intent, modern cases require that one look not only at the words used by the purported offeror, but also at all of the surrounding circumstances to determine whether a reasonable person in the position of the purported offeree would understand that the offeror intended to be bound. Murray p. 69. Farnsworth p. 135. Offers can be oral, written, or implied by conduct.

=====Intention to have Legal Consequences===== 
=====Tests to Determine if an Offer has been Made===== 
=====Auction Sales===== 
=====Termination of the Power of Acceptance=====

=====The Nature of Acceptance=====

====Definiteness====
=====Types of Indefiniteness=====

=====Agreements to Agree=====

===Legal Capacity===
Both parties to a contract must have contractual capacity. This means they must be seen as competent persons in the eyes of the law. Common qualifiers are: Being of the age of majority (18 in the United States), possessing the freedom of choice (free of outside influence such as duress, undue influence, and intoxication), and being of sound mind at the time of the contracts formation (on this topic an entire book can be written).

===Legality===
The contract's purpose must be legal, for example murder is illegal. Therefore you cannot form a contract which to be completed requires someone to murder another person as the purpose of the contract is to conduct an act which is not legal. This means that contract law will not apply. 

This is the strict sense of the legality dependant upon state, so an act legal in one state may result in a void contract if contracted elsewhere.

===Relieving Party from Promise===
====Mutual Mistake====
====Unilateral Mistake====

====Duress==== 
Restraint or danger, actually inflicted or impending, which is sufficient in severity or apprehension to deprive a person of free choice, destroy his volition, or obtain consent only in form.

Under the law, a person is not guilty of a crime if he participated only because he believed, and had good reason to believe, that he would be seriously harmed if he did not participate and had no other way of escaping serious harm. The burden is on the government to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To find someone guilty, therefore, there must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt that when he participated in the offense, he did not have a reasonable belief that such participation was the only way he could save himself from serious harm.

An actual or a threatened violence or restraint of a man's person, contrary to law, to compel him to enter into a contract, or to discharge one.

Some divide duress into two sorts:

First. Duress of imprisonment, where a man actually loses his liberty. If a man be illegally deprived of his liberty until he sign and seal a bond, or the like, he may allege this duress, and avoid the bond. But, if a man be legally imprisoned, and either to procure his discharge, or on any other fair account, seal a bond or a deed, this is not by duress of imprisonment, and he is not at liberty to avoid it.

Second. Duress per minas, which is either for fear of loss of life, or else for fear of mayhem, or loss of limb,; and this must be upon a sufficient reason. In this case, a man way avoid his own act. Lord Coke enumerates four instances in which a man may avoid his own act by reason of menaces: 1. For fear of loss of life; 2. Of member; 3. Of mayhem; 4. Of imprisonment.

It is not every degree of violence or any hind of threats, that will invalidate a contract; they must be such as would naturally operate on a person of ordinary firmness, and inspire a just fear of great injury to person, reputation or fortune. The age, sex, state of health; temper and disposition of the party, and 0ther circumstances calculated to give greater or less effect to the violence or threats, must be taken into consideration.

A contract by violence or threats, is void, although the party in whose favor the contract is made, and not exercise the violence or make the threats, and although he were ignorant of them.

Violence or threats are cause of nullity, not only where they are exercised on the contracting party, but when the wife, the husband, the descendants or ascendants of the party are the object of them.

If the violence used be only a legal constraint, or the threats only of doing that which the party using them had a right to do, they shall not invalidate the contract A just and legal imprisonment, or threats of any measure authorized by law, and the circumstances of the case, are of this description.

But the mere forms of law to cover coercive proceedings for an unjust and illegal cause, if used or threatened in order to procure the assent to a contract, will invalidate it; an arrest without cause of action, or a demand of bail in an unreasonable sum, or threat of such proceeding, by this rule invalidate a contract made under their pressure.

All the above articles relate to cases where there may be some other motive besides the violence or threats for making the contract. When, however, there is no other cause for making the contract, any threats, even of slight injury, will invalidate it.

====Misrepresentation====
====Unconscionability====
====Statute of Frauds====
The Statute of Frauds is a collective term describing the various statutory provisions which render unenforceable certain types of contracts unless they are evidenced by a writing.

====Contract Interpretation====
=====Parol Evidence Rule=====
The nutshell version of this rule:  when drafting a contract -- write what you mean, and mean what you write.  If a judge looking at the contract can figure out what the parties' intentions were, then there is no need to have the parties give any testimony whatsoever on what they meant when they drafted the contract.  If a judge cannot reasonably understand the parties' intentions on a point of contention, then oral testimony, also called parol evidence, is allowed.  See the examples below.

It can happen that once the parties to a contract are somewhat along in their contractual relationship that a dispute will arise regarding what the contract requires one or both parties to actually do.  For instance, say Jane hires Bob to paint her house for $5,000.00 with the job to start in August, and the written contract states exactly that with no other wording regarding any sort of time requirement for getting the work done.  Jane then tells Bob that she wants the job finished by the end of August because she has family visiting from out of state on September 1st.  Bob tells Jane that he completely understands her situation.  Summertime is a very busy time for Bob, so he starts the job on August 31st to meet the deadline, but he then leaves the job to paint other houses and, as a result, he does not finish until mid-October.  Jane is infuriated and embarrassed that her visitors had to deal with looking at the partially painted house and she firmly believes that Bob knew he would not be able to get the work done in August as she asked.  So, she refuses to pay half of the agreed amount ($2,500.00). Bob files a lawsuit.

Bob tells the judge that he completely abided by the contract and did exactly as he was required to do.  Jane says that Bob knew that she wanted him to start and finish in August, despite the fact that the contract said Bob only needed to start in August.  The judge believes that both Jane and Bob are telling the complete truth, but finds that Bob is entitled to the remaining $2,500.00 due on the contract.  Here's why Jane loses: the contract did not state that Bob must finish in August; It merely stated he must begin in August.  When a judge can look at the plain language of a contract and from that can understand what the duties are for each party, the Parol Evidence Rule prevents the judge from taking into account oral evidence as to what a party or the parties actually meant.  In other words, the written word trumps the spoken.  In this case, the judge, even if he or she feels it is unfair to Jane, does not need testimony to understand that the contract only required Bob to start in August -- not complete the job in August. 

But what if the contract stated that Bob must start on August 15th, and that he must do the work quickly and in a workmanlike manner until completion.  Before signing the contract, Jane tells Bob of the reason for the &quot;quickly&quot; requirement -- that is she has visitors coming on September 1st.  Bob tells Jane that he completely understands.  Bob does start on August 15th but does not finish until September 15th, and tells Jane that he did indeed proceed quickly as she requested.  Jane withholds the $2,500.00 and, predictably, Bob files a lawsuit.

The judge, this time, would be very willing to hear the oral testimony of both parties because, while it is clear the parties contemplated some requirement for a finish date, it is unclear from the plain language of the contract what that date actually was.  Looking at the contract, it is absolutely impossible to find a solid finish date, and the parties' expectations as to what that meant under the contract can only be derived from oral testimony.  Jane's statement regarding her timetable and Bob's statement that he completely understood might be enough to convince a judge that the contract required Bob to be finished by August 31st.  

To sum up in outline fashion:
1. If the contract is specific as to the point in dispute: no oral testimony is allowed.
2. If the contract is ambiguous as to the point in dispute: oral testimony is allowed.

====Justifications for Nonperformance====
=====Impossibility=====
when an act cannot be performed due to nature, physical impediments, or unforeseen events. It can be a legitimate basis to rescind (mutually cancel) a contract

=====Impracticability=====
=====Frustration of Purpose===== 
Frustration of purpose is a term used in the law of contracts to describe a defense to an action for non-performance based on the occurrence of an unforeseen event which makes performance impossible or commercially impracticable. A common situation is that the subject matter of the contract - a house or a car for example - is unintentionally destroyed.

==Performance and Breach==
===Express Conditions===
===Constructive and Implied Conditions===

===Breach and Anticipatory Repudiation===

==Remedies==
;Expectation Damages
Give the benefit of the bargain i.e. expected gain. ''''''For the party who has suffered a loss to be put in the position as if the contract's obligations had been performed.''''''

;Reliance Damages
Restore to before contract. Repay any loss

;Restitution Damages
Action off the contract. Party receives damages for the benefit they conferred on the other party, so as not to allow unjust enrichment.  For the party who has suffered a loss to be put back in the position had the contract not been agreed at all - recovery of losses, as opposed to expectation damages, see above.

;Punitive Damages
Punish breach. 
Usually only used for tortious breach; therefore, this is not a usual type of damages in Contracts Law.
Policy: Breaching a contract can be efficient.  The law does not wish to force all promises to be adhered to. It simply wishes to put the non-breaching party in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed.

;Specific Performance
Perform as promised. Complete the bargain
Used only when damages can’t or won’t be sufficient.  Specific performance is the very last resort that the English Legal System shall generally resort to.  This is making a person carry out obligations agreed to under the terms of the contract.  This is not a good option for either parties.  The person is unlikely to perform tasks to a satisfactory standard for the Claimant and it is essentially like slavery for the Defendant whom is being made to carry out obligations.

      <comment>/* Use of Roman and Hindu-Arabic numerals */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Great article; a couple of comments: i) it would be nice to compare/contrast modes to other similar concepts in the world, for example &quot;Thats&quot; in Indian music. ii) The phrase in the last sentence 'sound through time' does not make sense; is there any sound that is not through time?

== Use of Roman and Hindu-Arabic numerals ==

This is looking good.

Only critique I  would make is that Roman numerals are usually reserved for discussing chords where Hindu-Arabic numbers are used for discussing scale tones. Also when using numbers to describe musical ideas we usually prefix any #'s or b's  rather than making them a suffix&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
i.e.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
{|
|-
| Ionian || 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
|-
| Dorian || 1 2 b3 4 5 6 b7 8 
|-
| Phrygian || 1 b2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8 
|-
| Lydian || 1 2 3 #4 5 6 7 8 
|-
| Mixolydian || 1 2 3 4 5 6 b7 8 
|-
| Aeolian || 1 2 b3 4 5 b6 b7 8 
|-
| Locrian || 1 b2 b3 4 b5 b6 b7 8 
|}

Is how we would describe the deviations each mode has from the Ionian in terms of scale degree structure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Before deciding to open your hive be aware that bees dislike the smell of newly mown grass, it can make them agitated and more liable to sting you. They are also similarly affected by the type of cool heavy air that presages a thunderstorm, so again delay opening the hive. However, once you have decided that the conditions suit,start your smoker and have a heavy cool smoke issuing from your smoker, making sure that there won't be any hot coals or chunks that will be blown out. Having your veil on would be helpful as well. Blow a few puffs into the entrance of the hive and wait a minute or so, then remove the cover. Open the cover slowly and carefully using a pry tool (my bees like to build a lot of burr comb upside down on the cover) and blow a few puffs of smoke on top of the frames and underneath the cover. The bees should retreat to the comb. Lean the cover against the side of the hive, never place it flat on the ground. This will prevent trapping or crushing the bees.

When you are ready to close the hive, puff some smoke over the tops of the frames again to keep the bees below the cover. Then position one end of the cover on top of the hive and close it like a hinge. This will help prevent the bees from being crushed under the cover.

'''Chinese five spice powder''' (&amp;#20116;&amp;#39321;&amp;#31881; or '''five spices powder''' or '''five-spice powder''') is a convenient seasoning for Cantonese cuisine. It incorporates the five basic flavours of Chinese cooking - sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and salty.
One common recipe includes [[Cookbook:China Tung Hing Cinnamon|China Tung Hing cinnamon]], powdered [[Cookbook:Cassia|cassia]] buds, powdered [[Cookbook:Star Anise|star anise]] and [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]] seed, [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger root]], and ground [[Cookbook:Clove|clove]]s.
Another recipe for the powder consists of [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], cloves, [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] seed, and star anise.  It is used in most Cantonese roasted [[Cookbook:Duck|ducks]], as well as [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] stew.

The formulae are based on the Chinese philosophy of balancing the yin and yang in food.
A pinch of the powder goes a long way.

Although this spice is used in restaurant cooking, many Chinese households never use it in day-to-day cooking.

A versatile seasoned salt can be easily made by stir-frying common [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] with five spice powder under low heat in a dry pan until the spice and salt are well mixed.

== Ingredients ==
* 2 teaspoons Szechuan peppercorns
* 8 star anise pods
* 1/2 tsp ground cloves
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* 1 tablespoon ground fennel

== Procedure ==
#Roast two teaspoons of Szechuan peppercorns in a dry frypan for about three minutes.
#Grind the peppercorns in a pepper grinder or coffee grinder together with 8 star anise pods.
#Strain the ground spices to remove any larger bits.
#Mix together 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds.
#Grind the completed mixture until it is a very fine powder.
#Use sparingly, as it is extremely pungent.

[[Image:StarAnise.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Star Anise]]                    

'''Star anise''' is a [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|spice]] commonly used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]], [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian]], and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesian]] cooking. It has a flavour much like [[Cookbook:Anise|anise]], and has also been compared to [[Cookbook:Fennel|fennel]] and [[Cookbook:Liquorice|liquorice]].

In many dishes, whole stars are added to the cooking, imparting their flavour as the food simmers. It is not uncommon to find star anise served in the food, to be fished out by the diner.

Star anise is also a component of the classic [[Cookbook:Five Spice Powder|Chinese five spice]] mix, used widely in Chinese cuisine.

In western cuisines, star anise has gained some use as a replacement for anise, as it is less expensive.

[[Image:DEA_mar_loose.jpg|right|thumb|loose marijuana]]
'''Marijuana''' and '''sinsemilla''' are parts of the '''cannabis''' (''Cannabis sativa L.'') plant. Serving foods that contain marijuana, without the eater's knowledge or consent, is very inappropriate and inconsiderate, due to the plant's strong effects.

Eating foods containing Marijuana can induce stronger psychoactive effects than most other methods of Cannabis consumption. These effects often do not appear for up to an hour and a half after eating (due to the time it takes to digest the food), and it is common among first-time cookers (but long-time smokers) to eat too much thinking it has not worked.

==Warnings==
* A common myth about cannabis is that it is physically addictive. While this is not true, a minority of users can come to depend on the drug’s effects — i.e., become psychologically dependent. 
* Cannabis can cause tiredness, reddening of the eyes, dry mouth, increased heart rate, and a drop in blood pressure. Appetite is increased. While the drug’s effects last, it is difficult to concentrate. Perceptions of distance and velocity can change. 
* It can impair short term memory while under the influence, and may aggravate existing disorders in people with mental health issues. Some people, particularly inexperienced users, may feel quite edgy or paranoid after using it.
* Due to cannabis's strong psychoactive effects, people under the influence should '''not''' attempt to drive or operate heavy machinery.
* Possession of marijuana is illegal in many countries. Depending on where you live, prosecution may result in fines, imprisonment, and even execution.

The Bubble Tea recipe seems to have a problem. Including the full cup of milk but no honey, I count 28 ounces. The recipe claims to produce only 16 ounces. Unless the cook is expected to heavily sample or spill, the math doesn't seem to work out. It's 35 ounces if you use Imperial units. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:42, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cells''' are the smallest units of life. The vast majority of organisms today are made up of eukaryotic cells, which contain distinct, membrane-bound organelles and which contain a membrane-bound nucleus. Earlier organisms with no membrane-bound organelles and no definite nucleus are termed prokaryotic. Each type has its own distinct anatomy.


==Organelles==
[[File:Plant cell structure-en.svg|right|350px]]
The term &quot;eukaryote&quot; comes from the Greek (eu, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;true&quot;) and κάρυον](karyon, &quot;nut&quot;).

Karyon refers to the nucleus of the cell, thus pointing out that every eukaryote must have the following characteristics:

* Contain a membrane-bound nucleus
* Be composed of membrane-bound organelles

Typically, eukaryotic cells are much larger and more complicated in comparison to prokaryotes.  Eukaryotes are believed to have evolved from early prokaryotes through endosymbiosis (see [[w:Endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiotic theory]]), roughly 1 billion years after the evolution of the first prokaryotes and archaea.  The endosymbiotic relationship between modern mitochondria and chloroplasts, and their corresponding membrane arrangements, provides some of the strongest evidence for this theory. The following is an overview of the main organelles which make up the eukaryotic cell.

===Cell Membrane===

The cell membrane is used to allow some materials to enter and block others, and vice versa.

===Cell Wall===
The '''cell wall''' is a more or less solid layer surrounding a cell. They are found in bacteria, archea, fungi, plants, and algae. Animals and most other protists have cell membranes without surrounding cell walls. When a cell wall is removed using cell wall degrading enzymes, what is left of the cell and its surrounding plasma membrane is called a protoplast.

'''Cell sap''' is a dilute fluid that is found in the large central vacuole of many plant cells. It contains water, amino acids, glucose, and salts. The sap has many functions, such as storage of useful materials, and provides mechanical support for non-woody plants; it also helps plant-cells in the process of osmosis.

===Centrioles===
A '''centriole''' in biology is a barrel shaped microtubule structure found in most animal cells, and cells of fungi and algae though not frequently in plants.  The walls of each centriole are composed of nine triplet microtubules or, in the case of ''Drosophila'', nine doublet microtubules.  The microtubules which make up the '''centriole''' are very stable and are acetylated.  
Centrioles are important in the cell division process, organizing the mitotic spindle upon which the chromosomes are pulled apart.  Some animal cells may be able to divide their chromosomes without centrioles, for instance in female meiosis. Centrioles assist the cell through the process of mitosis and in male meiosis.

===Cytoplasm===
The cytoplasm includes everything within the cell, within the cell membrane, but excludes the nucleus. Cytosol makes up the liquid part of the cytoplasm, filling the intracellular space of the cell. It functions to provide a medium in which cellular reactions take place, as well as suspending organelles, and aiding in sensory transduction and signaling.

===Chloroplasts=== 
Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and eukaryotic algae which conduct photosynthesis.  
They are similar to mitochondria but are found only in plants. Both organelles are surrounded by a double membrane with an intermembrane space; both have their own DNA and are involved in energy metabolism; and both have reticulations, or many foldings, filling their inner spaces. 
Chloroplasts convert light energy from the sun into ATP through a process called photosynthesis.

===Cytoskeleton===
The '''cytoskeleton''' is a cellular &quot;scaffolding&quot; or &quot;skeleton&quot; contained, as all other organelles, within the cytoplasm. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, enables some cell motion (using structures such as flagella and cilia), and plays important roles in both intra-cellular transport (the movement of vesicles and organelles, for example) and cellular division. The three types of cytoskeleton are microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.

===Endoplasmic Reticulum===
The '''endoplasmic reticulum''' or '''ER''' (endoplasmic means &quot;within the cytoplasm,&quot; reticulum means &quot;little net&quot;) is an organelle found in all eukaryotic cells. The ER modifies proteins, makes macromolecules, and transfers substances throughout the cell.
Prokaryotic organisms do not have membrane-bound organelles and thus do not have an ER. 
ER's base structure and composition is similar to the plasma membrane, though it is an extension of the nuclear membrane. The ER is the site of the translation, folding, and transport of proteins that are to become part of the cell membrane (e.g., transmembrane receptors and other integral membrane proteins) as well as proteins that are to be secreted or &quot;exocytosed&quot; from the cell (e.g., digestive enzymes).

===Golgi bodies===
The structure and internal function of the Golgi apparatus is quite complex and is the subject of scientific dispute. The Golgi apparatus consists, like the ER, of membranous structures. It is made up of a stack of flattened cisternae and similar vesicles. The ''cis'' face is the side facing the ER, the ''medial'' region is in the middle while the ''trans'' face is directed towards the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). The cis and trans faces have different membranous compositions.The Golgi apparatus is considered more or less the &quot;postal office&quot; of the cell. It handles all incoming lipids, proteins, etc., and controls their export as well.

===Lysosomes===
'''Lysosomes'''  contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases) to digest macromolecules. They are found in both plant and animal cells, but because animal cells also have vacuoles, animal cells contain many more lysosomes. They are built in the Golgi apparatus. At pH 4.8, the interior of the lysosomes is more acidic than the cytosol (pH 7). The lysosome single membrane stabilizes the low pH by pumping in protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the cytosol, and also protects the cytosol, and therefore the rest of the cell, from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome. The digestive enzymes need the acidic environment of the lysosome to function correctly.  For this reason, should a lysosome's acid hydrolases leak into the cytosol, their potential to damage the cell will be reduced, because they will not be at their optimum pH.  All these enzymes are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, and transported and processed through the Golgi apparatus. The Golgi apparatus produces lysosomes by budding.  Each acid hydrolase is then targeted to a lysosome. The lysosome itself is likely protected from digestion due to its unique internal 3-D structures which prevent enzymatic action{{ref|Campbell}}. 

Some important enzymes in lysosomes are:
*Lipase, which digests lipids,
*Carbohydrases, which digest carbohydrates (e.g., sugars),
*Proteases, which digest proteins,
*Nucleases, which digest nucleic acids.

===Mitochondrion===
Mitochodrion (from Greek ''mitos'' thread + ''khondrion'' granule) is an organelle found in most
eukaryotic cells, including those of plants, animals, fungi, and protists. A few cells, such as the trypanosome protozoan, have a single large mitochondrion, but usually a cell has hundreds or thousands of mitochondria. The exact number of mitochondria depends on the cell's level of metabolic activity: more activity means more mitochondria. Mitochondria can occupy up to 25% of the cell's cytosol.

Mitochondria are sometimes described as &quot;cellular power plants&quot;, because their primary function is to convert organic materials into energy in the form of ATP.

Important to note is that mitochondria are, in fact, separate cells unto themselves.  They were at one time independent prokaryotic cells living in a mutualistic prokaryotic community.  Over time, they evolved to live as ''endosymbionts'' within eukaryotic cells.  They reproduce independently of their host cells, having their own genetic material.

Mitochondrion have inner membranes composed of phospholipid bilayers.

===Nucleus===
The nucleus varies in diameter from 10 to 20 micrometres. It is enclosed by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope. The inner and outer membrane fuse at regular intervals, forming nuclear pores. The nuclear envelope regulates and facilitates transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, while separating the chemical reactions taking place in cytoplasm from reactions happening within the nucleus. The outer membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and may be studded with ribosomes. The space between the two membranes (called the &quot;perinuclear space&quot;) is continuous with the lumen of the RER. The nuclear face of the nuclear envelope is surrounded by a scaffold of filaments called the nuclear lamina.

===Peroxisomes===
'''Peroxisomes''' are ubiquitous organelles in eukaryotes that function to rid the cell of toxic substances. They consist of a single membrane that separates them from the cytoso] (the internal fluid of the cell). Peroxisomes were discovered by Christian de Duve in 1965. Unlike lysosomes, which are formed in the secretory pathway, peroxisomes usually self-replicate by enlarging and then dividing, although there is some indication new ones may be formed directly.  They also have membrane proteins that are critical for various functions, such as for importing proteins into their interiors and to proliferate and segregate into daughter cells.

Peroxisomes function to rid the cell of toxic substances, such as hydrogen peroxide, or other metabolites and contain enzymes concerned with oxygen utilization such as D-amino acid oxidase and urease oxidase.
The peroxisome contains the enzyme catalase which converts H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (hydrogen peroxide, a toxic byproduct of cellular metabolism) to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, with 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Ribosomes===
Organelle composed of rRNA (synthesized in the nucleolus) and ribosomal proteins. It translates mRNA into a polypeptide chain (e.g., a protein). 
It can be thought of as a factory that builds a protein from a set of genetic instructions. Ribosomes can float freely in the cytoplasm (the internal fluid of the cell) or bind to another organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum, or to the nuclear envelope. Since ribosomes are ribozym]s, it is thought that they might be remnants of the [[w:RNA world|RNA world]].

==Prokaryotic Cells==
[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|left|300px]]
The term &quot;prokaryote&quot; comes from the following combining terms:

'''&quot;pro&quot;''', meaning before
'''&quot;karyote&quot;''', meaning kernel (referring to the nucleus)

Thus, prokaryotes are cells that came before nuclei.  They have no membrane-bound organelles and lack a membrane-bound nucleus.  They are significantly simpler than eukaryotes.

==Nucleoid==
The nucleoid is the area of the cytoplasm where the single bacterial chromosome is located

==Ribosomes==
-Consists of RNA Molecules and proteins.
==Cell Covering==

===Cell Membrane===
In bacteria, this is also known as the plasma membrane.

===Cell Wall===
-found in plant cells, fungi, protists, and bacteria. They develop outside the plasma membrane and provide support for the cell.
===Capsule===

==Inclusion Bodies==

==Cytoplasm==

==Flagella==

==Pili==

[[File:Cell membrane detailed diagram 4.svg|thumb|400px|Illustration of a  Eukaryotic cell membrane]]

=Introduction=

The cell membrane is a semi-permeable membrane composed of all four types of macromolecules, with lipids and proteins being the most prevalent in dry weight.  The membrane is present in all cells and functions to regulate incoming and outgoing materials, maintain intracellular homeostasis, and participate in signal transduction.

=Models=

Various models have been created to help visualize the complex structure of the cellular membrane, the most famous being the fluid mosaic model, which describes the membrane as a two-dimensional &quot;sea&quot; of molecular units, and the liquid crystal model, which describes the membrane as a sea of crystals with liquid properties. 

==Fluid Mosaic==

The fluid mosaic model was developed in 1972 by S.J. Singer and Garth Nicolson.  In their report, they proposed that biological membranes can be considered as a two-dimensional fluid composed of a mosaic of molecules, the majority of which had hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (phospholipids).  Thus, the molecular interactions create a membrane that is not solid, but which behaves like a fluid as molecules change positions and has the ability to stretch and contract vertically.

==Liquid Crystal Model==

The liquid crystal model was developed in 1970 by Freye and Edinin&lt;!--Not sure about this--&gt;.  It proposes that the phospholipid bilayer behaves like a series of crystals moving in an fluid, yet ordered manner.

=Elements of the Membrane=

The phospholipid bilayer is composed of the following in dry weight:

*50% proteins
*30% lipids
*5% glycolipids
*15% other

Each element of the membrane performs a specific function in sensory transduction, transport, etc.

==Proteins==

[[File:Glicoprotein.svg|thumb|right|100px|Diagram of a glycoprotein.]]
'''&lt;big&gt;Glycoproteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Glycoproteins are transmembrane proteins with oligosaccharides covalently bonded to their amino acid chains.  Glycoproteins generally play an important role in sensory transduction, particularly with regard to immune system responses.

[[File:Polytopic membrane protein.png|thumb|left|250px|Schematic representation of transmembrane proteins: 
1. a single transmembrane α-helix (bitopic membrane protein)
2. a polytopic α-helical protein
3. a transmembrane β barrel &lt;br /&gt;
The membrane is represented in light brown.]]
'''&lt;big&gt;Transmembrane Proteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Transmembrane proteins are proteins that extend through the membrane, having both an exterior and an interior domain.  They are integral proteins, meaning they are permanently bonded to the PLB.  Many function as hormone/signal acceptors, ion channels, and transport proteins.  As a rule, they act as channels between the intra- and extracellular spaces.

There are two structural categories of transmembrane protein:

::#'''Alpha-helical''', those composed of repeating hydrogen bonds that make up alpha helices on the secondary level of structure
::#'''Beta barrel''', those which have repeating hydrogen bonds that form pleated sheets

Alpha-helical make up the largest group, with beta barrel proteins found primarily in mitochondrial and other prokaryotic gram-positive membranes.



'''&lt;big&gt;Peripheral Proteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Peripheral proteins are proteins that are bonded by weaker interactions to either the interior or the exterior of the membrane.  Their loose bonds allow them to detach and function as secondary messengers or extracellular messengers upon receipt of a signal from the cell.  Some prominent functions are in metabolism and in sensory transduction.

==Lipids==

'''&lt;big&gt;Phospholipids&lt;/big&gt;'''

Phospholipids are the &quot;glue&quot; that gives the membrane its distinct structure.  Their amphipathic nature and tendency to create micelles in water were likely the origin of the first cells.

'''&lt;big&gt;Glycolipids&lt;/big&gt;'''

Glycolipids are lipids with attached carbohydrates.  Their most prominent function is providing extracellular support to form tissues in multicellular organisms.

'''&lt;big&gt;Cholesterols&lt;/big&gt;'''

Cholesterol molecules are lipids distinguished by their four-ring structure.  In the membrane, they act to resist as a type of &quot;anti-freeze&quot; to prevent freezing and overheating.

=Transmembrane Transport=

==Passive==

'''&lt;big&gt;Osmosis and Diffusion&lt;/big&gt;'''


[[File:AQP-channel.png|thumb|300px|'''Schematic depiction of water movement through the narrow selectivity filter of the aquaporin channel.''']]
'''&lt;big&gt;Porin Proteins&lt;/big&gt;'''

Okay.  I'm jumping in on this one.  I'm going to hit the character sketches first, then go to the synopsis.  One question for those of you watching this module: I could do a synopsis of just a few paragraphs, or I could hit this chapter by chapter.  Which is preferred?  I'll look at entries for other novels and see what common practice is, I guess.  This novel is too great to be so poorly represented here.   -- [[User:Mitchell K Dwyer|Mitchell K Dwyer]] 09:58, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

Use [[Template:Wikipediapar]] if the article on Wikipedia has a different name than the name of the module you've placed the template on.
For example, [[Horn/General/Players/Dennis Brain]] needed to have this template linking to its complementary article on Wikipedia. Wikipedia's article ([[Wikipedia:Dennis Brain]]) is named &quot;Dennis Brain&quot;, ''not'' &quot;Horn/General/Players/Dennis Brain&quot;. The appropriate template code in this instance is:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
'''Do''' use two |'s.
[[User:Ross Uber|Ross Uber]] 04:34, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

:You should not have changed the template parameters without a previous consensus. Now there are broken usages of this template. At least you should update the template instantiations after changing it. But in any case I don't agree with the change given that the usual case is that the wikibook name does not match the Wikipedia article because of supages or namespaces. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:43, 13 May 2005 (UTC)
::Okay. I wasn't aware that modules were using this template as it appeared to be very broken. It ''appeared'' to be broken because the method of using it is completely different from how it is used on Wikipedia. Trying to use it on my module using the Wikipedia code method failed. These templates should be the same across sister projects so confused people like me don't screw them up with the wrong code in articles/modules. And, anyway, there ''should'' be two different templates (one for when wikibook name matches wikipedia article, one for when they don't match). [[User:Ross Uber|Ross Uber]] 00:36, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

:::I agree with your last sentence. Go and create the version with the same title, but this one should stay as it currently stands. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:17, 17 May 2005 (UTC)
:I have restored the use of one parameter because almost all the pages using this template were broken. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:17, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}} {{Wikipedia|Dennis Brain}}
I agree that it would be less confusing if Wikipedia and Wikibooks had consistent templates. But I'm still mystified as to why there are 2 templates.
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}} {{Wikipedia|Dennis Brain}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
both look identical to me. Couldn't both Wikipedia and Wikibooks each use a single template ?
Then the explaination would be much simpler.
The explanation (on the talk page) would say:
:On Wikipedia, type
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikibooks||Astronomy}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:to refer to a Wikibook (or a particular page in that book).
:On Wikibooks, type
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Wikipedia||Electronics}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:to refer to a Wikipedia article.
(Further down, the talk page would discuss &quot;Optional, advanced details&quot; about putting more stuff in-between the vertical lines).

You'd have no way of knowing I've spent most of my wikibooks time lately programming esoteric templates ([[Template:Navlist/Doc|yonder]]).

Here's one way I've thought of that ought to work to ''some'' extent, thought it could take some tinkering and would, I think, always be a kludge.  Modify the first version (the one using urlencode) by replacing each
:&lt;nowiki&gt;{{urlencode:{{{1|{{SUBPAGENAME}}}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
with a call to #titlepart on a call to localurl.  The uncomfortable part of this is that #titlepart has to remove the correct number of slash-separated fields &amp;mdash; either you have to build the expected number of slashes into the template, or you have to test for it and you can still only build in a finite number of possible numbers of slashes.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 19:57, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

Why is the search in the link. Wikipedia will automatically search if it's not found. Perhaps Wikipedia did not used to? Would seem that the seem in this template could now be removed. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 14:38, 14 February 2009 (UTC)

: Wikipedia doesn't automatically do a search if the page is not found when following a link (for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobiz or [[w:Foobiz]]). I see a message saying &quot;'''Wikipedia does not have an article with this exact name'''&quot;, if you see otherwise perhaps you are using a Gadget? Wikipedia will only automatically search if the page is not found when clicking go from the search toolbar or when using the search special page, which is what this template does. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:01, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

{{Wikipediapar||Dennis Brain}}
Dennis Brain was born into an already-famous horn-playing family in 1921. His father, Aubrey, his uncle, Alfred Jr., and his grandfather, Alfred Sr. all played professionally. Brain began his career by playing second to his father. For a time after WWII, Brain led the horn sections in the Philharmonia and Royal Philharmonic. Brain made several solo recordings, including the Strauss and Mozart horn concertos.

Brain died in a car accident while returning to London from the Edinburgh Festival. It is unfortunate that the world lost a great horn player at such a young age. [http://hornsociety.org/RESOURCES/famous/D-Brain.html]

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Legend. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Legend~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Renamed ==

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

Меня зовут Александр Лозовюк, я присоединился к сообществу Wikipedia недавно, 13.05.2005, хотя активно слежу за развитием проекта. 

Хочу пока представить на суд общественности некоторые свои работы, в частности книгу, которую я начал писать, но, к сожалению, в настоящее время не уверен, что смогу закончить ее. Поэтому было решено пока выложить ее в свободном виде.</text>

There is nothing like a =~ operator. Use either the regex module (cf. http://www.amk.ca/python/howto/regex/), or a string function. Often, the string's .find() method will do.

===No need to make sweeping commitments===
Uh, pals, there's no need to make huge promises if you're not going to fulfill them. Just do the work you can. There's no pressure here. If you can't do it all, do some and leave the rest to the future. --[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 03:14, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

===Labs===
If it's alright, I'll do all the labs around the end of April. Someone should probably check over them briefly, but I should get it mostly correct. After all, I'll be writing these to make sure I know it all for the AP exam!&lt;br&gt;[[User:Rroepke|Rroepke]] 6 January 2006

===Framework created===
I've created the framework, and I hope to write 1 article per month, complete with graphics.  Along the way, I'll be updating the [[Biology]] wikibook.  Please feel free to add!&lt;br&gt;[[User:Cnelson|Cnelson]] 19:39, 13 May 2005 (UTC)

=Structure=

Each article of the Study Guide should include a &quot;Keywords&quot; section, preferably at the top of the page. Once one article is 100%, we'll decide upon a more parmanent standard structure and style.  Suggestions for an additional articles should be run through this talk page first, and any major structural changes should receive a couple days of warning.  The current structure looks something like this:

 '''Contents'''
 ''The 12 AP National Labs''
  Overview
    1. Diffusion and Osmosis
    2. Enzyme Catalysis
    3. Mitosis and Meiosis
    4. Plant Pigments and Photosynthesis
    5. Cell Respiration
    6. Molecular Biology
    7. Genetics of Organisms
    8. Population Genetics and Evolution
    9. Transpiration
    10. Physiology of the Circulatory System

    4. The Chemical Building Blocks of Life - &lt;small&gt;From organic macromolecules to chemical structure&lt;/small&gt;
 ''Part II: Biology of the Cell''
    5. Cell Structure - &lt;small&gt;Organelles and their function&lt;/small&gt;
    6. Membranes - &lt;small&gt;Phospholipid bilayer and how molecules cross it&lt;/small&gt;
    7. Cell-Cell Interactions
 ''Part III: Energetics''
    8. Energy and Metabolism - &lt;small&gt;Heterotroph, autotrophs, ATP, and aerobic respirations!&lt;/small&gt;

 ''Part VIII: Organismal Biology''
    21. Taxonomy
    22. Plants
    23. Animal Structures and Functions
    24. Animal Behavior

=Style=
For all Study Guide articles, begin with (edit this page to view formatting):

[[AP Biology|Contents]] | [[AP Biology:name|Previous Chapter]] | [[AP Biology:name|Next Chapter]]
----
'''Study Time''' | ''X minutes''. &lt;small&gt;(explain what to focus on.)&lt;/small&gt;

==Keywords==
&lt;pre&gt;
{|
|-
|[[#link|name]] || [[#link|name]]
|-
|[[#link|name]] || [[#link|name]]
|-
|[[#link|name]] || [[#link|name]]
|-
|[[#link|name]] || [[#link|name]]
|-
|[[#link|name]] || [[#link|name]]
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Replace ''link'' with the section name where it is mentioned, or create one with &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;LINK&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; if it is a long section. See [[AP_Biology/The_Science_of_Biology|here]] for an example.

== Proposed rename ==

I'd like to rename all the pages in this book so they begin with &quot;AP Biology/&quot; as opposed to &quot;AP Biology:&quot;. This would make this book consistent with the naming policy for new books and with the naming convention used for other books. I trust this change would be non-controversial, but I note this proposal here in advance of any move so that if anyone wishes to make a comment, they can, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 13:28, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

== Let's try... ==

You can import some of these chapters from General Biology and then edit them, right? [[User:68.4.3.164|68.4.3.164]] 21:25, 27 October 2007 (UTC)

== Forgotten? ==

Is anyone else working on adding content to this book?  We need attention from an expert- I've noticed many errors and have done my best to correct them. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Bradfordw|Bradfordw]] ([[User talk:Bradfordw|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Bradfordw|contribs]]) 18:15, 25 July 2008&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Did you fix a spelling error? Write an article? Create a pretty image?  If you answered yes to any of these, or made any other tiny contribution to the AP Biology wikibook, please sign your name here:

:[[User:cnelson|cnelson]] - Haha... I'm the first contributor.  I started this out of a desire to learn biology, but not wanting to go out and buy a review book, as I felt it was inadequate for the price.  I have since taken the AP Biology test, and must say I was well prepared.  Waiting for my score now.

:[[User:rroepke|rroepke]] - I found this page while looking for study guides to AP Bio. I have written some of the things in here. I am currently taking AP Bio, and taking the exam in May.

:[[User:ccny930|ccny930]] - Well, I'm not taking AP Biology anytime soon, but I've decided to contribute what little I know. That amounts to spelling corrections and adding definitions. Still, I hope this project expands so that I can learn more about biology at a college level.

:[[User:Werdan7|Werdan7]]

== Addition of Matrices ==
Two matrices can be added together only if they have the same dimensions (the same number of rows and columns).  The resultant matrix is simply the matrix whose elements are the sum of the elements in the two matrices that were added together.  If a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is added to a matrix &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and the resultant matrix is &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
  5 &amp; 1 &amp; 7 \\
  3 &amp; 9 &amp; 4 \\
  0 &amp; -2 &amp; 6
\end{pmatrix}
 +
\begin{pmatrix}
  3 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\
  7 &amp; 1 &amp; -3 \\
  4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6
\end{pmatrix}
 =
\begin{pmatrix}
  8 &amp; 3 &amp; 11 \\
  10 &amp; 10 &amp; 1 \\
  4 &amp; 3 &amp; 12
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Multiplication of Matrices ==
[[Image:Matrix multiplication diagram.PNG|left]]
Two matrices may be multiplied together only if the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the rows in the second matrix.  That is, if the first matrix is &lt;math&gt;n \times m&lt;/math&gt;, then the second matrix must be &lt;math&gt;m \times p&lt;/math&gt;.  The resulting matrix will have a dimension of &lt;math&gt;n \times p&lt;/math&gt;, where each element is the sum of the products of the entries in a row of the first matrix with the entries of the corresponding column in the second matrix.  If &lt;math&gt;C=AB&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^na_{ik}b_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;.

Although matrix multiplication is not commutative, it is associative, which means that ('''AB''')'''C'''='''A'''('''BC'''). Since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the order of the factors must be specified. '''AB''' would be read as &quot;'''A''' post-multiplied by '''B'''&quot; or &quot;'''B''' premultiplied by '''A'''.&quot; Matrix multiplication obeys the distributive property, so '''A'''('''B'''+'''C''')='''AB'''+'''AC'''. Also, two nonzero matrices do not necessarily have a nonzero product.

There is no such thing as &quot;Matrix Division&quot;. To divide out a matrix, you need first to obtain the '''inverse''' of the matrix, and then multiply by the inverse. We discuss inverses below.

== Transpose ==

To obtain the '''transpose''' of a matrix, we swap the rows and the columns of that matrix. If we have a matrix X, the transpose is denoted X&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. For example:

:&lt;math&gt;X = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\ 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;X^T = \begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 4 &amp; 7 \\ 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\ 3 &amp; 6 &amp; 9 \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Determinant ==

The determinant of a matrix, X is denoted by |X|. 

== Inverse Matrix ==

If the matrix has a non-zero determinant, the matrix is said to be '''invertable'''. Inverse matrices follow the given formula:

:&lt;math&gt;XX^{-1} = X^{-1}X = I&lt;/math&gt;

Where I is the identity matrix.</text>

----

The pluperfect (''el pluscuamperfecto de indicativo'') is similar to the present perfect, but implies that an action had already occurred at a given time. For example:

:I had already bought a newspaper. ''Yo ya había comprado un periódico.''

It is formed, similar to the present perfect, using the imperfect form of [[../Haber/]] with a [[../Past Participle/|past participle]] of the action verb. ''Había'' is the first-person imperfect form of '''Haber''' and ''comprado'' is the past participle of '''Comprar'''. It is often used with the adverb ''ya'' which means &quot;already,&quot; indicating that the condition occurred in the past.

Examples:

:Tú ya habías mirado la película. ''You had already seen the movie.''
:Ella ya había hecho las galletes. ''She had already made the cookies.''
:Nosotros habíamos viajado a España. ''We had traveled to Spain.''
:Vosotros habíais sacado fotos. ''You (plural, familiar) had taken picture.''
:Ellos ya habían perdido el libro. ''They had already lost the book.''

==Para cuando==

The '''pluperfect''' is often used with clauses beginning in ''para cuando'' which means &quot;by the time that.&quot;  The verb following ''para cuando'' is conjugated in the [[../Present Subjunctive|present subjunctive form]]. For example:

:Ud. se había comido la merienda para cuando llegó al cine.
::''You (singular, formal) had eaten the snack by the time that you arrived at the theatre.''
:¿Habías terminado la tarea para cuando tu amigo te llamó?
::''Had you finished your homework by the time that your friend called you?''

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Electrodynamics}}


== Introduction ==

Many objects in this universe are conservative, the charge of the universe for instance always remains constant. This is called ''Global Conservation of Charge''. But also, if you take a defined area, then the charge in that also remains constant unless some is leaving through its boundary. And if some charge is moving through the boundary, then it must be equal to the change in charge in the volume. Just like if you and your friends are in a room, you cannot just not be in the room, you must go out the door.

This is called ''Local Conservation of Charge''.

== Charge Conservation ==

Let's look at the total charge enclosed by a volume V:

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{enc}(t) = \int_V \rho (\mathbf{r}) dV &lt;/math&gt;

We'll say that the charge inside V changes according to the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = \int_V \frac{\partial \rho (\mathbf{r})}{\partial t} dV &lt;/math&gt;

We could consider a current through a closed service, the boundary of V ( &lt;math&gt; \partial V &lt;/math&gt; ) for example, which would be

:&lt;math&gt; I = \int_{ \partial V } \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} dS &lt;/math&gt;

We can now bring in the equation &lt;math&gt; I = \frac{dQ}{dt} &lt;/math&gt; and relate it to the enclosed charge. We see that the corresponding equation is

:&lt;math&gt; - \frac{dQ_{enc}}{dt} = \int_{ \partial V } \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} dS &lt;/math&gt;

Because there positive flux of the current density (charge leaving V) when the enclosed charge is decreasing.

We see that

:&lt;math&gt; - \int_V \frac{\partial \rho (\mathbf{r})}{\partial t} dV = \int_{ \partial V } \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{n}} dS &lt;/math&gt;

Then by using the divergence theorem on the right hand side, we get the law of '''local conservation of charge''' or the '''continuity equation'''.

{{eqn|Law of Local Conservation of Charge}}
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d\rho}{dt} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

== Conservation of Energy ==

{{eqn|Law of Conservation of Energy}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t} (u_{mechanical} + u_{electro magnetic}) = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf S&lt;/math&gt;

Where 

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf S = \frac{1}{\mu_0} (\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{b})&lt;/math&gt;</text>

'''Notes:''' (1) &lt;s&gt;strikethrough&lt;/s&gt; letters are often silent in everyday speech. (2) Words in parenthesis are the spoken form. When they appear in text, they are colloquial on the same level as &quot;gonna&quot; or &quot;wanna&quot; in English. 

&quot;Second person plural&quot; means &quot;second person ''plural''.&quot; In Swedish there has been a marked difference between usage in Finland-Swedish compared to in Sweden. While the form Ni (noted as formal above) has remained the common respectful address in Finland-Swedish, it was until the 1960s considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude in Sweden, where addressing in 3rd person with repetition of name and title was considered proper and respectful. After that the usage swiftly changed in Sweden, and the 2nd person du (noted as informal above) came to dominate totally, until recently when in the late 1990s a usage resembling that in German, Finnish or Finland-Swedish has become popular among the youngest adults as a kind of false archaism. It is also now common to see Du capitalized in places where the formal Ni would have been used before, such as in printed instructions or on signs.

==Examples==
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; spacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

* No, the apples are mine.
* She gave the apple to him.

* He did not share the apple with her. &lt;br&gt; They did not eat it together.
* Their suitcase is heavy. Ours is light.
* But our dogs can eat your dogs.
* Your beautiful blue hands are not as strong as mine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page details some brief strategies for securing a wireless network
== SSID Broadcast ==
By default, most access points will automatically broadcast their [[w:Service set identifier|SSID]] so that the network can be more easily detected and configured.  For example the default SSID for many Linksys products is ''linksys''.
*One of the first things that you should do when setting up your wireless network is to change the default SSID from whatever the manufacturer set to something that is easy to understand and easy to identify as yours (e.g., your street address).
*Disabling SSID broadcast (as recommended in some articles) won't stop an experienced [[../Wardriving|wardriver]], and is ''not'' a significant contribution to security. Worse, it can make it harder to manage the network. Instead, focus on [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]].

== MAC Address Filtering ==
Another security feature commonly included with modern routers is the idea of MAC Address filtering.  The basic concept being that the administrator explicitly lists all of MAC addresses allowed to connect to the wireless LAN.  A great idea in theory: because all MAC addresses are, by standard, supposed to be globally unique.  One would have to go through a bit of trouble finding all of these addresses, but once in place, it is a system that needs very little attention.  Unfortunately, there are a number of problems with a network that is only MAC filtered.

The primary problem is that network traffic remains completely unencrypted.  Any passwords, e-mails, or other sensitive information is sent completely in the clear, thus leaving it highly vulnerable to the most cursory of snoops.  Also, it is very easy to modify the MAC address of a network adaptor through simple system registry changes (At least, in Windows XP.)

The real kicker is, any packet on the network that isn't a broadcast from the router contains the MAC address of a computer that can communicate to it!  Again, with a very cursory sniffing, it is easily possible for an attacker to build a list of MAC addresses that can communicate to the router, then simply change his adapter's address to match one not currently in use.

MAC address filtering is ''not'' a significant contribution to security. Instead, focus on [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]].

== Encryption ==
There are two main standards for encryption of wifi networks: WEP and WPA.

=== WEP ===
WEP stands for Wired Equivalant Privacy.

WEP is the most commonly used encryption standard.  It supports key lengths of 40 bits and 104 bits.

WEP has some major security flaws:
*It uses the RC4 cipher
*A wifi network that uses WEP can be passively cracked
WEP should be avoided unless it is the only available option.  It provides insufficient protection against crackers, and provides only a false sense of security.

When using WEP, the network key should be changed on a regular basis.

=== [[w:Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] ===

WPA was created by [[w:The Wi-Fi Alliance|The Wi-Fi Alliance]], an industry trade group, to address the serious weaknesses of WEP.

==== WPA-Enterprise ====

WPA-Enterprise uses an authentication server to distribute keys to each wireless user.  It can be expensive to implement and may not be necessary for homes or small offices.

==== WPA-Personal (WPA-PSK) ====

WPA-PSK stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access - Preshared Key.  It is a simplified version of the more complicated and expensive WPA-Enterprise protocol.

WPA-PSK allows for a passphrase of up to 63 characters to be specifed, that a user must provide before connecting to a network.  The passphrase should be a minimum of 14 random characters, or more than 20 non-random characters.  It provides several major improvements over WEP.

It uses a system called Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to distribute keys based on the passphrase to each user, and these keys are automatically updated at a specific interval.

=== WPA2 ===

An improved and more robust version of WPA.  This form of encryption is based on the AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) form of encryption.  It is even harder to break than the original WPA encryption method. Again it is available in Enterprise and PreShared Key versions

==Selecting a Good Password==
WPA and WPA2 depend on a &quot;passphrase&quot; (also known as a Pre Shared Key or PSK). Like any other, its strength depends almost solely on its complexity. Good WPA passphrases should be long compared to other passwords, and extremely confusing. The more nonsensical your passphrase, the better.  Actual words are not recommended, unless in a very long sentence.  For examples,

 f7S9^jeiF9ratt4-esttM8,25.4nZ8s

is more secure than the passphrase

 fff4526----354

which is better than

 4352354frewch

which is better than

 sdfnvuihgwkjsgdf

which is better than

 toaster

etc.

Finally, remember you will probably only need to enter this once (When you first set up your network and computers), so you can make it really strong and write it down rather than try and remember it. Just make sure you don't lose the paper, but keep it safe somewhere.

Note: ''Ett'' is neuter, ''en'' is uter; &quot;the digit 1&quot; is &quot;siffran ett&quot; in Swedish. Especially when counting, four is often pronounced as ''fyr''. ''Nio'' and ''tio'' are commonly pronounced as ''nie'', ''tie'', respectively. ''Tjugo'' is usually spelled ''tjugi'', and so on with the following multiples of ten (''tretti'' instead of ''trettio'', ''förti'' instead of ''fyrtio'' , etc.). Forty is never pronounced the way it is spelled (fyrtio), it becomes ''förti(o)''.

Note: To make numbers between these, you add a number 1-9 ''not'' in parenthesis, e.g. 55 is ''femtiofem'', 73rd is ''sjuttiotredje''. However, ''tjugo '' is in this case commonly pronounced as ''tju'', e.g. ''tjuåtta'' for 28. The -''tio'' ending is commonly pronounced as -''ti'' but ''not'' in the parenthesis case. ''Fyrtio'' is pronounced as ''förti'' and sometimes written as ''förtio''. One commonly only say ''etthundra'' to distinguish it from e.g. ''tvåhundra''. As you might have guessed, Swedish uses the same system for large numbers as e.g. the UK, ''not'' the system used in the US.

Some days my English is rather nuanced and witty; other days it has gone hiding under the sofa with all the dust bunnies, where I do not dare to try recollecting it.

Moreover, a cow is probably more skilled in explaining grammar than I am. But I'll write many examples instead. Hopefully, people will ask when they don't see the picture.</text>

(*) ''These are nouns but &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; adjectives, one commonly add -färgad or -färgat to make an adjective/adverb out of them.

Adding ''ljus''- or ''mörk''- to the color means &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;, respectively, e.g. ''ljusgrön'' (light green) or ''mörkblå'' (dark blue). It is common to combine colors, e.g. ''rödbrun'' or ''gröngul''. The first color is commonly the one thought to be most dominant. The same system is used to make colors similar to that of some well known element, e.g. ''sandgul'' (sand yellow) or ''havsblå'' (ocean blue or navy blue).

I'm a Math/Philosophy major by profession, with serious interests in theoretical and statistical physics, computer science, and foreign languages.

I am literate in English, French, and Japanese.

I joined wikibooks to help flesh out the [[Theoretical Mechanics]] wikibook.  Normally you'll find me roaming on Everything2 as eien_meru.

I'm still very new to wikimedia-style noding, so please forgive me if I screw things up on the outset.</text>

''Gyah, that does seem to be the case.  Perhaps someone should just make a Vector Analysis Wikibook and the others could link to that in their appendix.  Enough things in college-level maths require it as a prerequisite anyways, and you're certainly right that it seems silly for each wikibook to reinvent the wheel in different (and possibly inconsistent) ways.''

''Sorry, I'm really new here, and this book just caught my eye.  It seems like the pure math courses in Wikiversity would be a good place to put a primer for Vector Algebra, though... --[[User:Eienmaru|Eienmaru]] 23:48, 14 May 2005 (UTC)''

== Early American Peoples ==

One of the most interesting and difficult topics in American History is who arrived here and when. For example, the role of the Mousterian culture in the advent of Folsom points, the very early archaeological finds now being made, differentiating Athabascan arrivals from initial Asian origins. There ought to be a subject item covering those issues.


**

Just a suggestion, divide up the more significant segments of this section into their own respective articles (rather than having one Americas superarticle), in the same line as china and such were split. The Inka and their predecessors were very isolated. The entirety of the Amazon basin can be sorted into its own group as well. Going further north, the major section really were middle america and the american southeast (Missippians, &amp; their successors).</text>

* Aim for a second language English speaker
** keep sentences short
** explain all new concepts as simply as possible
** don't think you can't use terminology but it must be introduced - the real key is to keep sentences short and introduce things slowly

* When in doubt about if something fits the syllabus look at [[FHSST_Computer_Literacy/To_do|To do]] and check the ~Must include~ list

* If you think that something important is missing include it, but we must not exclude anything that is in the syllabus

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Salleman. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Salleman~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adverbs are generally made by putting an ending -''t'' to an adjective. If the adjective ends with a ''d'', then the ''d'' is changed to a ''t'', except when the vowel has a shorter length, then it becomes -''tt''. Historically, it would have become -''dt'' no matter what, this is still the case in Danish. If the adjective ends with a ''t'', one adds a new ''t'' and shorten the length of the vowel.  If the ending is -''n'', then the ''n'' is changed into a ''t''.

Note however, that also adjectives acquires the same ending if the noun is neuter instead of uter. The comparative and superlative forms are the same as for an adjective.

===Examples===
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; spacing=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
:'''Svenska'''
* Skyskrapan är hög. Jag hoppar högt.
* Bilen är snabb. Jag springer snabbt.
* Sångerskan är sorgsen, därför sjunger hon sorgset.
* Blommorna är vackra. I gryningen är de särskilt vackra.
* Tack, det var snällt. Det vill säga, det var snällt sagt.
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
:'''English'''
* The skyscraper is high. I jump high.
* The car is fast. I run fast.
* The (female) singer is sorrowful, therefore she sings sorrowfully.
* The flowers are beautiful. At dawn they are especially beautiful.
* Thank you, that was kind. That is (to say), it was kindly said.
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Note that ''därför'' is not a formal word in Swedish, and would probably be translated as &quot;that's why&quot; in the sentence above.

A '''bundt cake pan''' gives a tall round cake with a hole in the middle. Without the hole, the outside of the cake would burn before the inside of the cake cooks.

While bundt pans were originally Bavarian (German), Nordic Ware (US) made them popular in the 1950s. There are 35 (or more) patterns of bundt pans in existence.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Conjugate ===

The rule for comparison of adjectives is: -''are'' for comparative and -''ast'' for superlative.

'''ful, fulare, fulast''' (ugly, uglier, ugliest)

'''rolig, roligare, roligast''' (funny, funnier, funniest)

'''röd, rödare, rödast''' (red, more red, most red)



Many adjectives are on the form: [noun]ig or [noun]sk or [noun]isk. This is akin to English [noun]y or [noun]ic or [noun]ish [noun]ean. The -''g'' is silent in everyday speech, thus: &quot;Ja blir toki, nä tokiast!&quot; (I'm going crazy, no craziest!). As in English, long words are often compared by means of ''mer'' (more) and ''mest'' (most).

For example: Snabb (fast), snabbare (faster), snabbast (fastest); tokig (crazy), tokigare (crazier), tokigast (craziest); excentrisk (eccentric), mer excentrisk, mest excentrisk.

A famous Swedish tongue-twisters is the neuter adjective or adverb ''västkustskt''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Sv-v%C3%A4stkustskt.ogg].
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The adjectives are affected by the [[Swedish/Nouns|nouns]] they describe, both depending on singular/plural and gender. For example:

'''ful''' (ugly)&lt;br/&gt;
ful [singular uter noun] (''en ful get'' -- an ugly goat)&lt;br/&gt;
fult [singular neuter noun] (''ett fult får'' -- an ugly sheep)&lt;br/&gt;
fula [plural noun] (''några fula getter och fula får'' -- some ugly goats and ugly sheep)&lt;br/&gt;

'''rolig''' (funny)&lt;br/&gt;
rolig [singular uter noun] (''en rolig lek'' -- a fun[ny] (children's) play)&lt;br/&gt;
roligt [singular neuter noun] (''ett roligt spel'' -- a fun[ny] game)&lt;br/&gt;
roliga [plural noun] (''många roliga spel och lekar'' -- many funny games and plays) &lt;br/&gt;

'''röd''' (red)&lt;br/&gt;
röd [singular uter noun] (''en röd stuga'' -- a red cabin)&lt;br/&gt;
rött [singular neuter noun] (''ett rött hus'' -- a red house)&lt;br/&gt;
röda [plural noun] (''en massa röda hus och stugor'' -- a lot of red houses and cabins)&lt;br/&gt;

Adverbs(usually ending in -ly in English) are formed by using the singular neuter form of the adjective. Example: ''Tåget går väldigt långsamt'' (the train is going very slowly).



'''Some irregular (''oregelbundna'') Swedish adjectives:'''
* Liten '''or''' små, mindre, minst. (Little or small)
* Stor, större, störst. (Big or large)
* Långsam, långsammare, långsammast. (Slow)
* Dålig, sämre, sämst. (Bad)
* Gammal, äldre, äldst. (Old)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Developed to reduce the mite population of that hive. It is placed on the  bottom of the hive box. Sticky paper can be placed underneath the box to observe the number of mites that fall through the screen. If a plain floor is used below the SBB, a gap of around 2&quot; (5cm) will prevent any mites returning to the hive.

[[/Introduction|Välkommen!]] ''Welcome!''

Swedish ({{Audio|Sv-svenska.ogg|''svenska''}}) is a ''North Germanic language'' spoken predominantly in ''Sweden'', part of ''Finland'', and on the autonomous island ''Åland'', by a total of over 10 million speakers.

Standard Swedish is the national language, which has evolved from the Central Swedish dialects from the 19th century and was well-established by the first decades of the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties still exist, influenced by the older dialects, both the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized. Some of the genuine dialects differ considerably from the standard language in grammar and vocabulary and are not always mutually intelligible with Standard Swedish. They are mostly confined to individual communities and have been in decline during the past century. Though not facing imminent extinction, and often encouraged by local authorities, they are usually confined to rural areas in population of low education and social mobility.

Swedish is distinguished by its prosody, which varies considerably between the various varieties and includes both lexical stress and some tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory, with a total of 9 separate vowels that are distinguished by quantity and to some degree quality, making up a total of 17 vowel phonemes. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, [ɧ], found in most varieties, but has not been found in any other language.

Swedish is closely related to, and usually mutually intelligible with, [[Danish]] and [[Norwegian]], and to some degree with ''Faroese''; all of which evolved from ''Old Norse'' about a millennium ago. It is also closely related to ''Icelandic'', though the two are not mutually intelligible. Swedish, Danish, and Norwegian ''Bokmål'', which are all considered ''East Scandinavian languages'', have been strongly influenced by ''Low German''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the sje sound (''sje-ljudet'') in {{Audio|sv-sjok.ogg|''sjok''}}, /ɧu:k/, &quot;batch&quot;

And this is the tje sound (''tje-ljudet'') in {{Audio|sv-kjol.ogg|''kjol''}}, /ɕu:l/, &quot;skirt&quot;

Now, what you ''really'' should hold in mind when it comes to ''sje'' is that it is not ''tje''; and what you ''really'' should think about when it comes to ''tje'' is that it is not ''sje''. As long as you use some 'darker' sound for ''sje'' and some brighter sound for ''tje'', that's fine. For example, use a German ''ach-Laut'', the voiced postalveolar fricative found in ''mea&lt;u&gt;'''s'''&lt;/u&gt;ure'' or the dark ''sh'' in ''shoe'' for ''sje'', and a German ''ich-laut'' or the bright ''sh'' in ''shimmering'' for ''tje''. Some Swedish dialects come ''very'' close to these sounds for their ''sje''’s and ''tje''’s.

I disagree with your dates of the Romantic Era as being 1825-1945. While it is true that several composers during the first 45 years of the 20th century composed in a distinctly Romantic style (e.g. Rachmanioff), these composers are generally considered to be &quot;neo-romantics,&quot; not &quot;late romantics.&quot; The techniques they use contain clear contemporary influences. Additionally, while several composers continued in this style, the general trend moved to the more atonal contemporary era. I did, however, modify my original endpoint of 1900 to 1905 to conform with the dates given by wikipedia.

== Possible Consolidation ==

Hi there, please have a look at the work I have just completed on [[Western Music History]]. Unfortunatly I did not know that this book was in existance when I started work on [[Western Music History]]. Perhaps we could consolidate our work. However, the writing is very rough at the moment. But still have a look and see what you think.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}}

==Ingredients==

* 250g of [[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]
* 1 tbsp [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]]
* 1 lb [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallots]] (12-15 large)
* 1/2 tsp of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]], [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]], [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1.5 cups of [[Cookbook:Chicken Stock|chicken stock]]
* 1/4 cup of [[Cookbook:Heavy Cream|heavy cream]]
* 1 cup tightly packed [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]] ([[Cookbook:Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Cookbook:Sage|sage]], [[Cookbook:Thyme|thyme]], [[Cookbook:Marjoram|marjoram]], [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]], [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]])
* 500g [[Cookbook:Fusilli|fusilli]]
* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1.5 cups [[Cookbook:Parmigiano Reggiano|parmigiano reggiano]]

==Procedure==

# Place pancetta in a large sauté pan and cook over medium-low heat stirring occasionally until crisp about 15 minutes. Using a slotted spoon remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Set aside. Pour off all but 1 T of the fat.
# Add butter to the fat in the pan. Add garlic, shallots and sugar and season lightly with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to lowest setting and cook covered until shallots are soft and transparent about 15 minutes. Remove lid raise heat to medium high and cook stirring constantly until they have a deep golden-brown coating about 10 minutes. Do not allow to burn.
# Add the stock and simmer until reduced by one-third stirring to loosen brown bits from bottom of pan about 7 minutes. The sauce can be prepared up to this point several hours ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator. 
# Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Reheat the shallot mixture if it was prepared in advance. If using add cream to shallots and simmer for 2 minutes over high heat until sauce thickens slightly. Keep warm. Coarsely chop all but a small handful of herbs.
# Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and return to pot. Add chopped herbs to sauce and cook for another minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add pasta to sauce and toss together over low heat for 1 minute. As pasta and sauce heat, sauté remaining herbs in 1/2 t olive oil until crisp for garnish. Stir in pancetta and 1/2 C of the grated cheese. Divide the pasta among 4 bowls. Garnish with sautéed herbs. Serve remaining cheese on the side.

This makes 4-6 servings.

==Variations and Additions==

Given the strong and flavorful nature of this dish, when choosing a meat or other food to go along with this you must keep in mind that the two must not overpower each other. Grilling a small medallion of sirloin steak with garlic and red wine would go along perfectly with this, or perhaps a seared pork tenderloin medallion with white wine and ground pepper.
