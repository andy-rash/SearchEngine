[[image:GENtle_database.png|thumb|Databases.]]
The GENtle database management dialog is where sequences are stored and retrieved. DNA and amino acid sequences, primers, alignments, and projects all go to databases, which can be local (for one computer only) or shared (used by the whole work group, institute, etc.).

== Management ==
The &quot;Management&quot; tab can be reached through the ''File'' menu, the ''Tools/Manage database'' menu, the &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-O&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl-S&lt;/tt&gt; keys (&quot;open&quot; and &quot;save&quot;, respectively), or the appropriate buttons in the toolbar. The tab consists of two or three parts:

=== Filter ===
The filter section allows to filter the database entries so the list(s) below show only the matching entries.

The filter text box limits the shown sequences to those whose name (or description or sequence, depending on the checkboxes) contain that text. Multiple search words are separated by a space (&quot; &quot;) and work as a logical AND. Thus, entering &quot;pgex igf&quot; in the filter text box shows only those sequences whose name (or description) contain both the word &quot;pgex&quot; and &quot;igf&quot;. The search in not case-sensitive, so searching for &quot;igf&quot; or &quot;IGF&quot; will make no difference.

The checkboxes on the right limit the display to any combination of DNA, protein (amino acid sequences), and primers. If non of these is selected, all types of entries are shown, including alignments. As already described, search for text can be extended beyond the sequence name to description and the sequence itself through two other checkboxes, where description search is enabeled as default.

=== Lists ===
One or two lists are shown, depending on the appropriate checkbox above the left list. The database(s) to search/display can be selected via the drop-down box(es). One list with full width is good for an overview of a single database, whereas two lists are needed for moving and copying entries between databases; also, a search will be run on both databases simultaneously.

Entries will be sorted alphabetically. Every entry has a small icon associated with its type. There are icons for DNA, amino acid sequences, primers, and alignments. There is also a [[../Projects|project]] icon, but these will only be shown when opening/saving a project.

A single entry can be selected by clicking with the left mouse button. When opening a file, a double click or pressing &lt;tt&gt;RETURN&lt;/tt&gt; on a selected entry will open it. Multiple entries can be selected by dragging a rectangle with the mouse, or by holding down the &lt;tt&gt;SHIFT&lt;/tt&gt; and/or &lt;tt&gt;CTRL&lt;/tt&gt; keys. A multiple selection can be opened via &lt;tt&gt;RETURN&lt;/tt&gt;.

Grabbing selected entries with the left mouse button and dragging them into the other list will '''move''' these entries to that database. To '''copy''' these entries, hold down the &lt;tt&gt;CTRL&lt;/tt&gt; key when releasing the left mouse button over the target list.

Selected entries can be opened, renamed, and deleted via their context menu.

=== Save ===
If you save an entry to a database, there will be an additional line below the lists. It consists of a drop-down box with the database to save the entry to, and a text box for the name. The name of the database is remembered if you originally opened that entry from a database, otherwise the standard database is the default.

Saving an entry to a database where an entry with that name already exists will lead to the following:
* If the sequence of the entry in the database is exactly the same as the sequence of the entry you're trying to save, a message box will ask you if you really want to overwrite that entry.
* If the sequence of the entry in the database differs from the sequence of the entry you're trying to save, a message box will tell you that this action was prevented. This will avoid accidental overwriting of an entry with a different sequence. If you are very certain you want to replace that entry, you will have to delete the entry in the database manually via the context menu, as described above.

== Databases ==
Currently, GENtle supports sqlite and MySQL databases, both of them freely available. Each has different advantages and disadvantages, though both are integrated seamlessly into GENtle. Once set up, all functions are available on all databases, no matter the type.

The &quot;Databases&quot; tab keeps a list of all the databases that can be accessed. New databases can be created, and existing can be added to or removed from that list. The exception is the local database, which is essential for the functioning of GENtle and therefore can not be removed. Removal of a database will &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; delete the database itself, only the entry in the list.

One of the databases in the list is the default database. The default database can be set by selecting its entry in the list, then clicking the ''As Default'' button. The default database can carry shared [[../Sequence editor|enzyme groups]].

=== Sqlite ===
Sqlite is already integrated in GENtle, so no separate installation or setup of any kind is required. A sqlite database consists of a single file with the ending &quot;.db&quot;. For each GENtle installation, a database (&quot;local.db&quot;) is automatically created. New sqlite databases can be created, or existing ones added to GENtle, on the &quot;Databases&quot; tab in the dialog. To take such a database with you (e.g., for use at home or on a laptop), just copy the &quot;.db&quot; file. While sqlite databases are easy to set up and maintain, sharing them across a network tends to be slow, depending on the size of the database.

=== MySQL ===
MySQL is a professional client/server database system that will reliably store and serve millions of entries. It is ideal for shared databases, as even a huge number of stored sequences will not slow it down significantly, even across a network. Hovever, there are some steps required to use MySQL databases with GENtle:
* A &quot;server&quot; computer on your network, that is, a computer that is running most of the time, and preferably is not used for direct work. If the server is not running, or disconnected from the network, no one will be able to access the MySQL database and the sequences stored in it!
* The MySQL server software (4.1 works fine, other versions will likely do as well), which available for free [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ here].
* Someone to configure the MySQL server (not as complicated as it sounds)
Once the MySQL setup is complete, MySQL databases can be created (by one) and added to all the GENtle clients that should have access.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just went through and wrote a few things out.  I'll try to go back soon and create subsections and leave the top page as a broader definition of political philosophy.  I'll also expand the top two paragraphs to a better definition. I obviously left so much out of this. 10:47, 7 October 2004  [[User: S.rice|s.rice]]

: Hey, cool!  Thanks for doing this.  I was beginning to think I was the only philosopher on the planet.  I'm writing the logic bit.    I'll leave the political philosophy to you, as I know very little about it. --[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 11:39, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: BTW, we need someone to write a few paragraphs about John Locke's political philosophy on the wikipedia John Locke page.  When I tried editing the John Locke page, I found quite quickly that my knowledge of the man and his work is rather patchy.--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 11:49, 15 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Wow... I haven't looked at this page in over seven years. I think that I need to come back and contribute. Unfortunately, not much work has been done on it at all? Is Wikibooks just floundering as a project? Or is it just certain topics, like this one? As this is an introductory page, I'd like to divide it up into &quot;moments&quot; of political philosophy; perhaps it could be first divided up into something like &quot;eras&quot; of political philosophy which would start — ostensibly — with Plato; then move to the Romans (perhaps including the stoics — I'm not sure about this); then I'm not sure about who to put in before Machiavelli and Hobbes...; after that, obviously, there is a strong tradition in political philosophy itself, but, my next question is: where do we draw the line in political philosophy and different disciplines? While Marx, Weber, and Durkheim are political philosophers, they are usually considered sociologists (see, here my categories don't actually hold up), one could read Descartes as a political philosopher, but, that would imply looking at the political implicates of the &quot;cogito,&quot; which are many and varied. Obviously, Kant could come into play as could Nietzsche. Perhaps, the better question that I should pose is: how do we categorize this book? Or, at least, this introduction? There are a few other chapters (do we call them chapters?) in this Wikibook, but how should we organize it? Chronologically? Thematically (i.e. utilitarians, deontologists, social contract theorists, ...). The way that MediaWiki is coded requires some structure in order to render things readable, so, any advice? 8:02, 14 April 2011  [[User: S.rice|s.rice]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{GENtle/Main bar}} __NOTOC__
[[image:GENtle_properties.png|thumb|Sequence editor, properties tab.]]
The sequence editor holds the key to several properties of a sequence. It consists of several tabs, depending on the type of sequence, which can be DNA or amino acid.

== Properties ==
Here, the title and description of the sequence can be altered. As for feature descriptions, the sequence description will make http references clickable.

For DNA sequences, sticky ends can be entered.
{{clear}}

== Features ==
{| style=&quot;float:right;&quot;
|[[image:GENtle_sequence_editor_features.png|thumb|none|The sequence editor, features tab.]]
|[[image:GENtle_sequence_editor_edit_feature.png|thumb|none|Edit feature dialog.]]
|}
This tab shows a list of all features of the sequence. Features can be added, edited, and deleted. Most of the settings should be self-explanatory.
* The setting ''reading frame'' is only available when the type is set to &quot;CDS&quot; (&quot;coding sequence&quot;).
* A ''leading'' sequence is read 5'&amp;rarr;3'; leading unchecked, 3'&amp;rarr;5'
* ''Edit feature'' will invoke an additional &quot;Edit feature&quot; dialog

=== Edit feature ===
* ''Fill color'' is the color of the feature; it will invoke a color choice dialog
* ''Type in sequence display'' determines how that feature is drawn in the [[../Sequence map|sequence map]]
* ''Use offset'' sets the numbering for the first amino acid of the feature; useful if the feature marks a part of a protein
The list box below contains original data from GenBank format import.
{{clear}}

== Restriction enzymes ==
{| align=right
|[[image:GENtle_enzyme_settings(1).png|thumb|Sequence editor, enzyme settings tab.]]
|[[image:GENtle_enzyme_settings(2).png|thumb|Sequence editor, enzyme settings (2).]]
|}
When editing a DNA sequence, two tabs with settings for restriction enzymes are available. The first one is identical to the [[../Enzyme management|enzyme management]] dialog. The second one is identical to the [[../Options#Enzyme settings|global enzyme settings]] tab, but contains the settings for this sequence alone. By default, its options are disabled, and the global options are used. By activation the options here, global settings are overridden.
{{clear}}

== Proteases ==
[[image:GENtle_sequence_editor_proteases.png|thumb|The sequence editor, protease tab.]]
This tab holds a list of available proteases. Potential cleavage sites for selected (checked) proteases are shown in the [[../Sequence map|sequence]] (&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; in the [[../DNA map/]]).

New proteases can be added similar to the following examples:
* Example : &quot;Thermolysin&quot;
** Sequence for this protease : &quot;!DE|AFILMV&quot;
** Explanation: &quot;Not D or E&quot;, &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;then A, F, I, L, M, or V&quot;
* Example: Proline-endopeptidase
** Sequence for this protease : &quot;HKR,P|!P&quot;
** Explanation : &quot;H, K, or R&quot;, &quot;then P&quot;, &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;then not P&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This goal is too simple. The ideal &quot;robot&quot; to traverse a powered track is not a robot at all, but an automaton: namely an electric train. A simple electric train may be purchased for less than the cost of an electrical engineering textbook.

:Well what's the difference?  One uses sensors and feedback decision-making to stay on the track, and the other uses mechanical forces (feedback) to stay on the track?  Where does one end and the other begin? - [[User:Omegatron|Omegatron]] 14:16, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

The difference is how it acts when something goes &quot;wrong&quot;. Let's say someone puts a big box on the robots track. Can it addapt? If it just bumps into it, it's an automaton. Otherwise if it looks for a way around then it could be called a robot. But that's my oppinion. The border between the 2 is very fuzzy. --[[User:Patrik|Patrik]] 13:35, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)

I agree that this particular goal can be fulfilled (and at lower cost) by simple electric train, rather than a robot.
However, I think this book needs some &quot;simple&quot; goals before working towards more complicated goals.
Simple goals are good.
* The lowest-cost &quot;program&quot; to display the words &quot;Hello, world&quot; is to simply write them on paper with a pencil.
** But writing a program to display those words is still an excellent early goal while learning a programming language.
* The lowest-cost hardware to blink an LED certainly does not include a microprocessor.
** But programming a microprocessor to blink an LED is still an excellent early goal while learning [[embedded Systems]].

Would an even simpler goal (simpler than &quot;follow a powered track&quot;) be even better?

Let's say that we have a number of points in a 2-dimensional plane with x-coordinates stored in array x and y-coordinates in the array y.
How would one go about solving this problem? The obvious way is to compare all the points to all of the others. How would such an algorithm look? Something like this (it returns a 3-tuple with the two points and the distance between them):

 '''function ClosestPair'''(''x''[], ''y''[], ''numPoints'')
   ''min'' := &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;

What is the running time of this algorithm. Since the number of iterations in the inner loop starts with p-1 and decresases by one each time until it reaches 1, in which case the main loop finishes. It is thus an arithmetic progression from one to p-1:
:&lt;math&gt;1+2+3+4+\ldots+(p-2)+(p-1) = {p(p-1) \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;
It is therfore an &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; algorithm were n is the number of points.

Can we do better? Yes we can! First what we do is divide the group of points into two groups of size &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{b}{n / 2}\mathcal{c}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{d}{n / 2}\mathcal{e}&lt;/math&gt; by drawing a line through the point number &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{b}{n / 2}\mathcal{c}&lt;/math&gt; counted from the left. (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{b}x\mathcal{c}&lt;/math&gt; here represents the  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function floor] function and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{d}x\mathcal{e}&lt;/math&gt; is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function#The_ceiling_function ceiling] function). We then perform the perform the algorithm recursivly for the two groups. If the group size is 1 we return &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; or if the size is 2 we return the distance between the two points.

We can now start making creating some code. Note that the points in x[] and y[] are sorted after their x-coordinate primarily and y-coordinate secondarily (i.e if their x-coordinate is the same).
[[Image:Algorithms-ClosestPointPair2.PNG|right|frame|The two groups and the dividing line in red]]

 '''function ClosestPair'''(''x''[], ''y''[], ''startIndex'', ''finishIndex'')
   ''numPoints'' := ''finishIndex'' - ''startIndex'' + 1
   ''min'' = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
 
   '''if''' ''numPoints'' == 1
     '''return''' &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
   '''else if''' ''numPoints'' == 2
     return '''sqrt'''((''x''[''startIndex''] - ''x''[''finishIndex''])^2 + (''y''[''startIndex''] - ''y''[''finishIndex''])^2)
   '''else'''
     ''min'' = '''Min'''('''ClosestPair'''(''x''[], ''y''[], ''startIndex'', startIndex + '''Floor'''(''numPoints''/2)), 
               '''ClosestPair'''(''x''[], ''y''[], ''startIndex'' + '''Ceiling'''(''numPoints''/2)), ''finishIndex''))
   '''fi'''
   .........
 
 end function

This function obviously doesn't give the right results since none of the points in group 1 is compared to the points in group 2. What if the two closest points lie just left and right of the dividing line? We obviosly have to compare the groups with eachother.

Let's say that the distance between the closest pair of points in the groups is k (the variable ''min'' in the code) then if there exists a closer pair in different groups they must lie in a 2k wide strip over the dividing line. 
[[Image:Algorithms-ClosestPointPair3.PNG|left|frame|Points that need to be compared are in the yellow strip which is 2k wide]]</text>

I'd like to add a few clauses
#A place to dump stuff from Wikipedia. Just because an article written at Wikipedia, or any other Wikimedia project, is not consistent with that project's goals does not mean it is accecptable content for Wikibooks.  Before moving the content here, please check to see if it falls under any of the other clauses in this document first.
#A free wikiwiki host.  If your group would like to have a wiki, there are many free wiki hosts, or feel free to download MediaWiki and set up your own.  If you need help, please read our wikibook on [[Wiki Science]].
#A vehicle for advertising and self-promotion. We don't need books or modules on items just because a contributor is associated with them. Please note Wikibooks does not endorse any business and it does not set up affiliate programs.
Perhaps some are cruel, but we need to control our content. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:55, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I'd like to suggest &quot;A place for primary research such as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas, defining terms, coining words, etc. If you have done primary research on a topic, publish your results in normal such as proposing theories and solutions, original ideas, defining terms, coining words, etc. If you have done primary research on a topic, publish your results in normal peer-reviewed journals, or elsewhere on the web.&quot; (as from [[Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]]) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:58, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::I'm fine with all four suggestions. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 05:17, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::Sound good to me.  You could add some text to the &quot;no dumps from Wikipedia&quot; along the lines that some material at Wikipedia (such as cookbook recipes) were dumped here for a reason: The Wikibooks Cookbook made more sense as a place to organize them than did Wikipedia. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 01:46, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::The first three look fine.  The proposal about original research on Wikibooks might need to involve others from the following pages. It doesn't matter to me, but it looks like some in the Wikimedia community want a place to do collaborative research. See: [[Wikiresearch]] ; http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikiresearch ; is [[Wiki Science]] considered original research ; an Oct 7 edit added text at [[Wikiversity]] that said it was for research also. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 14:26, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::: Wikipedia is not a place for original research and neither should Wikibooks be a place for original research also. A seperate project will need to be created for that if the demand is high enough. Perhaps Wiki Science needs to go also, if it is indeed original research. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:29, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)
::::Yes, original research should not go here.  If it's sound research, it should be published/peer reviewed etc, and if the author(s) want it to be freely available, then WikiSource is the appropriate location, not here. [[User:TUF-KAT|TUF-KAT]] 20:12, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Proposed addition to first point:
:*(Attempt one) A place to dump stuff from Wikipedia without consideration of the content, structure, and accessibility of pages within Wikibooks.
:*(Attempt two) A place to dump stuff from Wikipedia without consideration of the context into which it will be dumped.
:[[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] (signed for liblam by [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] after investigating page history)

::I like liblam's attempt one to clairify the first point. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:06, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)
:::I wasn't very clear with respect to this but I would think my attempt #1 would be the first sentence and Gentgeen's #1 other sentences would follow. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 21:22, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I've added my points 2 and 3, and Dysprosia's point about primary research.  Point one will have to wait until the exact wording is ironed out. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 22:13, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== fiction ==

there should be a place for fiction on wikimedia; fiction books seem as though they should be here.  I would like to strike #4 from the record.  +sj+
: Wikimedia - possibly. Wikibooks - no. Wikibooks has and always should be an organization oriented to education. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 09:56, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)
:: That's not in line with how wikibooks as a project was founded... at least as far as [[User:Maveric149|mav]] is concerned.  And that's not how I have understood the purpose of Wikibooks.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for textbooks, but if you want to change the original intent of this project, you should at least recognize that it has not always been the way you perceive it.  [[User:Sj|Sj]] 22:52, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:::I always intended for Wikibooks to be a place to develop educationally-oriented materials. Just about any finite-sized non-fiction reference/textbook, manual or study guide should be welcome here. Wikifiction / Wikinovels would make for an interesting project, but I'm not sure if that fits with the goals of the foundation and thus may need to be hosted elsewhere. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 04:27, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== copyrighted content ==
this is obvious; we can get rid of #2 as it is more fundamental than a &quot;what this is not&quot; item.  +sj+
:Nothing is so obvious that it can't be clearly stated. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 05:41, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== speculative, subjective, and non-verifiable information ==
One of the important ways in which the wiki process works is by peer-review correcting information that is &quot;wrong.&quot;  As a result, I think that wikibooks should not contain texts that are purely speculative and non-verifiable in nature.  We are not trying to gather information that someone has simply acquired through their own experience and speculation, especially if that information cannot be proven wrong because it is essentially subjective in nature.  I think there should be a clause forbidding purely speculative and non-verifiable information as the basis for a text.  If the information cannot be refined through research and verification, it does us no good to construct it through a wiki.  Here is my proposed clause:
* A place for texts based on speculative, subjective, and otherwise non-verifiable information.  If it is impossible for the information in the text to be &quot;wrong,&quot; then it is also impossible for it to be refined or corrected.  It is, however, usually possible to reframe the text or its information so that it is verifiable: by establishing it as a perspective, and explaining whose perspective it is.
[[User:Jun-Dai|Jun-Dai]] 20:29, 10 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Real-life course materials ==

I found and removed the following:

:Wikibooks is also not a place to publish administrative materials relating to real-world courses, including course outlines, scoring rubrics, or assignment material.  Wikibooks is not affiliated with any institution of learning, and does not endorse any institution.

I wonder: why not? Aren't we specifically trying to create materials that can actually be used in schools? If useful course outlines, assignments, etc., can be made available here without copyright problems, then why not?

If people think I'm mistaken, then obviously the quote should be moved back into the article.[[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 09:58, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

The idea is that Wikibooks should not be used as a course website, despite our intentions of being an instructional resource.  In the past, teachers have made their students take up Wikibooks accounts for the sole purpose of collaborative work on one of their school projects, as well as posting their course timetables, grades, and stuff like that.  We can claim that it is against our policy to do so as it is original research, and using Wikibooks as a web hosting service. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 04:51, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

:Aha, I see what you mean. On the other hand, a ''general'' sample/example of a course outline could make the wikibook more useful. And assignments - these include study questions, which we explicitly want. So it sounds like the criterion should be: Might the outlines/assignments be useful to ''anyone'' studying/teaching the topic, or ''only'' to a specific school (which is taking advantage of Wikibooks' hosting).

:Another thought: Perhaps even school-specific uses should be OK on a user page, as long as the volume remains within reason? [[User:Dovi|Dovi]] 19:47, 21 May 2005 (UTC)

:: Yeah, maybe that needed reworking - as an educational resource, we need sample outlines and sample questions just for the fact that it is, but we need a clearly-defined line to determine what is acceptable and what is abusing WB as a free hosting service. [[User:KelvSYC|KelvSYC]] 05:49, 23 May 2005 (UTC)

: That is what the Wikiversity will be used for, not wikibooks. We don't want competing communities.--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 10:15, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks is not a repository of links ==
'''Wikibooks is not a repository of links''' is not official policy, as it is on Wiktionary, Wikinews, and Wikipedia, according to this page.  It probably should be.  Please discuss. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 15:18:46, 2005-08-20 (UTC)

:I want to wade in on this topic.  This is a solution in search of a problem from my viewpoint right now in terms of Wikibooks.  Most massive lists of links that I've seen added were blatant spam and vandalism, where the links were simply off topic and legitimate for removal simply for that reason alone.  On the other hand, massive lists of links to be used for bibliographic references of a subject in a Wikibook can and should be encouraged, particularly when content from those other websites were used directly in the creation of the Wikibook and the list of links is large simply because the Wikibook has a correspondingly large amount of content that needs to be referenced to original sources.

:Most other abuses of this sort can be dealt with through other policies here on Wikibooks anyway.  A Wikibook that is just a list of links would have to be removed because it is &quot;developing a new Wikimedia project&quot;, like a Wiki competitor to the Open Directory Project.  Other clauses in this official policy may also be cited as legitimate reasons to remove content like this.

:Basically, I fail to see a reason why this even needs to be official policy unless there are some clear examples of how somebody was abusing Wikibooks in this manner that couldn't be taken care of through other means.  There is no reason for preemptive measures or policies that will never need to be invoked.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:49, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks is not censored for the protection of minors ==
'''Wikibooks is not censored for the protection of minors''' is not official policy, as it is on Wiktionary, Wikinews, and Wikipedia, according to this page, despite our [[Wikibooks:content disclaimer]].  It probably should be.  Please discuss. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 15:18:46, 2005-08-20 (UTC)
:I agree. As part of our policy changes moving forward we should sync up with practices of the other wiki's. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 15:07, 31 August 2005 (UTC)
::If somebody creates a Wikibook about sex issues (sexual impotancy, theraputic research concepts, frank discussion about sexual habits in a clinical setting), it may not be appropriate for minors but I don't think it should be banned from Wikibooks.  Outright pornography should be banned, as should books like the [[Manual of Crime]] that encourage people to break the law.  Things like erotic literature and a neo-NAZI promo book would be dealt with through other parts of the deletion policy (no fictional content and no original research, respectively).  I don't know of any current Wikibook that really tries to push the line here, but I do think eventually there will be some that try to get right to the line on this idea but not cross it.&lt;p&gt;[[Wikijunior]] and the related wikibooks clearly should have censoring in regards to appropriate content for minors as that is the target for those books.  A Wikijunior book about sexuality, for example, is just going over the top and inviting criticism (although a resource to discuss sexuality to minors would be IMHO something very welcome).  I'm not sure where the line should be here on topics like this.  I've had people critical of the image of Venus (Roman goddess) because it shows a woman's bare breast.  I consider that to be art, but that is my own opinion of the subject. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 17:56, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
:I agree, non-censorship should be an official position (with a possible exception of the wikijunior area).  Its not a good idea to start the slide down the censorship road begin.  You wouldn't believe how extreme some parents get over what other people's children shouldn't be exposed to.--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 18:12, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
::But we should include a statement that says &quot;Pages marked with the prefix '''Wikijunior:''' will be censored for minors.

== Wikibooks is not a dictionary ==

This section is IMHO not clear enough and encouages people to add things like [[Body parts slang]] to Wikibooks.  To avoid abiguity on this issue, we need to emphasis that it would be easier and more appropriate to put even dictionary subsets, like the &quot;Hacker's Dictionary&quot; or &quot;Medical Dictionary&quot; on Wiktionary directly as well.  Wikitionary is set up better to deal with content of this nature, and IMHO material of this nature needs to stay there.  This comes up in repsonse to [[Body parts slang]] where an argument in the [[VfD]] discussion was to this current description that seems to encourage dictionary-like books even though the title reads Wikibooks is not a dictionary.  Where do we draw the line?  A glossary that is an appendix to a book I feel is just fine, as is a technical reference manual that has a huge number of terms.  A book that has as its primary focus to be a dictionary or encyclopedia IMHO should not be on Wikibooks but rather portals on Wiktionary and Wikipedia respectively.  Any other thoughts? --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:12, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

:I suggest adding that Wikibooks is not a thesaurus. The reason for this is [[wiktionary:Wiktionary:WikiSaurus]]. &lt;s&gt;Here is a proposed text: &quot;#'''Wikibooks is not a thesaurus.'''

== No original research ==
IMO, &quot;No original research&quot; is appropriate for wikipedia, but not so appropriate here.  One of Wikibooks' great strengths is its capacity to be more current than any printed reference texts.  It would be a great shame to limit it to reproducing preexisting textbooks.&lt;br&gt;An example of original research that (IMO) should be hosted by Wikibooks is documentation for newly-created software.  Ironically, the &quot;No original research&quot; rule means that a textbook on use of the Wikimedia software shouldn't be hosted on Wikibooks!&lt;br&gt;I doubt this is what was intended, and IMO the &quot;No original research&quot; rule should be replaced with a rule that reflects what '''was''' intended.  Jun-Dai's &quot;Wikibooks should not contain texts that are purely speculative and non-verifiable in nature&quot; above would seem an appropriate replacement.  [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 11:56, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
*[[Wikibooks:no original research|no original research]] is appropriate here.  It simply needs to be somewhat ''weaker'' in certain respects.  The major purpose of the policy is to exclude things which have not been peer reviewed and incorporated into the corpus of human knowledge, and which have yet to gain any traction in the world outside of their creators or founders, such as new religions, crackpot science theories, new languages, new philosophies, radically new and idiosyncratic interpretations of history, and the like.  We want to exclude most such things from Wikibooks just as they are excluded from Wikipedia.  (Wikibooks is not the place for writing a grammar book on one's own constructed language, for example, or for propounding the theory that the universe is a plutonium atom.)&lt;p&gt;However, the point that we certainly ''should'' allow textbooks to be written in newly formed areas of study is a good one.  If, for example, the field of computer science expands to include a new area, we shouldn't be creating impediments that prevent Wikibooks from being able to be the ''first'' to have a textbook covering it.  Verifiability does not cut the mustard as a criterion for that, though, and the rule that you mention is unsuitable.  Vast swathes of ISBN 0136386776 and ISBN 0201896834 &amp;mdash; standard textbooks in their field &amp;mdash; would not satisfy a verifiability criterion, as they describe and document systems that were invented by their authors. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 13:21, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I don't think who invented the systems is relevant - so long as they're freely or widely available, the average user can confirm that the software does what the book says it does. ie. it's verifiable.  (This means no books on proprietary software that hasn't been released yet, which is the sort of thing you're trying to keep out with &quot;No original research&quot; anyway). [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 21:30, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:The few cases where this has been an issue have generally been cleaned up quickly.  Yes, some Wikibooks have been deleted due to this policy.  The most glaring example was when a laboratory was literally placing their measurement results (I believe it was a chemical laboratory, but I may be mistaken) as a lab notebook on Wikibooks.  They did intend to have the results not only public but available under the GFDL, so it wasn't a problem for the lab.  The problem was the original research issue, which this clearly was.  We did find a Wikicity that was willing to take the data, so it wasn't &quot;lost&quot;, but it is no longer a part of Wikibooks.  Your proposed change would have actually encouraged more Wikibooks of this nature, which frankly we are not prepared to deal with and can't evaluate.
:: That's the key phrase - if we can't evaluate it, then it fails the verifiability test and won't be included anyway. &quot;Verifiable&quot; should probably be clarified to indicate that it means by a typical wikibooks user though (as opposed to, say a multi-million dollar physics lab).  [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 21:30, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:There is also the issue of psuedo science individuals like Richard Hogland (not that he has added anything here on Wikibooks that I'm aware of).  There have, however, been several attempts to put in Wikibooks that espouse some more esoteric scientific philosophies, and in this case it is much more polite to suggest that original research is not appropriate for Wikibooks than to say they are a quack and we think their research has no merit.  Again, there is an Academic Research Wikicity that not only handles this, but has the people capable of assisting individuals who do this sort of research, including UFO researchers and paranormal investigators.  Think &quot;Ghost Busters&quot; in real-life, and they do exist.

:A textbook about the use of Wikimedia software is appropriate, but a running bug report about trying to fix MediaWiki software would not.  That bug list is an example of original research.  I think you are confusing the two issues here.  It has nothing to do with the &quot;newness&quot; of the idea.  The software architechture document about MediaWiki software is not appropriate on Wikibooks either, because that is original research.  A comparison study about different Wiki software packages is also original research.  Writing a book about Wiki software is not.
:: Would you seriously want to prevent a wikibook on using wikis from including a comparison of features? To me this is an &quot;against&quot; for No Original Research, not a &quot;for&quot;. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 21:30, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:Let's take another view of this.  If I create a cold-fusion power cell, there are several books I could write about the topic.  Original research is publishing actual research notes about how I built the power cell, and what kinds of power readings I got from various experiments I conducted on that power cell.  I could also talk about what my theories about how this works, even doing citations from other fusion research.  That would still be original research, however.  If on the other hand I wrote a &quot;how-to&quot; book on the best way to operate a cold-fusion power cell, that would not be original research.  Writing a literature survey about cold-fusion would also be appropriate for Wikibooks, especially if it cites original research that has been published elsewhere.  Your proposed policy change would challenge these secondary books from ever being written and you could shut down the writing of any Wikibook that follows a theory that you or a large group of Wikibook participants don't agree with.

:: You say you want to avoid &quot;pseudo science&quot; wikibooks, but you don't want to &quot;shut down the writing of any Wikibook that follows a theory that you or a large group of Wikibook participants don't agree with&quot;.  That's what the verifiability test is all about.  If you come up with a better rule to weed out pseudo-science, I'd be happy to hear it.[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 21:30, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

:I'll be the first to admit that the &quot;original research&quot; clause in the policies is very subjective, and there are cases where it is difficult to draw the line.  Still, by keeping the original research exclusion policy it makes it easier to keep some books that we simply don't have people here that can evaluate the validity of the claims.  The emphasis here is that we are trying to write textbooks for educational environments.  Original research strongly distracts from this original goal, which is the primary reason this exclusion exists.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 13:43, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

Overreaction? Is there a massive change? Speedy deletions for [[WB:WIW]] exclusions are already [[Wikibooks:deletion policy|deletion policy]]. Someone moved [[Jokebook]] to [[WB:VFD]], and I moved [[Getting a date]], and there is nothing strange about that. Maybe proposed policies will become enforced or rejected, but I already expect that to happen. The recent changes to [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion]] were only minor.

The one major change might be game guides. I have created [[Wikibooks:Game manual guidelines]] and [[Wikibooks talk:Game manual guidelines]]; this needs discussion. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:06, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:Ummm... there is not much of an overreation. Do you realise how much here on Wikibooks is not a text book?  There is not even such a thing as a &quot;Deletion policy&quot;. That page isn't even an enforced policy. People at Wikipedia send stuff here because they don't understand what WB ''is''. There is a major change going on. If things like Jokebook are to be deleted, which have been here basically forever, how can there not be a major change. Actually enforcing policy ''is'' a major change. Like I said, I contacted Jimbo at WP and am waiting to hear back about what Wikibooks actually is. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:40, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

::This is Jimbo stirring up the pot.  He is in a position to &quot;clean house&quot; that the rest of us can't be, simply by being the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation (aka Benevolant Dictator and God of Wikimedia).  I disagree with him on some points, but if he wants to refocus Wikibooks to become more textbook oriented, I am not only willing to aquiese into this point, but I'm also willing to enforce a revised Wikibooks philosophy that follows that line of reasoning.  The big problem is that it is going to mean the deletion of a large portion of Wikibooks, including the alienation of many users here who have made very reasonable and meaningful contributions to Wikibooks.  I also want consistant policies rather than having to rely on whatever Jimbo feels isn't appropriate at the moment, which is not a good way to run a project like this.  That is why we need to have a policy overhaul, so these books that Jimbo doesn't want can be accomodated through policy rather than one person's opinions, even if it is the Wikimedia project's founder and initial financer (the true measure of why he has the political power on these projects that he has). --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:33, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:::Right, except he owns Wikibooks, and can therefore tell us what he wants it to be. If people want to start their own wiki to house all of the newly deleteable material, there is nothing stopping them. But Jimbo set up Wikibooks to be a place for ''textbooks'' and I am inclined to follow his desires on this issue and enforce his decrees, even if that means going against what the community-at-large feels is right. This is his website, he gets to make the rules. If he says, &quot;only textbooks&quot;, then we should have only textbooks.

::::I take exception to this point.  Jimbo does not own wikibooks or wikimedia-  the wikimedia foundation owns it.  THe wikimedia foundation isn't a codename for Jimbo, its everyone who works on a project it runs.  Jimbo deserves respect for starting and financing the project, and his opinion definitely holds more weight than a normal contributor.  But that does not mean his wishes override the voice of the community.  That is NOT his perogative.  And people believing it is the founders perogative has killed many good projects in the past when the founder has been wrong.  If Jimbo thinks we need major content deletion, this is something that needs to be discussed among the community and most likely the board.

::::::He can't legally do that-  wikimedia foundation is a non-profit corporation, it isn't his money anymore.  In addition, I'm not sure that he provides the majority of current funding-  remember that fundraising drive a few months back?  You did contribute, right?  I know I sure did.

::::::Communism?  No a democracy.  Or a republic if you prefer-  we vote for a board.  Elections were in July or August I think.  Every registered account got a vote.  If we wanted, we could have voted even Jimbo out.  We didn't, and it was probably a good thing- he's run wikimedia well.  But that does not mean every decision he makes is right, or that he gets to arbitrarily set any and all policies.  The board (of which he is a member) can of course do that by vote-  but the end result of going that route is a fractured contributor base, loss of contributors, forks, and eventually stagnation for the project.  Been there, done that, not a good option.  Major policy changes/decisions need to be discussed to avoid such situations.  --[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:45, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

:::::::&lt;s&gt;Actually, not Communism but a Facist dictatorship instead.  Jimbo doesn't even hide from that fact.&lt;/s&gt;  The charter of the Wikimedia Foundation is set up that he can't be voted out from his position.  All the elections are about is to elect two members of a five seat board.  Jimbo has indicated that eventually he wants to see all of the board members be up for election, but that is for some distant future event.  The ultimate issue here is that we are all volunteers here and if Jimbo gets too arbitrary and harsh that we can all simply leave.  This has been a problem for other internet communities when arbitrary decisions get handed out, and that is a problem.  Worse, that the Wikibooks community could split and fork the content in a major way, with a new group running the whole thing from somewhere else.  Jimbo is smart enough that he doesn't want to force that to happen again, as it already did happen with the Spanish Wikipedia some time ago.  I would like to stay within the Wikimedia community if I can, but if arbitrary decisions start to get handed out more often, a split will happen.  So far Jimbo has proved to be a generally hands-off manager except in extreme circumstances, and most other decisions about the governance are through participatory democratic discussion.  Not even republican representative governance but pure democracy where you govern through your level of participation.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:09, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

Jimbo does have some sort of dictitorial authority if he chooses it, but has generally shown considerable restraint in the past and the present.  Indeed, Jimbo has been hammered on many fronts lately, and I'm sorry that this whole issue came up at all.  My main beef with Jimbo was over how he handled this, not what he did.

==== Wikibooks is more than just textbooks ====

To suggest that Wikibooks is only for textbooks, I would strongly suggest that you look at the archives of [[Wikibooks:Mailing lists|the original discussion that created this Wikimedia project]] in the first place.

Now I will not disagree that one of the motivations behind the creation of Wikibooks is to write textbooks, and that should be the primary focus.  There seems to be a whole lot of misunderstanding here however that it was just for textbooks in the beginning.  Keep in mind the history of this project, where it was really an outgrowth of both Project Sourceburg (now Wikisource) and Wikipedia.  Sourceberg was in part an attempt to add source materials, and the name was to remember Project Gutenberg and the original sources there.  The name was discontinued, but the iceberg anaology from the name remains even today with the current icon for that project, with more subtle meaning that there is more to the project than just raw text sources.

Originally there was a general intent to try and encompass all human knowledge with Wikimedia projects.  That feeling and intent is really what is at stake here and more.  Issues like the NPOV and &quot;Original Research&quot; tenants were mainly a method adapted to try and keep the most extreme issues under control, where there is now more contention on Wikipedia about the abbreviation of computer memory usage (MiB vs. MB) than for the biography entry on George W. Bush.  Especially if the topic wasn't offensive to most Wikimedia users, the subject was to remain on some Wikimedia project.  Of course offensive has a POV issue, but even controvercial issues have their place and several potentially graphic issues like the [[w:Nazi extermination camp|Nazi Death Camps]] have well written articles about the subject that maintains a NPOV approach.

Generally speaking, whenever there was a recurring topic that didn't seem to fit within the project, it was moved onto another domain with a whole new Wikimedia sister project that was started.  This was particularly the case with things like Wikiquote, Wiktionary, and Wikinews, all of which are spin-offs from Wikipedia.  Even here on Wikibooks we have Wikiversity that is likely going to be a brand-new Wikimedia project.  Interesting ideas like Wikidata and Wikiscores (working with music) are still being developed but may still become future Wikimedia projects.

We are now at a cross roads here.  Do we start to really narrow the definition of Wikibooks or do we try to expand that definition to include more non-fiction content?  Keep in mind that even the non-fiction distinction was a very recent change, and that there was fictional content on Wikibooks as well until recently, and some people still try to add some every once in awhile.  Are we prepared as a community to throw away all non-textbook book-length content and declare that other non-fiction content should not be permitted on any Wikimedia project at all?  There is no other real home within the Wikimedia sister projects for this content.

I have been carrying on with some threads on Foundation-l about the future of Wikibooks, mainly with a proposal that Wikibooks somehow turn into a sort of incubator website for future Wikimedia projects.  We already have mini-project situations here for each seperate Wikibook, and except for some heartburn in trying to get it going on its own domain we have been successful with things like Wikiversity.  I still think Wikibooks is a good place for new Wikimedia project ideas and for some experimentation, but the general concensus on that mailing list and among Foundation board members is to create a whole new incubator project seperate from all other Wikimedia projects.

Wikicities is really quite a different beast all together, but it does muddle up the waters some.  Wikicities has nothing to do with the Wikimedia Foundation other than it is governed by two members of the Wikimedia Foundation board.  Some content has been recently moved to Wikicities (especially fictional content), but the current attempts at policy change are to move a massive portion of Wikibooks over to several projects there, and IMHO really muddle the distinction between Wikimedia projects and Wikicities.  I still don't know if this is intentional on the part of Jimbo or not, as he is to get some extra money indirectly into his own pocket due to this move.

Jimbo has not been participating on the discussions too much with Wikibooks.  I don't blame him, because Wikimedia users keep distracting him with so many other issues that I would be overwhelmed with some of the stuff he does.  He is also the P.R. point man for all of the Wikimedia projects, going to several conferences and meeting with members of the international press.  Still, even for a very active user on Wikibooks (or worse on Wikipedia), you can't keep up with all of the discussions on every topic.  Wikibooks has been evolving, and some of that has to do with trans-wiki efforts from other Wikimedia projects as well.  Books like [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] are not strictly textbooks, but I think have a very useful place here and are even beneficial to an educational environment.   I think Jimbo has missed this transformation of Wikibooks from a simple place for textbooks to become a fairly large library of non-fiction material.  His changes of Wikibooks policy, especially on this page, were very much out of line and otherwise against published policy and the formal disclaimer at the top of the page.  To quote '''&quot;Except for minor edits, please make use of the discussion page to propose changes to this policy.&quot;'''  Jimbo did not make a minor edit, but a major policy change here, and completely without anything on this discussion page.  He only informed the community that he made the change after the fact, and until now nobody has challenged him on that point directly.  I guess I am doing that now.  Why was this change made and is this something that we as a community really want to have happen?  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 04:02, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

:[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]] can be used in existing school classes on literature; it ''is'' a textbook. (The Harry Potter books themselves are textbooks, but they would go on Wikisource if not copyrighted.) The [[Wikibooks:How-tos bookshelf|How-tos bookshelf]] consist of textbooks; for example [[Sword construction]] can be used in school classes on metalworking. The [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf|Computing bookshelf]] consists of textbooks; for example [[Using KDE]] can be used in school classes on desktop computing. None of these seem to be problems.

:But perhaps there is a problem here. [[Wikibooks:Computer and video games bookshelf|Computer and video games bookshelf]] is large, and there are classes (groups) of video game players, but there are no ''school classes'' for video game players. There might be other parts of Wikibooks like this. Still, if [[wiktionary:class|class]] can mean group, category, instead of ''school class'', there is no problem with [[WB:WIW]], or is there? [[Freeware]] is a useful project, but I proposed deleting it because it is a macropedia. Are there many Wikibooks like [[Freeware]]?

:The reason why I have little trouble with Jimbo's edit is because Wikibooks already excludes most non-fiction books: previously published works (Wikisource), encyclopedias, macropedias, dictionaries, original research, and especially soapboxes. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 17:54, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

::As far as computer game classes, there is a whole PhD program that was mentioned on Foundation-l, and I've even seen B.S. programs in computer game design.  While I will admit that these &quot;textbooks&quot; are more about how to play the game than trying to understand the theory underneath the game, I've also seen that done, and something a &quot;hardcore&quot; game player should try to figure out as well.  I have also advocated that a good CS program should involve at least for beginning undergrads some game design theory as well, as it teaches some good programming habits that can be very useful in later work.

::As you've pointed out, there are some significnat restrictions on what we allow here anyway, and as I've pointed out things like [[White Heritage Society]] and [[Kabbalah]] violate several previous policies, most prominent in these cases was a blatant copyright violation from content published elsewhere.  The [[w:White nationalism]] article, however, shows some balance and NPOV treatment.  I mention this especially, because Jimbo suggested this Wikibook was vandalism and the user that created this Wikibook should have been banned.  Just where do we draw the line here?  Could this Wikipedia article be expanded to become a Wikibook?  Why or why not?  Existing policy suggests that it perhaps could be expanded.

::The big problem I have with Jimbo's edit was a complete disregard with the community in general, and the opinion that we as admins are somehow getting lax with our duties, without trying to see what we are trying to accomplish here.  After bringing this issue up on Foundation-l, there is yet to be even a single supporter of Jimbo, which IMHO is particularly surprising given the make up of the regular participants there.  More to the point, if I had made similar changes to this page I would hope that it would have created a similar firestorm of protest, as I've done when [[User:Lord Voldemort]] changed the copyright violation policy.  I've made mistakes here, and I've admitted them when I've done so.  I have, however, been very careful with high-profile pages and have tried to get community concensus first if I make a big change.  That was not done here at all, and in some ways Jimbo's silence on this issue after the firestorm is just making things worse.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 19:00, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

:::I am very concerned about the definition of Wikibooks.  I have a starter project going here that is not strictly speaking a textbook, but is of interest to educators, is based on verifiable fact, lends itself to widespread participation, and lends itself to NPOV.  It appropriately includes reference to me, but as it grows from a stub to a real book, my name is just one among many appropriately listed.  I think it is an asset to Wikibooks that will eventually draw considerable positive attention to the Wikibooks site and to Wiki in general. I guess someone could argue that it is a macropedia. I'm not calling attention to the particular wikibook, as I don't want to make it a center of controversy.  I would like to be able to go forward without risking deletion.

:This is a sorry state of affairs, and we certainly do need to sort this all out so people can get back to regular contributions without fear of deletion.

Barring a complete rewrite, it does need some kind of overhaul. Until we can get it sorted out, we should suspend all VFD discussions (except for the most heinous and unreasonable violations), to prevent unnecessary casualties. We should ask jimbo to come back and help with our discussions, but if he stays absent, we need to write up a complete policy ourselves. We should also try to get input from as many stewards, beauracrats (sp?) and admins as possible, because these are the people that will need to enforce whatever policy we finally adopt.

=== Headless chickenism ===
A lot of running around like headless chickens, crying that we need to make up entirely new policies, has been sparked by [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:What_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=281147&amp;oldid=265973 this edit].  This policy now sports a dispute notice, and people have decried Jimbo's change in the direction of Wikibooks.

''Jimbo has made no such change.''

[http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Staff_lounge&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=281215 Jimbo clearly stated himself] that his objections to the three books that he intended to delete were 100% consistent with existing policy.  He isn't changing policy, and isn't changing the focus of Wikibooks.  What he's doing, and what that edit means, is easily understood once one understands one very pertinent fact: 

''Jimbo's idea of what a &quot;bookshop&quot; is isn't the same as other editors' ideas of what a &quot;bookshop&quot; is.''  

Once one realizes this, what Jimbo is saying when he says that &quot;most books that you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of [... a] bookshop are not acceptable&quot; turns out to be exactly the same as what [[User:Aya|Aya]] is saying when [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:About&amp;diff=208003&amp;oldid=203428 he wrote] that &quot;any book you might expect to find in the non-fiction section of [... a] bookshop is acceptable&quot;.  There are (at least) two different sorts of bookshops that have non-fiction sections:

*In the non-fiction section of a '''mass-market bookshop''', where the target market is the populace at large, one predominantly finds things such as encyclopaedias, dictionaries, atlases, almanacs, maps, biographies, autobiographies, philosophical/religious/political tracts, tourist and travel guides, entertainment reviews and guides, [[w:coffee table book|coffee table book]]s, and only a small fraction of the whole that targets the education market.  Most of the books in the non-fiction section of such a bookshop ''are not'' appropriate for Wikibooks, as per Jimbo.
*In the non-fiction section of a '''university bookshop''', where the target market is students, one predominantly finds things such as [[w:CliffsNotes|CliffsNotes]] for set texts, textbooks for sciences and humanities, tutorials, manuals, study guides, and instructional and educational material in general; and the part that comprises the non-education-market material is a small fraction of the whole.  Most of the books in the non-fiction section of such a bookshop ''are '' appropriate for Wikibooks, as per Aya.

There is no actual disagreement in terms of what belongs on Wikibooks, no dispute, and no change of focus.  I am confident that Jimbo, Aya, and most editors here ''all'' agree that Wikibooks is not, and never has been, the place for encyclopaedias, dictionaries, atlases, almanacs, maps, biographies, autobiographies, philosophical/religious/political tracts, tourist and travel guides, entertainment reviews and guides, coffee table books, and other non-fiction books that aren't specific to the education market.  Indeed, most of these are specifically excluded by policy (such as &quot;Wikibooks is not an encyclopaedia&quot;) that is pretty much undisputed.  The disagreement lies in the preconception of what one might expect to find in the non-fiction section of a bookshop, because there are different sorts of bookshops, targetting different markets.  The disagreement isn't over what is appropriate to Wikibooks.  The disagreement is over what one finds in bookshops.  &amp;#9786;

Given that, the very least that we need to do is specify the type of bookshop when explaining things this way.  My opinion is that we shouldn't discard the metaphor.  Thinking of Wikibooks as &quot;Wikiversity's free university bookshop&quot; is a fairly good rule of thumb, and worth mentioning in some way, albeit with the caveat that the analogy is not an exact one, given that even university bookshops cater for the extra-curricular needs of their customers and sell ''some'' non-educational and non-instructional non-fiction material that is not appropriate for Wikibooks.

However, Wikibooks is not in a dilapidated state, and there is no need for sudden and drastic overhaul.  There is no need for running around like headless chickens.

[[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 18:43, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

*Jimbo made some recent remarks at staff lounge where he said specifically that wikibooks needs to become more serious. Prior to jimbo's recent remarks (all of them within the last week), the general attitude here on wikibooks was a relaxed one: nonfiction books from ''any bookstore'' were acceptable, so long as they werent blatant violators of other policies. Now, keeping in mind that we all need to take this project more seriously, we either need to start interpreting currently-written policy more strictly, or we need to rewrite the ambiguous parts of policy to be very absolute on what does and does not belong here. Until we have an unambiguous, straight-forward definition of what wikibooks is, we will find ourselves running around like headless chickens, trying to interpret what different clauses mean, and trying to decide if individual modules do or do not fit into that policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:18, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

Among other things, I think that Wikibooks should include [[Wikibooks:Travel Guides bookshelf|travel guide]]s, &lt;s&gt;and it should also include books that are not specific to the education market, such as [[Guide to UNIX]] and the other books on the [[Wikibooks:Computing bookshelf|computing (with software) bookshelf]].&lt;/s&gt; --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:25, 4 December 2005 (UTC) &lt;small&gt;(I thought &quot;instructional market&quot; was different from &quot;educational market&quot;, but that is obviously false... --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 23:32, 6 December 2005 (UTC))&lt;/small&gt;
**Travel guides are what [[w:Wikitravel|Wikitravel]] is for, and are not in any way targetted at the education market (People don't use travel guides in order to ''learn''.); and, contrary to your assertion, the [[Guide to UNIX]] is educational market material, being exactly the sort of instructional and educational text that one finds students buying and employing in Computing courses.

***I have used travel guides to learn.  Short of buying a plane ticket, how else are you going to learn about modern day culture in distant places?

*Where do you draw the line, exactly, between a text that would be suitable in a humanities class (studies in culture or religion), and a book that is deemed to be a &quot;travel guide&quot;? books about the socio-economic climate of a particular region should be here, so should books about the culture of a given area (art, philosophy, food), so long as they are expository books. Books about &quot;where to find the best parties in country X&quot; should not be here. Many travel guides could easily be hit with a {{tl|cleanup}} tag, to be converted into the first type. All they need is a little TLC --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 19:11, 5 December 2005 (UTC)

== Clarify soapbox? ==

I'm wondering if we should clarify ''soapbox'' point. I recently has a discussion with user starting book promoting secession of New York city from the USA. I argumented this is a soapbox, he said soapbox clause only affects commercial advertising. Maybe we should clarify it or add other entry like ''Wikibooks is not for writing manifestos''? --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:30, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:That is a good point, the term &quot;soapbox&quot; is far too vague. We could include an all-encompassing phrase like &quot;Wikibooks is not a soapbox for the dissemination of political or religious propaganda. Wikibooks is also not a commercial advertising venue. Wikibooks is for factual information, not debate or argument. Wikibooks should not be used to promote a political agenda, a religious agenda, or a commercial agenda.&quot; That would get the point across, but is a litter verbose. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:44, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

That's good but we should also cover cases like books &quot;Why you should use solar power?&quot; or &quot;Use only Free Software!&quot; (these are only my examples, such books haven't been created). --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:32, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:Both of those examples seem to me to violate either the &quot;no political propaganda&quot; or &quot;no commercial propaganda&quot;. Also, both of your two examples, as soon as you put forth one opinion over another, violate the NPOV clause. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:27, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

:If there are no objections, I would like to update the &quot;soapbox&quot; clause to state: &quot;Wikibooks is not a soapbox for the dissemination of political or religious propaganda. Wikibooks is also not a commercial advertising venue&quot;. I think this statement encompasses everything that the original clause intended, but is less vague and more useful in enforcing policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:18, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

:::'''Oppose''' this change, if you meant to replace the entire soapbox section with only those two sentences.

:::I propose combining the old version and the new version, like this: &quot;Wikibooks is not a soapbox for the dissemination of political or religious propaganda. Wikibooks is also not a venue for commercial advertising or self-promotion. We don't need books or modules on items just because a contributor is associated with them. Please note Wikibooks does not endorse any business and it does not set up affiliate programs.&quot;

:::As for &quot;Why should you use solar power?&quot;, it could become &quot;What are the benefits of solar power?&quot; or &quot;Benefits and disadvantages of solar power&quot;. &quot;Use only Free Software!&quot; is not appropriate here (neither is &quot;Read only Free Textbooks!&quot;). --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:07, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

:::Copying enforced policy from Wikipedia is only acceptable if the edit is minor, or if there is consensus. ''Please understand that consensus at Wikipedia does not imply consensus at Wikibooks.'' In this case, though, the edit seems consistent with existing policy, and the only part that I might disagree with is the sentence, &quot;See [[Wikibooks:No original research]],&quot; because it explicitly tells me to go see a nonexistant page. I have no problem with [[WB:WIW#Wikibooks is not a place to publish original works]] where the &quot;no original research&quot; red link is simply embedded in the text. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 01:59, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

== Allow me to clarify one thing ==

The nonfiction section of the bookstore contains all manner of things which are perfectly valid but which are not in any way shape or form textbooks.  They are not NPOV, they are polemics.  They contain original research.  They are most often the unique perspective of a single author expressing a point of view or calling for some action by the general public.

I do not view any of my work here as in any way changing the charter or mission of Wikibooks, although it is of course perhaps a refocussing on what it is we are doing here.  We are not a general repository for all sorts of nonfiction books, nor should we be.

I apologize especially to Robert Horning who seems to feel I have moved too quickly, but the point is: we are at a point where we can get major support for Wikibooks, or we are at a point where we can screw that up.  The way to get major support, the way to make Wikibooks as successful as wikipedia, is with a clear mission that can be supported by a huge variety of people.  Speedy deleting things which are clearly in violation of our mission is something that should have been done more aggressively a long time ago.

Many Wikibookians have given up and gone away after losing battles against Wikipedians who were (quite justifiably, from their perspective) just trying to make some crap go away from Wikipedia.  The Wikibooks community has been too small to resist such things.  Well, now I'm here to tell you that it is time for this community to come into its own and I will defend you on that.

And as with Wikipedia, the community is defined by the mission, rather than the other way around.  We know what we're here to do: revolutionize education by providing freely licensed alternatives to proprietary textbooks.  The vast majority of the work at Wikibooks is exactly that.  But we've been lax about enforcing policies because we were a young project and so on.  But we're about to get huge international exposure and attention, and we need to be ready for it.
--[[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] 17:32, 25 November 2005 (UTC)

:''The nonfiction section of the bookstore contains all manner of things which are perfectly valid but which are not in any way shape or form textbooks.'' I disagree with part of this.

:Most of the nonfiction books from the store are textbooks. For example, many books with original research, or advocating some political view, can be used by students at universities or outside of school. In a strict sense, these books are made with [[wikt:text|text]] (''A written passage consisting of multiple glyphs, characters, symbols or sentences'') and qualify as textbooks.

:However, this site Wikibooks has important policies which ban many textbooks. Even before [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] edited this policy this month, we already had policies like Wikibooks is not an encyclopedia, Wikibooks is not a soapbox, Wikibooks uses neutral point of view, Wikibooks is not a free web host. This effectively excludes most nonfiction textbooks. Wikibooks should keep these policies, because they help the community write good textbooks. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 03:15, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;Joke books&quot; and &quot;random books on any subject you like&quot; ==

I had labeled &quot;What Wikibooks includes&quot; as a disputed section, but [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=290679&amp;oldid=290677 it was removed]. I dislike that my marker of dispute was removed.

Since the only wording I actually disagreed with was &quot;not joke books&quot;, I have made [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=296766&amp;oldid=296764 another edit to that section] which I think is more consistent with existing policy. (As I recall, the &quot;not joke books&quot; wording was introduced by [[User:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] to a help page, and [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] moved the wording from the help page to this enforced policy page.) My edit removes my reason to dispute the wording.

Instead of &quot;not joke books&quot;, I say &quot;a collection of jokes like Lollerpedia&quot;, which is more specific, and does not prevent Wikibooks from containing instructional material on how to joke.

As for &quot;random books on any subject you like&quot;, that is confusing because Wikibooks does not exclude every book on a subject that someone likes. So I inserted &quot;because of the list of exclusions in this policy&quot;, to be consistent with [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a general repository for nonfiction works]]. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:48, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

: Jimbo probably does not wish for it to be advertised as something disputed. I can see why, and I would rather have the official policy to err on the safe side (the side that throws away more) than the invite everyone in side. Any active wikibookian will know that it is disputed right now, and we don't want to add more people like me who just came in not knowing about all this. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 10:32, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== Lets focus on the important aspects of the debate ==

I propose that we should not be so focused on the why wikibooks was created, but instead we should be focused on what is better for wikibooks's future. Additionally, lets stop arguing what definitions of words like &quot;textbook&quot; are and get on to something like &quot;What do the Games and Computer Games Bookshelves offer to wikibooks and the wikibook community&quot; and its opposite: &quot;What is the disadvantage to having thse bookshelves on wikibooks&quot;

From there, lets draft policy. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 11:04, 3 December 2005 (UTC)

== The blurred line, yet again ==

To my knowledge, &quot;cookbook&quot; style books are accepted here, correct? By cookbook, i mean stuff like if I were to start a book akin to the style of these:
*[http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/ Lisp Cookbook]
*[http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cookbook/ perl cookbook]
*Linux Cookbook
*[http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/CodeDoc/Inline/C/C-Cookbook.html C Cookbook]
*[[Cookbook | And of course, our (classic) Cookbook]]

And so forth, it is 100% inside policy (and if not, it should be). And yet, when I look at the Jokebook incident, the Jokebook truely was like one of these kind of &quot;cookbook&quot; style books (A book that is not how-to nor instructional, but really just a bunch of organized random ideas on a single subject). Not to raise old blood on the issue, but I think it is something that should be clarified that is not with the current policy. Using arguments from the Jokebook thing, a cookbook-style book is neither instructional (it doesn't tell you how to cook) nor does it tell you how to create your own recipies.

And some other ideas of some cookbook style books (to show how blurry the line really is):
* RPG Damage Algorithm cookbook (includes algorithms from a multitude of games; from Maple Story, Pokemon and Dragon Warrior algorithms, to D&amp;D and other paper/pencil RPGs)
* Programming Gem cookbook (perl cookbook, etc. etc)
* Collection of Exercizes, or workout routines.
* Book of Magic Tricks
* Common attacks across fighting Games (most fighting games for example have down-forward 'A' as a basic combo attack)
* Book on Graphical User Interphase Design Patterns; Menu on the top, Tabs, how to use each effectivly.
* An OOP &quot;Design Patterns&quot; book for programmers... Factory Design, etc. etc.
* Common Phrases of a language
* Book of known Proverbs ? &lt;--- (imagine wikiquote didn't exist for this one for a sec) Arguably allows one to create opennings in essays or themes when writing. :-p
* Video game ideas ? &lt;--- would fail because of &quot;No origonal works&quot; probably, but still something IMO worth bringing up
* Of course, the Jokebook ??

There is obviously a &quot;line&quot; somewhere, as the Jokebook was taken out while the Cookbook remains (whether or not I think it was a good idea is a non-issue; I wasn't active here at that time). I just want to bring up: Where is this line drawn? I can seriously find an argument on each one of these book ideas for why they should be allowed on Wikibooks with the current policy (stemming from allowing a cookbook to stay)

PS: This is not an issue of the Jokebook itself, just a much broader issue that I feel has been brought out by it. Nor do I think that all of those ideas should be allowed on wikibooks. (I dont think &quot;Common attacks in Fighting games&quot; should be allowed, for example) But I can find an argument for each one if I wanted to. (A book on Common Attacks is necessary for a video game designer because it gives what most video gamers see as the &quot;standard&quot;, and thus you can create a better game by learning the &quot;standard&quot; from a Common Attacks reference book) We need to find a way to not allow anyone to just tag &quot;cookbook&quot; to the end of the title and claim it is within the bounds of policy. (Ex. The Joke Cookbook)

PPS: Somewhere down the line, a &quot;Cookbook&quot; turns into a &quot;Dictionary&quot;. Maybe we should start there ?? --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 23:18, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider ==

Generally speaking the User pages have been allowed considerably more lattitude than most of the rest of Wikimedia pages, but there is one point I wanted to bring up:

Wikipedia has a specific clause in [[w:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not]] that specifically governs the use of user pages as part of a soapbox as well.  Specifically I'd like to add this policy to Wikibooks as well:

===Wikibooks is not a free host or webspace provider===

You may not host your own website, blog, or wiki at Wikibooks. If you are interested in using the [[w:wiki|wiki technology]] for a collaborative effort on something else, even if it is just a single page, there are many sites that provide wiki hosting (free or for money).  You can also [http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/ install wiki software] on your server. (See the [[Wiki Science]] wikibook for information on doing this.) Wikibooks pages are not:

# '''Personal homepages.''' Wikibookians have their own personal pages, but they are used for information relevant to working on free textbooks and other content on Wikibooks. If you are looking to make a personal webpage unrelated to textbook work (e.g. posting your résumé), please make use of one of the many free homepage providers on the Internet.
# '''File storage areas.''' Please upload only files that are used (or will be used) in textbook modules; anything else will be deleted. If you have extra relevant images, consider uploading them to the [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], where they can be linked from Wikibooks or any other Wikimedia project.

----

Anyway, what does the Wikibooks community think of this change?  (feel free to make modification of the above section as necessary)  I've seen a few user pages that have been abused already on Wikibooks, and this is more to CYA any attempt by an admin to cull out things that should have been deleted but were moved to the user pages instead to avoid deletion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 03:09, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:I was under the impression that we already had a similar policy on the books. maybe i was wrong. I agree with the text above, although i have no idea what the acronym &quot;CYA&quot; means. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 04:32, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::'''CYA''' - Cover Your Ass(etts).  Basically, if there is a formal dispute you can say &quot;see here, I am just following policy&quot;.  By custom there has been almost no policing of the User space area at all, but perhaps that does need to change.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

::I don't know what I think about the second point there. Why shouldn't I be able to upload an image to use on people's user pages? Or an image in a user page template? I don't necessarily know what to think of this second point. The first point seems okay, though. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:48, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:::He makes a point. Even Jimbo has a self-portrait in his user page. We have to come to terms with the fact that the user pages are going to be used as autobiographical pages, with information that doesn't directly pertain to the wikibooks project. The user pages will have to be examined on a case-by case basis to determine if they violate the &quot;wikibooks is not a free web host&quot; policy. We should also come up with a policy for action that we can take if a user is abusing their user pages. Do we ban a helpful user who is abusing their user namespace? do we simply delete bad user pages outright? do we VfD? --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 15:09, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::::While this is just an update to existing policy, I think this wording is considerably more clear and direct.  Generally, the policy of giving some huge lattitude to the users here on their &quot;home page&quot; is generally a good one.  One particular case I saw that promted me was with [[Business ideas]] that was subject to a VfD, but was moved to a sub-page of a user page instead.  I'm not trying to redo the VfD for this particular module, but in general I see this as a huge potential area for abuse and I would strongly discourage anybody else from doing something like this.  A &quot;wikibook in progress&quot; that is kept in the user space IMHO would be just fine.  All I'm asking is to give some &quot;teeth&quot; to this policy and hopefully explain what the difference between hosting bad content (like moving [[Jokebook]] to my private user space to avoid a VfD) and some development ideas for future use as a legitimate Wikibook.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:37, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::::: Eww, that could be a problem. How about as a general rule, user-pages should not be longer than xxx bytes long? then again... well, how about simply &quot;Wikibooks user pages should not be used as a personal homepage??&quot; Seems like a simple definition.--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 22:14, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
----
I was unaware that Wikipedia [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider|was banning]] images for use only on project or user pages instead of articles. I already knew that Commons in [[Commons:Commons:Criteria for inclusion|their criteria for inclusion]] allows such images.

If we want to require that all images for project and user pages be at Commons, perhaps we should put such a requirement in our [[Wikibooks:Image use policy]] first before stating it in this page. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 05:48, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks is not Wikipedia ==

There seems to be some confusion for some newcommers. I think this needs to be clarified. The rules and regulations at Wikipedia may be similar here, but not exactly the same as one here... I am not to apt with the rules over at Wikipedia, so maybe a list of major rule differences could help out. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 12:54, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

:Currently there are probably too many major differences in policy. (Have you seen my user page?) Our time would probably be better spent updating and initiating policy rather than pointing out differences at this point. Just my thoughts. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 14:50, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

::We do have a [[Wikibooks:Comparison of other Wiki projects]] page, however I would like to create a WikiNode page like [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiNode]] to compare the projects. As for policies, I was thinking of converting [[MetaWikipedia:Policy]] into a summary of policies at various projects. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 06:08, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

== Wikibooks is not a seed for another wikisite ==
Wikibooks is for books and book-like materials. Some even argue that Wikbooks is only for textbooks that can be used in educational classes (even though that would easily wipe out half of the current wikibooks...) but all that aside, lets get this point clear: You should not be aiming to create a &quot;sub-webpage&quot; on wikibooks. Wikibooks is for books, not websites. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 18:28, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

::We do already have [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not for developing new Wikimedia projects]], which covers this pretty good already, although some clarification could happen.  The section on [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks#Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider|Wikibooks is not a free wiki host or webspace provider]] also does a pretty good job of covering the &quot;free wiki hosting&quot; problem as well.  Wikibooks should be for non-fiction books that don't mirror existing Wikimedia projects.  The rest of this page is mainly refining and giving specific examples of that concept.  What is too bad is that the foundation still doesn't have a seed wiki, dispite a call for such a project for the past several months.  It would have its own rules, but there is a need for a developer to be bold and start the project.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 18:42, 27 December 2005 (UTC)

:::I attempted [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks%3AWhat_is_Wikibooks&amp;diff=320485&amp;oldid=318795 an edit]. If you only want to clarify policy, instead of changing policy, try editing the policy. --[[User:Kernigh|Kernigh]] 00:58, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

== New clause? ==

I would like to add something to basically say:

:''Wikibooks is not a list of random facts.''

An exception would be in the case for an appendix to a current module. Any thoughts? --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:21, 10 February 2006 (UTC)

== Original Research vs. Practical Knowledge (in how-to books) ==

Just curious how the NOR clause is applied to how-to books. For example, if I were to write a book on how to build greenwood fencing with a chainsaw and jute rope, I wouldn't be able to provide sources, except maybe give the name of the old man who taught me to do it. Similarly most of the garden techniques I plan to write about were passed on verbally and/or learned through the doing.

There seems to be a sort of academic bias in that rule. Is it meant to apply to everything? Seems to me that one of the best ways wikibooks can be used is to have them as a reserve of this kind of practical knowledge that doesn't necessarily exist in textbooks or journals. Is this really a sticky point? [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 18:35, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

:You might still be surprised at how many references you can come up with.  I would agree that most How-to books are going to be practical implementation type books, like [[How to build a deck]] (one I've thought about trying to write myself).  Still, you can reference building codes, recommended safty precautions, and manufacturer websites about materials.  The same can be said about the above proposed Wikibook about Greenwood fencing, and reference any sort of fire retardant or other materials that can be used to help make the fence safer and may even be legally required if you build it.

:You are not going to find a scholarly reference for every statement that you make in the writing of the book, but perhaps we should say something like every How-to book should be verifiable.

:Keep in mind that the real reason (looking both ways to make sure I don't get shot doing this) for the ''No Original Research'' clause is to make sure we can keep off UFO and Perpetual Energy people off of Wikimedia projects.  On the other hand, if you write a Wikibook called [[How to Build a Practical Time Machine]], you had better make sure that the thing can work.  I would '''love''' to see some pictures for something like this.  (Yes, [[w:John Titor|Mr. Titor]] is welcome to try.)  Perhaps verifiability is the real key here that we need to work with.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

::An interesting thought comes to mind then: practical knowledge, known by the doing, would then also be verifiable by the doing. A difference of theoria vs. praxis? (Aristotle would surely be thrilled). That would certainly make sense, as the users of these books are more likely to be out doing something than sitting in a library (though they might do that too, if google fails them).

::I don't think it should be necessary to hunt down references just for the sake of having them. That's the beauty of wiki after all. For example, in the fence zoning question: I wouldn't know anything about that, because those sorts of regulations don't apply to farms, but someone else might know about them, and add it in. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 10:24, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

:::I wouldn't necessarily rule out fence zoning for farms either.  I know that there are fencing requirements in some rural areas, particularly along major highways and near wilderness areas... to keep livestock from damaging either automobilies or native animal sanctuaries respectively.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:40, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

I think this rule should be relaxed on Wikibooks.  (Ditto the statement about 'not being a repository for non-fiction', which is very vague and occasionally used to attack any book the attacker does not like.) [[User:Sj|Sj]] 04:53, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

:Here is a rule I try to apply in terms of a &quot;stink test&quot; to see if content is reasonable on Wikibooks:  Can I edit the content with major revisions (subject to reasonable research and common sense), merging it with other similar content?  How upset would the author be if I substantially changed the whole order of things and even removed points that were more opinion rather than factual?

:The arguments that are used to by the author to keep me from doing these sort of edits will also determine where outside of Wikibooks the content really belongs.  If it is a historical text in public domain, it belongs on Wikisource.  If instead it is a lecture or a presentation of scholarly research, and they ask you to only do minor edits for proofreading but leave the structure and ideas alone, it would be considered original research, or perhaps an editorial.  The whole issue of editorials on Wikinews is something that still comes up from time to time, as it is a major feature for most media outlets, even though there are plenty of places to do that with blogs.  If instead the content is a narritive and offers completely made up characters (see [[Hud and Hel]] as an example), this is clearly fiction.  I have seen all of these types of content added to Wikibooks, with occasionally a surprising response from a contributor who wrote the text with an offer to substantially rework the content and make it into a real textbook instead.  If it is a bunch of text that is going to be reworked, putting NPOV or cleanup tags is a more reasonable thing to do.  Wikibooks editors are not really equiped to evaluate original research and needs a specialized group of individuals to see if it is a reasonable sort of research that should be presented.  And you open the Pandora's Box to paranormal and psuedoscience research as well.  Even opening up original research a crack is going to have to define what the next line is that should not be crossed.  

:BTW, the &quot;not being a repository for non-fiction&quot; was an invention of Jimbo, and I don't really understand or know what point he was trying to make here.  Originally the statement was that Wikibooks was &quot;for any kind of content that you would find in the non-fiction section of a bookstore&quot;.  Jimbo didn't like that statement thinking it was overly broad, notwithstanding the other exlusions like original research, NPOV, and not duplicating other Wikimedia projects.  Jimbo is trying to make this more oriented toward actual textbooks, and based on his pronouncements that seems to be the direction that Wikibooks is going toward.  Unfortunately that does kill some non-fiction content that otherwise would be fine to keep in Wikibooks.  Note the [[Jokebook]] and the current VfD to remove the last vestiage of that content from Wikibooks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:40, 10 March 2006 (UTC)

::Well (waxing philosophical, political, and pragmatic again), while I really admire the ambition to use wikimedia to grow books to be used in actual classrooms, I have a skeaking suspicion that in most places where a computer is available in the classroom, there will also be politics and politicians working against their adoption. Things could change on that note, but I think it's more likely that someone would download a wikibook on how to insulate a house or grow a garden than to teach their children basic chemistry. Wikibooks as textbooks seems to me more an ideal we should try to approach than an immediate goal. I assume that wikibooks is not on a deadline?

::The how-to books -- if well written and well supported (with as many writers editors as possible) -- could go a long way towards establishing the reliability of other projects here. [[User:SBJohnny|Johnny]] 20:54, 10 March 2006 (UTC)
:::In terms of K-12 instructors accepting content from Wikibooks, it really helps if you can say the content meets formal standards, and if you can quote chapter and verse from the standards guidelines for a particular state, that would give you a huge leg up over other content from major commercial textbook publishers.  Especially if you quote curriculum standards for small states like South Dakota, Arkansas, or Utah where major commercial publishers generally don't target specific guidelines and most teachers only make due as best as they can.  Writing a textbook for these markets would be a dream come true for many instructors.  Major markets like Florida and California are more likely to have a textbook written specifically for their state guidelines.  If you could get a Wikibook into even a handful of actual instructors in this manner, I think you would have a synergy effect with Wikibooks that would be incredible and you might see some real academic publishing of textbooks here.
:::On the other hand, I think you are perhaps right that at least in the short term you will find How-to books as the primary market that would be useful for Wikibooks, simply because most of these books require only practical knowledge to write and would have an audience that would be interested in reading them.  Books like [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] is a clear example of this, where the content is not only mirrored but has also been forked.  BTW it also deserves the Book of the Month status, and is IMHO one of the best books of its kind bar none, especially for using Blender.  There are several other Wikibooks that target MMORPG environments, and that is a natural experience where many of the potential consumers of that content would not only look at Wikibooks as a natural home, but it might even give credibility to the quality of the content.  There was a drive to remove content of this nature from Wikibooks, but I fail to see what policies it really is violating, and the motivation for creating new policies that would specifically exclude it.  As an example of content like this, see [[RuneScape]] --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:33, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</text>

[[image:GENtle_PCR.png|thumb|PCR and primer design.]]
This module allows for designing primers and running virtual PCRs. It can be started from a [[../DNA/]] module via context menu of the [[../DNA map#Background|DNA]] or [../Sequence map#Context menu|sequence]] map, or through ''Tools/PCR''. If a sequence is selected in the DNA module, one or more primers can be generated automatically upon startup of the PCR module. These will only be rough suggestions, and are in no way optimized by default.

== Toolbar ==
* Enter new primer
* Open primer/sequence
* Print PCR
* Add a primer (you will have to open or enter the primer first)
* Export a primer (generate its sequence)
* Edit mode
* Show/hide features
* Polymerase running length
* Horizontal mode

The polymerase running length is the number of nucleotides the polymerase is allowed to run during the PCR in the elongation step. This is usually measured in minutes, but each polymerase runs at a different speed, which is why this information is given here in nuleotides. The value is initially computed automatically, but can be changed manually.

== Primer list ==
The primer list (the upper left) shows all primers used in this PCR, as well as certain key properties of these. Selecting one of these primers will show more detailed information in the box on the right (see [[../Edit primer dialog#Properties display|here]] for details). Double-clicking one of the primers will mark and show that primer in the sequence. A selected primer can be removed through the ''Remove'' button, or [[../Edit primer dialog|edited]] via the ''Edit'' button. A selected primer can also be exported via the Export button in the toolbar; a new sequence will be generated for that primer.
:'''Caveat :''' The generated sequence is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; stored anywhere automatically, it needs to be saved manually!
:'''Caveat :''' To add a primer, use the Add button in the toolbar, or the ''Selection as new primer'' context menu. Merely editing the sequence (see below) is for editing existing primers only, it will &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; create new ones!

== Sequence ==
The sequence consists of the following lines:
* Features of the template DNA (can be turned off in the toolbar)
* 5' primer
* Template DNA (5'→3')
* Amino acid sequence of the template
* Template DNA (3'→5')
* 3' primer
* Restriction sites of the resulting DNA
* Resulting DNA (shown in green)
* Amino acid sequence of the resulting DNA

Some special functions and properties of the PCR sequence display:
* The amino acid reading frame can be set as described [[../Sequence map#Keys|here]]. This will affect both amino acid sequences shown (template and result).
* Only the two primer sequences can be edited; overwrite mode is mandatory, and deleting is disabeled.
* To delete a nucleotide, overwrite it with &lt;tt&gt;Space&lt;/tt&gt;.
* The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; key will copy the matching template nucleotide to that position in the primer sequence.
* Matching primer nucleotides (that is, matching with the template) are shown in blue, mismatches in red.
* If (when &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; in edit mode) an empty span of the primer sequence is selected, it can be turned into a new primer via the context menu (''Selection as new primer'').
* The sequence of a restriction site can be inserted left or right of a selection (in edit mode, right or left of the cursor) via the context menu. A selection dialog for the desired enzyme will appear.
* A [[../Silent Mutagenesis|silent mutation]] can be introduced via the context menu.

Finally, the resulting DNA or amino acid sequence (the green sequence, which will be the one generated by the PCR) can be copied to the clipboard or generated as a new sequence (containing all features, restriction enzymes etc.) via the context menu.</text>

[[image:GENtle_edit_primer_dialog.png|thumb|Edit primer dialog.]]
This dialog assists in optimizing a primer. For that reason, many variants of the primer are generated and can be examined.

The center line of the dialog shows the current variant of the primer; details of that variant are shown in the upper right box. ''OK'' will end the dialog, committing that variant to the PCR module. ''Cancel'' will end the dialog and &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; change the PCR module. ''Reset'' will return the primer in the dialog to the variant the dialog was originally started with.

The list in the lower half of the dialog contains an automatically generated list of variants of the current primer, sorted by an arbitrary score. The &quot;region&quot; of variants can be influenced by multiple settings in the upper left quarter of the dialog. Available settings include:
* The variation of the 5'-end of the primer to the right and to the left.
* The variation of the 3'-end of the primer to the right and to the left.
* The minimum and maximum length of the primer.
* The minimum and maximum melting temperature of the primer.
Any change of these settings will trigger a recalculation of possible variations. These variations are then evaluated and shown in the list in the lower half of the dialog. Double-clicking one of the varaiations will change the current variation in the center line, and the properties display in the upper right quarter of the dialog.

== Properties display ==
This will display:
# The primer sequence in 5'&amp;rarr;3' orientation
# The &amp;Delta;H and &amp;Delta;S values
# The length and GC contents of the primer
# The melting temperature, calculated according to the Nearest Neighbour method (usually best results, but only for longer primers)
# The melting temperature, calculated according to the salt-adjusted method (medicore results)
# The melting temperature, calculated according to the GC method (simplicistic)
# The highest self-annealing score (arbitrary) and the display of that annealing
:'''Caveat :''' Calculating primer melting temperatures is tricky. If one of the three methods gives a totally different result than the other two, ignore it. Also, the melting temperature is only calculated for the 3'-end of the primer that anneals with the sequence!</text>

[[image:GENtle_sequencing_primers.png|right|Sequencing primers dialog]]
The sequencing primers dialog can add possible sequencing primers as features to a [[../DNA/]] sequence. What primers to add can be specified:
* The minimum alignment (3') of a primer to the sequence. This means exact annealing!
* The database to search for primers. All primers from that database will be considered.
* Alternatively, use all primers that are part of a project in that database. That way, a range of primers across databases can be specified in a project and be considered as sequencing primers here.
* Primers that run in 5'&amp;rarr;3' or 3'&amp;rarr;5' direction.
You can also have the dialog remove old sequencing primers from the sequence. This can also be done manually through ''Edit/Remove sequencing primers'' in the DNA module. Note: Sequencing primers, if not removed, will be saved as features together with the sequence; they can still be removed lated, though.

Sequencing primers will display as yellow features, where the shade of yellow depends on their direction. The actual sequencing primer feature is only as long as the 3' annealing of the primer, so the primer might actually be longer than the feature towards the 5' end. For details, see the feature description, which contains the original primer sequence, among other data.</text>

{{Wikipedia|Semantic web}}

'''The semantic web''' is an exciting new evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW) providing ''machine-readable'' and ''machine-comprehensible'' information far beyond current capabilities. In an age of information deluge, governments, individuals and businesses will come to rely more and more on automated services, which will improve in their capacity to assist humans by “understanding” more of the content on the web. This has potentially far-reaching consequences for all businesses today. 

More information on the web needs to be structured in a form that machines can ‘understand’ and process rather than merely display. It relies solely on a machine’s ability to solve complex problems by performing well-defined operations on well-defined data. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has coined the term “Semantic Web” to describe this approach. Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila provide the following definition: 

{{cquote|The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.|||Tim Berners-Lee, Ora Lassila, James Hendler|Scientific American May 2001}}

==What Is The Semantic Web?==

The Semantic Web is a mesh of information linked up in such a way as to be easily processable by machines, on a global scale. You can think of it as being an efficient way of representing data on the World Wide Web, or as a globally linked database.

The Semantic Web was thought up by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the WWW, URIs, HTTP, and HTML. There is a dedicated team of people at the World Wide Web consortium (W3C) working to improve, extend and standardize the system, and many languages, publications, tools and so on have already been developed. However, Semantic Web technologies are still very much in their infancies, and although the future of the project in general appears to be bright, there seems to be little consensus about the likely direction and characteristics of the early Semantic Web.

What's the rationale for such a system? Data that is generally hidden away in HTML files is often useful in some contexts, but not in others. The problem with the majority of data on the Web that is in this form at the moment is that it is difficult to use on a large scale, because there is no global system for publishing data in such a way as it can be easily processed by anyone. For example, just think of information about local sports events, weather information, plane times, Major League Baseball statistics, and television guides... all of this information is presented by numerous sites, but all in HTML. The problem with that is that, is some contexts, it is difficult to use this data in the ways that one might want to do so.

So the Semantic Web can be seen as a huge engineering solution... but it is more than that. We will find that as it becomes easier to publish data in a repurposable form, so more people will want to publish data, and there will be a knock-on or domino effect. We may find that a large number of Semantic Web applications can be used for a variety of different tasks, increasing the modularity of applications on the Web. But enough subjective reasoning... onto how this will be accomplished.

The Semantic Web is generally built on syntaxes which use URIs to represent data, usually in triples-based structures, i.e., many triples of URI data that can be held in databases, or interchanged on the world Wide Web using a set of particular syntaxes developed especially for the task. These syntaxes are called &quot;Resource Description Framework&quot; syntaxes.
URI - Uniform Resource Identifier

A URI is simply a Web identifier: like the strings starting with &quot;http:&quot; or &quot;ftp:&quot; that you often find on the World Wide Web. Anyone can create a URI, and the ownership of them is clearly delegated, so they form an ideal base technology with which to build a global Web on top of. In fact, the World Wide Web is such a thing: anything that has a URI is considered to be &quot;on the Web&quot;.

The syntax of URIs is carefully governed by the IETF, who published RFC 2396 as the general URI specification. The W3C maintains a list of URI schemes.

== RDF - Resource Description Framework ==
A triple can simply be described as three URIs. A language which utilises three URIs in such a way is called RDF: the W3C have developed an XML serialization of RDF, the &quot;Syntax&quot; in the RDF Model and Syntax recommendation. RDF XML is considered to be the standard interchange format for RDF on the Semantic Web, although it is not the only format. For example, Notation3 (which we shall be going through later on in this article) is an excellent plain text alternative serialization.

Once information is in RDF form, it becomes easy to process it, since RDF is a generic format, which already has many parsers. XML RDF is quite a verbose specification, and it can take some getting used to (for example, to learn XML RDF properly, you need to understand a little about XML and namespaces beforehand...), but let's take a quick look at an example of XML RDF right now:-

== Why RDF? ==
When people are confronted with XML RDF for the first time, they usually have two questions: &quot;why use RDF rather than XML?&quot;, and &quot;do we use XML Schema in conjunction with RDF?&quot;.

The answer to &quot;why use RDF rather than XML?&quot; is quite simple, and is twofold. Firstly, the benefit that one gets from drafting a language in RDF is that the information maps directly and unambiguously to a model, a model which is decentralized, and for which there are many generic parsers already available. This means that when you have an RDF application, you know which bits of data are the semantics of the application, and which bits are just syntactic fluff. And not only do you know that, everyone knows that, often implicitly without even reading a specification because RDF is so well known. The second part of the twofold answer is that we hope that RDF data will become a part of the Semantic Web, so the benefits of drafting your data in RDF now draws parallels with drafting your information in HTML in the early days of the Web.

The answer to &quot;do we use XML Schema in conjunction with RDF?&quot; is almost as brief. XML Schema is a language for restricting the syntax of XML applications. RDF already has a built in BNF that sets out how the language is to be used, so on the face of it the answer is a solid &quot;no&quot;. However, using XML Schema in conjunction with RDF may be useful for creating datatypes and so on. Therefore the answer is &quot;possibly&quot;, with a caveat that it is not really used to control the syntax of RDF. This is a common misunderstanding, perpetuated for too long now.

==Screen Scraping, and Forms==

For the Semantic Web to reach its full potential, many people need to start publishing data as RDF. Where is this information going to come from? A lot of it can be derived from many data publications that exist today, using a process called &quot;screen scraping&quot;. Screen scraping is the act of literally getting the data from a source into a more manageable form (i.e., RDF) using whatever means come to hand. Two useful tools for screen scraping are XSLT (an XML transformations language), and regular expression (in Perl, Python, and so on).

However, screen scraping is often a tedious solution, so another way to approach it is to build proper RDF systems that take input from the user and then store it straight away in RDF. Data such as you may enter when signing up for a new mail account, buying some CDs online, or searching for a used car can all be stored as RDF and then used on the Semantic Web.

== The Power Of Semantic Web Languages ==

The main power of Semantic Web languages is that any one can create one, simply by publishing some RDF that describes a set of URIs, what they do, and how they should be used. We have already seen that RDF Schema and DAML are very powerful languages for creating languages.

Because we use URIs for each of the terms in our languages, we can publish the languages easily without fear that they might get misinterpreted or stolen, and with the knowledge that anyone in the world that has a generic RDF processor can use them.
The Principle Of Least Power

The Semantic Web works on a principle of least power: the fewer rules, the better. This means that the Semantic Web is essentially very unconstraining in what it lets one say, and hence it follows that anyone can say anything about anything. When you look at what the Semantic Web is trying to do, it becomes very obvious why this level of power is necessary... if we started constraining people, they wouldn't be able to build a full range of applications, and the Semantic Web would therefore become useless to some people.
How Much Is Too Much?

However, it has been pointed out that this power will surely be too much... won't people be trying to process their shopping lists on an inference engine, and suddenly come up with a plan for world peace, or some strange and exciting new symphony?

The answer is (perhaps unfortunately!) no. Although the basic parts of the Semantic Web, RDF and the concepts behind it are very minimally constraining, applications that are built on top of the Semantic Web will be designed to perform specific tasks, and as such will be very well defined.

For example, take a simple server log program. One might want to record some server logs in RDF, and then build a program that can gather statistics from the logs that pertain to the site; how many visitors it had in a week, and so forth. That doesn't mean that it'll turn your floppy disc drive into a toaster or anything; it'll just process server logs. The power that you get from publishing your information in RDF is that once published in the public domain, it can be repurposed (used for other things) so much easier. Because RDF uses URIs, it is fully decentralized: you don't have to beg for some central authority to publish a language and all your data for you... you can do it yourself. It's Do It Yourself data management.

== The Pedantic Web ==

Unfortunately, there is an air of academia and corporate thinking lingering in the Semantic Web community, which has lead to the term &quot;Pedantic Web&quot; being coined, and a lot of mis/disinformation and unnecessary hype being disseminated. Note that this very document was devised to help clear up some common misconceptions that people may have about the Semantic Web.

For example, almost all beginners to RDF go through a sort of &quot;identity crisis&quot; phase, where they confuse people with their names, and documents with their titles. For example, it is common to see statements such as:-

&lt;http://example.org/&gt; dc:creator &quot;Bob&quot; .

However, Bob is just a literal string, so how can a literal string write a document? What the author really means is:-

&lt;http://example.org/&gt; dc:creator _:b .
_:b foaf:name &quot;Bob&quot; .

i.e., that example.org was created by someone whose name is &quot;Bob&quot;. Tips like these are being slowly collected, and some of them are being displayed in the SWTips guide, a collection of Semantic Web hints and tips maintained as a collaborative development project.
Education And Outreach

The move away from the &quot;Pedantic Web&quot;, to some extent, is all part of a movement to bring the power of the Semantic Web to the people. This is a well documented need:-

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fffff4; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|

[...] the idea that the above URIs reveal a schema that somehow fully describes this language and that it is so simple (only two {count 'em 2} possible &quot;statements&quot;), yet looks like the recipe for flying to Mars is a bit daunting. Its very simplicity enables it to evaluate and report on just about anything - from document through language via guidelines! It is a fundamental tool for the Semantic Web in that it gives &quot;power to the people&quot; who can say anything about anything.

- EARL for dummies, William Loughborough, May 2001

RDF Schema and DAML+OIL are generally languages that need to be learned, however, so what is being done to accommodate people who have neither the time nor patience to read up on these things, and yet want to create Semantic Web applications? Thankfully, many Semantic Web applications will be lower end applications, so you'll no more need to have a knowledge of RDF than Amaya requires one to have a knowledge of (X)HTML.
Trust and Proof

The next step in the architecture of the Semantic Web is trust and proof. Very little is written about this layer, which is a shame since it will become very important in the future.

In stark reality, the simplest way to put it is: if one person says that x is blue, and another says that x is not blue, doesn't the whole Semantic Web fall apart?

The answer is of course not, because a) applications on the Semantic Web at the moment generally depend upon context, and b) because applications in the future will generally contain proof checking mechanisms, and digital signatures.
Context

Applications on the Semantic Web will depend on context generally to let people know whether or not they trust the data. If I get an RDF feed from a friend about some movies that he's seen, and how highly he rates them, I know that I trust that information. Moreover, I can then use that information and safely trust that it came from him, and then leave it down to my own judgement just to how much I trust his critiques of the films that he has reviewed.

Groups of people also operate on shared context. If one group is developing a Semantic Web depiction service, cataloguing who people are, what their names are, and where pictures of those people are, then my trust of that group is dependent upon how much I trust the people running it not to make spurious claims.

So context is a good thing because it lets us operate on local and medium scales intuitively, without having to rely on complex authentication and checking systems. However, what happens when there is a party that we know, but we don't know how to verify that a certain heap of RDF data came from them? That's where digital signatures come in.


In general, there are small- and large-scale systems, and interactions between the two will most likely form a huge part of the transactions that occur on the Semantic Web. Let's define what we mean by large-, medium-, and small-scale systems.

Large Scale

An example of a large-scale system is two companies that are undergoing a merger needing to combine their databases. Another example would be search engines compiling results based upon a huge range of data. Large-scale Semantic Web systems generally involve large databases, and heavy duty inference rules and processors are required to handle the databases.
Medium Scale

Medium-scale Semantic Web systems attempt to make sense out of the larger-scale Semantic Web systems, or are examples of small-scale Semantic Web systems joined together. An example of the former is a company trying to partially understand two large-scale invoice formats enough to use them together. An example of the latter is of two address book language groups trying to create a super-address book language.

Small Scale

Small-scale Semantic Web systems are less widely discussed. By small-scale Semantic Web systems, we mean languages that will be used primarily offline, or piles of data that will only be transferred with a limited scope, perhaps between friends, departments, or even two companies.

Sharing data on a local level is a very powerful example of how the Semantic Web can be useful in a myriad of situations. In the next section on evolution we shall be finding out how interactions between the different sized systems will form a key part of the Semantic Web.
SEM - SEmantic Memory

The concept of a SEmantic Memory was first proposed by Seth Russell, who suggested that personal database dumps of RDF that one has collected from the &quot;rest&quot; of the Semantic Web (a kind of Semantic Cloud) would be imperative for maintaining a coherent view of data. For example, a SEM would most likely be partitioned into data which is inherent to the whole Semantic Web (i.e., the schemata for the major languages such as XML RDF, RDF Schema, DAML+OIL, and so on), local data which is important for any Semantic Web applications that may be running (e.g. information about the logic namespace for CWM, which is currently built in), and data that the person has personally been using, is publishing, or that has been otherwise entered into the root context of the SEM.

The internal structure of a SEM will most likely go well beyond the usual triples structure of RDF, perhaps as far as quads or even pents. The extra fields are for contexts (an StID), and perhaps sequences. In other words, they are ways of grouping information within the SEM, for easy maintenance and update. For example, it should become simple to just delete any triple that was added into a certain context by removing all triples with that particular StID.

A lot of work on the Semantic Web has concentrated on making data stores (i.e., SEMs) interoperable, which is good, but that has lead to less work being conducted on what actually happens within the SEM itself, which is not good, because the representation of quads and pents in RDF is therefore up in the air. b developers to be investigating at this stage.

== Evolution ==

A very important concept on the Semantic Web is that of evolution: going from one system into another. Two key parts of evolvability are partial understanding and transformability. We will find out next how these manifest themselves naturally when changing the scale of a system.
Partial Understanding: Large Scale to Medium Scale

The concept of partial understanding is a very important one on the Semantic Web, and can often be found in older documents that came out about the same time as the Semantic Web was first being theorized.

An example of partial understanding when moving a large-scale system to a medium-scale system is of a company trying to make sense out of two invoices, one from Company A and one from Company B. The knowledge that both of the companies use similar fields in their invoices is well known, so a company trying to make sense out of the invoices can easily compile a master list of expenditures by simply scraping the data from the two invoice languages. Neither Company A nor Company B need to know that this is going on.

Indeed, TimBL included this example in his XML 2000 keynote:-

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fffff4; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|

[...] what we'll end up doing in the future is converting things, so for example [...] in the Semantic Web we will have a relationship between two languages so that if you get an invoice in a language you don't understand, and you have... some business software which can pay invoices... by following links across the Semantic Web, your machine will be able to automatically convert it from one language to another, and so process it.

- Tim Berners-Lee

== Transformability: Small Scale to Medium Scale ==

An example of a small-scale Semantic Web system joined together to make a medium-sized Semantic Web system could be two groups that have published address book formats wanting to make a larger and better address book format by merging the two current formats together. Anyone using one of the old address book formats could probably convert them into the new format, and hence there would be a greater sense of interoperability. That's generally what happens when one goes from a small-scale Semantic Web system into a medium-scale Semantic Web system, although this is often not without some disadvantages and incompatabilities. The Semantic Web takes the sting out of it by automating 99% of the process (it can convert field A into field B, but it can't fill in any new data for you... of course, new fields can always be left empty for a while).

== Facilitating Evolvability ==

How do we document the evolution of languages? This is a very important and indeed urgent question, and one which TimBL summarized quite neatly:-

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fffff4; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|

Where for example a library of congress schema talks of an &quot;author&quot;, and a British Library talks of a &quot;creator&quot;, a small bit of RDF would be able to say that for any person x and any resource y, if x is the (LoC) author of y, then x is the (BL) creator of y. This is the sort of rule which solves the evolvability problems. Where would a processor find it? [...]

- Semantic Web roadmap, Tim Berners-Lee

|}

One possible answer is: third-party databases. Very often, it is not practical to have (in TimBL's example) either the LoC or or BL record the fact that two of their fields are the same, so this information will have to be recorded by a reputable third party.

One such &quot;third party&quot; that was set up to investigate this is SWAG, the Semantic Web Agreement Group. Co-founded by Seth Russell, Sean B. Palmer, Aaron Swartz, and William Loughborough, the group aims to ensure interoperability on the Semantic Web. They set up what is possibly the first ever third-party Semantic Web dictionary, the WebNS SWAG Dictionary.

== Intertwining: Difficult, But Important ==

Although the Semantic Web as a whole is still very much at a grassroots kind of level, people are starting to take notice; they're starting to publish information using RDF, and thereby making it fit for the Semantic Web.

However, not enough is being done to link information together... in other words, the &quot;Semantic&quot; part of the &quot;Semantic Web&quot; is coming along nicely, but where's the &quot;Web&quot;? People are not using other people's terms effectively; when they use other terms, they often do so because they're aimlessly trying to help, but just generating noise in the process. If you're going to use other people's data, try to find out what the advantage is in doing that beforehand. For example, just because you use the term &quot;dc:title&quot; in your RDF rather than a home brewed &quot;:title&quot;, does that mean that suddenly a Dublin Core application is going to be able to &quot;understand&quot; your code? Of course not. What it does mean however is that if the &quot;dc:title&quot; property in your instance is being put to use in such a way that information may be need to repurposed from it in the near future, then you may gain some advantage because &quot;dc:title&quot; is such a commonly used term, you may be able to modify a current rules file, or whatever.

Another part of the problem may be due to a problem similar to the one that the early World Wide Web experienced: why bother publishing a Web site when there is no one else's site to link to or be linked to? Why bother publishing a Web site when so few people have browsers? Why bother writing a browser when there are so few Web sites? Some people have to make the leaps for it all to happen, and that's a slow process.

What can be done about the situation? Well, it may hopefully sort itself out. Another well-known principle that applies very well to Semantic Web applications is that there is no point in reinventing the wheel; viz., if someone has already invented a schema which contains a comprehensive and well understood and used set of terms that you also need to use in your application, then there is no point in trying to redo the work that they have done. At some points this may lead to a form of &quot;schema war&quot;, but survival of the fittest should see to it that a core of the best schemata are put to the most use. This is probably what TimBL means when he says that terms will just &quot;emerge&quot; out of the Semantic Cloud, that when people keep using the term &quot;zip&quot;, rather than just recording that my term &quot;zip&quot; is equivalent to your term &quot;zip&quot; which is equivalent to someone else's term &quot;zip&quot;, we'll all just use the same URI, and hence interoperability will be vastly improved.
Does It Work? What Semantic Web Applications Are There?

I addressed this in a previous article: The Semantic Web: Taking Form, but it does bear repeating: the Semantic Web already works, and people are using it.

== Semantic Web Applications ==

Unfortunately, the Semantic Web is dissimilar in many ways from the World Wide Web, including that you can't just point people to a Web site for them to realise how it's working, and what it is. However, there have been a number of small-scale Semantic Web applications written up. One of the best ones is Dan Connolly's Arcs and Nodes diagrams experiment:-

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #fffff4; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|

One of the objectives of the advanced development component of the Semantic Web activity is to demonstrate how RDF and Semantic Web technologies can be applied to the W3C Process to increase efficiency, reliability, etc. In the early stages of developing an RDF model of the W3C process, the tools I was using to visualize the model while working on it started working well enough that I started applying them to all sorts of stuff.

Of course, this is a rather demonstration-oriented Semantic Web project, but it does illustrate the feasibility of applications being easily built using Semantic Web toolkits.

Another good example of the Semantic Web at work is Dan Brickley et al.'s RDFWeb. RDFWeb is a RDF database-driven hypermedia blogspace, a site where all information is stored as RDF, and then that RDF used to render XHTML. Plans are underway to incorporate more advanced Semantic Web principles into the site.
What Can I Do To Help?

There are many ways in which one can contribute to creating the Semantic Web. Here's a few of them:-

    * Publish some globally useful data in RDF.
    * Write an inference engine in the language of your choice.
    * Spread the word: do some education and outreach.
    * Help in the development of RDF Schema and/or DAML.
    * Contribute in representing state in RDF, a rather neglected field of research.
    * Apply your own development backgrounds to the Semantic Web, give us all a new angle to consider it from.
    * Instead of using some proprietary system for your next application, consider making it a Semantic Web project instead.

There are many other ways in which one can help as well: ask in the community for more details.
What Now? Further Reading

As of 2001-09, the amount of Semantic Web Education and Outreach materials can only really be described as &quot;pitiful&quot; (hence this introduction, for a start). Here's a short list of some of the good primers and materials currently available, in no particular order:-

      <text xml:space="preserve">For a series RC consist of one resistor connected with one capacitor in a closed loop.

==Circuit Impedance==
In Polar Form Z/_θ
:&lt;math&gt; Z = R \angle 0 + \frac{1}{\omega C} \angle - 90&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Z = |Z| \angle \theta = \sqrt{R^2 + (\frac{1}{\omega C})^2}\angle Tan^ -1 \frac{1}{\omega RC}&lt;/math&gt;


In Complex Form Z(jω)
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_C = R + \frac{1}{j\omega C} = \frac{1}{j\omega C} (1 + j\omega RC)&lt;/math&gt;
:T = RC

==Differential Equation of circuit at equilibrium==

:&lt;math&gt;C \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{V}{R} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dt} = - \frac{1}{RC} V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V} dV  = - \frac{1}{RC} dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{V} dV  = - \int \frac{1}{RC} dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ln V =  - \frac{1}{RC}t + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V  =  e^(\frac{-t}{RC} + C) = e^C \cdot e^\frac{-t}{RC}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V  = A e^{\left(\frac{-t}{RC}\right)} = A e^{\left(\frac{-t}{T}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

==Angle Difference Between Voltage and Current==
Current leads Voltage  on an angle; Does this mean in measuring a angle of DC current causes a decrease in current?  Let us take some  time to understand the previous math in determing a factor of sinuous solution.
:&lt;math&gt;Tan\theta = \frac{1}{\omega RC} = \frac{1}{f} \frac{1}{2\pi RC} = t \frac{1}{2\pi RC}&lt;/math&gt;

Change the value of R and C will change the value of Angle Difference, Angular Frequency, Frequency and Time
:&lt;math&gt;\omega= \frac{1}{RC} \frac{1}{Tan\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{RC} \frac{1}{Tan\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 2\pi RC Tan\theta&lt;/math&gt;
u

==Application==
[[Image:RC_switch.PNG]]

When the switch is open, the initial voltage across the capacitor is zero.  When the switch closes (which we will refer to as time zero) the capacitor charges via the resistor to &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt;.

When the switch is closed, the circuit must follow the relationship:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_0=v_c(t)+i_c(t)R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_0=v_c(t)+\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}RC&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
which is derived by analysing the circuit using [[Electronics/DC_Voltage_and_Current#Kirchoff.27s_Voltage_Law|Kirchoff's Voltage Law]].

By letting &lt;math&gt;\tau=RC&lt;/math&gt; and rearranging the equation:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{\tau}v_c(t)=\frac{1}{\tau}V_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a first order linear differential equation with integrating factor:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e^{\int \frac{1}{\tau}dt}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}+\frac{1}{\tau}v_c(t)e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}=\frac{1}{\tau}V_0e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note that:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}[e^{t/\tau}v_c(t)]=\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt}e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}+\frac{1}{\tau}v_c(t)e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Substituting and integrating both sides:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}v_c(t)=V_0e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}+K&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where K is the integration constant.

When t=0&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v_c(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore:&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;K=-V_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When t&gt;0 this gives:
: &lt;math&gt;e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}v_c(t)=V_0e^{\frac{t}{\tau}}-V_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)=V_0-V_0e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)=V_0(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
when t&lt;0:
: &lt;math&gt;v_c(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;

----
Basil is a [[Cookbook:Spices and herbs|herb]], the green leaves of which are used extensively in Italian cuisine. It is the basis of [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]] sauce, and is also widely used as a [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]].

==Storing Basil==

Basil is best used fresh and can usually be bought either as a potted plant, or harvested leaves.  The leaves on the potted plant will remain fresh provided the plant itself is well cared for.  Harvested leaves will keep only for 1 or 2 days and are best used on the day of purchase, or frozen.  The leaves can then be used from frozen in recipes. Basil can also be bought dried and stored in a jar, which is best kept in a cool dark place.

==Chopping Basil== 
Chopping Basil is an inefficient way to release the flavors from its cellular structure. To maximize flavor from chopped Basil, first place it in a ziploc bag, and then pound it with the flat of cleaver or a meat tenderizer. Pound until the leaves appear wet, and then proceed to chopping.

==Basil Recipes==
[[:Category:Basil recipes|List of basil recipes]]

==Other types of basil==
[[Cookbook:Cuisine of Thailand|Thai cuisine]] uses a different type of basil called Thai basil. It tastes more like mint or anise than basil, so it is not interchangeable with Italian basil.

'''Holy basil''' (or krapow) is also used in Thai cooking, and has a distinctive, hot flavor, quite different from both regular basil and Thai basil. See [[Wikipedia:Holy basil|Holy basil]].

'''Lemon basil''' is used in Indonesian cooking, eaten raw (often along with with raw vegetables: cabbage, cucumber and long beans) as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck.

==Seasonality==
{{Seasonality|Basil|1|1|1|1|2|3|3|3|3|1|1|1}}
Summer is basil season. In September (northern hemisphere) the plant will flower, indicating the end of its season. Basil will not survive frost, and thrives on sunlight, but many people manage to grow or keep basil inside during the winter months.

A '''garnish''' is a small, usually raw, addition to a cooked meal, intended to give visual appeal and perhaps a contrast in flavour and texture. The classic, indeed hackneyed, garnish is a sprig of [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]] on top of just about anything, but garnishes can include croûtons in [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]], or a slice of [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]] on fish.</text>

'''Dal''' (also spelt '''Dahl''') is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] term that means split, often hulled (skin removed) dried [[Cookbook:Legume|legumes]], and can cover many different types of legume.

It is also the name given to many dishes prepared with dal; the variety of lentil used and the method of cooking varies according to both region and personal taste. 


==Varieties==

The names give away the type of dal - chana dal is the split, hulled chana or brown chickpea, for example. Similarly, the [[w:Tamil language|Tamil]] name is the name of the legume plus ''parrappu'', as in ''kadalai parrappu'' (see [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Cuisine of India]] for more translations). The most widely used dal in India is toor dal.

* '''Chana dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Chickpea|brown chickpeas]] (Bengal gram, or chana)
* '''Chowli dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Black Eyed Pea|black eyed peas]]
* '''Masoor dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Lentil|red lentils]]
* '''Moong dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Mung Bean|mung beans]]
* '''Moth dal''' or '''Moath dal'''
* '''Rajma dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Kidney Bean|kidney beans]]
* '''Toor dal''', '''tuvar dal''', '''Arhar dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Pigeon Pea|pigeon peas]] (red gram)
* '''Val dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Lablab Bean|lablab beans]]
* '''Urad dal''' &amp;ndash; [[Cookbook:Urad Bean|urad]], or black gram

==Preparation==

Typically lentils are boiled to a semi-liquid consistency, and are spiced by adding vegetable oil or [[Cookbook:Ghee|ghee]] in which spices such as [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] and [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] seeds have been fried. 

Served with [[Cookbook:Roti|roti]] or rice and [[Cookbook:Raita|raita]]. Dal is a nutritious meal in itself.

== Recipe ==

The procedure for cooking dal in the typical Indian way is described below.

This recipe will serve four.

== Ingredients ==

* 1/2 Cup [[Cookbook:Mung Bean|Moong Dal]]

* 1.5 Cups [[Cookbook:Water|Water]]

* 1/2 tsp [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric Powder]]

* 3 [[Cookbook:Chili Pepper|Green Chilli]]

* 2 tbsps Cooking oil or [[Cookbook:Ghee|Ghee]]

* 1 sprig [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry Leaves]]

* 1 tsp [[Cookbook:Cumin|Jeera]] (cumin)

* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] to taste

== Procedure ==

# Cook the dal, green chillies and turmeric powder in water, in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes. Leave the pressure cooker to release steam on its own.
# After the steam is released, open the pressure cooker and mash the cooked dal. Add salt to taste. Add more water if it is too thick and heat on a medium flame.
# Heat oil or ghee. When hot, add jeera and curry leaves. After it splutters, pour it over the cooked dal.
# Serve hot with rice or rotis.

== Notes ==

* Onion or shallots, chopped finely (1 tsp), browned in oil and added to dal, gives a characteristic taste.

* Mustard seeds fried in oil can also be added.

Alternate method:
# Cook 1 cup of dal with 2 cups of water in the pressure cooker till 15min approx. While cooking you may add a pinch to turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon of oil.
# Once dal is cooked (with just water) then there are many methods to give tadka. I have described one method of plain dal and one method of tadka.

=== Plain Dal ===
* Cook the dal as mentioned above.
* Take the water above the dal away and save it. 
* Now, mash the dal with the help of back of a ladle &gt;&gt; + add 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric + a pinch of asafoetida + some (say 5gm) of jaggry + Salt to taste and mix well when you mash the dal. Do not mash to completely.
* Add the saved water + add some more water to make a soupy consistency (bit more thinner than soup)
* Start heating the dal... boil it for 2/3 mins taking care it should not spill. 
* While serving add 2/3 or more teaspoons of ghee to it. Can be served with warm chapati, roti, rice etc. Ideal for the children who do not eat spicy food.

=== Tadka ===
* Cook the dal as mentioned above.
* Take the water above the dal away and save it. 
* Here, do not mash it.
* As per the quantity of dal chop 2 to 3 medium sized tomatos finely + Chop 4 to 5 cloves of garlic + 1/2 inch of ginger + 1 to 2 green chilies. (Just make big pieces of green chilies)
* Heat 1 or 2 teaspoons of oil. Once oil is hot add &gt;&gt; cumin seeds 1/2 teaspoon &gt;&gt; garlic &gt;&gt; ginger &gt;&gt; chilies &gt;&gt; once the spluttering is subsidized, add 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric and then tomatoes. Sautè this mix well. Once tomatoes are done add cooked dal. Then add saved water... till the consistency is soupy. Add salt to taste.
* Once the dal is boiled... turn the heat to lowest.
* Take other small heavy bottomed pan.
* Put sufficient amount of oil (3 to 4 tbsps) 
* Heat the oil slowly. 
* Try putting some grains of cumin seeds to check heat (purpose is not to burn the tadka)
* Once heated sufficiently, add 2 to 2-1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds, large pinch of asafoetida; once this is done add 2 to 3 red chilies broken into pieces to this hot mix. (Take care of yourself!)
* Turn the heat down. Now add about 1 teaspoon of red chili powder to this mix... (Take care of yourself!)
* Pour this boiling oil mix over the simmering dal. As soon as you pour it, cover the dal wok with a lid.
* Do not mix this tadka completely with the dal. Garnish with finely coriander. Serve hot with roti, fulka, rice, jeera rice etc.</text>

[[File:Kafta Raita.JPG|thumb|Kafta Raita]]

'''Raita''' is an [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]] [[Cookbook:Garnish|garnish]] often served with spiced dishes. It acts as a cooling flavour as the fat in the yogurt dissolves and mollifies [[Cookbook:Chilli|chili]] in the curry, while the taste of [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumber]] and fresh [[Cookbook:Mint|mint]] or other herbs refreshes the palate. 

The essential ingredient is [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]]. Here is one simple recipe:

==Ingredients==

* 1/8 cup grated cucumber (about one inch of a cucumber)
* 1/2 cup yogurt
* 2 - 3 mint leaves, chopped (more to taste)
* 2 [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]] leaves, chopped (more to taste)
* Optionally 1 - 2 tablespoons finely chopped or minced onions.
* Ground cumin

==Procedure==

# Grate about an [[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] (2.5 cm) of a cucumber and drain off some of the liquid.
# Stir the cucumber into half a [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of yogurt. 
# Add chopped mint and [[Cookbook:Cilantro|cilantro]], and perhaps some finely chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onions]]
#add salt to taste.(rock salt goes much better).
# Sprinkle a little ground [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]] on top.
# sprinkle red chilly powder if required.

Refrigerate and serve cold.

**Conclusion [http://www.rtog.org/abstracts/astrolist.html#Hartsell ASTRO 2003 Abstract] : &quot;Palliative external beam radiation therapy is very effective in providing pain relief, with complete or partial improvement in pain seen in 66% of patients. Pain and narcotic relief is equivalent for both 30 Gy in 10 fractions and 8 Gy in a single fraction. At 3 months follow-up, there is no difference between the two treatment arms, regardless of stratification. Treatment was well tolerated with few adverse effects.&quot;

**Conclusion: PMID 8365932 &quot;The study design could not credibly establish a safe dose for hepatic irradiation, however, it did succeed in determining that 33 Gy in fractions of 1.5 Gy is unsafe, carrying a substantial risk of delayed radiation injury. The absence of apparent late liver injury at the 27 Gy and 30 Gy dose levels suggests that a prior clinical trial of adjuvant hepatic irradiation in patients with resected colon cancer may have employed an insufficient radiation dose (21 Gy) to fully test the question.&quot;

&lt;!-- ATTENTION:  Please keep the atomic masses limited to only 5 significant figures.  Any more than that is completely unnecessary for a textbook, and should be considered encyclopedic data.
Also, for radioactive/synthetic elements, put the mass of the most stable isotope in brackets. --&gt;

This '''Huge Table''' is a detailed periodic table that does not fit on most computer screens. However, in print with a small font, or in landscape mode, this table can be printed onto a single normal-sized paper (A4 or 8½ x 11&quot;).  For a printable version that uses less colored ink (and works without color), [[General Chemistry/Periodic Table/Print|see this.]]

'''This method was made by Sanjith Sagar, a student of Glendale Academy International, Hyderabad, India. He's currently in Grade 10.

'''Consider the first group. H,He,Li,Be. Remember as it is. It's a nice ring to it which helps. One advise is remember it as the Full forms. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium and Beryllium. End with -ium'''&lt;/br&gt;
'''Next group is B,C,N,O,F. All these are single letters. REMEMBER THEM LIKE A RUSSIAN NAME, BCNOF or remember it using the short forms because in this group all are alphabets not a combination like Be or Cl.'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Next group is Ne,Na. Okay try reading it together. Sounds like Nina(NeNa) right?. So that's how you remember it'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Next group is Mg,Al. Try reading this as well. Sounds like Migal(MgAl) right? Remember it this way'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Next group is Si,P,S. We can make a proper word out of this. Sips(Si,P,S).'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Next group is Cl,Ar,K. Make a word out of this. Clark(Cl,Ar,K).'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''And finally. Remember Ca as it is'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''The first 20 elements is very much required to do well in chemistry.'''
'''The order mentioned above is the ascending order of atomic number of elements'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''So it is:'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''The ring, BCNOF, Nina(NeNa), Migal(Mg,Al), Sips(Si,P,S), Clark(Cl,Ar,K) and Ca'''&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Is this book over PowerPC assembly or 68K assembly. The introduction would have you think that the 68K and the PPC are compatable. So, if this book wants to hold true to its title, then all the material should be removed. Otherwise the title of the book should be changed to 68K Assembly.

: Fixed. The title is now [[68000 Assembly]], the [[PowerPC Assembly]] is a completely separate book, and the confusion between them in the text has now been fixed to point out that they are, in fact, completely different assembly languages. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 14:59, 9 September 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Pruning ==

As this is ostensibly a bartender's guide, wouldn't it make sense to remove recipes for things like Eggnog that would never be produced by a bartender?  Also, it seems reasonable to separate cocktails and shooters onto separate pages.  Thoughts?

For that matter, is anyone actively reading this at all?

: I am. Though there is not much going on here it seems. Similar to the [[w:Wikipedia:WikiProject Cocktails|WikiProject Cocktails]] project. I would encourage anyone reading this to join the Project over there so we can get some cross-wiki discussion going on. I think there are several ways we can help each other out.

: As to the ''eggnog'' question, the same type of question has come up over there. What I am proposing at Wikipedia is to make &quot;mixed drinks&quot;, not cocktails, be the top-level of the hirearchy. True cocktails would be the largest section thereunder, but there would also be places for things like eggnog, spritzers, beer mixes, and other things that aren't technically cocktails. I'm not sure how things are organized here, but you might consider something similar to that if it makes sense in your wikiverse. :-) --[[User:Willscrlt|Willscrlt]] 13:04, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

== Fleshing Out Cocktail List ==
Over the next little while, I'm going to flesh out the cocktails list by creating all the non-existant pages linked to from this main page, and filling in recipes as described by Google, the almighty. These should be fairly correct, but I'm sure people will want to then make alterations for accuracy/variations. Hope this helps. [[User:Lor|Lor]] 21:37, 5 September 2005 (UTC)
== Indik ==
Wikipedia is discussing deleting a recipe for a cocktail purportedly named &quot;Indik&quot;.  See [[w:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Indik]].  If any editors wish to have the recipe transwikied to here, please say so in that discussion. [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] 00:32, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

== Field research? ==

{{Bartending:region|This is the (region)}}
Barmeister and drinkmixer and iDrink and friends are all giving different results.  I'm going to do some field research; I've added a Bartending:region|(region) template in case anyone does some field research and polls at least say 5 bartenders from your area, preferably in different establishments.  It's shown to the right.  It may be wise to regionalize the bartending wikibook, or find another way to denote that things come from various regions.

I'm especially interested in non-alcoholic cocktails, being myself one who dislikes alcohol's flavor and effects.  I don't get off on being slightly out of it, or plastered to the wall, or vomiting in someone's face; I like my brain operating at peak efficiency at all times.  This is my only strong interest in this wikibook; plus it will help eat some of my free time on weekends, social engineering my way into bars.

== I'm a newcomer - is this still active? ==

I'm slightly newish to Wikipedia and Wikibooks and I'm just wondering if these projects are still active? [[User:Italydiplo|Italydiplo]] ([[User talk:Italydiplo|talk]]) 06:00, 8 July 2008 (UTC)</text>

[[Image:Dices1-6.png|250px|right|thumb|When throwing two dice, what is the probability that their sum equals seven?]]

Probability is connected with some unpredictability. We know what outcomes may occur, but not exactly which one. The set of possible outcomes plays a basic role. We call it the ''sample space'' and indicate it by S. Elements of S are called ''outcomes''. In rolling a dice the sample space is S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Not only do we speak of the outcomes, but also about ''events'', sets of outcomes (or subsets of the sample space). E.g. in rolling a dice we can ask whether the outcome was an even number, which means asking after the event &quot;even&quot; = E = {2,4,6}. In simple situations with a finite number of outcomes, we assign to each outcome s (&amp;isin; S) its ''probability'' (of occurrence) p(s) (written with a small p), a number between 0 and 1. It is a quite simple function, called the probability function,  with the only further property that the total of all the probabilities sum up to 1. Also for events A do we speak of their probability P(A) (written with a capital P), which is simply the total of the probabilities of the outcomes in A. For a fair dice p(s) = 1/6 for each outcome s and P(&quot;even&quot;) = P(E) = 1/6+1/6+1/6 = 1/2.

The general concept of probability for non-finite sample spaces is a little more complex, although it rests on the same ideas.

== Introduction ==

=== Why have probability in a statistics textbook?  ===

Very little in mathematics is truly self contained.  Many branches of mathematics touch and interact with one another, and the fields of probability and statistics are no different.  A basic understanding of probability is vital in grasping basic statistics, and probability is largely abstract without statistics to determine the &quot;real world&quot; probabilities.

This section is not meant to give a comprehensive lecture in probability, but rather simply touch on the basics that are needed for this class, covering the basics of Bayesian Analysis for those students who are looking for something a little more interesting.  This knowledge will be invaluable in attempting to understand the mathematics involved in various [[Statistics:Distributions|Distributions]] that come later.

=== Set notion ===
A set is a collection of objects. We usually use capital letters to denote sets, e.g. A is the set of females in this room.

*The members of a set A are called the elements of A, e.g. Patricia is an element of A (Patricia &amp;isin; A); Patrick is not an element of A (Patrick &amp;notin; A).
*The universal set, U, is the set of all objects under consideration, e.g., U is the set of all people in this room.
*The null set or empty set, &amp;empty;, has no elements, e.g., the set of males above 2.8m tall in this room is an empty set.
*The complement A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; of a set A is the set of elements in U outside A, i.e. x &amp;isin; A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; iff x &amp;notin; A.
*Let A and B be 2 sets. A is a subset of B if each element of A is also an element of B. Write A &amp;sub; B, e.g. the set of females wearing metal frame glasses in this room &amp;sub; the set of females wearing glasses in this room &amp;sub; the set of females in this room.

• The intersection A &amp;cap; B of two sets A and B is the set of the common elements. I.e. x &amp;isin; A &amp;cap; B iff x &amp;isin; A and x &amp;isin; B.

• The union A &amp;cup; B of two sets A and B is the set of all elements from A or B. I.e. x &amp;isin; A &amp;cup; B iff x &amp;isin; A or x &amp;isin; B.

=== Venn diagrams and notation ===
A Venn diagram visually models defined events.  Each event is expressed with a circle.  Events that have outcomes in common will overlap with what is known as the intersection of the events.   
[[Image:Venn diagram ABC BW.png|thumb|left|A Venn diagram.]]
{{-}}

== Probability Axioms ==

== Calculating Probability ==

=== Negation ===

Negation is a way of saying &quot;not ''A''&quot;, hence saying that the complement of A has occurred. &lt;i&gt;Note: The complement of an event A can be expressed as A' or A&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For example: &quot;What is the probability that a six-sided die will '''not''' land on a one?&quot;  (five out of six, or ''p'' = 0.833) 
:&lt;math&gt;
P[ X' ] = 1 - P[ X ]
&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:GenericcomplementofeventA.png|thumb|Left|Complement of an Event]]&lt;p&gt;
Or, more colloquially, &quot;the probability of 'not X' together with the probability of 'X' equals one or 100%.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

Relative frequency describes the number of successes over the total number of outcomes. For example if a coin is flipped and out of 50 flips 29 are heads then the relative frequency is 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{29}{50}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Union of two events is when you want to know Event A OR Event B.&lt;Br&gt;

This is different from &quot;And.&quot; &quot;And&quot; is the intersection, whereas &quot;OR&quot; is the union of the events (both events put together).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[File:Union_example.jpg‎]]&lt;br&gt;
In the above example of events you will notice that...&lt;Br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Event A is a STAR and a DIAMOND.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Event B is a TRIANGLE and a PENTAGON and a STAR&lt;br&gt;
(A &amp;cap; B) = (A and B) = A intersect B is only the STAR&lt;br&gt;
But (A &amp;cup; B) = (A or B) = A Union B is EVERYTHING.  The TRIANGLE, PENTAGON, STAR, and DIAMOND&lt;br&gt;
Notice that both event A and Event B have the STAR in common.  However, when you list the Union of the events you only list the STAR one time!&lt;br&gt;
Event A = STAR, DIAMOND    EVENT B = TRIANGLE, PENTAGON, STAR&lt;br&gt;
When you combine them together you get (STAR + DIAMOND) + (TRIANGLE + PENTAGON + STAR)  BUT WAIT!!! STAR is listed two times, so one will need to SUBTRACT the extra STAR from the list.&lt;br&gt;
You should notice that it is the INTERSECTION that is listed TWICE, so you have to subtract the duplicate intersection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Conjunction ===
&lt;b&gt;Formula for the Union of Events:  P(A &amp;cup; B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A &amp;cap; B)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt; 
Let P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2 and P(A &amp;cap; B) = 0.15.  Find P(A &amp;cup; B).&lt;br&gt;
P(A &amp;cup; B) = (0.3) + (0.2) - (0.15) = 0.35&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Example:&lt;br&gt; 
Let P(A) = 0.3 and P(B) = 0.2 and P(A &amp;cap; B) = 0.  Find P(A &amp;cup; B).&lt;br&gt;
Note: Since the intersection of the events is the null set, then you know the events are DISJOINT or MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.&lt;br&gt;
P(A &amp;cup; B) = (0.3) + (0.2) - (0) = 0.5&lt;br&gt;

=== Disjunction  ===

=== Law of total probability === 

== Conditional Probability ==

What is the probability of one event given that another event occurs?  For example, what is the probability of a mouse finding the end of the maze, given that it finds the room before the end of the maze?

This is represented as:

:&lt;math&gt;
P[A | B]
&lt;/math&gt;

or &quot;the probability of ''A'' given ''B''.&quot;

&lt;math&gt;P(A | B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''A'' and ''B'' are '''independent''' of one another, such as with coin tosses or child births, then:

:&lt;math&gt;
P[A | B] = P[ A ]
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, &quot;what is the probability that the next child a family bears will be a boy, given that the last child is a boy.&quot;

This can also be stacked where the probability of ''A'' with several &quot;givens.&quot;

:&lt;math&gt;
P[A | B_1, B_2, B_3 ]
&lt;/math&gt;

or &quot;the probability of ''A'' given that B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are true?&quot;

--&gt;


=== Conclusion: putting it all together ===

I agree with the first comment, this document is a structural mess. There's also a lot of plain vague or overly specific stuff that would need to be improved. And to either change the name to Windows Know-How or generalise the content.

How about changing this to [[Using Windows/Tips and Tricks]] and building a book out of [[Using Windows]] and these things into just a chapter (after much cleaning of course).  I am not volunteering, I still have two books I myself am working on at the moment, but I think that the [[Using Linux]], [[Using Windows]], [[Using Mac OS X]] and any other operating system books would be neat rather than one big mess referring to computers as the operating system.  [[User:70.24.120.242|70.24.120.242]] 04:05, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)

These were considered a great delicacy by the Romans and were raised in special earthenware jars.  The animals have also apparently been an important food source in Slovenia and are still eaten today.  Two recipes have survived from Roman times:

* Glazed with honey and rolled in poppy seeds (Petronius) 
* Stuffed them with a mixture of pork mince, dormouse meat trimmings, pepper, nuts, asafoetida and nuoc mam and then roasting or boiling them (Apicius 8.9.1)

The old Romany (gypsy) way to cook a hedgehog is to roll it in clay and bake it in the embers of a bonfire.  When ready, the clay is broken open and the spines come away still embedded in it.

'''Guinea pigs''' are a traditional food source in the Andes. Meals incorporating guinea pig are particularly associated with ceremonial occasions. Although the meat was for a time falling out of favour there has been a resurgence in its consumption. The most traditional Peruvian manner of cooking guinea pig involves building a stone pit and lining it with llama dung and firewood and then burying guinea pig carcasses in the coals once the fire has built up heat.

__NOTOC__
==Ingredients==
*2½ cups (approx 625 ml) warm water
*1 packet dry (2 1/4 teaspoons) [[Cookbook:Yeast|yeast]]
*1 oz (30 g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] or [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
*2 lb (1 kg) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1 pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==Procedure==
#Put half of the water into a container, add yeast and either sugar or honey.
#Take another container and put in 2 pounds(1 kg) of flour. Form a crater in the middle into which you can pour the water with the yeast. Add a pinch of salt. Knead it and keep adding water until the dough has a good thick consistency. 
#Place the dough on a surface and let it stand for about 1 hour. Knead again to let the air out and knead it into the shape of a bread. Let it stand for another 45 minutes.
#[[Cookbook:Baking|Bake]] in an oven at 375°F (200 °C) for 50-60 minutes or until the internal temperature is about 200°F(95 °C).
#Now you have a nice, tasty loaf of bread.

==Tips==
If your bread seems crumbly or not sufficiently soft and bouncy, try using high gluten flour. You can get special bread making flour which is higher in gluten than normal flour.

'''Fried chicken''' has a dual origin in the rural American South. The Scots had a tradition of shallow cooking chicken in fat (not quite pan frying), unlike their English counterparts who baked or boiled chicken. Later, as African slaves were introduced to households as cooks, seasonings and spices were added that are absent in traditional Scottish cuisine, improving the flavor and they brought the concept of deep fat frying. Since slaves were often allowed to keep only chickens, frying chicken as a special occasion spread through the African American community. After slavery, poor rural southern blacks continued the tradition since chickens were often the only animals they could afford to raise. Since fried chicken could keep for several days, it travelled well, and also gained favor during segregation when blacks normally could not find places to eat and had to carry their own food. Southern whites also continued the tradition of frying chicken. Therefore, fried chicken continued to dominate as &quot;Sunday dinner&quot; or on other special occasions.

==Ingredients==

*1 fryer [[Cookbook:chicken|chicken]], cut up (see notes below)
*1 quart [[Cookbook:milk|buttermilk]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:salt|salt]]
*[[Cookbook:Spice rub|Spice rub]] (paprika is highly recommended. See below for how to prepare)
*[[Cookbook:Flour|Flour]]
*A quantity of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] suitable for the desired cooking method (see notes below)

==Procedure==
===Preparing the spice rub===
#Put a large amount of the spice in a bowl. 
#Add slightly less of some other seasonings, such as [[Cookbook:pepper|pepper]]. Mix it up. You now have a spice rub.

===Brining the chicken===
#Pour the buttermilk into a bowl and dissolve ½ cup of salt in the buttermilk.
#Piece by piece, roll the chicken around in the spice rub.
#Submerge each chicken piece in the buttermilk.
#Cover the bowl of buttermilk and chicken and refrigerate. (You can get by with as few as two hours if you are in a hurry, but the flavor will suffer. You can also park it overnight, but you should reduce the salt to ⅓ of a cup)
#Shortly before you want to cook the chicken, remove it from the buttermilk and drain. Roll it around in flour so that it is well covered in flour. Shake off the excess flour.

===Cooking the chicken, deep frying method===
#The safest cooking method is [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep frying]]. Immerse chicken in 360°F oil. Cooking times are:
#*Breasts: 10 minutes
#*Drumsticks: 12 minutes
#*Thighs: 13-14 minutes
#*Wings: 10 minutes (though wings are often better suited to other applications)
#Drain the chicken on a wire rack (place it over a sheet pan to catch the oil).

===Variation 1, pan frying method===
#The most traditional cooking method is [[Cookbook:Pan Frying|pan frying]] in a [[Cookbook:Cast iron|cast iron skillet]]. Care must be taken to avoid spilling and splattering.
#Heat enough oil (or shortening) to come 3-4mm up the side of the pan to 325°F.
#Carefully place chicken in pan, skin side down, and cook until brown, 10-12 minutes. Turn over and cook other side.
#Doing this will require some careful placement in the pan so as to cook the slow-cooking meat (such as thighs) more intensely than the fast-cooking meat (such as wings and breasts).
#Drain the chicken on a wire rack (place it over a sheet pan to catch the oil).

===Variation 2, pressure frying method===
#[[Cookbook:Pressure frying|Pressure frying]] gives excellent results, but special equipment is needed. A typical pressure cooker is not suitable for cooking with large quantities of oil; a pressure fryer must be used. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully.
#Put the chicken pieces into hot oil (larger pieces first) and fry about 3 minutes until very light brown. Then put on the lid and lock it.
#Cook at a pressure of 5-6 pounds for about 7 minutes.
#Drain the chicken on a wire rack (place it over a sheet pan to catch the oil).

==Notes, Tips, and Variations==
*The key to this recipe is the buttermilk brine, which seasons the chicken with a salty tanginess inside. Combined with a suitably zingy spice rub, this works out beautifully.
*This recipe is death to oil, so it's one you might want to save until you're thinking about changing your fryer oil anyway.
*As with all respectable fried chicken recipes, this recipe may be even better 24 hours after you cook it, when the chicken has been refrigerated.
*If you can get a pre-cut chicken, this is  ultimately easier. Alternatively, if you have a real preference for drumsticks, thighs, breasts, or some other part, feel free to buy just those. The quantities in the ingredient list, however, reflect two breasts, two thighs, and two drumsticks. (Don't waste the other parts on fried chicken; save them for chicken soup! But if you like fried chicken wings, increase the quantities a bit.)
*If you are kosher, lactose intolerant, not fond of buttermilk, or feeling experimental, feel free to play around with other possible brines here. If you use a less [[Wikipedia:viscous|viscous]] liquid than buttermilk, however, you may need to use an egg wash to make sure that the flour sticks to the chicken in sufficient quantity.
*Wings can also be saved, along with other leftover bits of carcass, to make [[Cookbook:Chicken Soup|chicken soup]].
*Personal preference chooses which spice to use as a base. A [[Cookbook:paprika|paprika]] based rub works very well for this recipe, but others will work just fine. [[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]] or [[Cookbook:Curry Powder|curry powder]] would also both be good choices. You can use [[Cookbook:Rosemary|Rosemary Powder]] and [[Cookbook:Bell Pepper|Green Bell Pepper Powder]] in order to give a more mediterranean taste to fried chicken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Internet began life as a research project sponsored by ARPA. Previously US defense computers were connected to each other in a one way fashion such that each computer was connected to the others in series. In case of one computer being destroyed all others would lose communication. To avoid this the government decided to connect the computers in a web with each computer connected to all others. The motivation was to connect the few then existing proprietary computer networks to one interconnected network. The first version of the Internet was called ARPANET and was implemented in 1969. It then consisted of 4 Nodes in UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, Stanford Research Lab, and the University of Utah. It was to be the predecessor of what is today called the Internet.

This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Wjgilmore. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Wjgilmore~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

We've seen that an Hamiltonian of the form

:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

describes motion under a conservative force, but this is not the most general possible Hamiltonian. 

Many waves are described by another simple form, in the geometrical optics limit,

:&lt;math&gt;H=f(|\mathbf{p}|)&lt;/math&gt;

What happens if we consider other forms for the Hamiltonian?

Suppose we have

:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}}{2m} + 
\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product term is the simplest scalar we can add to the kinetic energy that's dependent on momentum. We'll see that it acts like a potential energy.

Using Hamilton's equations we can immediately write down equations of motion.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\dot{x}_i &amp; = &amp; \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} &amp; = &amp; \frac{p_i}{m} + A_i \\
\dot{p}_i &amp; = &amp; -\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_i} &amp; = &amp;
 -p_j \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we are using the [[../Index Notation|summation convention]] here.

Now that we've got the equations of motion, we need to work out what they mean.

The first thing we notice is that the momentum is no longer ''m'''v'''''. There is an additional contribution from the potential field '''A'''. We can think of this as a form of ''potential momentum'', analogous to potential energy.

The force on the particle is

:&lt;math&gt;F_i = m \ddot{x}_i = \dot{p}_i + m\frac{d}{dt}A_i(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;

Using the chain rule, and substituting for ''dp''/''dt'' with the second equation of motion, we get

:&lt;math&gt;F_i =  -p_j \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i} +
m\dot{x}_j \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial x_j} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the first equation, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt;F_i = m \dot{x}_j 
\left( \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial x_j} -\frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i}
\right) + m A_j \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i} &lt;/math&gt;

The term in brackets is recognizable as being the type of thing we see in cross products. With a little manipulation, using the Kronecker delta and alternating symbol, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
F_i &amp; = &amp;  \dot{x}_j \left( \delta_{il}\delta_{jk}-\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} \right) \frac{\partial A_l}{\partial x_k} &amp; + &amp; m A_j \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i} \\
&amp; = &amp; \dot{x}_j \epsilon_{nij} \epsilon_{nlk} \frac{\partial A_l}{\partial x_k} 
&amp; + &amp; m A_j \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i} \\
&amp; = &amp; -\epsilon_{ijn} \dot{x}_j \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right)_n
&amp; + &amp; m A_j \frac{\partial A_j}{\partial x_i} \\
&amp; = &amp; -\epsilon_{ijn} \dot{x}_j \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right)_n
&amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} A_j A_j
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so, writing the last line as a vector equation,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = -m \mathbf{v} \times (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) + 
\frac{1}{2} m \nabla A^2 &lt;/math&gt;

The force from this potential has a component perpendicular to its curl and to the velocity, and another component which is the gradient of a scalar.

If we add a carefully chosen potential energy to the Hamiltonian we can cancel out this second term.

:&lt;math&gt;H=\frac{p^2}{2m} + \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{r}) + 
\frac{1}{2} m A^2 \qquad
\mathbf{F}= -m \mathbf{v} \times \left (\nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

This Hamiltonian can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p}+ m\mathbf{A} \right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where the term in bracket is ''m'''v''''', written as a function of momentum. 

This simple modification to the Hamiltonian gives us a force perpendicular to velocity, like magnetism. Because the force and velocity are perpendicular, the work done by the force is always zero.

''We can use potential fields to describe velocity dependent forces, provided that they do no work.''

The coefficient of '''A''' in these expression is arbitrary. Changing it amount merely to measuring '''A''' in different units so we can equally well write 

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{1}{2m} \left( \mathbf{p}+ \alpha\mathbf{A} \right)^2 \qquad
\mathbf{F}= -\alpha \mathbf{v} \times \left (\nabla \times \mathbf{A} \right) 
&lt;/math&gt;

Having &amp;alpha;=''m'' means '''A''' is measured in units of velocity, which may sometimes be convenient, but we can use any other constant value of &amp;alpha; that suits our purpose. When we come to study relativity, we'll use &amp;alpha;=-1.

Notice that the force depends only on the curl of '''A''', not on '''A''' itself. This means we can add any function with zero curl to '''A''' without changing anything, just as we can add a constant to the potential energy.

Furthermore, it is a standard result of vector calculus that any vector field is the sum of two components, one with zero curl, the other with zero divergence. Since the zero curl component does not affect the total force, we can require it to be zero; i.e. we can require '''A''' to have zero divergence.

:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A}= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is called a ''gauge'' condition. For the moment, it can be considered to define especially natural values for the integration constants.</text>

Eibwen, you are mistaken about odds.  Please see the Wikipedia article on [[w:Odds|odds]].  As it says both here in the text, and there, odds is the ratio of the probability an event will happen to the probability it will not happen.  Mathematically, odds = p/(1-p).  The probability a coin will land heads is 50%.  The probability it will not land heads is 50%.  Therefore, the odds it will land heads is 50%/50% = 1:1, not 1:2. [[User:CyborgTosser|CyborgTosser]] 08:18, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

The approach in the material I have added, by the way, is loosely based on ''Probability and Random Processes with Applications to Signal Processing'' by Henry Stark and John W. Woods. [[User:CyborgTosser|CyborgTosser]] 10:47, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

==Abstract Algebra==
It would seem that if somebody had a passable grasp of abstract algebra (other than what you might learn about Fields in freshman year courses) then you'd think that they'd probably have been introduced to probablility to some extent. Wouldn't it be better to omit the abstract algebra if at all possible?</text>

'''Pastry''' is made from a mixture of (at minimum) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]], fat and water, used to encase or cover food in the form of [[Cookbook:Pie|pies]], [[Cookbook:Tart|tarts]] etc.

Pastry is generally dry, delicate, and flaky. The delicacy and flakiness of a pastry is determined by how much the dough is mixed, how thin the dough is, how much fat is involved, and the melting properties of the fat. A [[Cookbook:Pie_Crust|pie crust]], for instance, is delicate due to the relatively low amount of mixing (and hence, low gluten production), and is flaky due to the high fat to flour ratio. A [[Cookbook:Croissant|croissant]] dough, unlike a pie crust, will endure a high amount of mixing (thus more gluten) but the dough is rolled into very thin layers between a large amount of fat.

One of the main goals of pastry dough preparation is to avoid combining the fat and the other ingredients. The fat should be distributed in the other ingredients while remaining unique from them; in a pie crust this is achieved by using a [[Cookbook:Pastry Blender|pastry blender]] to cut the fat into small chunks, which &quot;float&quot; in the rest of the ingredients, while in a croissant this is achieved by mixing the dough separately, folding the dough over the fat, then rolling and folding the dough over itself a number of times to produce distinct layers of dough and fat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stereoisomers are properly named using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to decide which parts of the molecule to consider first.

The rules have evolved to cover many situations, but the basic rules are:

#Consider the first atom of each part of the molecule. An atom with higher atomic number has higher priority. (e.g. I &gt; Cl &gt; C &gt; H)
#If the first atom of two groups is the same, consider the second atom(s) in the same way as the first. (e.g. -C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; -CH(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; -CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). If this does not assign priority, consider the next atoms until there is a difference.

Realize that when you do this it will mean that sometimes groups with higher total weights will have lower priority because of a lower weight of the atom that connects them.

==R and S Notation==

R- and S-notation use the CIP priority rules for the assignment of the ''absolute configuration'' around a stereocenter.  

First, assign priorities as described above to each bonded group surrounding the stereocenter (1, highest to 4, lowest).

Second, point the lowest priority (4) atom away from you.  Follow the direction of the remaining 3 priorities from highest  to lowest priority (lowest to highest number, 1&lt;2&lt;3).  

A counterclockwise direction is an S (Latin for ''sinister'', left) configuration.
A clockwise direction is an R (Latin for ''rectus'', right) configuration.

[[Image:CIP-RS_configurations.png|frame|center|Direction of the travel 1-2-3 dictates configuration]]
'''R-S system''' RULES OF PRIORITY ORDER:-

 (1)According to the atomic number when only atom is present and in a group the direct attached atom is considered with atomic number.
 (2)When two or more groups have similar first atom, the priority is determined by considering the atomic number of second atom.
 (3)If the first atom of two same groups have same substitutes of higher no will get more priority.
 (4)More atomic number containing atom and how many atoms are present of the higher atomic number containing elements.

==E-Z notation==

The R-/S- notation is valid only for the the absolute configuration of a center having single bonds only. In the case of a double bond, the traditional ''cis''/''trans'' nomenclature system is not sufficiently accurate and the ''E-''/''Z-'' is currently preferred.

The basis is again the CIP priority rules.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called DanShi. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name DanShi~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Some info about Windows CE/Windows Mobile... ==

... is the topic which I plan to cover in this textbook (if the author is agree, of course).

And please excuse my mistakes. :) --[[User:212.45.8.211|212.45.8.211]] 22:31, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Clean up ==

This needs a expert to go through and do some real clean up to it.....I've done a few touch up but I can not really explain a whole lot

== Too big a topic? ==

Am I alone in thinking that this book may be trying to tackle too big a topic without much real focus? Right now it seems to be a mix between some Windows history with a little bit of Windows optimisation tricks in it and a few other miscellaneous pieces of info.

Would it perhaps be more useful to take the information in this book and put it into other more focused books and delete this one?

: Yes, I agree that more focused books might be an improvement. But which specific books are you talking about? [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]]? [[Operating System Design]]? Some new books specifically designed include topics discussed in this book that don't already have a place in some pre-existing wikibook? --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:28, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

: I agree, it would be a bit of work but do able. I think that each OS should have it's own book. I know a lot about these systems, but I don't know if I qualify as an expret. [[User:MWOAP|MWOAP]] ([[User talk:MWOAP|talk]]) 02:56, 6 November 2009 (UTC)

This Wikibook currently suggests that I &quot;Google for a list&quot;.

While admittedly a work in progress, He has set the stage for developing educational activities based on the fundementals of '''serial communications'''.

== style guide ; feedback (strictly imo) ==

If you see how http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk713/tk628/technologies_tech_note09186a00800f9e3a.shtml is written, there is a technical style in use here.  I'm not familiar with the rest of the wikibook here to make an absolute judgment.  However, it's in my opinion that the style could be changed from a speaker, to a reference.  If the goal is to make the content not too technical, I still think it can be accomplished.

Just my two cents.  thanks, and good luck. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:66.129.242.4|66.129.242.4]] ([[User talk:66.129.242.4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/66.129.242.4|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Keep in mind, this was not intended to be a reference manual originally, but something more of an informal tutorial.  I deliberately tried to follow the style used in what IMHO thought was an outstanding tutorial book with Jack Crenshaw's &quot;Let's Build A Compiler!&quot; text (Google the name and you'll find the book).  I certainly didn't want a dry reference manual, as there are dozens of those for serial programming that are available.  In fact, the kind of ultra dry and terse writing that you have given in the above example is precisely what I was trying to avoid.

:I've sort of run out of steam with this book and haven't really worked on it for... gosh... almost a year now or more.  It is something that I want to get back to, and really work on stylistically.  There are a whole bunch of areas that I haven't even touched including some more high-level applications I'd like to get into.  But even so there is some content that can still be useful for understanding the low-level guts of serial communication.  

:I don't want this to sound that I'm &quot;possessive&quot; of this text, and I'm willing to let others &quot;edit mercilessly and redistribute at will&quot;.  Even so, it is important to know where I was coming from to start this project oh so long ago.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] ([[User talk:Robert Horning|talk]]) 04:11, 29 June 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''L.In.O.L.E.U.M.''' (also called ''Linoleum'' or ''Lino'') is a programming language developed by Alessandro Ghignola. It is an assembler, easier than native assembly, and twice as fast as C/C++. Uniquely it is designed to be recompilable across CPUs.

Compilers are free. Versions exist for Linux and Windows, although the Linux port is currently incomplete (most features are working). Currently, compilable files use the extension &quot;.txt&quot;. After installing, in Windows, right-clicking on a txt file gives the option to read into notepad (as usual) or compile into a Linoleum executable file &quot;.exe&quot;.

Code is cleaner and simpler than C, with comments appearing in parentheses (like so), which seems rather obvious and then someone does it.

==Installation==
# Download the latest Lino package from the Lino website.  (Or here: [http://www.anynowhere.com/postline/cd/zips/fpWeu2ngte4h3Jkig1.zip Lino package] [http://www.anynowhere.com/postline/cd/zips/fpWeHvsetlhhTpWef8Q3l.zip Lino compiler v1.14 Alpha])
# Unzip the file into the &quot;C:\LINOLEUM&quot; folder of your computer
# Open the &quot;readme.htm&quot; file and follow the installation instructions placed in the &quot;Terms of use&quot; section.

==Sample Code==
Code from MyLinoClock4.0:&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-size:10px;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is a part of the program that gets the position of the mouse pointer, then draws a shape in a companion library.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;mousepointer&quot;
        [Function for the arrow routine] = ERASE IT;
        [Shape data] = Arrow Background;
        =&gt; Update Arrow Background;

        [Pointer Command] = READ POINTER; isocall;

        [Current arrow X] = [Pointer X Coordinate];
        [Current arrow Y] = [Pointer Y Coordinate];

        [Function for the arrow routine] = STORE IT;
        =&gt; Update Arrow Background;

        [Function for the arrow routine] = ERASE IT;
        =&gt; Check Arrow Format;
        =&gt; Update Arrow Background;
        end;&lt;/pre&gt;

A tutorial to introduce Linoleum to people new to programming has been written by the user known on the [http://anynowhere.com anynowhere.com community] as Ponche. It is available there, along with French and Italian translations and an editable version, in the &quot;l.in.oleum&quot; section under &quot;Advice For Newbies&quot;.

Ghignola has also said the following of learning Lino:

&quot;About learning the programming language (traditional way, if you don't like this one try with the Lino tutorial):
# Rest in bed for a few days. When you wake up, make yourself a BIG coffee
# Read the Compiling and Programming sections of the manual. Take a global point of view of what is all this about
# Now comes the harder part... read all about the periods. This is, the libraries, stockfile, directors, constants, variables, workspace and programme sections.
# If you achieve to arrive to this step, try to understand the very first examples placed at the &quot;examples&quot; folder of the package. Experiment with them and check the modifications at runtime
# After this you can read other sections of the manual, like Process, and Subroutines. Useful stuff.
# During the whole process if you find something strange or a new instruction you didn't met before, check the Glossary, Instructions, Tags and Isokernel sections of the manual (it's a technical reference, but if you want to be a programmer, you must mess up with this later or before...)
# Of course, if you have any question, doesn't matter if it is stupid, just post it in the Linoleum forum and I or someone else will be glad to answering you.&quot;

==Projects==
Probably, the largest project written in Linoleum is the ongoing (started October 2001, not finished as of June 2006) development of the space exploration game [[w:Noctis Noctis V|Noctis Noctis V]] by the author of Lino, Alessandro Ghignola. For information about NV, visit the [http://anynowhere.com/bb/posts.php?t=409&amp;p=3 NV page] on the anynowhere forum.
The largest single collection of Linoleum programs is at [http://home.versatel.nl/kleinhaneveld/index.html Peterpaul kl h's Lino website.]

A [http://anynowhere.com/bb/posts.php?t=1810 PNG image exporter] has also been written by Peterpaul kl h.
A [http://anynowhere.com/bb/posts.php?t=2449 ray tracer] has been developed in Lino by the user Ponche - note that updated versions are posted on the above thread.

==Future==
[http://www.anynowhere.com/postline/cd/zips/fpWeHvseLfwee1.zip Sample program compiled in the upcoming Linoleum version 1.14] (Program created by Jaxe'd, compiled by Alex)

Most assemblers are used to develop programming skills. To generate code that is different can be seen in potential from the look and feel of Lino programs. Whether it moves beyond a small band of enthusiasts depends on creating suitable material that interests a wider audience.

If you have ideas please add:

# Where Lino is
# Where it is directed
# How it will get there

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Ásatrú is the faith and the way of life which springs from the specific spiritual beliefs of the Northern Europeans. It is as old as this branch of the human race, which came into being 40,000 years ago. Along with other native European faiths, it fell into shadow for some centuries after the Christian conversion of Northern Europe. During the last quarter of the twentieth century Common Era, it re-emerged as modern men and women took up the faith of Ásatrú once more.

Ásatrú is a faith which honors many gods and tells stories of many worlds, of which Midgard (Earth, or the world of Men) is but one.  At the heart of Ásatrú lies the  desire of men to hold to a way of life which brings honor to them, strength to their  kin and families, and closeness to the Gods and Godesses who Ásatrúar (adherents of Ásatrú) hold to be their Eldest Kinfolk.

This faith is very different from Christianity, which has been the religion of most Europeans for the last ten to twelve centuries.  Ásatrú does not consider men to be &quot;fallen&quot; and in need of &quot;saving&quot;.  Men and women, one by one, simply exist, each different from the next, having the potential in them for rightness and honor.  Some will bring this forth and some will not.  Ásatrú honors Gods, but does not hold them to be all-knowing or all-ruling.  Anyone who needs -- openly or secretly -- an all-knowing, all-ruling God, would most likely find Ásatrú's Gods unfit for the role.  In Ásatrú, a man's heart and mind belong to him, and his fate is held to be far closer linked to actions and conduct than to beliefs and professions.  Physical death is part of that fate for every man, and while there is much in Germanic mythology about the afterlife and worlds beyond our Earth, Ásatrú makes no promise of admission to a blissful &quot;heaven&quot; simply for believing or following a certain doctrine.  

In other Worlds, as in ours, Gods, spirits and beings have fates due to the actions they take based on their own will and wisdom.

There is no demand that Ásatrúar convert others to their faith, and there is no record that its historical adherents tried to do so. 

Ásatrú is thousands of years old. It's beginnings are lost in prehistory, but as an organized system, it is older by far than Christianity.

==The Runes==
The Runes go back when time began, we of Ásatrú have set a date from when the first Futhark was discovered 2259 [as of 2009] years ago. This is known as the Runic Era which places us to date in the year 2259 R.E.. comparable to [2009 AD]

Ásatrúar have always lived in close harmony with the environment, the seasonal and stellar cycles, their Gods and Goddesses, and their ancestors. These forces come together in the mysterious symbols known as Runes. The word Rune means a secret or a whisper. Runes are magical tools for both divination and spell casting.

: I know that I hung on Yggdrasil
: For nine nights long
: Wounded by spear
: Consecrated to Oðin
: Myself a sacrifice to myself
: Upon that tree
: The wisest know not the roots 
: of ancient times whence it sprang.

: None brought me bread
: None gave me mead
: Down to the depths I searched
: I took up the Runes
: Raised them with song
: And from that tree I fell.

: Runes you shall know, and readable staves,
: Very powerful staves, Very great staves
: Graven by the mighty one who speaks
: Carved by the highest hosts

: Oðin among the Aesir,
: Dvalin (sleeper) among dwarfs,
: Dáin (dead) among alfs,
: Alvitter (all-knowing) among etins,
: I myself carved some for mankind

The following are not recommendations, Alfather commands you to know the following if you are Ásatrúar.

: Know how to carve,  know how to read,  
::     know how to stain,  know how to understand,
: know how to ask,    know how to offer, 
::    know how to evoke,  know how to sacrifice.

The current version of this module lists desirable traits in person, and has not much connection to the former title, &quot;masculinity&quot;.

== Chivalry ==
Starts with politeness and common courtesy

Reverence and respect for womanhood.  (They are half of the human race, and mothers to the other half!)

&quot;Milady, your chariot awaits&quot; as opposed to *HONK! HOOOOOONK!* on the car horn

Dwelling on a girl's good characteristics, rather than bad characteristics.  (Think &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;)

Masculinity- The degree or property of being masculine or manly; manliness

E.g. Girls Were Dressing, to the boys wearing sporty clothes or baggy clothing

== Protectiveness ==
Some protection that one person can provide to their partner:
* financial stability and security
* honor? safety? (FIXME how?)

== Competitiveness ==
Also related to ambition.

Some persons adore those who become the best they can be.

== Physical Strength ==
Some persons adore those with physical strength who do help instead of bully other people. One can use physical strength to help move furniture and other heavy objects.

== Moral Strength ==
A person that maintains morals has more respect.  Furthermore, a person who chooses to be dishonest are often discovered and dumped.

== Humility ==
It is advantageous to be able to admit fault to one who one loves. It is advantageous to be able to say, &quot;I am sorry&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An extremely specialized attack, '''meet in the middle''' is a known plaintext attack that only affects a specific class of encryption methods - those which achieve increased security by using one or more &quot;rounds&quot; of an otherwise normal symmetrical encryption algorithm. An example of such a compound system is 3DES.

However, to explain this attack let us begin with a simpler system defined as follows:
Two cryptographic systems denoted &lt;math&gt;encrypt_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;encrypt_\beta&lt;/math&gt; (with inverse functions &lt;math&gt;decrypt_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;decrypt_\beta&lt;/math&gt; respectively) are combined simply (by applying one then the other) to give a composite cryptosystem. each accepts a 64 bit key (for values from 0 to 18446744073709551615) which we can call &lt;math&gt;key_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;key_\beta&lt;/math&gt; as appropriate.

So for a given plaintext, we can calculate a cryptotext as 

&lt;math&gt;cryptotext=encrypt_\beta( key_\beta , encrypt_\alpha(key_\alpha,plaintext))&lt;/math&gt;

and correspondingly

&lt;math&gt;plaintext=decrypt_\alpha( key_\alpha , decrypt_\beta(key_\beta,cryptotext))&lt;/math&gt;

Now, given that each has a 64 bit key, the amount of key needed to encrypt or decrypt is 128 bits, so a simple analysis would assume this is the same as a 128 bit cypher.

However, given sufficient storage, you can reduce the effective key strength of this to a few bits larger than the largest of the two keys employed, as follows.

#Given a plaintext/cyphertext pair, apply &lt;math&gt;encrypt_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to the plaintext with each possible key in turn, generating &lt;math&gt;2^{64}&lt;/math&gt; ''intermediate cryptotexts'' &lt;math&gt;cryptotext_1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;cryptotext_n&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n=2^{64}&lt;/math&gt;
#Store each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; cryptotexts in a ''hash table'' so that each can be referenced by its cryptotext, and give the key used to generate that cryptotext
#Apply &lt;math&gt;decrypt_\beta&lt;/math&gt; to the ciphertext for each possible key in turn, comparing the ''intermediate plaintext'' to the hash table calculated earlier. this gives a pair of keys (one for each of the two algorithms employed, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;)
#Taking the two keys from stage 3, test each against a second plaintext/cryptotext pair. if this also matches, odds are extremely high you have a valid keypair for the message - not in &lt;math&gt;2^{128}&lt;/math&gt; operations, but a &quot;mere&quot; &lt;math&gt;2x2^{64}&lt;/math&gt; operations (which nonetheless are significantly longer due to the hash table operations, but not so much as to add more than a couple of extra bits worth of time to the complexity of the task)

The downside to this approach is storage. Assuming you have a 64 bit key, then you will need at least &lt;math&gt;2^{64}&lt;/math&gt; ''units'' of storage - where each unit is the amount of space used by a single hash record. Even given a minimal implementation (say, 64 bits for the key plus four bits hash collision overhead), if you implemented such a system using 160GB hard drives, you would need close to one billion of them to store the hash table alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a South African physiotherapist teaching at a university in Cape Town. I'm interested in the use of emerging online and mobile technologies to change teaching and learning practice at an undergraduate level, which is the focus of my doctoral thesis. I'm also interested in the role that content licenses play in the distribution of content and believe strongly in an academic / knowledge commons where content is available for educational use without restrictive licensing. I completed my Masters degree at the University of the Western Cape in 2008 where I looked at the use of Information and Communication Technology as means of supporting physiotherapy students.

I graduated from the University of the Western Cape in 2001 with a BSc. (Physiotherapy) degree and began traveling immediately after graduating. I spent two years moving between Cape Town, London and San Francisco before settling in Ireland for a year and a half. This is where I completed my basic grade rotations in two rural hospitals, moving between acute medical and surgical departments, respiratory and intensive care, orthopaedics and outpatients. After that I moved to England where I spent two and half years doing community work in the National Health Service.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a number of existing Wikipedia articles on [[Wikipedia:Category:Bioinformatics|bioinformatics]] and computational biology; the article on [[Wikipedia:Biostatistics|biostatistics]] is also helpful.


There is some disagreement on the proper uses of the following terms.  The meanings intended by the author are summarized below:

; Bio- : Etymology: From the Ancient Greek βίος (bios), “‘life’”.

; Bioinformatics : The science of the treatment of biological information, especially large quantities of biological information.

; Biological System : A group of organs or organelles that work together to perform a certain task. (see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_system| Wikipedia Biological System]])

; Biological Systems : A group of biological systems that work together producing an organism ie a living being, ie life

; Biostatistics : The sub-discipline of Bioinformatics concerned with probability and hypothesis validation on biological data. The term Biostatistics predates &quot;Bioinformatics&quot; considerably.

; Computational Biology : Computationally-intensive methods to treat biological information. Generally this implies treatment of large amounts of data, but not always.

; Control System : A device or set of devices to manage, command, direct or regulate the behavior of other devices or systems.

; Control Systems of Biological Systems : A group of factors working to keep a group of organs balanced and still flexible enough to respond to hostile and variable environments

; Functional Genomics : The study of functional information derived from entire proteomes; ''alternatively'', high-throughput study of protein functions in general.

; Genome : All the genes derived from one organism make up a single genome.

; Genomics : The study of information derived from entire genomes; ''alternatively'', high throughput study of genes in general.

; Informatics : The science of information, the practice of information processing, and the engineering of information systems.

; Organism : Any living system (such as animal, plant, fungus, or micro-organism). In at least some form, all organisms are capable of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development, and maintenance of homeostasis as a stable whole

; Proteome : All the proteins coded for by the sequences of a single genome, including their structures and functions, make a single proteome.

; Structural Genomics : The study of structural information derived from entire proteomes; ''alternatively'', high-throughput study of protein structures in general.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Verses 1-4 ==
Jesus comforts his disciples and calls upon them to invest both trust and faith in the Lord.  He does this by once again inferring (and thus predicting) his own death and resurrection.  Though Jesus' use of foreknowledge is nothing new in John's gospel, his description of divine destination is completely unique.  &quot;I am going there to prepare a place for you. 3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am&quot; (John 14:2,3).  This heavenly destination is not exclusive to Jesus however; he explicitly states that his disciples are the motivating factor in regard to this preparation.  After this strange statement, Jesus reminds the disciples that they &quot;know the way to the place where I am going&quot; (John 14:4).    &quot;The way&quot; is not a physical path, but a lifestyle of submission and faith that has been taught to Jesus' disciples from the beginning of his ministry; and the &quot;place&quot; is obviously near the Father, (aka heaven).

There is also disagreement  in the arrangement of Chapter 14.  &quot;The fact that in 14:31 Jesus tells his disciples to get up and depart, but they do not, has suggested to many commentators that there has been some disarrangement of the text,&quot; (Smith 263).  The fact that the disciples would not obey Jesus seems inconsistent with the text.  One argument, Smith continues, is that 15-17 were added later, as is a possibility in many parts of this Gospel.

Jesus reassures his disciples the events that are to come should not be troubling to them and they should trust God during this time.  Jesus also reassures the disciples they know the way to the kingdom of Heaven.  Throughout Jesus' ministry the disciples showed a lack of understanding of Jesus' teachings and mission.  Now Jesus is reassuring the disciples they know what they need to know from his teachings.

== Verse 6 &quot;The Way the Truth and the Life&quot; ==

John 14:6 may be one of the best known verses of the Gospel of John.  Jesus announces to his disciples, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life.  No one comes to the Father but through Me.&quot; (NASB)  This verse fits with the often stark contrast of dark and light in the gospel of John, especially as depicted of &quot;the Jews&quot; who are constantly in the dark.  Some argue that this exclusivity only applies to those immediately exposed to Jesus, saying that all have received &quot;the light&quot; (cf. 1:9) and must respond to the light they are given.

== Verse 12, the person who believes in Jesus will do the things Jesus did ==
He who believes in Jesus will do the same things that Jesus did.

Some of the things that characterized Jesus' and made it different than the lives of the people who went before him were:

* sacrificial love
* confrontation of sin
* spending time with his disciples
* teaching people how to be close to God
* praying fervently to God
* believing and trusting in God

So Jesus' expectation was that those who believed in him develop similar characteristics in their lives.

An important part of this verse states that those who believe in Jesus will not only do similar works to Jesus, but also &quot;greater works than [them] because [Jesus] is going to the Father.  An interpretation of this verse is that Jesus is referring to the idea that His followers will perform the act of proclaiming the resurrection.  In other words, Jesus is saying, &quot;What could be greater than spreading the news of my resurrection to the world?&quot;

== Verse 14 &quot;I will do anything that you ask in my name&quot; ==

Jesus refers to things that are in line with his teaching and will. By looking at other scriptures that describe God's heart we can construct a list of things that Jesus has in mind that his disciples would ask for:

* unity among believers (Jn 15)
* faith (various)
* spiritual fruit (Jn 15)
* a new heart
* changes in character (2 Peter 1)
* healing of the heart (James 5:15, 16)
* understanding and wisdom

Other scriptures demonstrate that to ask for things a believer uses prayer. This is an ongoing communication with God, talking with him, asking for things and sometimes insisting over time.

Jesus uses the plural &quot;you&quot;, speaking immediately to his group of disciples, and by extension, those who would come to believe through their efforts. By talking to the group and using the plural &quot;you&quot;, as well as the help of other passages, we know that the prayers are one person for himself as well as one person praying for another or for others.

== Verse 15 The one who loves Jesus will obey his commands ==
Jesus commanded many things of his disciples, principally moral teachings about how to treat one another and how to relate to God.

Rather than focus on the emotional aspects of a relationship with him, Jesus calls the attention of his followers to their actions. A disciple of Jesus' who loves him will obey him. This implies that in the areas that Jesus gives commands, Jesus becomes the person who calls the shots in one's life, not the person person who professes love for Jesus. This was acted out in the lives of many thousands of early followers of Jesus', many of whom obeyed to the death at the hands of non-believers. At the time of the writing of John, most of the Apostles and many other followers had already been killed for obeying Jesus' commands.

Jesus then goes on to explain in verse 16 how he will ask the Father to send another advocate for his disciples. He speaks of the Holy Spirit, which will always remain with the disciples of Jesus as a counselor.  The purpose of this discourse has been questioned by some as a possible way that John attempts to allow for a progressive revelation of doctrine by leaving the door open for future revision after the death of Jesus.  By having Jesus explain that there will be an &quot;Advocate&quot; that will come to guide them after his death, John could very well be addressing the concerns of the Christian community who might have been divided on certain issues and were seeking ways to settle disputes in the absence of a firm stance by Jesus.  This view also lends itself well to subsequent church history as we have seen that the &quot;Spirit of Truth&quot; or Holy Spirit has been credited with guiding the decisions of church doctrine throughout history.  Without this guide it would have been difficult for church leaders to make decisions of doctrine with any type of authority if they were not clearly outlined by Jesus.  So it is an interesting question to wonder if Jesus actually said something along these lines or if this was an attempt by John to address issues and concerns of the Christian community of his day.

== Verses 18 and 19 I will not leave you orphans ==
The word 'orphan' appears here in the Greek. Note that he addressed them as little children in John 13:33, showing his deep love and affection for them. He saw them as vulnerable children in a hostile world, in his absence. That is how the disciples would feel when Jesus was no longer with them on Earth.  But they need not feel like that; he would send another spirit/angel to them.  For the elohim/angel, their parakletos in Greek, would be their supporter.  The Spirit/angel is not explicitly mentioned here, but it is through the Spirit/angel  teaching Jesus to them that they will draw nearer to the ever-living Father.

== Verse 21-23 Obedience gains a believer the love of Jesus and his Father ==
Besides the universal love for mankind expressed throughout the gospels and New Testament, Jesus talks about a love that comes specifically when his followers obey the commands of his Father. This level of love is conditional to an extent on the response of the believer. Jesus describes love for him as minding his word.

Jesus tells the disciples in this section about the coming of the Holy Spirit/angel in the near future.  The Holy Spirit/angel will teach the disciples and will lead the disciples in their mission to spread the message of Jesus throughout the world.

== verse 27-29 ==

In this passage Jesus tells his disciples he's leaving them in/with peace meaning that once he is gone they should still be assured and comforted that he will not have left them in spirit, only body.  &quot;This peace, bestowed upon them from the throne of God, was His gift to them -- the indwelling Spirit/angel Who would assure them of His presence no matter what life would bring&quot; (Speer 445).  Furthermore, Jesus reminds them that he will once again return to them, but later.  If anything they should rejoice that he is going to be with his Father(in heaven) for the Father is greater than anything.  The last verse &quot;I am telling you this now before it happens.  When it does happen you will believe&quot; (14:29) is a prophecy to let them know that they will finally realize everything once it all occurs.

== Verse 30 The one who is boss here in this world ==
Jesus refers to the Devil as master of this world. This is because the majority of human desires go against the desires of God. The most dramatic example of this is the reaction of the people who rose up to kill Jesus, a person who preached about the will of God and how the people needed to change what they were doing.

Some people believe that God controls everything that happens on this planet but not according to Jesus. He told us to pray for God's will to be done. That means his will is not being done.

In the time period that John was written, Greco-Roman religion worshiped the Emperor.  Traditionally, Jews had exemption from Emperor worship, because of their own beliefs.  It is possible that when the Jewish Christians were cast out of the synagogue, they were told that they weren't Jewish from an &quot;official&quot; standpoint, not being in the Temple; they were also persecuted by the Romans, who &quot;wanted&quot; them to partake in Emperor worship.  For this reason, this verse could possibly refer to the anti-Christ.  The book of Revelations possibly supports this theory: in this book, the beast, referred to as the anti-Christ, has many characteristics which point to it being a symbol for the Emperor.

The follower of Jesus, in contrast, has a very different master in his heart. Rather than being guided by selfish human desires, the follower of Jesus is directed by the word of God. This includes going against many common beliefs of the non-believing world, and often against the natural desires of the human heart. To allow Jesus to be the lord of one's life means self-denial (Luke 14) and sacrifice. Jesus leads in this way by example. In verse 31, he says that he does exactly why God commands of him. This exemplifies the obedient lifestyle that Jesus teaches—for him to follow God's commands even to the cross.

'''Philip and Thomas in John 14'''   Philip and Thomas  are doubters, with reservations regarding Christ's person even as He is near departure.  They have witnessed his miracles and been at His side for the duration of his ministry, so why the questions?  What makes them so different from the others who remain silent at this critical juncture?  Are they the only ones who had doubt, or were they simply the voices of doubt that the author of John included to portray them in a certain light?  Their dialogue, too, seems to be simply an excuse for Christ to reiterate His doctrine, and after He rebukes Philip, he does just that.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Word of God==
* 2 Timothy 3:16,17 Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 
* 2 Peter 1:20-21 ... knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation. For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit. 
* Hebrews 4:12-13 For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. There is no creature that is hidden from his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
* Mark 7:5-8 The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?” He answered them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 

‘This people honors me with their lips, &lt;br&gt;
but their heart is far from me. &lt;br&gt;
But in vain do they worship me, &lt;br&gt;
teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ &lt;br&gt; 
“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.” 
* John 8:31-32 Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.”
* John 12:46-48 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness. If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn’t believe, I don’t judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He who rejects me, and doesn’t receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day. 

* John 1:1-5 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him. Without him was not anything made that has been made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome it.
* Matthew 4:1-11 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. When he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry afterward. The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that these stones become bread.” 

But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.’” 

Then the devil took him into the holy city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will put his angels in charge of you.’ and, 

‘On their hands they will bear you up, 
so that you don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”
Jesus said to him, “Again, it is written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’” 

Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory. He said to him, “I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me.” 

Then Jesus said to him, “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’”

Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Quantum Cryptography''' is a phrase that seems to bleed across two topics - one is QBit Cryptanalysis, and the other is Quantum Key Exchange (which is the most common use of the term, and I will discuss here)

== Quantum Key Exchange ==

With Quantum Key Exchange, also called quantum key distribution (QKD),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
or a single optical fiber to send a single photon at a time orientated to one certain angle of four; we can describe them as horizontally polarized ( - ), vertically polarized ( | ), Ordinary ( \ ) or Sinister ( / ) 
To detect these photons, you can use either an ordinary filter ( \ slot) or a vertical filter ( | slot)

An ordinary filter has the properties that it will '''always''' pass an ordinary polarized photon, and '''always''' block a sinister polarized photon (this is because the photon is correctly aligned for the slot in the Ordinary case, and at &lt;math&gt;90^o&lt;/math&gt; to the slot for the Sinister photon.

A vertical filter has similar properties for its two associated photons - it will always pass a vertical photon, and always block a horizontal one.

This leaves four cases:  '|' and '-' for an ordinary filter, and '\' and '/' for a vertical one. The problem is - nobody knows! they might make it though the slot, they might not, and it is entirely random.

For this reason, the sender will send 'n' photons to the recipient, and the recipient will then report back which of the two possible filters (chosen at random) he tried.

If the recipient guessed the right filter, he now knows which one of two possible orientations the photon was in. if he guessed wrong, he has no idea - so the sender responds to the recipient's list with a second list - of the decisions the recipient got right. By discarding the &quot;wrong&quot; filter choices, both sender and recipient now know which of two possible choices each of the photons received were actually matched to - and can convert pass/fail into logic 1 or 0 for a binary set (and this can then be used as an encryption key)

However, this *only* works if the cable between the sender and the recipient is completely unbroken - because it is impossible to route, regenerate or otherwise manipulate the photons sent without losing the delicate orientation information that is the hub of the scheme.

Anybody who tries to measure the photons en route '''must''' pick the correct filter - if he picks the wrong one, he is unable to tell the difference between a pass and a misaligned photon that happens to have gotten though the slot - and indeed, a block and a misaligned photon that was blocked. If he picks wrongly, he cannot tell what orientation the photon was in, and the eventual conversation between the recipient and sender as to orientation of filters will cause there to be differences between the two sets of data - and reveal an eavesdropper has intercepted photons.

There are obvious problems with this scheme. the first is that sending a single photon down a light pipe can be unreliable - sometimes, they fail to reach the recipient and are read as a false &quot;block&quot;. The second is that the obvious attack on this is a man-in-the-middle one - the attacker intercepts both the light pipe and the out-of-band data channel used for the discussion of filters and acceptance lists - then negotiates different Quantum key Exchange keysets with both the sender   '''and''' the recipient independently. by converting the encrypted data between the keys each is expecting to see, he can read the message en route (provided of course there is no way that either party can verify the transmissions in a way the m-i-t-m cannot intercept and replace with his own doctored version)

However, the problems have not stopped a commercial company selling a product which relies on QKE for its operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This Part is heavy on broad concept and relatively light on useful technical details. I should probably move this to the end (after I decide what to do with the topics presently found in Part IV) even though that rather bruises the narrative.

I don't actually know much (well, relatively speaking) about computer models for entire populations - but that is certainly computational biology and should absolutely be included here.

The first chapter will explain the differences in sequence that allow organisms to thrive in different environments or on different chemical substrates.

The second chapter will discuss the relationship between the observed complexity of an organism and the complexity of that organisms genome.

The third chapter discusses how whole-genome analysis leads to the conclusion that there existed a single, common ancestor to all known life forms. There will be some discussion of how we come to that conclusion, what we think we known about this ancestral organism. If there's room, I may include a chapter on the Origins of Life on Earth.

Chapter four is self-explanatory.

Chapter five will discuss how whole genome analysis leads us to conclude that Chloroplasts and Mitochondria are descended from eubacterial endosymbionts.

Chapter six is essentially devoted to computational studies of genes related to development - pariticularly in comparison to their homologs found in single celled organisms such as Yeast.

Chapter seven discusses means of measuring effective population sizes - and what the effective population size means in terms of the real diversity of an organismal genome. If the population genetics textbook is ever finished I hope to life most of this from there.

Chapter eight extends the discussion in chapter seven to the special case when a population splits into multiple groups in limited genetic contact.

'''Sociology''' is the study of human social life. Human social life is complex and encompasses many facets of the human experience.  Because of its complexity, the discipline of sociology has been subdivided over time into specialty areas.  The first section of this book covers the foundations of sociology, including an introduction to the discipline, relevant study methodologies, and dominant theoretical perspectives.  The remaining chapters focus on the different areas of study in sociology.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The assessment is probably the most important aspect of your work because without a good assessment, there is almost no way for you to get a handle on what's actually wrong with your patient. Many therapists will have many different ideas on what constitutes a good assessment and there are many different variations on what to do and when to do it.

This is an attempt to lay out a few basic principles of assessing patients. I'm going to use the ‘patient’ label because most of the people reading this book will probably be students who work in an acute hospital setting.  I’ve also used the term ‘physiotherapist’ as opposed to ‘physical therapist’, the distinction being mainly a grammatical one with the United States using the latter and everyone else the former.  Along the same lines, it may be important to note that physiotherapists are physical therapists who have respiratory therapy included in their training, while in the US, this is a separate profession.

You may find that the order of questions/techniques is different from what you've been shown before. You may find that I've left questions out, or included ones you've never seen. You should therefore bear in mind that this is only a guideline, something that you can use while you get comfortable with the idea of performing an assessment.

I was always told that in your subjective examination (interview), the answers you get should be used to initiate or guide the direction of the next question. It's not about learning the questions off by heart and then sitting down with a pen and saying, &quot;Right, number one...” Your patient’s answers should be clues in your search for the cause of their pain or stiffness.

I've divided the book into several chapters, each focusing on a particular type of assessment. For example, Chapter 5 is a Respiratory assessment. I've divided them up for the sake of simplicity and ease of explanation. In reality there is no hard and fast dividing line for what type of assessment you'll use. In fact, you'll generally use a combination of all of them. Think about the 83 year old lady who's just had a stroke and also has a history of [[w:|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). You'll be doing a neurological assessment while taking note of her respiratory system, while possibly mentally scoring her on an Elderly Mobility Scale.

''Note: While the subjective assessment is examined in detail in it's chapter, the objective assessment will be dealt with separately in each following chapter, as they will all be slightly different depending on the type of condition being assessed.  Therefore each chapter after the subjective assessment will actually be an objective assessment of that type of condition i.e. the chapter on Respiratory assessments is actually a description of the objective assessment performed on a respiratory patient.''

== Adding two single digit numbers ==
Adding single digit numbers is done according to the table below.  To add two single digit numbers, find one number in the first row and one number in the first column of the table.  You will find the sum where that row and column intersect.  These sums follow a regular pattern and are quite easy to remember with a little practice.  Knowing these sums is the first step to mental arithmetic.

== Adding multiple digit numbers ==

To add multiple digit numbers, use the following procedure.

# Start at the right-most digit in each number.
# Add the right-most digit of each number as though they were single digit numbers.
# If the sum of those digits is 0 to 9, that is the right-most digit of the answer.
# If the sum of those digits is 10 to 18, the right-most digit of this sum is the right-most digit of the answer.
# Move one digit to the left in each of the two numbers you are adding.
# Prepare to repeat the process with these digits, with one difference.  If the sum on the previous round was 10 or more, you will add 1 to the sum of these digits.  If the sum on the previous round was 0 to 9, you will not add one to these digits.
# Repeat the process, moving left each time, remembering to add 1 if required, until there are no more digits to add.  For each round, you will find the next digit to the left of the answer.

If you are using pen and paper, write the two numbers you are adding one below the other, aligning the right-most digits.  Draw a line beneath the two numbers below which you will write the answer as you calculate it.  As you calculate each digit of the answer, write it below the digits of the numbers above.  For those rounds where the sum is 10 or more, write the &quot;1&quot; that you will add above the digits of the next round so that you won't forget it.

You now know how to add numbers of any size.

== Teaching addition of numbers ==

When teaching young students how to add you will need to use physical items to help them understand how addition works, use items that are similar to avoid confusing younger children. It is very important that they understand the number system before trying to add or subtract. The following is an example of how to show a child how to add.

I have two blocks, and Mary has two blocks. If Mary gives me two blocks how many blocks do I have?

First show that you do in fact have two blocks, then show that Mary (or whatever the name of the person is) also has two blocks.  Have the children count the number of blocks you have and the number of blocks Mary has.  

Have Mary give them two blocks, now have the children count how many blocks they have.  You have four blocks and now Mary has zero blocks.  Some children may be able to understand addition better if you teach subtraction at the same time, some may notice that Mary has zero blocks while others may not make this connection, this depends completely on each child.

This block example should be done multiple times until every student understands how to add two single digit numbers together, if some students have trouble understanding the concept have them hold the blocks and do the above block example with each other, help them count the blocks they have.  You can later increase the number of blocks slightly to help encourage further counting.  

----

When the basic concept of adding has been introduced via a physical method children should be encouraged to learn the combinations of single digit numbers - so that addition no longer relies on counting blocks (or fingers). Especially important for mental subtraction is to learn the combinations of numbers that add to give 10.

When these basics have been taught and before moving on to adding 2 digit numbers children must learn place notation (ie that 25=20+5).  Once this is learnt children can progress to adding 2 (and more) digit numbers.  It needs to be explained that when you have 10 in the units column you must 'carry' that over to be 1 in the 10s column. Note that this means that 25+97 is MUCH harder than 12+13.

Depending on the child it can be useful to do this in binary as there are far fewer number combinations to remember, though this can confuse some children.


Due to place notation addition is usually carried out right to left:

       1   1
  45   45  45
 +37  +37 +37
 ===  === ===
        2  82 
 

With the 1 above the addition representing a carried digit.

It is possible to do addition left to right:

  45
 +37
 ====
  70
  12
 ====
  82

(adding the tens first).

Children who are taught this way will usually work out for themselves the shorter way of writing it out.

== Subtracting numbers ==

Subtraction is when we ask the question, if I have this many, and take away that many, how many are left?  Like I may have 7 apples, but I eat 2, so I have 7-2 = 5 left.

We are not allowed to subtract a larger natural number from a smaller one because we can not have less than zero of anything.

Subtraction is just addition reversed.  You can see this in the following way.  If I have an addition, like 3+5 = 8, I can write it in a triangle like so:

    8
   / \
  3 + 5

Now the left side and the right side of the triangle are two subtractions: 8 - 3 = 5, and 8 - 5 = 3.  This nicely shows that when you subtract, say, 8 - 5, you want to know what the other leg of the triangle is, given that the top is 8 and one leg is 5.  To say this in another way, you want to know what must be added to 5 to get 8.


Below is a subtraction table for small numbers.  To use it, find your first number in the left column, your second number in the top row.  Then the difference is found where that row and column intersect.  These differences follow a very regular pattern and are easy to remember with a little practice.

== Subtraction with large numbers ==

When larger numbers are involved, use the following procedure.  Subtraction is more complicated than addition, so pen and paper are usually required.

* Start with the right-most digit of each number.
* If the answer of subtracting these digits will not be less than zero, subtract these digits.  The answer is the right-most digit of the answer.
** In this case, move one digit left in each number and repeat the process.
* If it was not possible to perform the subtraction because the result would be less than zero, add 10 to the digit of the first number to make the subtraction possible.  Do the subtraction, the answer is the right-most digit of the answer.
** Reduce the next digit to the left in the first number by 1.  This will be possible if that digit is 1 or more.
*** If reducing that digit was possible, the borrowing procedure is complete.  Continue to the next round, moving one digit to the left in each number.  You will now use the reduced digit in the next round.
*** If reducing that digit was not possible because it was 0, add 10 to it and then reduce it by one.  Now one must borrow again from next left digit.  Reduce the next digit to the left by 1, borrowing again if it is 0.  Continue this process until you reduce by 1 a digit that is 1 or more.  Then the borrowing procedure is complete.  Repeat the process with the next digit of each number.  You will now be using the first of the reduced digits in the next round.

To make this clearer, see the examples below.

Example 1, no borrowing required.

   27    27
 -  4, -  4
  ---   ---
    3    23

Example 2, 1 round of borrowing required.

       3    3
  40   &lt;del&gt;4&lt;/del&gt;0   &lt;del&gt;4&lt;/del&gt;0
 - 2, - 2, - 2
 ---  ---  ---
   8    8   38


Example 3, 2 rounds of borrowing required.

        09    09
  100   &lt;del&gt;10&lt;/del&gt;0   &lt;del&gt;10&lt;/del&gt;0
 - 15, - 15, - 15
  ---   ---   ---
    5     5    85

== Teaching subtraction ==

Subtracting numbers and adding numbers should be taught together, the process of teaching subtraction is the same as teaching addition.  You should not teach children negative numbers at a young age as there is no way to physically show them a negative number.

----

As with addition it is important for children to remember the simple combinations of single digit numbers.  Moving to 2 digit addition (having learnt place values), start with simple problems:

  45
 -32
 ===
 
first 5-2=3
second 40-30=10


  45
 -32
 ===
   3
  10

then add

  45
 -32
 ===
   3
  10
 ===
  13


To get the answer.

When this is grasped move on to harder problems:


  52
 -35
 ====


There are 2 methods that I would like to illustrate, the first uses carrying:

Start by saying that 5 is bigger than 2 so we take 10 from the 50 and add it to the 2 to get 12

  &lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2
 - 3 5
 ======

Is the usual way of writing this.

Now subtract 5 from 12 to get 7.  This is another 'pair' that needs to be taught - all the numbers up to 10 subtracted from all larger numbers up to 20 are 'required', or it is possible to say that 12-2 is 10 and that 5-2 is 3 and 10-3 is 7, which is how I do it, but is not necesseraly the 'easiest' way.  Different children will want to do this in different ways and will often develop their own methods for mental subtraction (ie when you don't write it down).  For instance I do this: 56-38 becomes 50-40+6+2 : note that I have used both the fact that 56=50+6 and that 38=40-2 (this is why I personally feel that every child needs to know the pairs that sum to 10) and that a+b-(c-d) = a-c+b+d allthough you can 'see' this as the 'big chunk' from 40 to 50 and then the two small end bits added on (6 and 2) without expaining using algebra, again teachers should remember this general truth (that addition can be re-ordered and that minus minus = plus) in order to answer questions and with a view to the child learning it in this form.

To continue:

  &lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2
 - 3 5
 ======
     7

Then we take 30 from 40 (remember that it is now 40 since we gave the other 10 to the units) to get 10

  &lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2
 - 3 5
 ======
     7
    10

And finally add these two together

  &lt;s&gt;5&lt;/s&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2
 - 3 5
 ======
     7
    10
 ======
    17

To give the answer.

An alternate method of subtraction is to perform subtraction starting on the left and heading to the right. This second method was used by some young children, which shows that young children can understand negative numbers if told about them:

The same sum:

  52
 -35
 ====

This time we will take 30 from 50 first (working left to right here - much more 'obvious') to get 20

  52
 -35
 ====
  20

Then we will take 5 from 2 to get -3

  52
 -35
 ====
  20 
  -3

Then we take the 3 from the 20

  52
 -35
 ====
  20 
  -3
 ====
  17

To finish the sum.  Here students need to know what 20-3 is: This is easiest to look at as 10+10-3 and then know that 10-3 is 7 (again, numbers adding to 10).

== Learning to use fractions (Visually) ==

'''Fractions''' or '''rational numbers''' are in essence the same as division, however we use them more often to express numbers less than one - for instance a half or a quarter.  Fractions have a numerator (on the top) and a denominator (on the bottom).  If a fraction is larger than 1 then the numerator will be larger.

=== Modern methods to teach fractions ===
Today's modern methods of teaching math and fractions are drastically different than how they were taught just 10 years ago. The difference between these methods is that the later method explores the visual evidence for certain ways of manipulating fractions and whereas the earlier approach simply used variables from the beginning. Tiles of different colors sorted into groups can be useful in representing fractions visually.

=== Origami and Fractions ===

There is perhaps little emphasis these days which  shows the elaborate &quot;visualization&quot; that math requires. Students used to be taught merely by equation, but to my understanding, by teaching them such methods they tend to take the &quot;cooking approach&quot; to problems in that they have an inadequate sense of &quot;visualizing&quot; the concept the problem in their mind. What i want to do is emphasize the creative aspect of fractions while at the same time exploring the richness of why such problems are true.

Why i call this section Origami and math is because they are very much related to each other. The thing about Origami which is rich in math is that essentially folding a piece of paper proves that such a fraction exists!

in order to do this experiment, you need the following materials:

# Square piece of paper
# pencil

Steps to seeing some nice fractions

First, we have to say to ourselves, &quot;This piece of paper is 1 piece of paper&quot;

Now, we will explore fractions by seeing how &quot;much&quot; of the remaining paper we see as we fold. 
Every time we see the paper, we will write down the fraction of the paper on the front of it.
By the time we get done, we'll have lots of fractions written on a piece of paper. 

:Step 1: Obtain square piece of paper. Write &quot;1&quot; on it.
:Step 2: fold piece of paper in half. Write &quot;1/2&quot; on it.
:Step 3: Fold again in half. write &quot;1/4&quot;
:Step 4: Fold again in half. write &quot;1/8&quot;
:Step 5: Unfold the piece of paper and write lines in where there are folds in the paper

Notice: if there is a 1 on top, then whatever number is on the bottom, it takes that many &quot;pieces&quot; to make a &quot;whole&quot;.  For example, 1/8 needs 8 pieces to become 1 whole.

=== The money approach: 1, 1/4, 1/2, 1/10, 1/20, 1/100 ===

A very practical way to learn fractions is the use of money, as we use it everyday.

Questions:

#How many quarters are in a dollar?
#How many dimes are in a dollar?
#How many nickels are in a dollar?
#How many pennies are in a dollar?

As said from the previous section, if there is a one on top and some number on bottom,
that means it needs that much pieces to make it a whole (a whole means 1 by the way)

For example, 1/10 is the value of a dime (10 cents). You need 10 dimes (10 x 10 = 1 dollar) to get one full dollar.

=== Whole number fractions ===

First of all, as always, instead of looking at complicated variable jargon, we will instead look at
certain ways to &quot;view&quot; certain types of number. Just like art, you don't need to be an accomplished
artist to draw, but rather you just need to know how to look at things better (in this case, numbers)

Since fractions have both a top (called a numerator. think &quot;topinator&quot;) and a bottom (denominator, which &quot;downominator&quot; which is divided by a bar, we have to &quot;adjust our thinking&quot; so that we can recognize what our friendly fractions might look like.)

For example, 

Q: 5 &amp;divide; 5 reads &quot;5 divided by 5&quot;. What does that look in Fraction form?

Well, since we are prospective mathematicians (and artists...) we will look at the magic of what
the divided sign actually means:
{|
|&lt;pre&gt; o
===
 o
&lt;/pre&gt;
|(my divided sign) What it actually means is that dots tell you to '''&quot;Make me a number!&quot;'''&lt;br /&gt;
(because Zeroes often become lonely...they want to have '''value''' in life...)
and you see that bridge which devides them too says that, &quot;In order to separate such
ZEROES in life and making more zeroes, we say always divide your numbers from each 
other.&quot;
|}

A: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{5} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, which also reads &quot;5 divided by 5&quot;.

Since we know how to recognize some fractions, we have to &quot;see&quot; with our naked eyes what some fractions actaully mean. The best preparation that you will have in our &quot;artist&quot; training is that whole numbers actually have &quot;1&quot; on the bottom. You may ask yourself, &quot;How can that be? Is that even possible?&quot;

Well Just for fun, we will go through this little exercise to show that there is indeed ones on the bottom when you have whole numbers.

'''Example''': express &quot;5&quot; in a fraction form.

Look at our previous example about the placement of things. We now know what a denominator is and a numerator is. Since the whole number is the number of top, all we have to do is see what number is on bottom, i wonder what it is.

{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{?}&lt;/math&gt;
| colspan=2| In order to figure out what goes on bottom, we can figure it out many ways.
Fractions are in ways actually like ratios. Such as if there were two ice creams for 
me and none for you, my ratio would be 2:1 and yours would be 0:1...Sad isn't it?
Getting back to the point, we must think about why and how it becomes a whole number.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\frac{(X)(X)(X)(X)(X)}{(X)}&lt;/math&gt;
| The upper part represents five oranges. &lt;br/&gt;the lower represents 1. 
| &lt;math&gt;=\frac{5}{1}&lt;/math&gt;
|}


So our lesson is, if there is any whole number, &quot;1&quot; will always go on the bottom. So if I say, &quot;What's the number that goes on the bottom if the number is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, or any other whole number?&quot;

Of course, your answer should be &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot; and always &quot;1.&quot; I want you to remember that!

== Multiplying fractions ==

In general, multiplying fractions involves a simple formula:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{B} * \frac{C}{D} = \frac{A*C}{B*D}&lt;/math&gt;

Where A, B, C, and D represent the numbers within the fractions.  If this seems intimidating, there are methods used to tackle the multiplication more easily. 

=== Traditional multiplication method ===

1. Know what the fractions are. Write it out.

2. If you wrote it out correctly, ignore the fractions part and look at it this way.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{3} * \frac{5}{3} = \frac{?}{?}&lt;/math&gt;

If you wrote it correctly, this is what it should look like. Also, it would be helpful if you wrote it equal to the mysteriously equal question marks, &quot;?/?.&quot; They're there so you can see where to  write your answers. 

3. Using your finger or card, cover or hide the bottom (called the denominator) so that you can concentrate on multiplying the top. Focus solely on multipling the upper portion:

&lt;span style=&quot;border:solid; border-width:1px; padding:8px&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{} * \frac{5}{} = \frac{?}{} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

5 x 5 = ?  (what is 5 times 5? what is the value (in cents) of 5 nickels? why 25 of course!)
So if 25 is equals ?, than simply &quot;erase&quot; the &quot;?&quot; and write &quot;25.&quot; Its that simple!

Again, since you know whats on top, do the same on the bottom:

&lt;span style=&quot;border:solid; border-width:1px; padding:8px&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{3} * \frac{}{3} = \frac{}{?} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt;

Again, what is 3 x 3? Of course, it is 9. So, again, erase the &quot;?&quot; and write down &quot;9&quot;

Once you remove the finger or card, you are presented with the answer: &lt;math&gt;\frac{5}{3} * \frac{5}{3} = \frac{25}{9}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multiplying Fractions with nice pictures ===
Another good way to prove that answers are actually correct is to use a diagram or tiles to prove that it is correct. So how we do that is first write out one of our fractions on one side and the other fraction on the other side. To see what i mean, here is an example:

Here is our little lesson. We will multiply 3/4 x 1/2 = ?. 
 
{|
| 
{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color:Chocolate &quot;
| 1/4
|-
| 1/4
|-
| 1/4
|-
| 1/4
|}
| So just imagine the figure to the right is one whole 4 story &quot;chocobar&quot; (i will remind you that one chocobar that has 4 stories still is one chcobar) You will see that each story represents  a fraction. 1/4 means its needs 4 pieces to make a whole.                           
|&lt;pre&gt;
 0000  __________________
000000/                  |
 OOOO   Mr. Anaconda     | &quot;CHOBARS ARE YUMMY!&quot;
  \        _______       | &quot;I hope I eat a lot     
   |      /       \      | of them!&quot;  
   |     /         \     |  
   |    /           \    |    
   |   /             \   /  
    \-/               \-/                          
&lt;/pre&gt;
|}
                                                   
But the thing is, Mr. Anaconda only has enough energy to eat once a week. His mouth is 1/2-full with chocbar and the deepest he can eat is 3/4 a chocbar. How much of the chocbar has he eaten?   
                                                                 
The fraction is set up like this:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{4} * \frac{1}{2} = \frac{?}{?}&lt;/math&gt;
  
Visually, it will look like this:

{| 
! 1/2 || 1/2 || 
|-
| colspan=2 rowspan=4 | 
{|border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color:Chocolate &quot; 
|  1/8 || 1/8
|-
| 1/8 || 1/8
|-
| 1/8 || 1/8
|-
| 1/8 || 1/8
|}
! 1/4
|-
! 1/4
|-
! 1/4
|-
! 1/4
|}

So, simplified from our little illustration is our little chocobar broken up into nice convenient blocks so that Mr. Anaconda    can eat it.

{| 
! 1/2 || 1/2 || 
|-
| colspan=2 rowspan=4 | 
{|border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color:Chocolate &quot; 
| style=&quot;background-color:Brown&quot;| 1/8 || 1/8
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:Brown&quot;| 1/8 || 1/8
|-
| style=&quot;background-color:Brown&quot;| 1/8 || 1/8
|-
| 1/8 || 1/8
|}
! 1/4
|-
! 1/4
|-
! 1/4
|-
! 1/4
|}

From the image, you can count 3/8ths of the chocobar was eaten.

=== Dividing fractions ===

As mentioned earlier, a fraction is one number divided by another.  Because of textual limitations, fractions here will be represented using numbers and slashes.  For example, the fraction one half will be represented as 1/2.  The fraction two thirds will be represented as 2/3. 

Now, on to some specifics.  You may already know how to multiply fractions.  Remember all you have to do is multiply the two top numbers together and put them above your two bottom numbers multiplied together. If know how to multiply fractions, dividing fractions will also be easy, and only requires one extra step.

In order to divide two fractions, you invert the second fraction and multiply.  This means that you switch around the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom) of the fraction before multiplication. 

Let's look at examples using our two fractions.  First, let's divide the fraction 1/2 by the fraction 1/2.  Since we are dividing a number by itself, we should expect to get an answer of 1.

Here is our problem.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\div\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} * \frac{2}{1} = \frac{1*2}{2*1} = \frac{2}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

Now let's try another example.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\div\frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{2} * \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1*3}{2*2} = \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Following these simple steps will let you solve any fraction division problem.  

There is also an alternate way to divide fractions using an equivalent fraction approach.  You obtain this by multiplying the numerator and denominator so that they're equivalent, cancelling out the denominator, and creating a fraction from the two remaining numerators.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}\div\frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{6}\div\frac{4}{6} = \frac{3}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

Here is another example:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{5}\div\frac{3}{4} = \frac{8}{20}\div\frac{15}{20} = \frac{8}{15} &lt;/math&gt;

It works because the common denominator will always be &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{n} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Adding fractions ===
Fractions that have the same or &quot;Common&quot; denominator are called &quot;Like&quot; fractions.

1/3, 2/3

(one-third, two-thirds)

To add Like fractions together such as these:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = ? &lt;/math&gt;


1. Add the numerators (the top numbers): 
* 1 + 2 = 3 (one plus two equals three)

2. Use the common denominator (the bottom numbers):
* /3

All together it looks like this:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{3}{3} &lt;/math&gt;

3. Simplify the answer as much as you can by dividing the denominator into the numerator.
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{3} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

If the numerator is now larger than the denominator it might look like this:

4/5 + 3/5 = 7/5  (four-fifths plus three-fifths equals seven-fifths)

This is simplified by creating a mixed number:

* 5 goes into 7 one time, with 2 left over. Put the remainder (2) over the denominator (5).
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{7}{5} = 1 \frac{2}/{5} &lt;/math&gt;

To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, you must first convert them to equivalent fractions with common denominators.

=== Multiplying to get equivalent fractions ===

In some cases, you may need to add 1/2 to 1/3:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}=?&lt;/math&gt;

You will first have to convert the fractions into like fractions.  The easiest means of doing so is to multiply the top and bottom of the left fraction by the bottom on the right, and the top and bottom of the right fraction by the bottom on the left:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1*3}{2*3}+\frac{1*2}{3*2}=?&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{6}+\frac{2}{6}=?&lt;/math&gt;

The addition can now take place as expected:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{3}{6}+\frac{2}{6}=\frac{5}{6}&lt;/math&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The amount of a good in the market is the supply, and the amount people want to buy is the demand. Consider a certain commodity, such as gasoline.  If there is a strong demand for gas, but there is less gasoline, then the price goes up.  If conditions change and there is a smaller demand for gas, for instance if everyone started using electric cars, or the commodity becomes more available, for instance a new oil field is discovered, then the price of the commodity decreases.

== Supply ==
The availability of goods and services in the marketplace at any given point in time is defined as &quot;supply&quot;.  As we will see after, if the demand is greater than the supply, there is a shortage (more items are demanded at a lower price, less items are offered at this same price, therefore, there is a shortage). If the supply increases, the price decreases, and if the supply decreases, the price increases. This is called an ''indirect relationship'', where if one variable goes up, the other variable goes down. 

It is easy to see why this should be true; if 20 people have identical houses to sell, and only 15 people want to buy a house, then the buyers can pick the lowest price, so the sellers must try to satisfy the buyers. Of course, if the supply changes, and 5 sellers decide to stay, then there is one house for each buyer, and neither side can bully the other; each buyer will offer money for the house they want, and if the seller thinks it's not enough, he can refuse, since his house will probably be bought anyways. If 5 more of the sellers decide not to move, then the buyers need to offer more money, because the remaining sellers want to be able to sell their houses for as much money as they can, so they will pick the ten buyers who offer the most money. 

The inverse is true as well; if the price of a home goes down, fewer people will sell, but if the price of a home goes up, more people will sell. This means that price and supply are closely linked, and changes in one are reflected in the other.

=== Factors affecting ===

'''Price'''-As the price of a product rises, its supply rises because producers are more willing to manufacture the product because it's more profitable now.

'''Price of other commodities'''-There are two types
*'''Competitive supply'''-If a producer switches from producing A to producing B, the price of A will fall and hence the supply will fall because it's less profitable to make A.
*'''Joint supply'''-A rise in one product may cause a rise in another. For instance, a rise in the price of wooden bedframes may cause a rise in the price of wooden desks and chairs. This means supply of wooden bedframes, chairs and desks will rise because it's more profitable.

'''Costs of production'''-If production costs rise, supply will fall because the manufacture of the product in question will become less profitable.

'''Change in availability of resources'''-If wood becomes scarce, fewer wooden bedframes can be made, so supply will fall.

==Demand==
A desire becomes demand when it meets the three important factors i.e. having a strong desire, having the necessary purchasing power, having the power to take decision to purchase.

Similar to supply, there is a relationship between price and demand; the more people want, the more it will cost, if the supply remains the same. To return to our example of houses, let's say there are 15 people selling houses, and 10 buying; the buyers have more influence on the sellers, and the prices will be low. If 5 more people decide to buy houses, then the price will go up, and if another 5 decide to buy one of these houses, the price will climb even further. Thus when demand is high the price goes up and consequently the supply contracts and when the demand is low the supply expands while the prices go down

The inverse here is true as well; if people will sell their house for less, they will find more people interested in buying. The reason why demand behaves this way is fairly obvious: people are more willing to buy more of a good, or buy the good more often if the good becomes cheaper. Likewise, when a good is on sale, or its prices drop, people will become more willing to spend money on it.

===Consumer Behaviour===

The way consumers behave can affect demand in many ways. Consumers gain satisfaction from the consumption of goods or services. This satisfaction is called '''utility'''.

'''The law of diminishing marginal utility''' is a theory in economics that says that with increased consumption, satisfaction decreases.

You are at a park on a winter's day, and someone is selling hot dogs for $1 each. You eat one. It tastes good and satisfies you, so you have another one, and another etc. Eventually, you eat so many, that your satisfaction from each hot dog you consume drops. You are less willing to pay the $1 you have to pay for a hot dog. You would only consume another if price drops. But that won't happen, so you leave, and demand for the hot dogs falls.

'''Consumer surplus''' is a term used to describe the difference between the price of a good and how much the consumer is willing to pay.

Back at the park, they are still selling hot dogs, but now for 80 cents. You are hungry, so you are willing to pay $1 for a hot dog, but since the price is cheap, you buy two. For each hot dog, you get 20 cents of ''consumer surplus''

'''The income effect''' occurs when the incomes of consumers change.

You are still in the park, and someone is still selling hot dogs for $1. But over the weekend, you got a pay rise, and have more money in your pockets! But there's another hot dog stand selling hot dogs for $1.50 on the other side of the park. You have two choices;
*Buy more of the $1 hot dogs, because you can afford to.
*Go to the other side and buy the $1.50 hot dogs, because you believe they are of better quality, and you can afford to buy them now you've had a pay rise. In this case, the $1 hot dogs have become what we call an ''inferior good'' (a good for which demand falls as income rises).

'''The substitution effect''' is similar.

On another day in the park, there is the same $1 hot dog stand. But, on the other side, the rival hot dog stand now sells hot dogs for only 50 cents. You are more likely to go to that stand because it is cheaper.

==Demand Curve==
A curve that shows the relationship between the price level of a good and the quantity of the good demanded at that price is called the ''demand curve'' (at any given point in time).  Demand curves are graphed with the same axis as supply curves in order to allow the two curves to be combined into a single graph: the y-axis (vertical line) of the graph is price and the x-axis (horizontal line) is the quantity of houses.  Demand curves usually slope downward because people are willing to buy larger quantities of a good as its price goes down.  That is, low prices mean high quantities.  Turning the relationship around, as price increases, the quantity demanded decreases.

==Equilibrium==
[[Image:Equilibrium.PNG|thumb|300px|right]]
Since the demand curve slopes down and the supply curve slopes up, if they are put on the same graph, they eventually cross one another. Graphically, this consists of superimposing the two graphs that we have; at the point where the two lines, the supply line and the demand line, meet, is called the ''equilibrium point'' for houses in our market; in the end, if the price is $60,000 for a house, everyone who wants to buy will find a house, and everyone who wants to sell will find a buyer.

In general, for any good, it is at this point that quantity supplied equals quantity demanded at a set price. If there are more buyers than there are sellers at a certain price, the price will go up until either some of the buyers decide they are not interested, or some people who were previously not considering selling decide that they want to sell their houses. This process normally continues until there are sufficiently few buyers and sufficiently many sellers that the numbers balance out, which should happen at the equilibrium point.

'''Please note: The incorrect labeling of the diagram has been fixed. Also note, the curves need not be straight in a real situation.'''

Changes in demand or changes in supply are conceived as shifts in the demand or shifts in the supply curve, to produce a &lt;u&gt;new&lt;/u&gt; equilibrium point. The new price and quantity of the equilibrium point should fit commonsense ideas of what happens when demand or supply changes. 

Cases
# '''demand increases'''. For a given price, there is more demand. The down-sloping demand curve, where there is more quantity demanded as price decreases - is shifted in which direction ?  It is shifted to the right, because for a given quantity, a higher price can be obtained. If the supply curve is not changed, then the right-shifted down-sloping demand curve will intersect at a higher price/quantity equilibrium point, and this is shown easily by sketching a second down-sloping curve next to ,and to the right of,  the original down-sloping demand curve.
# 
# '''supply increases'''. For a given price , there is more quantity supplied. The up-sloping supply curve, where there is more quantity willing to be supplied for higher prices, is shifted to the right, because more suppliers are willing to supply at a lower price , causing quantity to increase for a given price.  Drawing a second up-sloping supply curve to the right of the original up-sloping supply curve, will show that new equilibrium point gives a lower price and higher quantity for the same down-sloping demand curve. 
# 
# '''demand decreases'''. The demand curve is shifted to the left, and there is both a decrease in quantity and price at the equilibrium where it now intersects with the upsloping supply curve.
# 
# '''supply decreases'''. The supply curve shifts to the left, and the now intersects the downsloping demand curve at a higher price , and a lower quantity at the new equilibrium point. 
# 
# '''demand increases, and supply increases'''. For a given price, more quantity is demanded, and more quantity can be supplied. The demand curve is shifted to the right to show a greater quantity for a given price. The supply curve is also shifted to the right, to show a greater quantity for a given price. If supply increases relatively greater, than the equilibrium price is smaller, but if demand increases relatively greater, than the intersection is higher, and the price obtained will be higher. Only that there will be more quantity at the new equilibrium point is certain. 
#
# '''demand decreases, and supply decreases'''. Similiar to the previous point, the price may increase or decrease depending whether supply decreases relatively more, or demand decreases relatively more, respectively,  and the only certainty, is that there is less quantity at the new equilibrium point. 
#
# '''demand decreases, and supply increases'''. This is easy, the price will drop for sure, but if supply curve shifts a lot more right than the demand curve shifts left, then the new equilibrium point will mean more quantity is supplied at a much lower price. 
#
# '''demand increases, and supply decreases'''. Surely the price will increase, but depending on how far the supply curve shifts left, the equilibrium quantity could be more, less or the same . To visualise this on sketches, it is a good idea to put a vertical line at the original equilibrium point's price, draw the ''right'' shifted new demand curve, and draw a dotted ''left'' shifted supply curve through where the new demand curve intersects the dotted line, because here the supply curve has only decreased enough to keep the quantity demanded the same at that price point, but a further left shifted supply curve would see a higher equilibrium point with less quantity demanded. 

In summary , to easily remember the meaning of the demand-supply curve, draw the original X intersecting up-sloping supply curve , and down-sloping demand curve, on a PQ graph, where P is left of Q, and the vertical Y axis is left of the horizontal X axis, so Y is P and X is Q. Mark the old equilibrium point.  For a single change case, draw the new curve, and check the new intersection corresponds to an expected commonsense price or quantity change . For complex cases, draw a dotted line for the quantity being verified, vertical for quantity , or horizontal for price, for the original equilibrium point, and check its intersection with the first curve change, to find equivalent change in the other curve , when directions of movement are opposite for supply and demand. 

==Disequilibrium==
Violation of market forces can occur in society when laws are made to enforce certain economic conditions, often with good intentions. Take for example price setting, either a minimum or a maximum price. 

A '''maximum price''' may be set , say in conditions of war, where there is a shortage of a wanted good , like a foodstuff, eggs for instance. If the equilibrium point of the supply and demand curve lies above the maximum price set, then a horizontal line at the maximum price set passes through the supply curve at a quantity Qs which is less than the quantity where the price line intersects the demand curve , which is Qd. Since Qs &lt;&lt; Qd, there will be a shortage , as suppliers will only supply a quantity at the price set , and consumers demand more at the price set.

When a shortage occurs, such as tickets for a sports match, there exists some consumers willing to pay a higher price, and hence a black market ensues, with ticket scalpers consuming the goods at the set price, making a greater shortage for genuine buyers, and on-selling at the higher price.

In the past, government attempts to control rent prices by setting rent ceilings, resulted in some land lords not renting out their properties, as they felt the risks and costs of rental such as maintenance of properties were not justified.  

Similiarly, offering negative gearing incentives , where the cost of ownership has a ceiling set by the deductions available for investment property borrowing costs , results in a shortage of properties, because  the quantity demanded at the net price after tax deductions is to the right of the equilibrium point. 


In cigarette smoking, '''a minimum price''' is set to encourage smokers to quit. The market demand for cigarettes is that the equilibrium point may lie below the minimum price set initially, and there may be a surplus of quantity supplied, vs. the quantity demanded. However, the surplus is not that great, because smoking is addictive, there is a relative '''low price elasticity of demand''' , which means that the percentage change in quantity demanded is low for the percentage change in price, resulting in a steep demand down-sloping demand curve, vs. a more normal down-sloping demand curve.

    the latter being the less surplus experienced due to price inelastic demand for addictive cigarettes (curve | )
    Dc -  demand cigarettes.    Dn - average demand for goods.

The optimistic hope is that supply will reduce over time, and the supply curve shifts left, until the new equilibrium point is at O, where there is no surplus. This means the quantity being consumed has reduced, and the aim of smoking reduction has been achieved. 

Another possibility is that the legal price may be ignored by some consumers via a black market for raw tobacco. 

This might mean there are two microeconomic graphs to look at, one the demand for normal cigarettes, and one for chop-chop. 

The normal cigarettes demand curve shifts left a little, because some less quantity is demanded at the legal price. The chop-chop's demand curve shifts right,
because more quantity is demanded , which means the equilibrium point shifts right and up, along the chop-chop supply curve, and black marketeers can sell their
inferior (risky), substitute good at a higher price. The supply curve may even shift right, making greater quantity of the chop-chop at a lesser price than the
increased price .  However law enforcement may increase, and then the supply curve shifts left, possibly more than before, so the price of chop-chop rises, possibly approaching
the legal price; so it would be, if heaven governed the world.

&lt;u&gt;Taxation effect&lt;/u&gt; on the supply curve is to shift all prices up by the amount taxed, so a 10% GST would increase prices at all quantities supplied by 1/11. 
For a special tax, say 100% on cigarettes, supply curve would shift up 100%. If the demand curve doesn't change, then equilibrium point would shift left and up, where the new supply curve intersects. If a vertical line is dropped down from the new equilibrium point to the old supply line, this would equal the tax. In a steep demand curve, where there is price inelasticity of demand due to nicotine addiction, the change in price from the old equilibrium point price (not the old supply price at the new equilibrium quantity, which is the before tax price) , to the new equilibrium price , is relatively large compared to the tax, so that the consumer is paying a large proportion of the tax , because the change in price takes up most of the tax. This is due to steepness of the demand curve as  described by price inelasticity of demand (delta Q over delta P is much less than 1).  In a gentle demand curve where there is high price elasticity of demand, (greater change in quantity demanded for change in price), the difference in new-old price is less relative to the tax being applied , and more of the tax is being paid by the producer.

== The Teaching of Multiplication ==

=== Manipulatives and Models ===

In the early and middle primary grades, the operation of multiplication is first denoted by the symbol &quot;x&quot;, and is normally first taught as repeated addition, where multiplying the numbers &quot;3&quot; and &quot;5&quot; (3 x 5) is the same as adding the number ''three'' a total of ''five'' times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15, so 3 x 5 = 15.  Modern curriculums initially teach this concept with ''manipulatives'', or toys and objects that serve to ''model'', and enable students to visualize what multiplication is.  For instance, a teacher might ''model'' the problem 4 x 6 by putting 4 jelly beans each in 6 bags.  Subsequent models become more abstract, but the model that all students eventually learn to understand and use is called an '''''area rectangle''''':

[[Image:Arearectangle.jpg]]

The above area rectangle models the problem 9 x 4, which equals 36.  Note that there are 4 rows and 9 columns and that the height of the rectangle is 4 units and the width  (or base) is 9 units.  Students find that when they count the 9 unit rows four times, they will count a total of 36 units.  Soon, they come to the realization that if they were to count the 4 unit columns nine times, they arrive at the same answer.  This becomes one of the ways that they learn the commutative property: a x b = b x a  (See:[[Wikipedia:Commutativity]])     Eventually, students should memorize all of combinations of multiplying single digit numbers, but it should be noted that just because a student has memorized their multiplication facts that they necessarily understand at an abstract level what multiplication represents.  Note that the above rectangle has a total of 36 square units, which serves to introduce students to the geometric axiom that area of a rectangle is equal to the base (9 in this case) times the height(4).

By working with ''area rectangles'', students make connections to geometry that serve to strengthen their understanding of multiplication.  Eventually students no longer need to see the interior square units and soon come to the understanding that one or both of the lengths of these area rectangles can be expressed as the sum of two lengths.   The following area diagram models the problem '''16 x 3''' :

[[Image:16x3arearectangle.JPG]]

Because 16 = 10 + 6, students can visualize that the length of the above rectangle is still 16. They then can see that the larger rectangle can be expressed as the sum of the two smaller area rectangles: (3 x 10) + (3 x 6).

In upper elementary grades students are introduced to a more standard mathematical nomenclature where the mulitpication symbol &quot;x&quot; is no longer necessary, permitting them to notate an equation for this model as:  3(16) = 3(10) + 3(6).  This is the primary model used to teach the distributive property:
a(b + c) = a(b) + a(c) (See: [[Wikipedia:Distributivity]])

The area model can be used to show the distributive property at an even more complex level.  Consider the problem 155x360:

[[Image:155x360.jpg]]

=== The Use of Different Algorithms to Solve Multiplication Problems ===

Note that in the above model, the height and width (base) of the larger area rectangle has been broken up into smaller area rectangles based on the place holder of each digit in each number, making it a representation of the '''standard algorithm for multiplication''':

[[Image:360x155standardalgorithma.JPG]]

This standard algorithm can be further modified to make it more efficient.

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
   360 \\
 \star 155 \\
 \hline \\
 1800\\
1800\  \\
360\ \ \ \\
\hline \\
55800
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In the example above, multiplication is the same, but uses carried digits and integrates them into the same row.


=== The Lattice Method ===

Some students find an algorithm known as the ''lattice method'' easier to use because it involves the use of lines that guide the eventual values of the final place holders.  It should be noted that students using this algorithm generally take more time to complete a problem.  Additionally, this algorithm tends to become confusing for students when it is used with problems involving decimals.  For these reasons, the use of the lattice method can become a liability in later grades.  It is recommended that as soon as this model is mastered by the student, it becomes advisable to teach and encourage them to use the standard model. 

[[File:Hindu lattice.svg]]
[[File:Hindu lattice 2.svg]]

In the left image, the two numbers are arranged at the edges of a grid.  In each cell of the grid, the two numbers in the row/colum are multiplied together to get a two digit number; the tens place is placed in the upper-left triangle in the grid, and the ones in the bottom-right corner. 

In the right image, each diagonal is summed to produce a number on the bottom; digits are carried to the diagonal on the left.

=== Multiplication with decimals ===

When decimals appear in a multiplication problem, they can be hidden during the multiplication.  For example, when looking at the problem 21.4 x 5.63 you would ignore the decimals and perform the operation for 214 x 563.  When the computation is complete and you have the answer of 120482, count the digits (or place values) to the right of the decimal in each of the original two factors.  The first factor, 21.4, has one digit to the right of the decimal and the second factor 5.63 has two digits to the right of the decimal.  Next, take the total of these two counts, which in this case is 3, and include the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point within the product.  This makes the answer 120.482 

Another way to determine where the decimal point belongs in your answer is to make an estimate.  For example if you once again have the problem 21.4 x 5.63 you could make a quick estimate of 20 x 5 which is 100, so you know your answer will have to be near 100.  If you complete the multiplication computation, once again ignoring the decimals (214 x 563), your answer will be 120482.  The only reasonable place to insert the decimal point, based on our estimate of 100, is between the 0 and 4, making the answer 120.482

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the beginning of a tutorial on how to make [[../Making Period Leather Armour|leather armour]] {{stage short|75%|Jan 23, 2005}} and [[../Making Period Mail|chainmail]] {{stage short|100%|Jan 23, 2005}}.

=Chain mail=

*Chain mail can be made out of just about any wire, 16 gauge and above.  This includes plastic coated wire for inlays, although this it is not recommended for &quot;period&quot; armour.
*If the armour will be used in [[Wikipedia:Society_for_Creative_Anachronism|SCA]] combat forged or riveted links will hold up better. Links made of aluminium will not hold up to combat use. Forged/Welded links are not required for SCA use [http://sca.org/officers/marshal/combat/armored/armor_standards.pdf SCA Armour Standards]
*If it is to be for purely decorative purposes, like for greeting guests at a medieval dinner party, it can be made of butted links of aluminium, to reduce the weight to about two to five pounds.


==Materials==
* Aluminium - good for decorative purposes.
* Stainless Steel 
* Galvanized Steel

==Gauges==

* 12
* 14
* 16
* 18

==Techniques (Styles)==
===Torso===
===Torso with Sleeves===
===Gloves===
===For Head===
===Making Rings===

Rings are made by following these steps:
Take a length of wire of whatever metal is being used.  
Wind it around a dowel rod of the diameter desired. 
Take wire cutters and cut out each individual ring. Some people cut several rings at a time, but I find that that tends to warp the rings too much. 

Some people use a special apparatus to wind the rings.
This is made as follows:
A wooden platform with two beams going up on opposite sides. Each beam has a circular hole at the top, in which the dowel rod is placed. The dowel rod has a small hole of the wire's gauge drilled into it on the inside; on the outside it has a lever. To use: place the end of wire through the hole on the inside part of the dowel, and crank the lever so that the wire winds itself around the rod.

Note: Galvanized steel will stain your skin if worn for long periods. It is recommended that you de-galvanize these rings if they will be in contact with skin. To do this, soak the rings overnight in hydrogen peroxide (available at drug stores). Afterwards, they will have lost some of their metallic luster, but they will be safer to wear.

===Putting rings together===

There are countless patterns that can be used for the placement of rings, such as 4 in 1, 6 in 1, etc. They are thus named for the number of links that are connected inside each individual ring. In a 4 in 1, each ring has four other rings connected to it. 
Some other patterns include Byzantine and Dragonscale.

=Leather armour=
*Leather for armour must be boiled before use. The longer it is boiled, the thicker and smaller it becomes. However, the longer a piece of leather is boiled, the more brittle it becomes.
*To make armour-grade leather vambraces, put a thick towel around your arm and mold the boiled leather around it.


Metal:
*Depending on the gauge (thickness) and temper (hardness) many pieces of armour may be made entirely with cold work (no forge required). Generally this is true for 12 gauge and smaller mild steel.
*True period metal armour was hardened using a forge. This allowed the metal to be thinner/lighter than much modern reenactor armour. 
*Most metal armour sold today is mostly or entirely cold worked, with the exception of the welds used in some pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Armour-Grade leather is basically boiled leather.  In this tutorial I will tell you how to make a coat of leather scales, with 1/4 sleeves. If you wear a [[w:gambeson|gambeson]] under it, it should be SCA legal. If it isn't, then, well you'll have a really cool motorcycle shirt.

==Materials==

*A large pot that you aren't afraid of ruining.
*Lots of eight ounce vegetable tanned leather, {or higher thicknesses, but no thicker than 12 ounce}
*Leather needle, and thick wax coated thread.  Fishing line will do well as well.
*Something that will easily cut the leather that you chose.
*Leather punch.
*A stopwatch, for timing the leathers, boiling time.
*A spider scoop, or the thing you use to get deep fried food out of the boiler.

==Starting the Pattern==

Start by getting a pattern for a loose shirt with sleeves down to slightly above or below your elbows.  A pattern for a chainmail shirt will work good as well, perhaps better.  When you have that, make the pattern out of flexible, but tough leather, or thick cloth, like canvas.  When you have the shirt sewn, try it on.  You will cover every square inch on the outside of this, except the armpit, where you may want to put chainmail.  How to make chainmail can be found in another of our tutorials [[../Making Period Mail/]].

==Making the Scales==

Now you can start making the scales.  Obviously you won't be able to do it all in one day.  It would probably be a good idea to start out with a simple rectangle, about three inches by an inch and a half.  Once you get better you can make &quot;dragon scales&quot;.  Punch two holes in the top of each scale with the largest punch on the rotary punch, then punch two more a quarter inch beneath those.  Fill up about a five gallon bucket.  You can find full size patterns for several different scales [[Image:Leather_scale_plans.jpg|here]]

==Boiling the Scales==

Start boiling the water, depending on how many scales you are going to make about a couple gallons should be fine.  When the water is simmering, hot, or boiling {your choice} you put the leather scales in until they have shrunk, and are rubbery.  You will need to use the timer for this, and experiment.  But remember that the longer you leave them in, the thicker, and harder they will get.  

After they have been boiled, you will have to lay them out, perhaps on a cookie sheet, with another cookie sheet on top to keep them flat.  After they are dry, thread the needle through the holes your prepunched, and start sewing them to your leather shirt.  Make sure to overlap them.  You won't beand sew it on there, if you are going to try to use it for SCA battle.

==Making Vambraces==

To make vambraces you simply measure the greatest and least circumferences of your forearm, and make a conical pattern, with holes every half inch or so.  Make it about two inches bigger than needed, to allow for the shrinkage.  When you have boiled the leather long enough, wrap a towel around your arm, and use your arm as a mold for the leather.  It may help if you have another person help you.

==Golden Rules of Making Mail==

The first rule if you are going to make chainmail is '''To Be Careful''', and where you hold the wire, wear thick leather gloves.  This is because the wire will be running through your hands at a rapid rate and you could get serious cuts.  The second rule is wear glasses when you knit the wire, even if you don’t need them.  If you don’t do this you will get some serious eye strain.  And lastly the third rule is that if you want battle ready mail for the Society for Creative Anachronism or Adrian Empire, don’t use aluminium mail, use steel, at least 16 gauge, preferably riveted.  In other words if you're are going to be hit--wear steel.

==The Types of Wire== 

Here are some of the best types of wire to use, both for the armour and inlays.  Aluminium isn’t good for either, as it is too weak and brittle, and the mail will soon start to fall apart when used.

*Mild steel: Mild steel is plain low carbon steel that is the closest material we have to what real maille was made from.  It doesn't stink and isn't carcinogenic like galvanized steel, but will rust.  
*Spring steel: Spring steel is a high carbon steel that can be tempered but is otherwise like mild steel.
*Galvanized steel: Galvanized steel is good—it is cheap, it won't rust easily and is durable, and easy to work with.  Plus you can find it at just about any hardware store.
*Stainless steel: Stainless steel is more expensive than galvanized steel, but is more durable, and won’t rust, but is harder to work with.
*Brass rod: Brass rod isn’t good for making the armour itself, but is used for inlays and edging.
*Copper: Copper wire is good for inlays and edging.  It is fairly cheap and common.  However after a while it will form a blue-green layer of patina upon contact with air, so you will want to work that into your pattern, unless you want to polish the links about once a week. Also note that the Patina will rub off and leave stains on light-colored clothes and skin (especially when the links become wet from sweat or rain), so be careful where you use copper links.
Other: You can also use plastic coated wire for inlays.  Some people will use titanium wire to make the chainmail, but it is hard to find and expensive, although it is tough and lightweight.

==The Sizes of Wire==

Generally, an internal link diameter 6 or 7 times the wire gauge (6.5 if you prefer) will give a good looking mail. Most armour work can be done in 14 gauge wire with a 5/16&quot; ID.

A higher wire gauge indicates thinner wire. Larger wire sizes give heavier links, but links can be larger and take less time to make. Smaller wire sizes give lighter links, with smaller IDs (internal diameter), and it will take longer to make something with them, but feel better when worn.

==Tools You Will Need==
These are the tools you need:

*A reversible, variable speed drill, or some kind of crank
*A stand for the drill.
*Thick leather gloves.
*Something to cut the wire with.  Aviation snips are fine; jewellers saws give the smoothest edge (get plenty of extra blades), but are slower; you could also try heating the metal to red hot, and using a hot chisel (I don't know what how clean the cut would be though)
*For knitting the chain, pairs of needle nose pliers are good.  You have to be careful of your fingers though.  You can also use different pliers, so don’t be afraid to experiment.

==Chainmail Patterns==

The most common pattern is the four in one.  This means that each link has four others going through it.  There is also six in one, where each link has six links going through it, and eight in one, with eight links going through one.  There is also the double mail, which is a doubled four in one, or eight in two (also known as king's mail).  This has every link in the four in one pattern doubled.  Beware though; the double mail is twice as heavy as the four in one.

European 6in1
[[Image:6in1_mail.jpg]]

==Making the Links==

First wind your chosen wire (if you decide that you want to make a lot of mail, you can make thousands of links and put them in containers marked according to what they're made of, gauge, and inner diameter), and slip it off the rod.  You then cut the individual rings with your cutting tool (in this case, aviation snips), and close about half of the rings.  You then take four closed rings, and thread them onto one open ring.  You then make a running chain by hooking the little sets of four in one together.  You then lay two running chains out together, and link the sets of two together with another open link.  Close the link.  You do this over and over again until you have a ribbon of the desired length.

'''Step One''' - Wind some coils
For this step you will need: 
*Winding Jig w/Mandrel 
*Wire 
*Wire Cutters 
*Gloves 
When winding coils, put safety first. It is possible to bend your mandrel into a crank and wind by hand, or to chuck a straight mandrel into a variable speed power drill for faster production. I recommend starting out winding by hand (I did so for 7 years before moving to power winding) until you have a good feel for the process. If and when you begin using a power drill to wind, make sure you use a variable speed drill and start out slowly! Winding your hand into the coil can break bones at worst and is generally painful at best. 
A scrap lumber winding jig is shown at right &lt;ref&gt;Apparent source page: http://www.lindell.us/chain/Untitled-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; - these are easy to make with an extra dresser drawer or scrap lumber - a hot rolled steel rod can be easily had at most hardware stores, and it is fairly easy to drill a starting hole with most drill bits.

To wind a coil, insert the wire into the hole in the dowel. Guide the wire with one hand and operate the crank or drill with the other. Go slowly at first and increase speed as you gain proficiency. When you finish winding a coil, cut off the wire and slide the coil off the dowel. Repeat until you have run out of wire or have enough coils to keep you busy for a while.

==Making 4-in-1 mail - Step by step==

*'''Necessary Tools''':
** 2 Flat Pliers (Depending on material used, but with most materials you will hurt yourself and get blisters if you bend them with your fingers)
** 1 Steel Rod or similar thin stick

1. Preparation
:First take the rod and fix it horizontally somewhere on a table with a vice or clamp. Fasten it in a place that is a bit higher than your face so you can work downwards without having to bend down all the time. 
2. The first row
:Take a number of closed chain links (close them with the pliers if they're open) and thread them on the rod but don't link those together. This will be the first row of your chain mail sheet. Arrange them so that they all face in the same direction, left side behind the rod and right side in front of it.
3. The second row
:In this step you will link each two adjacent rings of row one with a ring of row two. Note that every ring of row two goes through two rings of row one, but not through a ring of row two. Rings in the same row are not linked together, they are linked to two rings from the row above (row one) and two rings of the row below (row three, which we will add in the next step). Hence the name &quot;4-in-1&quot;, because every ring is linked to 4 other rings. Look at the picture above to see where a ring of row two goes through behind a ring of row one and where it goes through in front. Use the pliers to close the rings or you will hurt your fingers.
4. The third and all following rows
:From now on you build every row like you build row two. Every ring goes through two adjacent rings from the row above and rings in the same row are not linked. Take care to check that all rings of a finished row are flipped in the same direction before you start the next row. The sheet of mail needs to look regular, If any part of it looks twisted or the sheet bends somewhere a ring was flipped or twisted the wrong way. This takes a bit of practice but after a few rows you'll be able to do it pretty fast.

''Special Techniques''
* Thinning and widening
:You can thin or widen the sheet if necessary. Just take less rings in that row and link every ring of a row to three rings of the row above (which will give you a with reduction to 2/3) or you can link 2-3-2-3 (one ring linked normally, one linked to three). The row below links normally again. Experiment to find the right reduction factor. Widening works the other way round, you take more rings in a row and you get a widening. Again, experiment.

== More to come? ==

Is anyone planning to expand this book? I would be interested in helping with that.
--[[User:Erraunt|Erraunt]] 17:27, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I've done a little, but the subject is maybe too broad for a Wiki-book. I might put some pointers to (several) published works   Ralph 31Jan06

i thing that it will do a lot for the book if you add some picturs pluss it wikk help you understand better how to do it and maby some step by step explenations images if someone will be so kind to make some perhaps ssomeone who understand how its done --[[User:194.144.73.134|194.144.73.134]] 18:27, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</text>

what &quot;period&quot;? &quot;period&quot; is only meaningful in a context where you know what &quot;period&quot; you are talking about. century? culture? continent? [[User:80.218.88.6|80.218.88.6]] 22:49, 28 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==What's {in|out of} Period to Whom?==
In general, when reading/talking about items that are being discussed in terms of 'period', the item(s) should give you a rough guess about the time-frame of the 'period'.  As to the culture and geographic are that are the further context of the object, once the century is filled in, you may well have a fairly good frame of reference of the rest of the item's details. 

For those of us in the Current Middle Ages, our period in/of history is defined as a 'pre-17th century Western European-based' educational organization.  The practical statement on 'period' is that the majority of folk are in the time span from 600 CE to 1600 CE, with a slight shove to the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 for the rapier/light fighters.  The Society does have a '''lot''' of visitors from the rest of the Known World.  We try to have a 'have fun, be safe' attitude in general, politics notwithstanding and mostly deplored. 

==Preparing Leather for Armour==

In this specific, cuir bouilli (leather from cattle, swine, goats, sheep and horses that has been boiled in beeswax and then sawn, filed, punched/drilled to spec for that piece of armour) is used through-out most of the date-range of the SCA.  The only exception that I have noticed in my time in the Society would be the middle-to-late human jousting/war armours for the rider.

In the harnesses that I have built for myself, my ever-lovely Lady-Wife and for customers, the major portion of the equipment is boiled/lacquered leather of various weights.   Obviously, the legal requirements of the Society and kingdoms' Earls Marshal were followed in the matter of having steel helms, hand protection, etc.  My own body armour is now  of legal drinking age {grin} and has required only simple maintenance of the lacquer/dye and occasional rivet replacement.

For Mistress Laurel Seamchecker (the authenticity mavens/police), certainly using wax or paraffin is The Right Way To Do It.  I completely agree, but I also will point out that boiling wax is very flammable, and in the exactly wrong conditions, explosive.  I'll enlarge on  this in the article.  Using modern lacquer produces nearly the same result, but is easier to do, and safer.

I hope that I've cleared things a bit.  There is lots more to come on the subject(s), and I hope that folks will have a better understanding of how to make armour when we're done.

Yours in Service of the Society,

Laird Andrew MacIan of Blackthorne

== How-to? Not really. ==

This how-to seems to be written for a person who is already very familiar with the concepts and techniques involved. At no point is a process 'walked-through' with the reader, let alone discussed in depth. If this is to be considered a how-to it needs some serious work. I would expect an article such as this to go on for several pages.

Any thoughts?

== not a tutorial... ==

This is not so much a how-to as it is a brief description. Many of the 'facts' expressed here
are opinions, not facts. This does not touch on period maille at all either, period maille
was made with riveted links, this description applies to butted maille. Several of the
other errors or omissions are 
1. You can also use a hand turned mandrel to make your coils.
2. there are several places online that offer pre-made links inexpensively so you do not
need to make your own.
3. Some of the SCA kingdoms do indeed allow aluminum maille, look at local baronies rules to
determine if yours does.
4. Brass links make fine chainmail(but not as durable as steel), if you don't use brass-rod stock but brass wire/pre-made links
5. Essentially most of the limitations listed are incorrect or simply opinions, there are many
other wire types and pre-made links available. The most 'correct' period maille would be made from
mild steel links riveted together. 
6. There are many chainmail sites online with good tutorials for beginning to work with maille.
Use google and they are easy to find, some of them are also suppliers of pre-made links.
7. and finally all the weaves described here are given without their full titles, the 4-in-1 is properly
called european 4-in-1 ( since there is a japanese 4-in-1 weave also this is important), the 6-in-1 should
be european 6-in-1, etc...

== Name change ==

The name of this book ought to be changed to Making armor for the SCA.  That is what this book covers and the audience it is written for.  There is nothing 'period' about aluminum and there are no references which tell why any piece of mail is or is not period.  Which I would consider the first step for making mail in a given period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The goal of this book is to discuss the different issues involved in operating system design, the different strategies that have been tried and to provide concrete examples where possible.  Given the number of open-source operating systems available, specific implementations will be used as examples where possible. 

== Example Operating Systems ==

Naturally, open source operating systems lend themselves to teaching more than proprietary operating systems. The source code of all the following operating systems is available free of charge online:

*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Linux|Linux]]
*[[Operating_System_Design/Case_Studies/BSD|Net/Free/OpenBSD]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Solaris|Solaris]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/MINIX|MINIX]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/GNU Hurd|GNU Hurd]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/XOK|XOK]]
*ReactOS

While the following operating systems are closed source, enough is known about their implementation that they can all be used as specific examples of approaches to various OS design issues and tasks.

*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Mac_OS X|Mac OS X]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Windows 9x|Microsoft Windows 9x]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/Windows_NT|Windows NT]]
*[[Operating System Design/Case Studies/QNX|QNX]]
*DOS
*HP-UX
*AIX
*BeOS

== Example filesystems ==

* [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/FAT|FAT]]
* [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/NTFS/NTFS|NTFS]]
* [[Operating System Design/Case Studies/ext4|ext4]]

== Case Study Areas ==

The following areas of operating system design can all be illustrated with specific examples from real operating systems.  In some cases different approaches to the same task can be seen within one OS. For example, many operating systems support multiple file system types.

*Loading the operating system
*Initialising the operating system for use
*Managing tasks (processes)
*Managing memory
*File systems and storage management
*User interfaces

For example, in the &quot;Managing tasks&quot; section we might use the example of task management in a single tasking operating system like DOS, as well as some of the different scheduling algorithms that have been used in various multitasking operating systems.

The case study can include comparative analysis about any concept of different operating systems or comparison between the different versions of same operating systems. It can include the total functionality of the operating system given.

== Further reading ==

* [[Embedded Systems/Common RTOS]] gives yet more examples of real-time operating systems, many of them open-source.
* [[A Neutral Look at Operating Systems]] gives yet more examples of operating systems, many of them proprietary.

The book contents should be improved in many aspects. I am going to discuss some of them in order to  improve the book. Here is the overall material commonly covered in an OS textbook.
* Introduction and History
* Process
** Process Concept
** Process States
** Inter Process Communication
** Process Scheduling
** Synchronization
** Deadlock
** Thread (Light Weight Process)
* Memory Management
** Basic Models
** Virtual Memory
** Segmentation
** Paging
* Filesystem
** File Abstraction
** Issues
*** Performance
*** Fault-tolerance
* Security and Protection

== WARNING ==

Unless somebody objects I am going to hijack this book project and start over. I can't write a complete book on this subject but I can do about 75% and I can provide what I hope is a rational overall structure.

I am much more interested in the history of and rationale for operating systems than I am in the details of the popular contemporary systems. Myself I use Linux these days, but my experience goes back to the ten card loader for the IBM 704.

== old stuff ==

You will find that for a book to be successful it is better to allow people to contribute and colloborate directly - You might find the controversial [[ASQ]] page has much of interest for you. Anyway good luck [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 12:54, 16 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Thanks, Lobster. I'll change it now. If people want to contribute it would be prefered that they discuss it here first though. [[User:Wranga|Wranga]]

== change title ==

There are some who feel that a title such as 'my perfect OS' - could not be the title of a text book - (that it is just opinion)
so I would suggest giving it some serious title such as &quot;Perfecting Operating System Design&quot; - it sounds silly but these people are control freaks and prefer everyone to conform to their vision limitations - I warn you now :-) Also turn your editing to minor edits as you are still developing the book - good luck :-) [[User:Lobster|Lobster]] 07:38, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)


== operating system wiki ==

The TUNES project also involves creating an improved operating system.
They have a wiki now:
* TUNES wiki http://cliki.tunes.org/index

So, does &quot;My Perfect OS&quot; have any new idea that haven't already been discussed to death over on the TUNES wiki ?

Also check out the ideas at
* Killer Operating System http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?KillerOperatingSystem

== ReactOS ==

[http://reactos.org/ ReactOS] is almost similar to &quot;My Perfect OS&quot; -- Bijee

==Linux Considerations==

Requirements to be modular, open, and easy to use are already being rapidly satisfied in many Linux distributions. 

Here are a couple of friendly desktops:

*[http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ Ubuntu Linux]
*[http://www.morphix.org/ Morphix] - Very modular!

Because Linux is already so advanced, much of the work is already done. Additionally, many linux distributions are accompanied by [[w:LiveDistro]]s which give you a full operating system that boots from a cd, dvd, usb stick, or other bootable media devices. These ''bootable LiveDistros'' are useful because there are already tools out there to ''remaster'' these, giving you your own, unique operating system customized to include your own desktop background, browser bookmarks, applications and more.

==Software Analogs==

Here's a list of software that is free and can easily be added to My Perfect OS

*http://www.demosoftware.net/docs/gfdl/equivalents_english_table.html

== This is pointless... ==

This book is pointless, quotes like

&quot;The OS should almost definitely be built upon FreeDOS (http://www.freedos.org/) (or on its 32 bit counterpart, FreeDOS-32 (http://freedos-32.sourceforge.net/)) like Windows 9x is upon MS-DOS. This would enable users to access and maintain and repair their computers when the GUI isn't working.&quot; 

and

&quot;Linux is best as a server, but average PC users are not familiar with its concepts and simplicity, hence will never be much of a competition to MS Windows.&quot;

clearly show that this has been written by a bunch of people too lazy to learn some simple linux command line tools.

go rtfm rather than making up bullshit.

While the above user is a wee bit harsh... I see a little truth in it. I don't exactly see where this book is going, nor how I can make this book better. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]]

== ReactOS ==

You may as well just make a reactos distro [http://www.reactos.com reactos.com] (they've been having some server problems recently) if your going to clone directx api at least help them do it. they're working on cloning windows itself. (which would make something that's just similary programmed obsolete.)

== Where Are MacOS ==

Where is MacOS i think it was missing!

== [[Embedded Systems]] ==

In the [[Embedded Systems]] book, We talk alot about Real-Time OS's, and i think that perhaps we could post links between these two books. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 22:16, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

== &quot;&lt; Operating System Design&quot; links point to cover page rather than contents page. ==

The &quot;&lt; Operating System Design&quot; links point to the cover page rather than the contents page, meaning that people have to click through to the contents page again every time they exit a chapter. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 09:05, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

== Rearrange Titles ==

I think this book should have the TOC rearranged some. It's very messy, and does not go in the actual order of development. You SHOULD NOT be working on getting a process into memory UNTIL you have memory management of some type.

== Threads versus Processes ==
A Thread is basically a subset of a Process.  Some of the management is removed but generally the same issues exist.  Wouldn't the discussion of Threads be better off as a subset of Processes.

The list at the top of this page is a decent start, but omits Initialisation.  The order of topics being covered can vary depending on whether you want to go through order of development, or order of running, but the basics that should be covered are:
*Initialisation
** Boot Loaders (including multi stage ones)
** Hardware Initialisation (after the OS has loaded)
*Tasks (Processes if you prefer)
** Definition
** Scheduling
*** First Come First Served
*** Run Shortest First
*** Run First to Complete
*** Time slicing
*** Pre-emption
*** Prioritising
** Concurrent processing
*** Deadlock
*** Livelock
** Interprocess Communication
*** Semaphores
*** Shared Memory
** Threads (Lightweight processes)
*Memory Management
** Basics
*** Allocation Algorithms
** Segmentation
** Virtual Memory
*** Paging
*** Swapping
** Fault Tolerance (Page Deallocation tables)
*File Systems
**Abstractions
**Allocation Algorithms
***Performance
**Fault Tolerance
*** RAID
*** Moving Bad Blocks
*** Journalling
* Security
** Access Controls
*** Users
*** Resources
** Privileges
== Continuing Work ==
I see that some edits have been done... I've tried to tidy some of the pages up a bit, and mostly I'm working from memory here so if I make mistakes please correct me.  It seems like some of the pieces that have been added are very minor, but still if we can get some more pages in place perhaps we can make this actually useful... 

I've not added any specific implementation chunks in as I'm not sure what the best way to do it would be... Explicit copies of portions of Open OSes that match the descriptions, or custom pseudocode that at least helps the would be learner to understand what they would need to write?  Any thoughts any one? --[[User:Zwack|Zwack]] 17:51, 28 October 2007 (UTC)</text>

If you participate in a sports team, play music in a group, organize a group of neighbors  to convince local government to plant a tree in your street or  work with colleagues in a project, in all these situations you will have to make decisions together, inform each other and distribute the work to be done. To do these things you will have to get together from time to time and have a meeting.  This booklet describes a structure you can give to your meetings.  

If you have to meet with more than twenty-five people the structures described in this booklet become impractical and might lead to fruitless meetings without end. For such meetings it is better to borrow ideas from regulations as they are used for member participation in parliaments and large societies.  If you meet with two or three people, probably  no formal structure will be needed. If you meet with four to twenty people and the task is complicated or will span a significant amount of time, having a meeting as described in this booklet is probably a good option and this booklet is written for you.

==Tip== 
In your opening meeting if you run a brainstorming session (maybe on a whiteboard) and ask people what they want from a good meeting, you inevitably get a list reflecting your objectives but you've created much greater buy-in from your team. Buying early makes the whole process easier.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Web Advertising uses static images, animated GIFs, and Flash Animation to display a product or service. 
Advertising on the Web displays in many different ways such as banners or buttons, Pop-up and Pop-under, and intro pages to websites.

A banner or a button can be an image, animated gif, flash video or plain text

A Pop-up or Pop-under causes a new browser window to open and displays a webpage that can contain text, images and flash.

Intro Pages to websites usually have a flash or gif animation to introduce a company, their services or Products.


Internet advertising is delivered by ad servers.  The most common type of ad server in use today is the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_ad_server Central ad server].

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called IBB. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name IBB~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

==Agenda==
A good agenda reflects the function of the meeting, because many of these functions are the same for any group staying together for a longer time a large part of the agenda can exist of standing items. An example may clarify this, many companies in Europe have a workscouncil from which representatives of the employees give advice to the management of their company. Their agenda might look something like this:

&lt;center&gt;Agenda Workscouncil YourCompany&lt;/center&gt;

Date: 2004 October 16

Time: 11.15

Location: YourCompany Headquarters, Meeting Room 1

# Opening and Agenda
# Minutes Last Meeting
# Open Action Points
# Incoming Mail
# Outgoing Mail
# Implementation New Tax Rules on Company Cars for Private Use
#*Backgound: See IN2004-078, Finance Ministry, Tax Guide 2004 
#*Proposal : See Attachment: P2004-10: &quot;Ads on Our Cars to Keep YourCompany Rolling.&quot;  &lt;/br&gt;The Chairman of our finance committee will present the proposal.   
# Communication with Employees 
#* Background: Via several routes complaints have reached the workscouncil that employees feel they don't get sufficient information on workscouncil matters.&lt;/br&gt; Proposal: The Chairman and two members (who?) will contribute a page to our company magazine and add a news section to the workscouncil website.

# Preparation Meeting with Management  
#*Background: Management proposed agenda points see IN2004-201.
# Roundtable
# Closure
    
Why is this agenda as it is? The order is rational, as we hope to show.  
===Date, Time, Location===
Well should we explain this? We suppose you would like the participants to be at the meeting. Therefore, we recommend to add these items to the agenda. Only change the date or time after sending out the agenda if you discover there is something important (a festival, a sports game, etc.) at the planned time that will stop a majority of the participants from coming to the meeting. Of course it is better if you are able to check for these  obstacles in advance.

===Opening and Agenda===
Opening, this is often nothing more then a welcome to all participants. If there are new participants or it is the first meeting those new participants can be introduced here. The opening can however be a place to add a small identity related element. In the case of the workscouncil this does not apply, but the board of a poetry society could start every meeting with a poem.

Agenda, fix it well before the meeting, as an agenda point it is there as a last resort to make a change. Although there might be a reason to add or remove an agenda point, changes to the agenda should be a rare exception rather than the rule. To have an agenda point added during the meeting it should be very urgent, because most participants did not get a chance to inform themselves and will therefore not be able to participate with judgement in the discussion. If adding an agenda point is necessary it should probably be combined with a break in which the participants can prepare themselves.Removing an agenda point during the meeting can be an option if changes have removed the necessity of discussing it or if there is reason to assume there will be no time to deal with it. Even changes to an existing agenda before the meeting should be discouraged, because even if sent to the participants by mail or email these changes often fail to reach them, because they have developed habits of reading their mail only at certain time or simply because they have limited access to them.

===Minutes Last Meeting===
An opportunity to correct factual mistakes in the minutes of the previous meeting. Not an opportunity to restart discussions. These days the best way to deal with minutes is probably more direct: The minute taker can send the minutes to the participants as soon as possible after the meeting and gives the participants to point factual mistakes. After that the corrected minutes can be sent with the agenda.  

===Open Action Points===
A list of things to be done, the list should at least indicate: what, when and who. This is the moment to indicate which points can be closed and to consider whether a task should be tranferred from one participant to another. For this agenda we assumed it is provided as an attachment, but if the list is short it can be simply included. The list is there to prevent the meetings from turning into a tea party, i.e. a gathering of people talking about the work without ever getting it done. Because this list shows which participants are performing the work it is also a useful instrument in getting everybody 
to take a fair share in the work.

===Incoming Mail===
A list of incoming mail, it is there to inform all participants, if they are interested they can pay a visit to the mail archive to have a look at the mail. The list should at least include the day it was received, who sent it and a short description of the content. The person making the agenda should go through the mail before making the agenda to see if anything needs to be addressed in the meeting. Because the person making the agenda has to go through the mail and also send the material for the meeting of to the participants, responsibility for handling correspondence is often put in his/her hands aswell. 

===Outgoing Mail===
A list of outgoing mail. Participants should be informed about the mail that is sent on their behalf aswell.
The list should at least include when correspondence was sent, to whom and a short description. Again of  every item on this list a copy should be available in the mail archive. If it contains usefull information a copy of an important letter can be sent to all participants to whom the content is relevant.  

===Variable Agenda Points===
In this agenda there are three of them. These are generally considered to be the main part of the meeting. If most time is spent on other agenda points, the agenda was probably not optimal or the chairman incapable of leading the meeting correctly or the participants not sufficiently disciplined to follow the chairman.

Because it is likely that an update from the committees is important for the meeting with management, the committee update is put before discussing the meeting with management. Generally, however, one would keep the non-standard agenda points together. 

What are the important points to notice about these agenda points. First they indicate where you can find new relevant information or they give a short description it. Second they indicate a direction for solving the problem. 

The relevant information can come from all kind of sources, for the agenda point `New Tax Rules on Company Cars for Private Use'  this is an incoming piece of mail IN2004-78 ( this is the number by which you can find it in the archive) sent by the finance ministry containing an update on tax rules. In the ideal case the finance committee noticed the problem at the same time as management did and the proposal on the agenda was reached by a collaboration between management and the finance committee. In practice howevere there might reasons, good or bad, why such a collaboration with people outside is not possible and the proposal your group makes needs to negotiated with the other party. The proposal accepted in the meeting is then still subject to negotiations and might actually contain suggestions for a negotiation strategy aswell. For the agenda point `Communication with Employees' it is simply a remark which summarizes employee opinions that reached the workscouncil over the past few months, be it by email, mail or conversations. For the agenda point `Preparation Meeting with Management' it is a proposal for an agenda meeting sent by management. If management thinks the new tax rules are the employees problem they will not put it on the agenda and leave it to the alertness of the employees. If on the contrary they have already reached preliminary agreement with the finance committee they probably want to get it on the agenda so they can obtain certainty and can plan the work related to it. This is an important point about agenda's: in general the agenda points left out can convey at lot of information about the goals are of the agenda maker.

The proposals also vary a lot in style and detail. For the changing tax regulations it is a complete document   which will also be further explained by the finance committees chairman. For the communication problems it is very simple and concrete and the main problem left is to find  people who are willing and able to do it among the participants. For the agenda for the meeting with management, there is the managements proposal but no internal proposal. There are two good reasons not to have an internal proposal yet: first the proposal by management will probably have most of the agenda points the workscouncil would come forward with and therefore changing it will be ammending it,  secondly probably only after dealing with the previous agenda points will it be clear which agenda points need to be added. It is a general rule of politeness to accept agenda points put forward by the other party and only add new agenda points. If this leads to time or other problems it is a good idea to ask the chairman or another participant who can act on behalf of the whole group to contact the chairman of the other group, in this case management, about the agenda.

===Committees===
Committees are an important instrument to structure work and we will come back to them. A meeting is often not the right place to do the real work, that is why this work is sometimes delegated to a committee. Many organizations, like the workcouncil in our example, often have permanent committees, because they are permanent they function largely independently but need to be able to report on the work they do. Because the end responsibility stays with the participants of the meeting they need to be able to judge the work of the committee and sometimes even confirm the decisions or decide between proposed alternatives. 

===Roundtable===
An opportunity for all participants to briefly share factual information with all other participants. This is not a place for discussion!
  

===Closure===
Mostly a simple thank you and see you next time by the chairman, but see remarks made about the opening. This is also the right place to thank leaving participants and give them flowers.

=Participants=

Who should be invited for the meeting?

1. Everybody who by regulation has a right to be at the meeting.

These people  should all be informed timely that a meeting is taking place and about what is on the agenda. If there are many people who have a right to be at the meeting but in practice they rarely do, this information should be sufficient. You will have to provide a place where they can access the relevant information. If this a situation that applies it is good practice to make a strict rule where and when you announce the meeting, especially if you don't know who these people are. If this group is small and practically everybody is always present it is easier to send the preparation material to all possible participants. 

2. Everybody who by regulation is required or at least expected to be at the meeting. 

These people all receive an agenda and the relevant background material and proposals. Where it should be noted that generally most incoming and outgoing mail is not relevant to the meeting!

3. People who need to give information to the meeting in person. 

The works council meeting above mentions committee updates, if the committee member who is most suited to give the update is not a regular participant in the meeting this expert committee member can be invited for the committee update. If the other agenda points are not confidential or even stronger the meeting is public, then this guest can be allowed to be there for the whole meeting. If there are agenda points where the guest presence is not desired and the meeting is not public the guest can simply be called in for the one agenda point in which he gives information. In the case of an works council meeting is conceivable, although more likely to happen in a committee, that a Human Resources officer comes to explain a certain regulation. The role of the  Human Resources officer is to support management, because of that one doesn't want to discuss a negotiation strategy in the his/her presence. Another example to explain this: if your society is in conflict with local government over a permit for adding  a kitchen to your society building but you found a civil servant who is willing to explain the new subsidy regulations to you, it is better not to discuss the kitchen problem in his presence. Even if you know this civil servant can be trusted it is better not to put the loyalty conflict on him.

Who should not be invited?

1. Individuals with whom your organization or group has a conflict. 

A meeting of your own group is not the place to solve a conflict with an individual, be it someone from outside or inside. It is better to talk to such an individual with a small number of people, where a small number is one or two and definitely not three. And two is really the best. 

2. The Opponent in Negotiations.

Well this is almost trivial. However be aware of the third category of people that should be invited. Reality is seldom black and white and where you might have hard negotiations on some topics you might have peaceful cooperation with the same outside group on others topics. This leads to another important point to make about opponents in negotiations, it is important not to spoil personal relationships with people in the other group, so try to keep conflicts purely business.

==Invitation==

To get the participants to the meeting they need to be invited, or if an appointment was made at a previous meeting or via telephone they still need to receive an agenda and supplementary documents. 

For small and/or well defined groups invitation, agenda and all other documents should be sent at least a week in advance of the meeting to all participants. If the group is very small, the meeting takes place at a fixed time and the participants agree to it you can shorten this period, but in all other situations a week is an absolute minimum. Of course if the meeting takes place every week, there is no other option but sending the agenda and documents at shorter notice.

For large and/or not well defined groups other methods apply, a possibility is to approach them through local papers, a poster in your street or apartment building. For these groups you should think about a creative way to approach them but always stay polite. If you don't know precisely who will be attending, you will have to start early with making announcements. 

Don't forget to invite the guest partipants and to indicate to them when and where  they are expected to join the meeting.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|GUI}}

GUIs display visual elements such as icons, windows, and other gadgets. The precursor to GUIs was invented by researchers at the Stanford Research Institute (led by Doug Engelbart) with the development and use of text-based hyperlinks manipulated with a mouse for the On-Line System. The concept of hyperlinks was further refined and extended to graphics by researchers at Xerox PARC, who went beyond text-based hyperlinks and used GUIs as the primary interface for the Xerox Alto computer. Most modern general-purpose GUIs are derived from this system. For this reason some people call this class of interface a PARC User Interface (PUI) (note that PUI is also an acronym for perceptual user interface). The PUI consists of graphical widgets (often provided by widget toolkit libraries) such as windows, menus, radio buttons, check boxes, and icons, and employs a pointing device (such as a mouse, trackball, or touchscreen) in addition to a keyboard. Those aspects of PUIs can be emphasized by using the alternative acronym WIMP, which stands for Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointing device.

The GUI familiar to most of us today in either the Mac or the Windows operating systems and their applications originated at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Laboratory in the late 1970s. Apple used it in their first Macintosh computers, followed by Atari with their ST range, and Commodore with the Amiga. Later, Microsoft used many of the same ideas in their first version of the Windows operating system for IBM-compatible PCs.
Examples of systems that support GUIs are Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, NEXTSTEP and the X Window System. The latter is extended with toolkits such as Motif (CDE), Qt (KDE) and GTK+ (GNOME).

== Types of GUIs==
GUIs that are not PUIs are most notably found in computer games, and advanced GUIs based on virtual reality are now frequently found in research. Many research groups in North America and Europe are currently working on the Zooming User Interface or ZUI, which is a logical advancement on the GUI, blending some 3D movement with 2D or &quot;2 and a half D&quot; vectorial objects.
Some GUIs are designed for the rigorous requirements of vertical markets. These are known as &quot;application specific GUIs.&quot; One example of such an application specific GUI is the now familiar touchscreen point of sale software found in restaurants worldwide and being introduced into self-service retail checkouts. First pioneered by Gene Mosher on the Atari ST computer in 1986, the application specific touchscreen GUI has spearheaded a worldwide revolution in the use of computers throughout the food &amp; beverage industry and in general retail.
Other examples of application specific touchscreen GUIs include the most recent automatic teller machines, airline self-ticketing, information kiosks and the monitor/control screens in embedded industrial applications which employ a real time operating system (RTOS). The latest cell phones and handheld game systems also employ application specific touchscreen GUIs.

==GUI vs. CLI==
GUIs were introduced in reaction to the steep learning curve of Command Line Interfaces (CLI), text-based user interfaces requiring commands to be typed on the keyboard. Since the command words in CLIs are usually numerous and composable, very complicated operations can be invoked using a relatively short sequence of words and symbols. This leads to high levels of efficiency once the many commands are learned, but reaching this level can take a while because the command words aren't easily discoverable. WIMPs, on the other hand, present the user with numerous widgets that represent and can trigger some of the system's available commands.
Most modern operating systems provide both a GUI and a CLI, although the GUIs usually receive more attention. The GUI is usually WIMP-based, although occasionally other metaphors surface, such as Microsoft Bob, 3dwm or (partially) FSV.
Applications may also provide both interfaces, and when they do the GUI is usually a WIMP wrapper around the CLI version. The latter used to be implemented first because it allowed the developers to focus exclusively on their product's functionality without bothering about interface details such as designing icons and placing buttons. Nowadays, the GUI is no longer considered an optional part of most applications because users have grown accustomed to the ease of use provided by their familiar GUIs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is not designed to teach the reader how to be an artist, nor is it step-by step instruction on how to directly make art. This book is an overview of tools, procedures and creation paradigms for creating art within each of the major artistic disciplines.

Training a person to create art is not a subject that can be easily handled by any one book, at least not effectively. Learning to create art is a process that consists of directed practice and diligent study. 

The aim of this book is to give the reader a better understanding for some of the individual components that generally make up artistic creation and the creative process.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Linux already has reliable journalling filesystems, several graphical interfaces, massive amounts of written documentation, etc. etc. Why would anybody want to use a DOS type of OS?? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:33, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I agree - anyone who would consider basing an OS on DOS (even back in the 80's and early 90's when Microsoft was doing this with Windows) needs to learn more about the topic. DOS doesnt allow for much expansion (more filesystems), is single tasking (that means no running mozilla at the same time as notepad, and even GUIs themselves are almost unusable in this state) unless this is done manually by almost replacing all of DOS. The command line is defianately an advantage, however anyone familiar with a DOS command line would notice its almost impossible to work in by today's standards. Any Unix implementation has all the desirable features of DOS, only they actually are desirable for Unix - the command line is useable. Also, DOS offers no security whatsoever, any application can delete anything and stop the system from functioning and prevent recovery of any data. Unix is very secure (much moreso than Windows, this is a topic of debate, however anyone who has experience with both systems rather than just believing what microsoft says would defianately agree). Unix's only real shortcoming is the GUI - X11 is seriously slow and lacking in features desirable by the common user. While X is certainly more than sufficient for web browsing, word processing and most other things, benchmarks show that it is slower than Windows, and the fact alone that many applications look and behave differently is a serious problem. No GUI for DOS even competes with X however. I have deleted the FreeDOS section, no offence to the author, but it is misinforming.

How is this a wikibook topic? - anonymous

I don't think this belongs.  It acts as if a new os is going to be created in the book.  This is not the case according to the preface.

I have to agree with the above.  This sounds like the author is going to document writing their own OS from scratch.   Much better for this type of textbook (imho) would be to discuss the issues, and various approaches to resolving them.  Using real life examples (particularly open source ones like Linux or the BSDs) to point the user to implementations that match specific approaches.  For example most OSes have some kind of memory management, some kind of task scheduler, and some kind of file system.  The actual implementations can vary massively, and there are many ways of dealing with the associated problems.  In the spirit of this I'll try modifying this page to state more explicitly what could make this a good text book.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fibonacci-function using memoization and DP==

So how would a fibonacci program using memoization work? Consider the following program (''f''[''n''] contains the nth Fibonacci-number if has been calculated, -1 otherwise):

 '''function''' ''fib''(''n'')
   '''if''' ''f''[''n''] != -1  
     '''return''' ''f''[''n'']
   '''else if''' ''n'' == 0 '''or''' n == 1
     '''return''' ''n''
   '''else'''
     ''f''[''n''] = ''fib''(''n''-1) + ''fib''(''n''-2)
     '''return''' ''f''[''n'']
   '''fi'''
 '''end function'''

The code should be pretty obvoius. If the value of fib(n) already has been calculated it's stored in f[n] and then returned instead of calculating it again. That means all the copies of the sub-call trees are removed from the calculation.

[[Image:Algorithms-F6CallTreeMemoized.PNG]]

The values in the blue boxes are values that already have been calculated and the calls can thus be skipped. It is thus alot faster than the straight-forward recursive algorithm. Since every value less than n is calculated once, and only once, the first time you execute it, the asymptotic running time is&lt;math&gt;O (n)&lt;/math&gt;. Any other calls to it will take &lt;math&gt;O (1)&lt;/math&gt; since the values have been precalculated (assuming the rest of the calls is less than n). 

The algorithm does consume alot of memory. When we calculate fib(n), the values fib(0) to fib(n) are stored in main memory. Can this be improved? Yes it can, although the &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; running time of subsequent calls are obvoisly lost (since the values aren't stored). Since the value of fib(n) only depends on fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) we can discard the other values by going bottom-up. If we want to calculate fib(n), we first calculate fib(2) (fib(0) + fib(1)) then we can calculate fib(3) by adding fib(1) and fib(2). Then we can discard fib(1) and fib(2) since we don't need them to calculate any more values. From fib(2) and fib(3) we calculate fib(4) and discard fib(2), then we calculate fib(5) and discard fib(3), etc etc. The code goes something like this:

 '''function''' ''fib''(''n'')
   '''int''' ''u'' = 0
   '''int''' ''v'' = 1
   '''int''' ''t'';
 
   '''for''' ''i'' = 2 '''to''' ''n''
     ''t'' = ''u'' + ''v''
     ''u'' = ''v''
     ''v'' = ''t''
   '''repeat'''
   
   '''return''' ''v''
 '''end''' '''function'''

We can, obvouisly, modify the code to store the values in an array for subsequent calls, the point is that we don't have to. This method is typical for dynamic programming. First we identify what subproblems need to be solved in order to solve the entire problem, and then we calculate the values bottom-up using an iterative process.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Supreme Court decisions are often controversial; therefore giving citizens the right to approve or reject Supreme Court decisions would increase political participation. Court decisions often involve the most fundamental moral and political issues and citizens care enough to vote on them. &lt;br&gt;


*In 1902, Oregon introduced the initiative process which helped to raise voter turnout while it declined elsewhere. Due in part to this element of direct democracy, Oregon consistently has better than average turnout.  Giving Americans a similar right could increase national turnout. &lt;br&gt;


*I disagree, this would not increase political participation. In the 2002 election in Oregon, which was dominated by ballot measures, only 42 percent turned out, contrasted with 60 percent in the 2000 Presidential election. Court cases would be similar to ballot measures in that they would only address one issue. &lt;br&gt;


*Further, there are deeper reasons why people don’t vote. There are still social and cultural barriers to voting by poor and minority citizens. Also, the cynicism of many voters wouldn’t be changed by this proposal. &lt;br&gt;


*The Constitution should be amended so citizens can approve or reject Supreme Court decisions. Currently, the Court has nearly unlimited power; far-reaching policy is often made by five unelected justices. This resembles more of a tyrannical aristocracy than a democracy. A vote would be the people’s opinion, rather than the political elite’s. &lt;br&gt;


*I disagree. First, the sheer impracticality to such as system is mind-boggling. How would we determine which case should be voted on? 5-4 rulings only? Or would we set up a nationwide initiative process? Perhaps we should only vote on a decision if 100,000 people march on Washington. Even the wording of a measure would ignite controversy. For example, most Americans are in favor of allowing two consenting adults to engage in sexual practices in the privacy of their own home. However, change ‘adults’ to ‘men’ and the results would be, in my opinion, quite different. &lt;br&gt;


*Further, This proposed system would dangerously upset our system of checks and balances and endanger minorities. The judicial branch is designed to be the final stop for most everything, and with a few exceptions, it has been. Changing this would effectively destroy the idea of Judicial Review as created in Marbury v. Madison. &lt;br&gt;


*The judiciary is the branch furthest from the turbulent emotions of the majority, and thus is the only one that can effectively protect the minority. Federalist ten expressed the Framers fears of rule by the majority; they were largely antimajoritarian; they knew that a government dominated by the majority would be no better to the minority than a monarchy. The Justices base their decisions on precedent and Constitutional history and wrestle with the complexity of the issue. Voters, on the other hand, would vote with their hearts, not with their minds. &lt;br&gt;


*Finally, court decisions already can be overturned through the Amendment process. This has occurred on several occasions; most notably in Scott v. Sanford and Oregon v. Mitchell. These two cases resulted in the 13th and the 26th Amendments, respectively. &lt;br&gt;


*A voting plan wouldn’t threaten basic rights. On the contrary, it would expand them by allowing citizens an opportunity to protect themselves from unjust laws. The entire population would become a jury. The sixth Amendment specifically grants the right to trial by jury; this would simply create the ultimate jury. Furthermore, the Supreme Court deals with upholding or rejecting existing laws, so technically rejecting a ruling could only delay the development of new rights not threaten established ones.&lt;br&gt;


*I disagree. This plan would definitely threaten basic rights. The US is a republic rather than a democracy to protect against overpowering majority rule. James Madison famously wrote, “Democracies…have in general been as short in their lives as they are violent in their deaths.” Decisions as important as Supreme Court cases should not be left up to the rash masses. There are many cases that would support my opinion.&lt;br&gt;


*For example, Romers v Evans, would likely have been rejected, thus allowing states to prohibit cities from enforcing ordinances protecting homosexuals, and permiting the violation of Evans rights.&lt;br&gt;


*Another example would be the Brown v Board of Education, which would likely have been overturned allowing for “separate but equal” to exist, which would inherently violate Linda Brown’s rights.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve"> Mr. Emore's Class : Heffernan vs. Classical Republicans&lt;br&gt;
(a dialogue)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

GENERAL TENDENCY OF THE LAWS UNDER AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, AND INSTINCTS OF THOSE WHO APPLY THEM. Defects of a democratic government easy to be discovered--Its advantages discerned only by long observation--Democracy in America often inexpert, but the general tendency of the laws is advantageous--In the American democracy public officers have no permanent interests distinct from those of the majority--Results of this state of things. 

THE defects and weaknesses of a democratic government may readily be discovered; they can be proved by obvious facts, whereas their healthy influence becomes evident in ways which are not obvious and are, so to speak, hidden. A glance suffices to detect its faults, but its good qualities can be discerned only by long observation. The laws of the American democracy are frequently defective or incomplete; they sometimes attack vested rights, or sanction others which are dangerous to the community; and even if they were good, their frequency would still be a great evil. How comes it, then, that the American republics prosper and continue? 

In the consideration of laws a distinction must be carefully observed between the end at which they aim and the means by which they pursue that end; between their absolute and their relative excellence. If it be the intention of the legislator to favor the interests of the minority at the expense of the majority, and if the measures he takes are so combined as to accomplish the object he has in view with the least possible expense of time and exertion, the law may be well drawn up although its purpose is bad; and the more efficacious it is, the more dangerous it will be. 

Democratic laws generally tend to promote the welfare of the greatest possible number; for they emanate from the majority of the citizens, who are subject to error, but who cannot have an interest opposed to their own advantage. The laws of an aristocracy tend, on the contrary, to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of the minority; because an aristocracy, by its very nature, constitutes a minority. It may therefore be asserted, as a general proposition, that the purpose of a democracy in its legislation is more useful to humanity than that of an aristocracy. This, however, is the sum total of its advantages. 

Aristocracies are infinitely more expert in the science of legislation than democracies ever can be. They are possessed of a selfcontrol that protects them from the errors of temporary excitement; and they form far-reaching designs, which they know how to mature till a favorable opportunity arrives. Aristocratic government proceeds with the dexterity of art; it understands how to make the collective force of all its laws converge at the same time to a given point. Such is not the case with democracies, whose laws are almost always ineffective or inopportune. The means of democracy are therefore more imperfect than those of aristocracy, and the measures that it unwittingly adopts are frequently opposed to its own cause; but the object it has in view is more useful. 

Let us now imagine a community so organized by nature or by its constitution that it can support the transitory action of bad laws, and that it can await, without destruction, the general tendency of its legislation: we shall then conceive how a democratic government, notwithstanding its faults, may be best fitted to produce the prosperity of this community. This is precisely what has occurred in the United States; and I repeat, what I have before remarked, that the great advantage of the Americans consists in their being able to commit faults which they may afterwards repair. 

An analogous observation may be made respecting public officers. It is easy to perceive that American democracy frequently errs in the choice of the individuals to whom it entrusts the power of the administration; but it is more difficult to say why the state prospers under their rule. In the first place, it is to be remarked that if, in a democratic state, the governors have less honesty and less capacity than elsewhere, the governed are more enlightened and more attentive to their interests. As the people in democracies are more constantly vigilant in their affairs and more jealous of their rights, they prevent their representatives from abandoning that general line of conduct which their own interest prescribes. In the second place, it must be remembered that if the democratic magistrate is more apt to misuse his power, he possesses it for a shorter time. But there is yet another reason which is still more general and conclusive. It is no doubt of importance to the welfare of nations that they should be governed by men of talents and virtue; but it is perhaps still more important for them that the interests of those men should not differ from the interests of the community at large; for if such were the case, their virtues might become almost useless and their talents might be turned to a bad account. I have said that it is important that the interests of the persons in authority should not differ from or oppose the interests of the community at large; but I do not insist upon their having the same interests as the whole population, because I am not aware that such a state of things ever existed in any country. 

No political form has hitherto been discovered that is equally favorable to the prosperity and the development of all the classes into which society is divided. These classes continue to form, as it were, so many distinct communities in the same nation; and experience has shown that it is no less dangerous to place the fate of these classes exclusively in the hands of any one of them than it is to make one people the arbiter of the destiny of another. When the rich alone govern, the interest of the poor is always endangered, and when the poor make the laws, that of the rich incurs very serious risks. The advantage of democracy does not consist, therefore, as has sometimes been asserted, in favoring the prosperity of all, but simply in contributing to the well-being of the greatest number. The men who are entrusted with the direction of public affairs in the United States are frequently inferior, in both capacity and morality, to those whom an aristocracy would raise to power. But their interest is identified and mingled with that of the majority of their fellow citizens. They may frequently be faithless and frequently mistaken, but they will never systematically adopt a line of conduct hostile to the majority; and they cannot give a dangerous or exclusive tendency to the government. 

The maladministration of a democratic magistrate, moreover, is an isolated fact, which has influence only during the short period for which he is elected. Corruption and incapacity do not act as common interests which may connect men permanently with one another. A corrupt or incapable magistrate will not combine his measures with another magistrate simply because the latter is as corrupt and incapable as himself; and these two men will never unite their endeavors to promote the corruption and inaptitude of their remote posterity. The ambition and the maneuvers of the one will serve, on the contrary, to unmask the other. The vices of a magistrate in democratic states are usually wholly personal. 


Voice 1: This philohsophy represents how  the individual over society, whereas classical republicanism advocates the betterment of society even when restricting personal liberty. Both these systems influenced the framers.  Natural rights citizens form a social contract, consenting to form a government designed to protect their own interests. They participate to ensure the protection of their rights. Further, citizens can change the government if it fails to protect those rights.  In Classical republicanism, citizens accept their obligation to the good of the whole. They participate because it is their civic duty. Citizens could rarely enter republics which effectively constrained them from leaving their own.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 2: Ben Franklin believed the citizen’s rights often outweigh priorities of government. He said “they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” Conversely, the Greek orator Pericles said, “The merits of a citizen outweigh the demerits of an individual.” To him and other classical republicans, sacrifices made for community were significant enough to offset personal errors.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 3: The belief at the Convention was that classical republicanism would only work in small, homogeneous societies where citizens had similar goals. Therefore natural rights philosophy is more clearly exhibited in the Constitution, as in Article one Section nine, which prohibits the government from suspending important rights. &lt;br&gt;

Voice 4: My definition of common good is the promotion of the good of society seen as a whole, as in classical republicanism.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 1: The common good in respect to natural rights philosophy is the maximum amount of liberties for the individual. This is my definition of common good.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 3: In my opinion each system is fatally flawed, they isolated paths to reach the common good. Classical republicanism discouraged individuality, punishing it by exile or death, as shown by the example of Socrates, who was executed for teaching people to question society.  Natural rights societies do not ask their citizens to sacrifice for the good of the whole.  Today’s drive for private gains ignores community goods like clean air, schools, and parks. &lt;br&gt;

Voice 2: We purpose that the simultaneous advancement of society and the individual is the real common good. This is not a compromise or an average between classical republicanism and natural rights, the benefits of both systems are included entirely. In short, the common good is a fusion of these two extremes.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 3: Historically politics has not used our definition due to its difficulty to attain. Instead they are compromises including some of both systems. In actuality, the common good is more than a perfect compromise, it is what is best for both at the same time. The framers understood this ideal; Madison said “the public Good, the real welfare of the great body of the people, is the supreme object to be pursued; no form of government… has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object.”&lt;br&gt;

Voice 1: My idea of common good, the natural rights theory, can be determined only by every individual deciding what is best for themselves.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 4: I disagree. I believe in the classical republicanism take on common good, which is determined by the selfless wise for the benefit of society. &lt;br&gt;

Voice 3: No, the common good is the selfless wise weighing the opinions of the masses to maximize the individual and collective goods.&lt;br&gt;

Voice 2: Self-interest is looking out for ones own well-being. In contrast, enlightened self-interest is the idea that by helping society we in turn help ourselves. A simple way to distinguish between the two is by asking– Who is directly benefiting and for what reasons? As Du de la Rachefoucauld said, “However brilliant an action it should not be esteemed great unless the result of a great motive.”&lt;br&gt;

Voice 4: Enlightened self-interest is disappearing from our society. It is largely due to social disconnect, lack of trust, feeling of powerlessness and because of the prevailing individualistic attitudes of Americans.  The Tipping Point by Malcom Gladwell reveals that to create ideological epidemics one must solve the minute aspects of the problem.  In short, to encourage enlightened self interest we should encourage domestic vacationing, labeling state origins of products, promote switching schools, teaching natural leaders to be civic, advocate public forums, providing tax benefits as a reward, and educating about benefits of enlightened self interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book aims to function as a comprehensive reference guide to the measures used in  descriptive statistics. For a general introduction to statistics, see [[Statistics]] instead.

It has a section on all the common measures, and they are categorised according to type. Initially we shall concentrate on univariate statistics. Entries should be brief, information-packed and not overly tutorial in nature. Assume a reader which already has a basic knowledge of statistics, and needs detailed information or a refresher.

*Sampling distribution.

== Calculation ==

Include any alternative methods of calculation, especially for large data sets, or when other measures have already been calculated.

(An example: once you have the count, sum, sum of squares, cubes and fourth powers for a data set, you can then use these to easily calculate the Mean, Std. Dev, Skew and Kurtosis, rather than having to go through the entire dataset multiple times calculating differences.)

== Software ==

Include how it is accessed in common statistical packages, if known.
Can also provide links to source code samples for calculating it, etc.

      <comment>/* Level of Measurement */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Statistical variables can be classified as follows:

== Level of Measurement ==
The level of measurement of a variable in mathematics and statistics describes how much information the numbers associated with the variable contain. Different mathematical operations on variables are possible, depending on the level at which a variable is measured. In statistics, the kinds of descriptive statistics and significance tests that are appropriate depend on the level of measurement of the variables concerned.

Four levels of measurement are usually recognised:

* '''Nominal measurement'''. The numbers are names or labels. They can and often are replaced by verbal names. If two entities have the same number associated with them, they belong to the same category, and that is the only significance that they have. The only comparisons that can be made between variable values are equality and inequality. There are no &quot;less than&quot; or &quot;greater than&quot; relations among them, nor operations such as addition or subtraction. Examples include: the international telephone code for a country, the numbers on the shirts of players in a sports team, or the number of a bus. The only kind of measure of central tendency is the mode. Information entropy is available as a measure of statistical dispersion, but no notion of standard deviation or the like exists. Variables that are measured only nominally are also called categorical variables.in other word it is used for qualitative data.
* '''Ordinal measurement'''. The numbers have all the features of nominal measures and also represent the rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.) of the entities measured. The numbers are ordinals. Comparisons of greater and less can be made, in addition to equality and inequality. However operations such as conventional addition and subtraction are still without meaning. A physical example is the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Another example is the results of a horse race; which horses arrived first, second, third, etc. are reported, but the time intervals between the horses are not reported. Most measurement in psychology and other social sciences is at the ordinal level; for example attitudes and IQ are only measured at the ordinal level. If customers surveyed report preferring chocolate- to vanilla-flavored ice cream, the data are of this kind. The central tendency of a distribution an ordinally measured variable can be represented by its mode or its median; the latter will give more information. Variables measured at the ordinal level are referred to as ordinal variables or rank variables.
* '''Interval measurement'''. The numbers have all the features of ordinal measurement and also are separated by the same interval. In this case, differences between arbitrary pairs of numbers can be meaningfully compared. Operations such as addition and subtraction are therefore meaningful. However, the zero point on the scale is arbitrary, and ratios between numbers on the scale are not meaningful, so operations such as multiplication and division cannot be carried out. On the other hand, negative values on the scale can be used. An example is the year date in many calendars. The central tendency of a distribution an variable measured at the interval level can be represented by its mode, its median or its arithmetic mean; the mean will give most information. Variables measured at the interval level are referred to as interval variables, or sometimes as scaled variables, though the latter usage is not obvious and is not recommended.
* '''Ratio measurement'''. This is the highest level of measurement and is used for quantitative data. The numbers have all the features of interval measurement and also have meaningful ratios between arbitrary pairs of numbers. Operations such as multiplication and division are therefore meaningful. The zero value on a ratio scale is non-arbitrary. Most physical quantities, such as mass, length or energy are measured on ratio scales; so is temperature when it is measured in kelvins, i.e., relative to absolute zero. The central tendency of a distribution an variable measured at the interval level can be represented by its mode, its median, its arithmetic mean, or its geometric mean; however as with an interval scale, the arithmetic mean will give the most useful information. Variables measured at the interval level are referred to as ratio variables.

Interval and/or ratio measurement are sometimes referred to as &quot;true measurement&quot;, though this usage reflects a lack of understanding of the uses of ordinal measurement. However, it is only quantities measured on ratio scales that can correctly be said to have units of measurement.

== Continuous and Discrete ==

Continuous variables are those variables that have theoretically an infinite number of gradations between two measurements. For example, body weight of individuals, milk yield of cows or buffaloes etc. Most of the variables in biology are of continuous type. Discrete variables, on the other hand, do not have continuous gradations but there is a definite gap between two measurements, i.e. they can not be measured in fractions. For example, number of eggs laid by hens, number of children in a family etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

Most commonly used measure of central tendency. 

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{x} = \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

'''Wikipedia article:''' [[Wikipedia:Arithmetic mean|Arithmetic mean]]

== Usages ==

* The mean may be conceived of as an estimate of the median. When the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median, the set of numbers, or frequency distribution, is said to be skewed.

* The arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by outliers. For instance, reporting the &quot;average&quot; annual income in Redmond, Washington as the arithmetic mean of all annual incomes would yield a surprisingly high number because of Bill Gates. These distortions occur when the mean is different from the median, and the median is a superior alternative when that happens.

* In certain situations, the arithmetic mean is the wrong concept of &quot;average&quot; altogether. For example, if a stock rose 10% in the first year, 30% in the second year and fell 10% in the third year, then it would be incorrect to report its &quot;average&quot; increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean (10% + 30% + (&amp;minus;10%))/3 = 10%; the correct average in this case is the geometric mean which yields an average increase per year of only 8.8%.

== Distributions ==

*Include standard values for common distributions, if they exist. For example, a normal distribution always has a skew and kurtosis of zero.
*Include standard error for normal distribution, and for other distributions also if possible.

For a normal distribution, the standard error of the mean is:

:&amp;sigma;&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;sigma; / sqrt(N)

*Sampling distribution.

== Calculation ==

''Include any alternative methods of calculation, especially for large data sets, or when other measures have already been calculated.''

== Software ==



=== Microsoft Excel ===

It is relatively easy to determine the arithmetic mean, or average, in Microsoft Excel (v. '97, 2000, 2002/XP) by using a simple equation. Follow these steps to determine the mean in Excel for a set of data:

# Highlight an empty cell in the worksheet in which the mean will be calculated.
# Assuming that there are ten data points in cells A1 through A10, the following equation could be typed in the empty cell: &quot;=AVERAGE(A1:A10)&quot;. Alternatively, this equation can also accept arguments in the form: &quot;=AVERAGE(A1,A2,A3,...,A10)&quot;

Refer to Microsoft Excels application documentation for further help.

=== Minitab ===
In Minitab (v. 14), finding the arithmetic mean is as simple as choosing options from the menu to display several descriptive statistics at once, including the arithmetic mean. Assuming again that there are ten valid data points in column C1, follow the steps below to display the mean:

# Go to the Menu bar at the top of the Minitab application and choose the following options: Stat -&gt; Basic Statistics -&gt; Display Descriptive Statistics...
# In the box labeled &quot;Variables:&quot; on the right hand side of the dialog box that appears, type &quot;C1&quot; and then click on the &quot;OK&quot; button in the bottom center of the dialog box. The mean will then be displayed in addition to other useful statistics in the 'Session' window of Minitab.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Description ==

*Brief description of what it is and what its used for.
*Mathematical formula
*Link to a Wikipedia article on it.

== Usages ==

Describe in detail here data sets and purposes on which it is most useful. Describe also data sets for which it may give misleading results.

== Distributions ==

*Include standard values for common distributions, if they exist. For example, a normal distribution always has a skew and kurtosis of zero.
*Include standard error for normal distribution, and for other distributions also if possible.
*Sampling distribution.

== Calculation ==

A formula for calculating the variance &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of a population of size ''N'' is:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \mu)^2 = \frac 1N\sum_{i=1}^N x_i^2 - \mu^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac 1N \sum_{i=1}^N x_i&lt;/math&gt;

stands for the population mean.

A formula for calculating the sample variance s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the unbiased estimation of the population variance, from a sample of size ''n'', is:
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \frac 1{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - n \bar{x}^2}{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = \frac 1n \sum_{i=1}^n x_i&lt;/math&gt;

stands for the sample mean.

===Algorithms===

====Algorithm====

Therefore a simple algorithm to calculate variance can be described by the following [[pseudocode]]: 
&lt;pre&gt;double sum;
double sum_sqr;
double variance;
long n = data.length; // the number of elements in the data array (the actual syntax is language-specific)

for i = 0 to n
 sum += data[i];
 sum_sqr += ( data[i] * data[i] );
end for

variance = ((n * sum_sqr) - (sum * sum))/(n*(n-1));
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Algorithm ====

Another algorithm which avoids large numbers in sum_sqr while summing up
&lt;pre&gt;double avg;
double var;
long n = data.length; // number of elements

for i = 0 to n
 avg = (avg*i + data[i]) / (i + 1);
 if (i &gt; 0) var += (var * (i - 1) + (data[i] - avg)*(data[i] - avg)) / i;
end for

return var; // resulting variance
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Another Algorithm ====

'corrected two pass algorithm' of Chan, Golub, Leveque (American Statistician, 1983, page 242):
&lt;pre&gt;
 avg=0
 for all i
   avg=avg+data[i]
 end for
 avg=avg/n

 sum=0
 sum2=0
 for all i
    sum2=sum2+(data[i]-avg)^2
    sum=sum+(data[i]-avg)
 end for
 var=(sum2-sum/n)/(n-1)

 return var
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Analysis of Algorithms ===

It is important, when dealing with large data sets or large numbers, on computers, to choose an algorithm which minimizes error due to approximate calculations by the computer. ''Merge in below discussion of the above algorithms.''

It is actually the first formula that has precision problems when dealing with limited-precision arithmetic.  If the difference between measurements and the mean is very small, then the first formula will yield precision problems, as information will be lost in the (x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - µ) operation.  There is no such loss of significance in the intermediate operations of the second formula. 

In fact, the second formula is the one more commonly beset with problems.  The first can have problems when the mean is very large relative to the variance, but this is relatively rare in practice and this problem also affects the second formula.  Much more common is the situation where you have comparable mean and variance and a very large number of observations.  In this case, the second formula will result in the subtraction of two very large numbers whose difference is relatively small (by a factor roughly equal to the number of observations).  If you have one million observations, you lose roughly six significant figures with the second formula if you use ordinary floating point arithmetic. 

The problem may occur
#when the deviations are very small relative to the mean or 
#when they are small relative to the representational capacity of the arithmetic instrument (floating point computer, fixed point calculator, paper and pencil). 
To be precise we have to specify the instrument and the nature of the data.

What do you mean by ordinary floating point arithmetic?  Are talking 
about precision with respect to register width, or is there an implicit 
reference to some &quot;non-ordinary&quot; scheme, that is, non-IEEE?   Thanks. I thought the reference was pretty explicit.  I didn't mean, however, to imply the use of non-standard but still floating point arithmetic.  I had in mind systems that were entirely different.  A simple example is a system that uses rationals based on unlimited precision integers.  Another system might be fixed point arithmetic.  The first would not lose precision in the computation while the second would lose more or less precision than I quote depending on the values in question and the characteristics of the fixed point system.  You could also imagine an optimizer that noted that you might be adding up large numbers of very small numbers and would re-order the addition to avoid most of the round-off error by using log N temporary values to perform the addition.

== Software ==

Include how it is accessed in common statistical packages, if known.
Can also provide links to source code samples for calculating it, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==

You should bear in mind that there are many variables that can affect the outcome of your assessment.  The following is a (by no means exhaustive) list of possible factors influencing the patient (and condition) at the time of the session:

* Time of day (are they tired after work or feeling fresh in the morning)
* Temperature (extremes of hot and cold affect pain and stiffness)
* Position (if sitting relieves their pain and they sit down for 20 minutes, it may have disappeared by the time you try to assess it)
* Demeanour (if you’re abrupt with them, they won’t be very open with you)

The list goes on and on and it’s something that you’ll probably only begin to take note of as you gain experience.  For now, just be aware that there’s more to the overall picture than what the patient says.  Try to take notice of their body language as well as their verbal replies.

It’s important to make the patient feel as comfortable and relaxed as possible, as this will have a direct bearing on how open they are in discussing the problem with you.  Remember, you’re probably going to ask them to remove at least a few items of clothing and to get into positions that in any other circumstances would be highly inappropriate.  Think carefully about what you’re saying, as while it may be technically correct to say to the patient, “Take off your pants and bend over” when assessing the range of lumbar flexion, it may not be socially acceptable.

Use the subjective assessment as a period in which to make the patient feel calm and to try and create an atmosphere of trust.

Your assessment will almost always fall into 2 categories; the subjective and objective assessment.  The subjective assessment, or interview, is used to try and work out the nature and cause of the patient’s symptoms.  A good clinician will be able to get a very good idea of what’s going on just by speaking to the patient.  The objective assessment is used both to eliminate other possible causes as well as to verify the hypothesis formed during the interview.

=== Personal details ===
Many outpatient settings will have their own forms for clinical notes.  These differ greatly in layout but will always follow a similar sequence.  The top of the form is usually reserved for the patient’s personal information, which is important to gather for the purposes of records.  It usually consists of the following:

* Name and Surname
* Date of birth
* Telephone number
* Address
* Date of referral
* Date of first appointment
* Referring doctor/consultant/physiotherapist
* There may be other information gathered, like medical chart number (if you're in a hospital setting), sex (‘male’ or ‘female’, not ‘often’), occupation and hobbies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Subjective assessment ==
''Note: While the subjective assessment is examined in detail in this chapter, the objective assessment will be dealt with separately in each following chapter, as they will all be slightly different depending on the type of condition being assessed.  Therefore, each chapter after this one will actually be an objective assessment of that type of condition i.e. the chapter on Respiratory assessments is actually a description of the objective assessment performed on a respiratory patient.''

=== Observation ===
Without saying a word, you could start picking information from the patient from the very first moment. 
This begins as soon as you see the patient in the waiting area and continues until they leave your company.  Everything they do is a potential clue to their problem.  Take note of how they’re sitting (or are they standing?).  Do they look like they’re in pain?  When they stand up, is it a struggle, or effortless?  Watch them walk to the cubicle, do they limp, do they favour one side, are they steady on their feet?  If they have to undress, watch them closely.  If they’re saying they can’t lift up their arm and yet remove a T-shirt with no apparent discomfort, are they faking it (if it’s a medico-legal issue) or are they just having a pain-free day?

=== History of the Present Condition (Main problem) ===
You might begin your session (after taking details) with the following question, or one like it.  “What seems to be the problem?”  While this could elicit many responses, people will usually tell you what it is in terms of a functional deficit i.e. they’ll tell you what they can’t do, or name an activity that causes pain.  You can’t expect a patient to reply, &quot;Well Bob, I seem to have torn my left rotator cuff in what I think was a hyperextension injury.&quot;  It’ll more than likely be something along the lines of, &quot;It hurts when I sit for a long time&quot;, or &quot;I can’t walk as far as I used to&quot;, or &quot;My neck hurts when I type&quot;.  You may occasionally get a response like: &quot;My cow pushed me up against the wall&quot;, as I did when I treated a farmer with rib fractures.  My first thought was that this guy had a ''very'' different approach to looking after his animals than more conventional farmers.

It’s part of your ability as a clinician to interpret these answers.  As you gain experience you’ll start doing it subconsciously, but in the beginning it may take some effort.  You’ll need to break the activities down into the likely actions/postures involved (are they sitting, standing, bending over, rotating, extending, jumping, running, etc.), analyse the functional muscle groups (what’s contracting, what’s relaxing?), think about the structures under duress (ligaments and tendons being strained) and figure out the potential causes (traumatic injury, arthritis, ‘wear and tear’, poor posture, fracture, etc.).

=== Body chart ===
[[Image:Body_chart.jpg|frame|Body chart in the anatomical position]]
The main problem is usually recorded on a body chart, all which have similar features and all are similarly asexual.  The chart on the right is a more or less standard view of one.  It shows an anterior and posterior view of the body (some charts have left and right views as well) and shows it in the anatomical position.  It is the ideal place to reflect the description and relationship of symptoms. You could qualify them as following: nature, depth, frequency and impact. If the symptom is pain, you could add the VAS/NRPS grade.
Some departments will have their own symbols for describing pain, stiffness, acute, chronic, whether it radiates, etc.

=== Behaviour of symptoms ===
A Typical 24-hour pattern;
What aggravates it;
What eases it;
Any particular activities that bring on symptoms

=== Past Medical History (PMH) ===
It’s important to have a good understanding of the patient’s history at this point.  You need to know whether this kind of thing happens often.  Is it long-standing (chronic) or is it a recent thing?

=== Social/Family History (SH/FH) ===
FAMILY HISTORY: to rule out whether the pathological condition is due to hereditary transmission,example:diabetes also it can out the relationship with others

=== Past surgical history (PSH) ===
Have they had recent surgery that might give a clue to an underlying problem?  If a patient has had a spinal fusion 6 months ago, and is now complaining of back pain, might the two be related?

=== Special questions ===
* General health&lt;br /&gt;
* Operations&lt;br /&gt;
* Weight loss&lt;br /&gt;
* Drugs (steroids, anticoagulants)&lt;br /&gt;
* Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)&lt;br /&gt;
* Osteoporosis&lt;br /&gt;
* Diabetes&lt;br /&gt;
* Spinal cord/Cauda equina symptoms&lt;br /&gt;
* Dizziness&lt;br /&gt;
* X-rays&lt;br /&gt;
* Working environment&lt;br /&gt;
* Constant or night pain&lt;br /&gt;

=== Life impact ===
What is the effect of the problem on their activities of daily living (Basic DLA, DLA and Participation):
- Personal care
- Home management 
- Social life and hobbies 
- Work

[[Image:Congruent triangles.svg|thumb|Triangle congruency.]]
'''Side-Side-Side (SSS) (Postulate 12) '''
If three sides of one triangle are congruent to three sides of a second triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

'''Side-Angle-Side (SAS) (Postulate 13) '''

If two sides and the included angle of a second triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

'''Angle-Side-Angle''''''  (ASA)'''

If two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the included side of a second triangle, then two triangles are congruent.

'''Angle-Angle-Side''''''  (AAS)'''

If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to two angles and the corresponding non-included side of a second triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

'''NO -  Angle-Side-Side (ASS)'''

&lt;u&gt;The &quot;ASS&quot; postulate does not work&lt;/u&gt;, unlike the other ones.  A way that students can remember this is that &quot;ass&quot; is not a nice word, so we don't use it in geometry (since it does not work).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Boolean logic symbolically represents relationships between entities. There are three Boolean operators:

'''[[../AND-default|AND]]'''
Use the AND operator to retrieve a set in which each citation contains all the search terms. This operator places no condition on where the terms are found in relation to one another; the terms simply have to appear somewhere in the same citation.

'''[[../OR-OR|OR]]'''
Use the OR operator to retrieve documents that contain at least one of the specified search terms.

Use OR when you want to pull together articles on similar subjects.

'''[[../NOT-negative|NOT]]'''
Use the NOT operator to exclude the retrieval of terms from your search.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book consists of a set of short tutorials on making period armour and chain mail.  We refer to items that are in or out of period in the context of which re-creation group we belong to.  In the case of the armours presented here, the operational time span is that of the Society for Creative Anachronism, or the SCA.  The 'uptime' cut-off date is 1600 CE, as the defining documents for the Society mandate a 'pre-16th century' mode of dress, etc.  We allow a bit of leeway to include the years up to the death of Elizabeth I, at 1603 CE.  The 'downtime' date(s) are a favourite argument topic; a rough estimate is 400 CE to 500 CE

Hello.  My nick is publunch.  If you go to my [http://www.publunch.plus.com home page] you might discover what my real name and my email address is.  You might also find an old c.v./resume lying about.  You'll see that I've been educated here and there.  My certificates tell me that I'm supposed to know something about philosophy and one or two other things as well.  When I got too old to be a perpetual student I got admitted to a mental hospital, but I haven't updated my c.v. since that happened.  Generally people leave me alone these days, which means I may have time to make one or two minor contributions to wikipedia, wikiversity and so on, and might actually do me some good as well as benefitting other people.


21st March 2005

I haven't being doing much here, but I am still alive.  I've been reading stuff about animal welfare and rights.  I do a little bit of work for Compassion in World Farming.  Indeed this seems to be taking up more and more time, so I have less time to work here.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Buddha expressed his philosophy when he said: &quot;''I teach only two things, O disciples, the nature of suffering and the cessation of suffering.''&quot;

Buddha taught the famous &quot;Four Noble Truths&quot; and &quot;Eightfold Path,&quot; which allows people to achieve '''enlightenment'''.  Enlightenment (nirvana, awakening, realization, satori) is the cessation of suffering, freedom from conditioned existence ('''samsara'''). Buddha taught that every action has a consequence; things are because of previous conditions.  If one practices the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path, then one will no longer be subject to the cycle of existence '''samsara'''.

    &quot;My teaching is not a philosophy. It is the result of direct experience...
    My teaching is a means of practice, not something to hold onto or worship.
    My teaching is like a raft used to cross the river.
    Only a fool would carry the raft around after he had already reached the other shore of liberation.&quot;

To his favourite disciple, Ananda, the Buddha once said (from: Old Path, White Clouds by Thich Nath Hanh):

==Three Marks of Existence==
#'''Annica''' - Everything is subject to change.
#'''Dukkha''' - All pervasive unsatisfactoriness.
#'''Anatta''' - Everything is empty of a separate self.

==Four Noble Truths==
#'''Dukkha'''   - Life is unsatisfactory, disjointed, suffering.
#'''Samudaya''' - There is a cause of suffering, which is attachment or desire (tanha).
#'''Nirodha'''  - There is a cessation of suffering, which is to eliminate attachment and desire.
#'''Marga'''    - The path that leads out of suffering is called the Noble Eightfold Path.

Buddha taught that in order to realize enlightenment, man must free himself from his ego, and give up all desires.  Buddha taught that by having so many desires (such as wanting pleasure, wealth, happiness, security, success, long life, etc.), man condemns himself to suffering, and will never escape the cycle of rebirths.

Therefore Buddhism believes that suffering is self-created.

==The Eightfold Path==
=== Wisdom - Prajna ===

1. Right Understanding (or ''Right View'', or ''Right Perspective'')

&quot;And what, monks, is right understanding? Knowledge with regard to dukkha, knowledge with regard to the origination of dukkha, knowledge with regard to the stopping of dukkha, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the stopping of dukkha: This, monks, is called right understanding.

2. Right Thought (or ''Right Intention'', or ''Right Resolve'')

&quot;And what is right thought? Being resolved on renunciation, on freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right thought.

=== Morality - Sila ===

3. Right Speech

&quot;And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from abusive speech, abstaining from idle chatter: This, monks, is called right speech.

4. Right Action

&quot;And what, monks, is right action? Abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity: This, monks, is called right action. 

5. Right Livelihood

&quot;And what, monks, is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood: This, monks, is called right livelihood.

=== Concentration - Samadhi ===

6. Right Effort (or ''Right Endeavour'')

&quot;And what, monks, is right effort? '''(i)''' There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. '''(ii)''' He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen. '''(iii)''' He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen. '''(iv)''' He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: This, monks, is called right effort. 

7. Right Mindfulness

&quot;And what, monks, is right mindfulness? '''(i)''' There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. '''(ii)''' He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. '''(iii)''' He remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. '''(iv)''' He remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves -- ardent, aware, &amp; mindful -- putting away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. This, monks, is called right mindfulness. 

8. Right Concentration

&quot;And what, monks, is right concentration? '''(i)''' There is the case where a monk -- quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities -- enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. '''(ii)''' With the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, one-pointedness of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. '''(iii)''' With the fading of rapture, he remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; fully aware, and physically sensitive of pleasure. He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' '''(iv)''' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress -- he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This, monks, is called right concentration.&quot;

==Buddhism's world view==
Buddha taught that beings were born into their position because of past karma.  He taught that there were six realms of existence: hell, insatiable-spirit, animal, fighting-spirits, human and heavenly-being.  A human birth was most desired because you have the best chance of enlightenment.

==Summary==
*Life is ''dukha'' (suffering)
*Karma: Cause-effect relationship.
*Enlightenment: Escape from samsara.
*Everything is marked by suffering, change and emptiness.
* The following quote by Buddha summarizes many of his beliefs&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;:
:On ignorance depends karma;
:On karma depends consciousness;
:On consciousness depend name and form;
:On name and form depend the six organs of sense;
:On the six organs of sense depends contact;
:On contact depends sensation;
:On sensation depends desire;
:On desire depends attachment;
:On attachment depends existence;
:On existence depends birth;
:On birth depends old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, misery, grief, and despair.

I just rewrote the page.  As such an archived the previous discussions relating to the old page. There is a lot left to be added, specifically there should be a rather lengthy problems section.  I am now thinking that order of operations should wait until its own section?  We shall see. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 08:57, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

==Natural numbers==
A recent edit changed &quot;whole numbers&quot; to &quot;natural numbers&quot; in a few places.  This made sense because the text then gave as examples of whole numbers 1, 2, 3, … etc. I really wanted to stick with the term &quot;whole&quot; because I felt is was a bit more familiar, and I wanted to keep the terminology friendly at least until the formal definitions that come later in [[Algebra/Sets|Sets]].

==Set notation==
Hi I was hoping to remove the symbols { and } from the paragraph here.  I wanted to avoid using set notation until after it is introduced section on sets a bit later on in the book. As the students I taught often don't understand what the notation means.  I also was  hoping to change leading sentence in Evaluating expressions to emphasize the idea that &quot;variables ''are'' numbers&quot;.  But I wanted to make sure there were no objections.

== Editorial Opinions Welcome ==
I have no objection to any changes you want to make to the Algebra book.

I am currently working my way through it trying to make it &quot;more conversational&quot; while still keeping the rigor.  The set notation is probably a style remnant from initializing arrays.  [[User:Nfgdayton|Nfgdayton]] ([[User talk:Nfgdayton|talk]]) 19:30, 15 July 2010 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">If one indexes the sequence from t, then the function for each term is trivially
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1\ \mathrm{if}\ n &gt; t \\ 0\ \mathrm{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Because this is the end of the easy sequences, you get something a bit more tricky - another solution:

:&lt;math&gt;a_n = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1\ \mathrm{if}\ n &lt; t \\ 1\ \mathrm{if}\ t &lt; n &lt; t + 7  \\ 1\ \mathrm{if}\ t + 7 &lt; n \\ 0\ \mathrm{otherwise} \end{matrix}\right.&lt;/math&gt;

Part of what mathematicians do is look for patterns.  But be warned, just because it *looks* like it's doing something doesn't mean it's going to keep doing it forever!  Showing that something does actually follow a pattern is some of what mathematicians spend their time on.  But don't worry about that now, go look at some more sequences!

----

A bit too trivial for my liking, what about

&lt;math&gt;a_n = (n + 4)\ \mathbf{div}\ 6&lt;/math&gt;

resulting in 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, '''2, 2, 2, 2...'''

----
What about any of these?

&lt;math&gt;a_n = (n + k)\ \mathbf{div}\ (k+2)&lt;/math&gt; with k &gt;= 4

The sequence wasn´t supposed to necessarily change from 1 to 2 exactly after the ellipsis (&quot;...&quot;).

----
another solution:
&lt;math&gt;a_n = (k*f(n))\ \mathbf{div}\ f(n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k \in \ ]1,2[&lt;/math&gt;

f(n) = f(n-1) ! for n &gt; 1

'''Rissoles''' (ris·sole) is an extremely popular traditional Australian dish, similar to the American meatloaf.

== Ingredients ==
*1 kilogram of regular grade [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] mince (ground beef)
*1/2 cup of [[Cookbook:Breadcrumbs|breadcrumbs]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*Gravy powder or [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*various [[Cookbook:Herb|herbs]]

== Procedure ==
# Place beef mince in mixing bowl with eggs, breadcrumbs and your favourite meat herbs and seasonings.
# Mix thoroughly. When fully mixed, remove one handful and mould into a the shape of a very thick hamburger patty.
# Roll the rissole in either flour or gravy powder (depending on your preferences).
# Cook in the oven, on a BBQ, or in a frying pan on a medium level of heat until cooked through and outer layer is crunchy.

Serve with vegetables, hot chips, salad or by themselves on bread or toast to make rissole burgers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Indications ==

The Null Hypothesis should be an assumption about the difference in the population means for two populations (note that the same quantitative variable must have been measured in each population). The data should consist of two samples of quantitative data (one from each population). The samples must be obtained independently from each other.

== Requirements ==

The samples must be drawn from populations which have known Standard Deviations (or Variances). Also, the measured variable in each population (generically denoted x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) should have a Normal Distribution.

Note that if the distributions of the variables in the populations are non-normal (or unknown), the two-sample z-test can still be used for approximate results, provided the combined sample size (sum of sample sizes) is sufficiently large. Historically, a combined sample size of at least 30 has been considered sufficiently large; reality is (of course) much more complicated, but this rule of thumb is still in use in many textbooks.

== Procedure ==

*The Null Hypothesis:

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;delta;

in which &amp;delta; is the supposed difference in the expected values under the null hypothesis.

*The Alternate Hypothesis:

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; &amp;delta;

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; &amp;delta;

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;ne; &amp;delta;

For more information about the Null and Alternate Hypotheses, see the page on the z test for a single mean.

*The Test Statistic:

:&lt;math&gt;z=\frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - \delta}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma _1^2}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma _2^2}{n_2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the null hypothesis is that the population means are equal; in this case, the formula reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;z= \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma _1^2}{n_1}+\frac{\sigma _2^2}{n_2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the past, the calculations were simpler if the Variances (and thus the Standard Deviations) of the two populations could be assumed equal. This process is called Pooling, and many textbooks still use it, though it is falling out of practice (since computers and calculators have all but removed any computational problems). 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}
{\sigma \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

*The Significance (p-value)

Calculate the probability of observing a value of z (from a Standard Normal Distribution) using the Alternate Hypothesis to indicate the direction in which the area under the Probability Density Function is to be calculated. This is the Attained Significance, or p-value.

Note that some (older) methods first chose a Level Of Significance, which was then translated into a value of z. This made more sense (and was easier!) in the days before computers and graphics calculators.

*Decision

The Attained Significance represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme, or more extreme, than ours&amp;mdash;if the null hypothesis is true.

If the Attained Significance (p-value) is sufficiently low, then this indicates that our test statistic is unusual (rare)&amp;mdash;we usually take this as evidence that the null hypothesis is in error. In this case, we ''reject the null hypothesis.''

If the p-value is large, then this indicates that the test statistic is usual (common)&amp;mdash;we take this as a lack of evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, we ''fail to reject the null hypothesis.''

It is common to use 5% as the dividing line between the common and the unusual; again, reality is more complicated.

== Worked Examples ==

=== Do Professors Make More Money at Larger Universities? ===

Universities and colleges in the United States of America are categorized by the highest degree offered. Type IIA institutions offer a Master's Degree, and type IIB institutions offer a Baccalaureate degree. A professor, looking for a new position, wonders if the salary difference between type IIA and IIB institutions is really significant.

He finds that a random sample of 200 IIA institutions has a mean salary (for full professors) of $54,218.00, with standard deviation $8,450. A random sample of 200 IIB institutions has a mean salary (for full professors) of $46,550.00, with standard deviation $9,500 (assume that the sample standard deviations are in fact the population standard deviations).

Do these data indicate a significantly higher salary at IIA institutions?
----
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference; thus

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(where &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the true mean full professor salary at IIA institutions, and &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the mean at IIB institutions)

He is looking for evidence that IIA institutions have a higher mean salary; thus the alternate hypothesis is 

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;

Since the hypotheses concern means from independent samples (we'll assume that these are independent samples), a two sample test is indicated. The samples are large, and the standard deviations are known (assumed?), so a two sample z-test is appropriate.

:&lt;math&gt;z=\frac{\mu _A -\mu _B}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma _A ^2}{n _A}+\frac{\sigma _B ^2}{n _B}}}=
\frac{54218-46550}{\sqrt{\frac{8450 ^2}{200}+\frac{9500 ^2}{200}}}=
8.5292&lt;/math&gt;

Now we find the area to the right of z = 8.5292 in the Standard Normal Distribution. This can be done with a table of values or software&amp;mdash;I get 0.

If the null hypothesis is true, and there is no difference in the salaries between the two types of institutions, then the probability of obtaining samples where the mean for IIA institutions is at least $7,668 higher than the mean for IIB institutions is essentially zero. This occurs far too rarely to attribute to chance variation; it seems quite unusual. I reject the null hypothesis (at any reasonable level of significance!).

It appears that IIA schools have a significantly higher salary than IIB schools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Null Hypothesis should be an assumption concerning the value of the population mean. The data should consist of a single sample of quantitative data from the population.

== Requirements ==

The sample should be drawn from a population from which the Standard Deviation (or Variance) is known. Also, the measured variable (typically listed as &lt;math&gt;x-\bar x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''sample statistic'') should have a Normal Distribution.

Note that if the distribution of the variable in the population is non-normal (or unknown), the z-test can still be used for approximate results, provided the sample size is sufficiently large. Historically, sample sizes of at least 30 have been considered sufficiently large; reality is (of course) much more complicated, but this rule of thumb is still in use in many textbooks.

If the population Standard Deviation is unknown, then a z-test is typically not appropriate. However, when the sample size is large, the sample standard deviation can be used as an estimate of the population standard deviation, and a z-test can provide approximate results.

== Definitions of Terms ==

:&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; = Population Mean

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; = Population Standard Deviation

:&lt;math&gt;\bar x&lt;/math&gt; = Sample Mean

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\bar x}&lt;/math&gt; = Sample Standard Deviation

:&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = Sample Population

== Procedure ==

*The Null Hypothesis:

This is a statement of ''no change'' or ''no effect;'' often, we are looking for evidence that this statement is ''no longer true.''

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; = &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;

*The Alternate Hypothesis:

This is a statement of inequality; we are looking for evidence that this statement ''is'' true.

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; &amp;lt; &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; &amp;gt; &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; &amp;ne; &amp;mu;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; 

*The Test Statistic:

:&lt;math&gt;z=\frac{\bar x -\mu _0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- perhaps symbols should be explicitly defined --&gt;

*The Significance (p-value)

Calculate the probability of observing a value of z (from a Standard Normal Distribution) using the Alternate Hypothesis to indicate the direction in which the area under the Probability Density Function is to be calculated. This is the Attained Significance, or p-value.

Note that some (older) methods first chose a Level Of Significance, which was then translated into a value of z. This made more sense (and was easier!) in the days before computers and graphics calculators.

*Decision

The Attained Significance represents the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme, or more extreme, than ours - if the null hypothesis is true.

If the Attained Significance (p-value) is sufficiently low, then this indicates that our test statistic is unusual (rare) - we usually take this as evidence that the null hypothesis is in error. In this case, we ''reject the null hypothesis.''

If the p-value is large, then this indicates that the test statistic is usual (common) - we take this as a lack of evidence against the null hypothesis. In this case, we ''fail to reject the null hypothesis.''

It is common to use 5% as the dividing line between the common and the unusual; again, reality is more complicated. Sometimes a lower level of uncertainty must be chosen should the consequences of error results in a decision that can injure or kill people or do great economic harm. We would more likely tolerate a drug that kills 5% of patients with a terminal cancer but cures 95% of all patients, but we would hardly tolerate a cosmetic that disfigures 5% of those who use it.

== Worked Examples ==

=== Are The Kids Above Average? ===

Scores on a certain test of mathematical aptitude have mean &amp;mu; = 50 and standard deviation &amp;sigma; = 10. An amateur researcher believes that the students in his area are brighter than average, and wants to test his theory.

The researcher has obtained a random sample of 45 scores for students in his area. The mean score for this sample is 52.

Does the researcher have evidence to support his belief?

The null hypothesis is that ''there is no difference,'' and that the students in his area are no different than those in the general population; thus,

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; = 50&lt;br /&gt;
(where &amp;mu; represents the mean score for students in his area)

He is looking for evidence that the students in his area are above average; thus, the alternate hypothesis is

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; &gt; 50

Since the hypothesis concerns a single population mean, a z-test is indicated. The sample size is fairly large (greater than 30), and the standard deviation is known, so a z-test is appropriate.

:&lt;math&gt;z=\frac{\bar x -\mu _0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} =\frac{52-50}{10/ \sqrt{45}}=1.3416&lt;/math&gt;

We now find the area under the Normal Distribution to the right of z = 1.3416 (''to the right, since the alternate hypothesis is to the right''). This can be done with a table of values, or software- I get a value of 0.0899.

If the null hypothesis is true (and these students are no better than the general population), then the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 52 or higher is 8.99%. This occurs fairly frequently (using the 5% rule), so it does not seem unusual. I fail to reject the null hypothesis (at the 5% level).

It appears that the evidence ''does not'' support the researcher's belief.

=== Is The Machine Working Correctly? ===

Sue is in charge of Quality Control at a bottling facility. Currently, she is checking the operation of a machine that is supposed to deliver 355 mL of liquid into an aluminum can. If the machine delivers too little, then the local Regulatory Agency may fine the company. If the 
machine delivers too much, then the company may lose money. For these reasons, Sue is looking for any evidence that the amount delivered by the machine is different from 355 mL.

During her investigation, Sue obtains a random sample of 10 cans, and measures the following volumes:

:355.02 355.47 353.01 355.93 356.66 355.98 353.74 354.96 353.81 355.79

The machine's specifications claim that the amount of liquid delivered varies according to a normal distribution, with mean &amp;mu; = 355 mL and standard deviation &amp;sigma; = 0.05 mL.

Do the data suggest that the machine is operating correctly?

The null hypothesis is that the machine is operating according to its specifications; thus

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; = 355&lt;br /&gt;
(where &amp;mu; is the mean volume delivered by the machine)

Sue is looking for evidence of ''any'' difference; thus, the alternate hypothesis is

:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; : &amp;mu; &amp;ne; 355

Since the hypothesis concerns a single population mean, a z-test is indicated. The population follows a normal distribution, and the standard deviation is known, so a z-test is appropriate.

In order to calculate the test statistic (z), we must first find the sample mean from the data. Use a calculator or computer to find that &lt;math&gt;\bar x = 355.037&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;z=\frac{\bar x -\mu _0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} =\frac{355.037-355}{0.05/ \sqrt{10}}=2.34&lt;/math&gt;

The calculation of the p-value will be a little different. If we only find the area under the normal curve ''above'' z = 2.34, then we have found the probability of obtaining a sample mean of 355.037 or ''higher''&amp;mdash;what about the probability of obtaining a low value?

In the case that the alternate hypothesis uses &amp;ne;, the p-value is found by ''doubling the tail area''&amp;mdash;in this case, we double the area above z = 2.34.

The area above z = 2.34 is 0.0096; thus, the p-value for this test is 0.0192.

If the machine is delivering 355 mL, then the probability of obtaining a sample mean this far (0.037 mL) or farther from 355 mL is 0.0096, or 0.96%. This is pretty rare; I'll reject the null hypothesis.

It appears that the machine is not working correctly.

N.B.: since the alternate hypothesis is &amp;ne;, we cannot conclude that the machine is delivering ''more'' than 355 mL&amp;mdash;we can only say that the amount is ''different'' from 355 mL.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, content of this page is fair enough.  I can't see why it is put under the broader title 'ethics' however.  Like Sartre's ''Being and Nothingness'', which I consider to be one of the core texts of existentialism, has the subtitle
''An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology''.  If no-one objects, I might soon move this page to a different chapter of the textbook.

It's worth noting that most existentialists - including Sartre who first coined the term - would reject that they were part of a 'movement'. Kierkegaard didn't call himself an existentialist, and it wasn't until the 20th Century that people used that term in reference to him. - Tom M

&quot;Apathy&quot; is a misnomer as used in &quot;One existentialist feeling is nausea, another is apathy.&quot;  Existentialism might seem at first to condone a nihilistic lifestyle, but an apathetic existentialist is failing to be an existentialist.  --[[User:Mute.prophet|Mute.prophet]] 12:18, 4 December 2007 (UTC)

I thought that &quot;Nothing is real, all is permissible&quot; was originally attributed (falsely) as the last words of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_I_Sabbah Hassan-i Sabbah] by a historian of the period.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I have revised the chapter.  A few comments:

-Overall the chapter is a lot to swallow.  Some of the parsers are based off Java code, some are based off of .NET, and one is bassed off of Tcl, a language I have never seen before.  Maybe we should focus on a few parsers that are relavent to our class.

-This chapter lacks diagrams, maybe a diagram to show the relationship between xml files, parsers, and 'client applications'.

-The example given is based of movies rather than tourguide.  Hopefully this could stay this way because I still don't really understand the exact mechanics of how parsers work and the possibility of me incorrectly changing the examples are extremely high.

Viji - 3/8/06

* I think that just focusing on Java is best (therefore eliminating the .net and all other languages)

* The examples should in some way be related to the Tourism example.  If you are to teach this chapter to the class it will be an excellent way for you to prepare by creating your own example.  Remember that Dr. Watson is an excellent resource and that you can ask him for help.

Thanks, viji


Christina - 3/8/06

Good feedback, Andy. You're right--this chapter is quite a bit to swallow.

* I concur with Viji's comment about the Java focus and tourism example.

* Modify the chapter learning objectives to match your plan for the narrowed focus of the chapter.

* You should verify comments about previous chapters. The Java parsing content has been removed from those chapters, so references to Java parsing in past chapters should be removed.

* It may be worth looking at the history of the beginning chapters to review the Java parsing content that used to exist in those chapters.

* Definitely follow the checklist. I tried to use the checklist for this chapter, and I could only check off a few of the many author guidelines in the checklist.

= Professor =
I agree with the focus on Java and the addition of some diagram. Move the other material to an appendix for this chapter. A tourism example should not be hard to create.
Remember to follow the guidelines and the checklist.
Check that the code works and for class create a problem for students to parse a given xml file. They should be able to modify the sample code.

un tractor cuesta $120,000 cada año se devalua en 8% de su precio original. Encuentre la fôrmula para el valor (V) de la maquina en (T)años.


'''¿Que proponen?'''?
Encontrar la formula para el valor (V) de la maquina en (T) años.


'''¿Que nos dan?'''
El valor de el tractor $120,000 y el porcentage 8%con el cual se devalua cada año de su precio original.


'''Solucion'''

I=valor en que se devalua 
P=precio del tractor
R=% de devaluacion                     


&lt;math&gt;I=P(R/100)&lt;/math&gt;


La sucesiôn de valores es:
&lt;math&gt;P, P-I, P-2I, P-3I, P-4I,....&lt;/math&gt;


Despues de t años el valor esta dado por

&lt;math&gt;V(t)=P-t*I&lt;/math&gt;

en este caso:&lt;math&gt;P=120,000 Y R=8%&lt;/math&gt;
             

&lt;math&gt;I=P(R/100)&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow\I=120,000(8/1000)=9600&lt;/math&gt;


Despues de t años, el valor total devaluado sera

&lt;math&gt;t*I=9600T&lt;/math&gt;, por lo tanto &lt;math&gt;V(t)=p-tI=120,000-9600t&lt;/math&gt;

=&lt;math&gt;V(t)=120,000-9600t&lt;/math&gt;



'''EJERCICIO 11 (Si no es compuesta)'''
Si la devaluacion de tractor no es de su precio original sin no apartir de la precio anterior despues de insertarle la devaluacion.


Se devalua 8% o vale 92% cada año.
¿porque?
&lt;math&gt;100-8%=92%&lt;/math&gt;

Que nos dan?

a=valor inicial=120,000
r=valor cada año =23/25
t=tiempo en años
&lt;math&gt;92/100=46/50=23/25&lt;/math&gt; (se simplifica)


&lt;math&gt;23/25 de 120,000 &lt;/math&gt; es el valor de la maquina al termino de un año.

&lt;math&gt;23/25 de 120,000=120,000*(23/25)&lt;/math&gt;


Al segundo año &lt;math&gt;=120,000(23/25)^2&lt;/math&gt;


=&lt;math&gt;V(t)=a*r^t-1 \Rightarrow\V(t)=120,000(23/25)^t-1&lt;/m

&lt;math&gt;(/cup/_{i=0) ^n  A_i)'=/cap/_{i=0} ^n  A_i&lt;/math&gt;

'''Demostrar para el primer caso:'''









suponiendo valido para n=k

&lt;math&gt;(/cap/_{i=1} ^k  A_i)'=/CUP/_{i=1}^k  A__i&lt;/math&gt; H.I



debo demostrar, usando HI que:
&lt;math&gt;(/cap/_{i=1} ^k A_i)'=(/cup/_{i=1} ^{k+1} A_i)'&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(/cap/_{i=1} ^{k+1} A_i)=/cup/_{i=1} ^{k+1} A_i&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;(/cap/_{i=1} ^k  A_i) /cap/ A_{k+1}'= /cup/_{i=1} ^k  A_i /cup/ A^1 _{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;


















'''Ejercio 3.24'''

Demostrar que la suma de los &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; primeros numeros impares es &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;


Que es una sucession?

Por ejemplo la sucession dada por la suma de los #'s impares:


&lt;math&gt;s=1+3+5+7...2n-1&lt;/math&gt; 



Tiene la propiedad comutativa:

&lt;math&gt;s=2n-1......5+3+1&lt;/math&gt;


Al sumar las dos expresiones anteriores 

&lt;math&gt;s=1+3+5.....2n-1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;s=2n-1....5+3+1&lt;/math&gt;

tendremos &lt;math&gt;2s=(2n-1)+1&lt;/math&gt;
 
se puede escribir de esta manera:&lt;math&gt;2s=[(2n-1)+1]n&lt;/math&gt;


despejando &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math%&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">At one time the general view in some religious societies was that people had souls, which, when they died went to heaven or hell, or else were reborn.  The soul was considered the essential core of what a person was.  This idea is perhaps less fashionable now, but it forms the basis of most religious beliefs.  This belief in the separation of mind and body is known today as dualism.

Current scientific thought tends toward the alternate view: monism.  Bodies are viewed as complex biological entities responsible for all behaviors and thought processes they express.  Since no evidence for a soul exists, only the physical entity remains for consideration.  To say that X now and Y then are the same person is to say that there is bodily spatio-temporal continuity between them.

The question of personal identity, which was first raised by Locke and later expanded on by Leibniz, would at first seem trivial in nature.  When looking at a person or an object one can easily trace that person throughout his life.  If I place a pen behind my back and then pull it back out again it is obviously the same pen.  Problems arise when we discuss cases where this is not so straightforward.  

Let us return to the example of the person; from the time you are born to the time you die you change a large portion of the matter in your body, are you then the same person?  A tree that grows from a nut shares the same thing in common throughout its entire life, mainly its origin, however is it always the same 'tree?' How about when it is just a nut, or firewood behind my house.  When does an object cease to be an object and become a different object?

Perhaps the most famous historical example comes from the ship of Theseus.  The ship of Theseus has 100 parts to it, and within the hold are contained 100 replacement parts.  The ship sets sail on a voyage and on the first day out the captain discovers there is a problem with a piece of the boat so he replaces it with the one in the hold.  The next thing happens on the next day, and the next, etc.  At the end of 100 days the ship returns to port with every piece of it having been exchanged with its correlating piece in the hold.  Is the ship the same ship?  What if the captain emptied the hold and built a new ship with the parts that were originally the ship of Theseus, would those be the ship of Theseus or would it be the ship he sailed into port with?

Concerning personal identity at what point does a person cease to be a person?  If your arm is chopped off are you still a person, still the same person?  What do I need to remove in order to take away your personhood? 

The question of what makes a person is charged with all types of implications.  For example, is an unborn human a &quot;person?&quot;  Ask a pro-lifer and you will likely get one answer; conversely, ask someone from Planned Parenthood and you will almost inevitably get another.  If an unborn human is a &quot;person,&quot; at what point does it become recognizable as a person? Is it, perhaps, implicit in the being? What, then, differentiates between an unborn human from an unborn chicken? Both contain similar levels of sentience at the time, it would seem. Many questions like these are raised no matter which definition of personhood is used.

==Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person==
Harry Frankfurt (1929- ), wrote, &quot;[The criteria for being a person] are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.&quot; In philosophy, &quot;what is a person?&quot; is not a question of biology, but a question of other attributes. Harry Frankfurt says that one of those attributes is the structure of the will.

Within the Free-will Debate, there are three main schools of thought: Hard Determinism, Soft Determinism and Libertarianism. These schools are divided over two issues, Determinism vs. Indeterminism and Compatibilism vs Inompatibilism. In the terms of the free will debate, determinism is the view that the decision-making parts of the human brain are not fundamentally random, whereas indeterminism is the view that those decision-making parts of the brain are fundamentally random. Compatibilism holds that humans can make free-willed decisions even if our decision systems are not random, while incompatibilism holds that we can only have free will if our decision processes are random.

The debate is complicated by the fact that some writers use the term &quot;determinism&quot; interchangably with &quot;hard-determinism.&quot; Determinism is a condition of a group of object (a &quot;system&quot;) such that its state at time t-0 determines its state at time t-1, t-1 being the moment in time that comes immediately after t-0. A determinist about free will believes that the decision making system in the human brain is just such a system. A hard-determinist believes this and one other thing, namely, that the fact that someone's decisions are determined (by their desires and so on) somehow means that they do not have free will. Thus it is important to carefully distinguish between these two terms, and to remember that a person who believes in determinism is not necessarily a person who disbelieves in free will.

Another complication stems from the fact that some writers believe that lack of determinism (&quot;indeterminism&quot;) is a fundamental randomness in which the state of something at time t-0 does not determine the state, or even the existence of that thing at t-1, thus making control impossible, while other writers believe that indeterministically brained human beings can still control what they do at t-1, even if their brain states at t-1 have absolutely no relationship to their immediately preceding t-0 brain states. (Writers who hold the former view tend to be soft determinists, while libertarians seem to tend to take the latter view. Hard determinists can take either view.)

Incompatibilists argue that in order for a person to have free will, under all of the same conditions, it must be the case that one would follow different courses of action. For example, let us imagine I go to the ice cream store wanting chocolate ice cream. With all of my inner states and psychological states and every condition remaining the same, it must be the case that I would order EITHER the chocolate OR the Neapolitan, in order to have free-will. For instance, if it is the case that I love chocolate and hate Neapolitan, me ordering chocolate because I wanted chocolate ice cream would not be a free-willed action because it was determined by the fact I wanted chocolate ice cream. Incompatibilists argue that I could only have free will if me going into the ice cream store wanting chocolate and hating Neapolitan could result in me ordering Neapolitan even though I wanted chocolate and hate Neapolitan.

In contrast, compatibilists argue that in order for a person to have free-will, they must decide what they do without coercion. If I go to the ice cream store wanting ice cream, compatibilists hold that my choice to order chocolate being determined by my firm desire for chocolate does not make it not a free willed action. Rather, compatibilsts believe that what robs people of free will is coercion. If a crazed tourist from Naples held a gun to my head and made me order Neapolitan instead of my beloved chocolate, my ordering the Neapolitan ice cream would not be a free willed action.

Hard Determinists accept determinism and incompatibilism, believing that human decisions are not random, and that this nonrandomness rules out free will. Soft Determinists accept determinism and compatibilism, believing that human decisions are not random, and that this nonrandomness does not rule out free will. (Some soft determinists believe that randomness in human decision making would make free will impossible.) Libertarians accept indeterminism and incompatibilism, believing that human decisions are random, that this randomness does not rule out free will, and in fact that randomness actually allow free will.

Determinists hold that, if a particular system is deterministic, its immediately next state will be exactly determined by its present state. This means that, in a deterministic system given any particular set of circumstances, the immediately succeeding set of following outcomes or events are determined, guaranteed by the laws of nature. Everything in nature is made up of atoms that behave according to the laws of nature, and we are no different. Determinism is the view that everything happens necessarily due to the circumstances that precede it; Hard determinism is the dual view that this is true and that people are unable to truly make their own decisions. Incompatibilism is the view that, if the laws of nature determine what people will do under certain circumstances (circumstances which were themselves determined by the circumstances that immediately preceded them), people cannot have free will. 

Everything we know about science and the physical world points to determinism being true under virtually all observable circumstances. However, certain interpretations of quantum mechanics hold that some events are fundamentally random, which means it is possible that some brain events are random. This in turn means that it is at least theoretically possible that some human decisions could be random, as in the case of a person who decides to order chocolate ice cream but instead, for no reason, orders Neapolitan.

Libertarians believe that the everyday experiential evidence that people have free-will proves that human decisions are not determined. Soft determinists agree that the evidence overwhemingly supports the idea that free will exists, but that the fact that human beings at least sometimes determine their own actions does not prove that those actions are not determined. Some soft determinists argue that the fact that someone determines her own action proves that the action was determined (by her.)

Libertarians argue that people can only deliberate about choices that are truly up to them, and that this fact proves that human actions are not determined. Soft determinists reply that deliberation is not a random sequence of events, but a deterministic process in which a human brain comes to a decision caused by the person's needs, preferences and desires.

Libertarians sometimes refer to the basic feeling have that tells them they are making things happen. Soft determinists reply that this feeling is correct, and that it reflects the fact that the person's brain is  recognizing needs, forming preferences, making decisions and then initiating actions based on those decisions, none of which could happen if the brain was inderterministic, which is to say, random.

People feel like they are making my own choices, and that they are free to pick among different alternatives. These feelings are cause by the fact that I experience myself forming forming preferences based on my feelings, forming desires based on my preferences, making decisions based on my aggregated desires, and performing actions from those decisions. Libertarians, who hold that human behavior is not subject to cause-and-effect, cannot explain this orderly one-thing-leads-to-another process, and thus this experience of choosing is a strong argument against libertarianism

Throughout history, the majority of philosophers have found middle-ground, and argued that free-will and determinism are compatible. David Hume is a good example of this. Hume argued that people are free as long as they are doing what they want to do. I may not be able to really make my own choice (in the way that hard-determinists and libertarians mean), but as long as I wanted the chocolate ice cream, and that desire determined that I would choose it, I have free will.

Back to Harry Frankfurt. He believes that causation really has nothing to do with freedom of the will and personhood. Frankfurt constructs a hierarchy of desires and volitions. A first order desire is wanting to do something. Mostly every creature has this type of desire. &quot;I want to eat.&quot; A second order desire is the want to be different, or to have different first order desires. This self-evaluation, Frankfurt says, is a mostly human trait. A step up from that is a second order volition, that is, when someone wants a certain desire to be his will. Frankfurt says that these volitions are characteristics of people, whereas &quot;wantons&quot; are creatures without these volitions, creatures who do not care about their will and are moved simply by their desires.

These theories, along with others, still exist and are in conflict to this day.

This question must be answered before we can even begin to think about whether it might be possible to build a person. The English term, &quot;person,&quot; is ambiguous. We often use it as a synonym for &quot;human being.&quot; But surely that is not what we intend here. It is possible that there are aliens living on other planets that have the same cognitive abilities that we do (e.g., E.T., Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, the famous &quot;bar scene&quot; from Star Wars). Imagine aliens that speak a language, make moral judgments, create literature and works of art, etc. Surely aliens with these properties would be &quot;persons&quot;--which is to say that it would be morally wrong to buy or sell them as property the way we do with dogs and cats or to otherwise use them for our own interests without taking into account the fact that they are moral agents with interests that deserve the same protection that ours do. Thus, one of our primary interests is to distinguish persons from property. A person is the kind of entity that has the moral right to make its own life-choices, to live its life without (unprovoked) interference from others. Property is the kind of thing that can be bought and sold, something I can &quot;use&quot; for my own interests. [Of course when it comes to animals, there are serious moral constraints on how they may be &quot;used.&quot; We urge you to learn about the philosophical debates concerning the ethical treatment of animals and whether animals may not themselves have extensive rights not commonly accorded them in our society. Persons are not to be treated as property. Henceforth, we shall define a person as follows: 

PERSON = &quot;any entity that has the moral right of self-determination.&quot;
So then, any entity judged to be a person would be the kind of thing that would deserve protection under the constitution of a just society. For example, you might think that any such being would have the right to &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; 
One of the primary philosophical questions that concerns us in the PT-Project is: What properties must an entity possess to be a &quot;person&quot;? Many properties have been suggested: Intelligence, the capacity to speak a language, creativity, the ability to make moral judgments, consciousness, free will, a soul, self-awareness . . and the list could go on almost indefinitely.

== Free-will and Ethics ==
There is a definite link between ideas of free-will and ideas of ethics and responsibility. Libertarians and Determinists mostly agree that in order for a person to be held responsible for her/his actions, that person must have made the decision to carry out said action. This translates to philosophy of law. We generally do not hold someone responsible for a crime if we do not consider him/her to be the &quot;owner of his actions&quot;. For example, if a man with schizophrenia shoots someone in a fit of hallucinogenic rage, we do not believe it was his fault, and we consider him &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity&quot;. There can be no blame, nor praise, in a world without freedom of the will.

However, some compatibilists, namely Hume, claim that people can be held responsible for their actions ''only when they are not free''.  In his essay &quot;Of Liberty and Necessity&quot;, Hume offers a disjunctive syllogism. He claims that either the actions of humanity are pre-determined (like everything else in this world), or else human actions are random and chaotic. He goes on to say that if human action is random, if my actions do not come from my character but only from chance, then there is no ethical responsibility. I cannot be held responsible if my actions do not come from me. However, if everything is pre-determined, then at least my actions are coming from my psychological and metaphysical states. At least then it can be said that my character is causing me to act in a certain way. 

Hume, for the most part, lost this battle, mostly because Richard Taylor defeated Hume's syllogism and offered a third alternative: Agent Causation, the notion that a person can cause an event to happen. This is arguably different from determinism and the idea of random, chaotic action. However, even this notion can be countered by determinists who can argue that though a person can be said to have caused an event, the person cannot make the decision that causes the event without relying on the beliefs and desires that followed naturally, or deterministically, from past experience and genetics.  If the person's actions do not follow directly from beliefs and desires developed from past experience and genetics, we come full circle and must accept that the world is random and chaotic.

Perhaps I have more to say about personal identity than person per se.  I'll say more if you want me to.  I feel I know enough about this area to have a point of view about it.  And that could render me liable to charges of bias.  Even
my reading list is biassed, though I haven't gone as far as referring to my own MPhil dissertation, which is perhaps an
imperfect document.

--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 18:19, 19 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I added to your stub. I personally felt it necessary for an intro to philosophy text to mention the free-will debate, and I thought this was the best place for it.

In para 8 of Identity Theory there is a reference to something called ''Planned Parenthood''. Can someone enlighten me as to what this is? [[User:62.253.64.14|62.253.64.14]] 10:56, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Isaiah 2:1-4 This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem. 

2:2 It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, 
and shall be raised above the hills; 
and all nations shall flow to it. &lt;br&gt;
2:3 Many peoples shall go and say, &lt;br&gt;
“Come, let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh, &lt;br&gt;
to the house of the God of Jacob; &lt;br&gt;
and he will teach us of his ways,&lt;br&gt; 
and we will walk in his paths.” &lt;br&gt;
For out of Zion the law shall go forth, &lt;br&gt;
and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem. &lt;br&gt;
2:4 He will judge between the nations, &lt;br&gt;
and will decide concerning many peoples; &lt;br&gt;
and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, &lt;br&gt;
and their spears into pruning hooks. &lt;br&gt;
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, &lt;br&gt;
neither shall they learn war any more. &lt;br&gt;

* Daniel 2:44 In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall its sovereignty be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

* Daniel 7:18 But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.
* Judges 6;09  When hope  comes, this is my kingdom, our perffersins, and our hearts to be brave, and our love.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==TIVI Finding Cancer Cells Faster==

Researchers at the University of Illinois have used a new microscopy technique, termed nonlinear interferometric vibrational imaging (NIVI), and produced color coded images of tissue, showing clear tumor boundaries, with more than 99% confidence in less than five minutes.

Current diagnostic methods require a day or more to show biopsy results, and are based on visual interpretations of cell structure. NIVI can assist in making diagnostics faster and more quantitative. Instead of focusing on cell structure and tissue structure, NIVI constructs images based on molecular composition, which is much clearer than the current visual method used by pathologists. Cancer cells produce more protein, a useful fact that NIVI uses to identify cancer cells, without relying on the staining method used currently. Another advantage of NIVI is that it shows a better mapping of tumor boundaries, the uncertain boundary zone of NIVI being only 100 microns.

Since each type of molecule has its own unique vibrational energy, enhancing the resonance of that vibration is used by NIVI to identify cells with high concentrations of that molecule. Two beams of light are used to excite molecules in a tissue sample. One beam serves as a reference, so that background noise can be cancelled and the molecular signal can be isolated. The resulting spectrum produces a color coded image for the tissue (for example, blue for normal cells, red for cancer cells).

Further improvements to NIVI are being worked on. Other light sources (different lasers) may make NIVI portable. The research is sponsored by The National Cancer Institute.

Medicine is a substance (not a device) that is used in treatment of conditions of the human body. Medicines are used to relieve pain, prevent progression of disease or alleviate the symptoms of conditions. In the area of infectious disease, they may cure the illness. Examples where medications allow resumption of normal body functions would be treatment of diabetes, thyroid deficiencies, or sex hormone deficiencies.

Medicines in the United States today are prescribed by experienced clinicians, whose ability to prescribe is subject to state licensing laws. In most states they include Doctors of Medicine, Osteopathy, and Podiatric Medicine (Physicians), Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and in rare cases, Pharmacists themselves.  All clinicians have undergone training, though Physicians have had the most extensive training in a medical school, and have developed an extensive body of knowledge expanded over the years.

'''Poaching''' is a method of cooking that employs a liquid, usually a small amount, that is hot but not actually bubbling.  The French term is ''frisonne'' &amp;ndash; shivering. The ideal temperature is between 160F and 180F (75-80C).  The cooking liquid is often [[Cookbook:Water|water]], but [[Cookbook:Broth|broth]], [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]], milk or juice can also be used.

Delicate foods such as [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]] out of the shell, or fruits are commonly cooked by poaching.  The cooking method is also used to partially cook certain foods such as [[Cookbook:Sweetbread|sweetbread]] in order to eliminate undesirable flavors and to firm the product before final cooking.

It should be noted that the term is occasionally used to describe foods that have been [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] or [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmered]].

==Tips for poaching==

*Use a thermometer to gauge the temperature of the cooking liquid or watch for bubbling and adjust the heat as necessary.
*Do not allow the food being cooked to touch the bottom of the pan or it may cook too rapidly or burn.
*When poaching eggs, add a splash of vinegar to the water.  This will help quickly firm the egg white so multiple eggs can be cooked at once without all sticking together.

==Hole technique==

# Heat water to just under simmering.
# With a pushpin, carefully pierce one end of the egg.
# Place egg on a large spoon, and lower it gently into the water.  Keep submerged for 20-30 seconds.  Some egg protein may start to come out of the hole in &quot;streamers&quot;.
# Raise spoon, gently crack egg, and drop into water.

Pre-cooking the egg by letting some hot water inside the shell will result in a firmer egg once opened, and it will be less likely to come apart in the water while cooking.

'''Sweetbread''' is the genteel name of the meat of the thymus and pancreas of a young calf. Sweetbreads are noted and prized for their flavor and texture. Sweetbreads have nothing to do with bread and they are not sweet.

The thymus is known as [[Cookbook:Neck Sweetbread|neck sweetbread]].

The pancreas is known as [[Cookbook:Stomach Sweetbread|stomach sweetbread]].

The testicles are known as [[Cookbook:Sweetmeat|sweetmeat]], not sweetbread.</text>

'''Fenugreek''', or ''Trigonella foenum-graecum'', is native to India and southern Europe.  People cook with the hard, yellow-brown seeds that come from the plant's pods.  Fenugreek contains only minute quantities of an essential oil.  [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_India|Indian cooking]] often employs fresh fenugreek leaves, which are eaten [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sautéed]], or dried and used as a flavoring.

'''Cumin''' (''Cuminum cyminum'') comes from Western Asia, where it has been cultivated since Biblical times. People cook with the fruits of the plant, which are usually referred to as the seeds.

Cumin is a very strong spice often used in highly spiced cuisines, especially [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|Indian]]. Commonly, you will use 1/4 to 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons]] per [[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (11 to 44 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]/[[Cookbook:kg|kg]]) of meat.

Cumin might be confused with [[Cookbook:Caraway|caraway]]. Both belong to the same family of spices.

Cumin is known as ''jeera'' in Hindi and ''zeera'' in Urdu.

A '''linear equation''' is an equation that has the form

&lt;math&gt;a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n=b&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'',''a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', etc. are called the '''coefficients''' of the equations and ''b'' is called the '''constant term'''. Variables in linear algebra are usually denoted by x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; instead of x, y, z, etc. because real world problems can have millions of variables. Problems in this text will have no more than 5 or 6.

Terms that appear on the left side of a linear equation must have a power of exactly 1. Terms that appear on the right hand side must have a power of zero.

'''Examples'''

1. &lt;math&gt;2x_1 - 5x_2 + x_3 = 9 \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;a linear equation

2. &lt;math&gt;x_1 + 2x_2 + 2\sqrt{x_3} = 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;NOT a linear equation because of the square root. A square root &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x_3}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt; to the power &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt; and not to the power 1.

3. &lt;math&gt;-10x_1 + 2x_2 = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;a linear equation

4. &lt;math&gt;x_1x_2 + 2x_3 = 0 \!&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;NOT a linear equation because &lt;math&gt;x_1x_2 &lt;/math&gt; is a term of power 2.

==Systems of linear equations==

&lt;table WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #FFBDBD; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top&gt;
A system of ''m'' equations in ''n'' variables has the form 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
a_{11}x_1&amp;+a_{12}x_2&amp;\cdots&amp;+a_{1n}x_n&amp;=&amp;b_1\\
a_{21}x_1&amp;+a_{22}x_2&amp;\cdots&amp;+a_{2n}x_n&amp;=&amp;b_2\\
\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\\
a_{m1}x_1&amp;+a_{m2}x_2&amp;\cdots&amp;+a_{mn}x_n&amp;=&amp;b_m
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

Note that if the coefficient of a variable in a linear equation is zero, we could omit it. Therefore not every variable needs to be present in every equation.  Below are two systems of linear equations:

1. &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}2x_1&amp;-2x_2&amp;+x_3&amp;=&amp;1\\-3x_1&amp;+2x_2&amp;&amp;=&amp;3\\3x_1&amp;+2x_2&amp;+x_3&amp;=&amp;7\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;


2. &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}2x_1&amp;-2x_2&amp;-x_3&amp;+2x_4&amp;=&amp;0\\-3x_1&amp;&amp;+2x_3&amp;&amp;=&amp;0\\3x_1&amp;+2x_2&amp;+x_3&amp;-x_4&amp;=&amp;0\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The second system is called a '''homogeneous system''' as all the constant terms are zero.

Usually, a system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations that have the same variables. Theoretically, we may treat a single linear equation as a system also.

===Matrix formulation===
Arrange the coefficients of a linear system in a ''m''-by-''n'' matrix (i.e. an array with ''m'' rows and ''n'' columns), we get

:&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix}
a_{11}&amp;a_{12}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{1n}\\
a_{21}&amp;a_{22}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{2n}\\
\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots&amp;\cdots\\
a_{m1}&amp;a_{m2}&amp;\cdots&amp;a_{mn}
\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and let 
&lt;math&gt;b=\left(\begin{matrix}b_1\\b_2\\\vdots\\b_n\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;x=\left(\begin{matrix}x_1\\x_2\\\vdots\\x_n\end{matrix}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
The system of linear equations could be written as 

:&lt;math&gt;Ax=b&lt;/math&gt;

This motivates the study of matrix theory. For further introduction, see [[Linear Algebra/Matrices]].

==Solutions of systems of linear equations==

A solution of a system of linear equations is a set of numbers for each variable that makes every equation true. For example, a solution of the first system given is (0,1.5,4) because 2(0)-1.5(2)+1(4)=1, -3(0)+2(1.5)=3, and 3(0)+2(1.5)+4=7.

See [[Algebra/Solutions of systems of linear equations]].

==Applications==

Solving systems of linear equations is essential in modern engineering. Physical systems of high complexity, which would require impossible formulas to describe, are approximated with high accuracy by solving a very large set of linear equations. By breaking the subject at hand into tiny, finite pieces, a solution can be obtained after a great deal of brute-force calculation. When such numerical analysis introduces errors into the calculation at hand, a sufficiently complex analysis often makes up for the simplifications often introduced in less numerical methods. Error can be avoided with smaller pieces or with more sophisticated algorithms. Specific methods include finite difference analysis, finite element analysis, and boundary layer analysis. Specific applications include computational fluid dynamics, heat transfer, fatigue analysis, strain analysis, and stress analysis.

Systems of linear equations are also used in statistical regression. A common algorithm for the least squares regression uses a matrix with n rows and m columns, where n represents the number of data points and m represents the number of base functions, or the number of coefficients sought. (A polynomial ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d, for example, uses four base functions: x^3, x^2, x, and 1.) A good explanation of this algorithm may be found in Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing.

'''Caraway''', also spelled '''carroway''', is one of the most common spices of German-speaking countries. People cook with the fruits of the plant, which are usually referred to as the seeds.

Caraway is most commonly used whole in [[Cookbook:Rye Bread|rye bread]].

Caraway is often confused with [[Cookbook:Cumin|cumin]]. Both belong to the same family of spices.

Hi Rachel, [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikibooks!  I see you've been making some contribution to the [[Cookbook]], and I wanted to thank you!  Keep up the good work.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on my [[User talk:Gentgeen|talk page]], or at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]].  Most importantly, have fun. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 21:38, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Ingredients index ==

Is the Cookbook:Ingredients page done manually, or is there a tool
for that sort of thing? The cookbook needs a global index. I'd like
to see something like this:

*Cheese Sandwich, Toasted
*Sandwich, Toasted Cheese
*Toasted Cheese Sandwich

Also, Fried_Rice and fried_rice (lowercase) ought to be together.
It'd be especially nice if this worked for non-ASCII text.

==Daughter==
I have a vegan daughter with your name. 
I'll let her know about your cookbook.

Thanks for helping out!  And thanks for signing up for some proofreading tasks! --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 18:59, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

I'd also like to thank you for helping out. If words are going into the glossary, are already there, or you think they should be there, then bold them. I think names of craters, geographical features, etc. should be italic, but there's no set policy on this, I think. I think I'll add this to the proofreading instructions.--[[User:Shanel|Shanel]] 06:05, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

===Deadline -- We miss it!===
RachelI don't think it is humanly possible to make an October 3 deadline.  The book is not proofread, we need to cut it by about 50%, we don't have an artist lined up, we have all the layout to do, and a printer to line up.

I don't really know what a reasonable timeline is for all this.  Do you?
Maybe we can come up with something sensible.

      <comment>removed canard about olive oil becoming dangerous when heated</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}} | [[Cookbook:Frying|Frying]]

'''Stir-frying''' involves [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]] food quickly over very high heat in an oiled pan.  While stir-frying, you generally stir continually.  A special slope-sided pan called a [[Cookbook:Wok|wok]] is designed for stir-frying.
An open flame heat source such as gas works best when using a wok.

Different frying oils produce different results. A light oil such as sesame produces a slightly healthier and much more tasty result but can burn if overheated. Olive oil has a low smoking point and may heat too quickly.

Here are some tips:

* Make sure all ingredients are prepared ''before'' you begin stir-frying.
* Heat the wok on medium-high or high heat at least one minute before adding oil. Do not pre-heat the wok if it has non-stick coating, as the heat can damage the coating.
* Drizzle the oil down the sides of the wok to maximize oil coverage as well as to heat the oil more quickly.
* Cook meat on high heat in order to keep it juicy. Remove the meat before stir-frying the vegetables. Add the meat back into the mix once the vegetables are almost cooked.
* If you are cooking over an electric range, replace the wok with an ordinary heavy-bottomed frying pan. You will achieve better results this way since electric ranges will not properly heat the curved sides of a wok.
* If you are using an electric range, you can preheat the pan or wok in an oven set to its highest setting, and only use the electric range to maintain heat during cooking. Be careful, as the pan's handle will be very hot.

A '''rhizome''' is a horizontal, usually underground stem of a plant that often sends out roots and shoots from its nodes. They are also referred to as creeping rootstalks, or rootstocks. A stolon is similar to a rhizome, but exists above ground, sprouting from an existing stem.

==Tubers==

A '''tuber''' is a thickened part of a rhizome that has been enlarged for use as a storage organ. They are typically high in starch.

A '''potato''' is a [[Cookbook:Rhizome|tuber]]. Originally from South America, the potato is now grown and used as a foodstuff in most parts of the world and is valued for its relative ease of growing and its high carbohydrate content. It is also extremely versatile in the kitchen and can be served [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]], [[Cookbook:Roasting|roasted]], [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]], [[Cookbook:Pan frying|shallow-fried]] or [[Cookbook:Deep frying|deep-fried]]. There is a large number of [[Cookbook:Varieties of potato|varieties of potato]], each of which has its own qualities and uses. Finally, some potatoes are harvested while still relatively immature (&quot;new potatoes&quot;), while others (&quot;old potatoes&quot;) are left to grow to their maximum size. This also affects the texture and flavour.

Potatoes have a thin layer of high-grade protein just under the skin.  The best ways to take advantage of it is to consume them whole, or boil them and very carefully remove their skins.

==Buying potatoes==
For practical purposes, potatoes can be put into three groups, although the distinctions between them are not clear-cut, and there is much overlapping. While the Russet Burbank baking potato is probably the most pleasing for general use, potatoes with oddly-coloured flesh often provide [[Cookbook:Antioxidants|antioxidants]] like beta-carotene and lycopene. Odd colours may hide greening and rotten spots, though.

*The term '''new potato''' is most frequently used to describe those potatoes freshly harvested and marketed during the late winter or early spring. The name is also widely used in later crop producing areas to designate freshly dug potatoes which are not fully matured. The best uses for new potatoes are [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] or mashing. They vary widely in size and shape, depending upon variety, but are likely to be affected by &quot;skinning&quot; or &quot;feathering&quot; of the outer layer of skin. Skinning usually affects only their appearance.

*The term '''general purpose potato''' includes the great majority of supplies, both round and long types, offered for sale in markets. With the aid of air-cooled storage, general purpose potatoes are amply available throughout the year. As the term implies, they are used for [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]], [[Cookbook:Frying|frying]], and [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]], although many of the common varieties are not considered to be best for baking.

*The term '''baking potato''' means a potato grown specifically for [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] quality. Both variety and farm location are important factors affecting baking quality. A long variety with fine, scaly netting on the skin, such as the Russet Burbank from Idaho, is commonly used for baking.

With new potatoes, look for firm potatoes that are free from blemishes and sunburn (a green discolouration under the skin). Some amount of skinned surface is normal, but potatoes with large skinned and discoloured areas are undesirable. For general-purpose and baking potatoes, look for reasonably smooth, firm potatoes free from blemishes, sunburn, and decay. Avoid potatoes with large cuts, green spots, bruises, decay, sprouting, or shrivelling. 

== Storage ==
Potato storage facilities need to be carefully considered to keep the potatoes alive and slow the natural process of decomposition, which involves the breakdown of starch. It is crucial that the storage area is dark, well ventilated and, for long-term storage, maintained at temperatures near 4 °C (39 °F). For short-term storage before cooking, temperatures of about 7 °C (45 °F) to 10 °C (50 °F) are preferred.  Temperatures below 4 °C convert potatoes' starch into sugar, which alters their taste and cooking qualities and leads to higher acrylamide levels in the cooked product, especially in deep-fried dishes.

Under optimum conditions possible in commercial warehouses, potatoes can be stored for up to ten or twelve months.  When stored at home, the shelf life is usually only several weeks.

If potatoes are exposed to light, they will develop green areas or start to sprout. Green parts can be very poisonous, as they indicate the presence of glycoalkaloids, ⍺-solanine and ⍺-chaconine. Although the green colour is caused by chlorophyll and is harmless, one should discard any such potatoes, as the toxins cannot be adequately removed by peeling or trimming techniques.  These potatoes are no longer suitable as animal food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Carol Deppe |title=The Resilient Gardener: Food Production and Self-Reliance in Uncertain Times |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |location=White River Junction, VT |year=2010 |page=157 |isbn=1-60358-031-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xf5Q4jo_mEEC&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooking techniques ==
=== Boiling ===
Old potatoes normally need to be peeled before boiling. Many new potatoes are better when boiled in their skins, but one should wash them first. Small potatoes can be cooked whole. Larger potatoes will cook more evenly and quickly if they are first cut into roughly egg-sized pieces. Put the potatoes in a large enough pan and add enough water to cover them easily. Add a little salt, if desired. Bring to the boil. Potatoes will take around 20 minutes to cook through. To test whether they are done, press the tip of a cook's knife into one. It should be able to slip in and out easily. Serve with butter if you're not worried about your weight, with salt if you're not worried about your blood pressure, or with a sprinkling of chopped [[Cookbook:Chives|chives]] if you want them to look nice.  Also boiled potatoes go well with [[Cookbook:mayonnaise|mayonnaise]].

=== Mashing ===
Skin potatoes and slice them as about finger thick (about 1 cm) slices. Put slices into pot and add some water (1/5 water of total level is enough, no need to cover them completely. Idea is to steam cook them and keeping the cooking water so nothing is wasted). Cook potatoes under a lid until they are ready, about 10 minutes. Attack the potatoes with a knife so that they are cut into smaller pieces. You then need to add some milk and butter (according to taste and waistline) and purée all ingredients. Use a [[Cookbook:Potato-ricer|potato-ricer]] for best results or a hand-held masher for possibly lumpy mash. Food processors can have a tendency to over process for mashed potatoes, instead producing more of a purée suitable for vichyssoise and other potato soups. You can add salt, pepper, muskat, or other herbs and spices as you wish. Roasted garlic is also a popular addition.

=== Roasting ===
Roast potatoes are a good and traditional accompaniment to roast meat. Prepare the potatoes as for boiling, and [[Cookbook:Parboil|parboil]] them for just a few minutes. Then put in the roasting dish around the meat, and baste them with the juices as cooking goes on.

=== Baking ===
On a cold day, few things are nicer than a baked potato. Use a large potato, with its skin on. It is important to stab the potatoes with a knife or fork in several places so they will not explode. Preheat the oven to very hot ([[Cookbook:Oven Temperatures|gas mark]] 7) (about 375°F) and put in the potatoes for about an hour. Especially when using an electric oven, it is important to protect the potatoes from drying by covering them with foil or coating them in oil. A lid over the whole batch will do, saving on foil and oil. You may put a metal skewer through the potato to help distribute heat evenly.
 
Serve the potato as hot as you can stand it. Fillings can include [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], grated cheese (something strong like [[Cookbook:Cheddar cheese|cheddar]] or [[Cookbook:Red Leicester Cheese|red Leicester]]), baked beans, [[Cookbook:Pesto|pesto]] - you name it. Eat the skin&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; it really is good for you.

=== Microwave ===
Perforate the skin with a fork in many places to prevent the potato from exploding.  It is important to protect the potatoes from drying by covering them with a damp paper towel or coating them in oil. A low power setting may be a good idea, but you wouldn't be using the microwave if you didn't want fast cooking!

=== Deep frying ===
Described here is the basic method. Put the potatoes in whole. If you don't have any day-old bread to hand, drop one of your chips in; if the fat is hot enough it will start to cook. Add the chips, using a frying basket. The temperature of the fat will drop sharply, so keep the heat high under the pan. Cook until the chips are browned. Remove the frying basket, and allow the fat to get a little hotter. Then plunge the basket back in for a few minutes to complete the cooking. Keep a fire blanket or damp towel nearby at all times.  

An alternative, and safer, method is to use a specialized deep fat fryer.

=== Shallow frying (sautéing) ===
Potatoes can be shallow fried, as an easier and quicker alternative to deep-frying. Use a mealy potato (such as King Edward) and cut into cubes of about 1&amp;nbsp;cm or half an inch. Heat up a sauté pan then add vegetable oil and the potatoes. Cook at a high temperature for about five minutes, stirring often, until the cubes are browned all round. At the last moment you can add [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] to glaze the potatoes and maybe some herbs or chopped [[Cookbook:Shallot|shallot]]s.

Another way of sautéing potatoes is to produce a '''Roesti''' (''Rösti''), a dish which originates in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Switzerland|Switzerland]]. Instead of chopping the potatoes into cubes, grate the potato using the coarse setting on a three-sided [[Cookbook:Grater|grater]].

Rinse the potatoes under cold running water to extract their starch.  It is essential that you then squeeze the potato shards very dry.  If you can, use a muslin cloth to squeeze out all the excess moisture.

Now, add the potato mixture to DRY (yes, really) frying pan and spread out evenly. Cook on a medium heat for about 5-7 minutes, resisting the temptation to turn or flip the potatoes.  After this time, take a spatula and flip the entire potato pancake over. It should be a lovely golden colour and not burned.  Fry the pancake for another 5 minutes on its other side, and then the Roesti is ready to eat. Simply slide it from the frying pan, onto a plate.

N.B.: Traditionally, Roesti either have butter or fat mixed into the grated potato before frying, or are fried in fat or oil.

=== Stewing ===
Stewing is a great way to take care of left over potatoes. [[Cookbook:Potato Stew|Potato stew]] goes well with sausages, meatballs, or smoked, salted or gravad fish. To make stewed potatoes, peel and dice the cold, already boiled potatoes.  Make the cubes about 1-2 cm across. Mix flour with milk and butter in a saucepan. Bring the sauce to a boil, add the potatoes, and boil gently for 5 min. Add salt, pepper and dill to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Well, I've got as far as a table of contents.  I welcome constructive comments.  I might copy some of the wikiversity stuff I've written across to here, as I think this is where a lot of it really belongs.
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 12:40, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Well, I'm busy working on this.  But I need your help.  I feel like there is some kind of 'mathematical creep' going on.  Now this might be something to do with the nature of logic as a tradition - a lot of logicians were also mathematicians, predicate calculus has its roots in mathematical analysis, etc.  Trouble is I've been steeped in mathematics and am part of this tradition myself.  I don't want to expunge the maths, but I don't want the book to become too mathematical, which it could do if I'm the sole author.  Logic should be able to cope with the real world, not just some platonic heaven.

It would be nice to have some logic gurus here.  But failing that, I'll try to be the guru for any student who is moderately interested in being guinea pig for this text as it develops.

== Under construction, Update ==

I ([[User:JMRyan]]) have decided that it is best to move (most of) the newer pages (see [[Introduction to Philosophy/Logic/Some Properties of the Logical Connectives#Under construction]] above) to a new book, [[Formal Logic]].  [[Introduction to Philosophy]] appears to be a general survey book which looks broadly at a wide variety of philosophical areas, but does not cover any one of them in much detail.  The newer pages are a more detailed presentation of standard formal logic.  I will also try to patch up the older pages to fit in with the apparent goal of [[Introduction to Philosophy]].  (October 13, 2005)

== link back ==

publunch, good work.  I think it would be good to have links from the subpages back to the main page. See the example I made on the modes page. What do you think? I was also wondering what the reasoning was behind calling the page [[Philosophy/Logic/Modes|Modes]] vs Introduction_to_Philosophy:Logic:Modes or Introduction_to_Philosophy:Modes? Does Modes ever have the potential of being a book of its own? It is possible I am seeing all these pages in a bit too linear of form though. [[User:Liblamb|liblamb]] 19:32, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: Thanks, liblamb.  It is nice to know that someone is reading this stuff - I sometimes get the feeling that I am talking to myself when I am writing and that makes me feel lonely and depressed and makes me wonder what the point of writing this is.  Well, there is a lot of bad reasoning in the world, and a bit of teaching about logic might just help.  It could stop wars!

:Perhaps there is a problem with the page called 'modes'.  I needed to introduce modus ponens and modus tollens there, as they are pretty basic and I don't think the propositional calculus, which I am working on at the moment would make any sense without me talking a little bit about introducing MP and MT there.  Somehow some rather important stuff about logical fallacies has crept in at the bottom of the modes page.
--[[User:212.56.114.4|212.56.114.4]] 12:13, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Well, I might get round to putting some links back in my pages, or you can put the links in for me.  There is so much to do, so a bit of help is appreciated.  --[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 11:06, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Well, I'm note sure where this goes so feel free to move or delete it, but what I am trying to understand is another paradox and its relation to logic.   

When a person is inebriated they often report bothing being and not-being themselves.  

Or there are some logical arguments that have all sound premises that are true for the people who believe them.  While there are opposite logical arguements leading to the opposite conclusions, but consisting of sound premises from the point of view of the people who believe them.

All x is y,
a is x.
.: a is y   

But other people will believe that
All x is ~y,
a is x.
.: a is not y.

My problem is that it can be shown by both parties that 1) All x is y  and 2) All x is not y
is sound from their point of view. But this leads to the unallowable
a is not a, a contradiction   

Now, is this handled by having some sort of statement that when we see &quot;a is not a,&quot; what we are really seeing is that B(a is y) and C(a is not y) where B and C are the people holding those conclusions. Or they hold those beliefs because they flow logically from their assumptions B(All x is y) or C(All x is not y).

I guess what I'm asking is how does point of view fit into logic, specifically related to what are taken to be sound premises.

Almost all political arguments for policy outcomes seem to fall into the above (paradox?).
The other example may not, but it's the one of both being and not being yourself when you are inebriated.  I guess I'm trying to see if there's a relation of logic to psychology or if logic can't apply to psychological states. (teacher@mediawell.com)

== false name space ==

I've been asked by someone on irc to move all the logic pages to a 'false name space'.  So stuff is slowly being moved to 'introduction to logic'.  This will be done, but it may take a while, 'coz I don't rush anything these days.
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 12:09, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Notation ==

I have just put a couple of paragraphs into the Modal logic section and I have used LaTeX with the &quot;math&quot; tab to write the formulae. I think they look much better this way. Although the formulae in the previous sections look fine, I don't think they will when they get more complicated. ([[User:80.58.11.107|80.58.11.107]] 11:52, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC))

== Casing ==

I have started to moving (renaming) these pages to achieve better casing consistency, especially with the parent [[Introduction_to_Philosophy|Introduction to Philosophy]] book.  The parent book is not completely consistent, but it mostly appears to follow book title casing with the first and all subsequent non-minor words capitalized.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 19:42, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

== E-Prime ==

I thought this might be the place to also mention [[w:E-Prime|E-Prime]]. It relates very much to logic. Perhaps the regular editors to this book would be interested in incorporating a chapter about it.

This is a delicious and quick recipe for a sunny day, or to bring back a little memory of summer. It's served warm so may not suit a winter evening! The combination of flavours ('''m'''ilky mozzarella, eggy '''p'''asta, sweet '''t'''omato and spicy basil) is just wonderful.

== Ingredients ==

*250g fresh egg pasta
*2 mozzarella balls (cow or buffalo)
*About 10-15 small tomatoes or 4/5 larger tomatoes (you need about the same amount as the mozzarella)
*A good handful of basil leaves, about 15-20
*Olive oil
*Salt and black pepper

== Procedure ==

The secret here is to prepare all the ingredients except the pasta ahead of time and let them soak together. I tend to stand the prepared bowl of ingredients in a sink full of hot water, so that the mozzarella starts to soften and the juices start to run.

#Chop the mozzarella and the tomatoes roughly and put them in a big salad type dish.
#Now tear up the basil and sprinkle it over the mozzarella and tomatoes.
#Drizzle on lots of extra virgin olive oil - at least 3 tablespoons (I usually do more!)
#Finally add a really good amount of salt and just a little black pepper. The salt will start to leech moisture out from the other ingredients and create a sauce.
#Wait!
#When you're ready, boil up the egg pasta, drain when cooked al dente (as usual) and then pour, still hot, on the other ingredients. Stir it up well, coating everything very well, and serve.

This is a delicious and quick recipe for a sunny day, or to bring back a little memory of summer. It's served warm so may not suit a winter evening! The combination of flavours (egg pasta, milky mozzarella, sweet tomato and spicy basil) is just wonderful.

==Ingredients==

*250[[Cookbook:g|g]] fresh egg [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella]] balls (cow or buffalo) - Works well with Brie as well
*About 10-15 small [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] or 4/5 larger tomatoes (you need about the same amount as the mozzarella) 
*A good handful of [[Cookbook:Basil|basil]] leaves, about 15-20 
*Extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]  (what else?)
*[[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]] &amp; black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]

==Procedure==

The secret here is to prepare all the ingredients except the pasta ahead of time and let them soak together. I tend to stand the prepared bowl of ingredients in a sink full of hot water, so that the mozzarella starts to soften and the juices from the tomatoes start to run.

#Chop the mozzarella and the tomatoes roughly and put them in a big salad type dish. You're looking to create small cube shapes between 1 cm and 1 inch (i.e., about 2.5 cm).
#Now tear up the basil and sprinkle it over the mozzarella and tomatoes. I always tear basil as I've read that it's the best way to preserve the flavour, but others may disagree.
#Drizzle on lots of extra virgin olive oil - at least 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (I usually do more - for me it's pouring, not drizzling!) 
#Finally add a really good amount of salt and just a little black pepper. The salt will start to leech moisture out from the other ingredients and create a sauce.

So the meeting comes. What are you going to do? Here it is:
==Participants with Special Roles==

Two participants have special roles in a meeting, the Chairman and the Secretary. Other participants my have importance during the meeting, however these two roles are consistent across many different types of meetings. Together these two roles form the motor of the meeting.

===Chairman===
The chairman takes care of an orderly progression of the meeting, sees that procedures are followed and that every participant gets a chance to play his or her role. In meetings regarding multi-sided discussion, this person is typically a facilitator of discussion rather than a strong proponent of one side or another.

===Secretary===
The secretary is a person who supports the chairman and is also responsible for taking the minutes. This person is usually tasked with preparing and sending out the agenda, however in some organizations this can fall in the chairman's responsibilities.

==Speaking and Listening==
An important part of participating in a group meeting is that all points of discussion and opinions be heard. It is the chairman's role to ensure that no one voice be louder than the rest, and that no voices go unheard. As a meeting facilitator, the chairman's authority must be respected by all participants, otherwise an imbalance of input can occur.

It is important that all participants adhere to the guidelines agreed upon at the onset of the meeting. If the chairman notices that one person is speaking out of turn or is speaking more forcefully than any others, it is the chairman's right and responsibility to direct the over-talking person to remain quiet while opposing viewpoints are heard.

One method for ensuring that all participants are able to follow the flow of the meeting is to ask for feed back during the course of the meeting. While it's not always practical to ask for feedback continually, the appropriate point to ask this question would be when the end of an agenda item is about to be reached, or the beginning of a new agenda item is about to be started. By asking for feedback at these points rather than all at the end of a meeting, it allows the topic to remain fresh in all participant's minds.

===Introducing an Agenda Point===
When introducing an agenda point, the person who knows the most about this point should be given the opportunity to summarize it without interruption. Questions and comments should be left until the topic has been fully outlined by the presenter. This allows for all participants to be provided with the same basic understanding of an agenda point, which allows discussion to be productive and informative.

Several methods for allocating speaking time are provided below.

===Formal Structures for Allocating Speaking Time===
There are several methods that a Chairman might utilize regarding allocation of speaking time. Some have more effectiveness with different types of people and there is no catch-all method to ensure every meeting runs smoothly.

The more people are involved in a meeting, the greater importance it is that everyone be given the same respect and opportunity to speak. Interruption while another person is speaking is counter-productive and can increase the meeting times beyond the desired limit. It is the chairman's responsibility to ensure that interruption is not tolerated.

==== Round-robin ====
In this method for allocating speaking time, the facilitator of the current agenda item (typically the chairman, but sometimes another participant) presents the complete overview of the agenda point as well as any extra details. Once the facilitator has finished presenting the relevant information, questions and feedback are opened up sequentially (such as clockwise from the chairman). Each person is given an opportunity to speak without interruption before two-way discussion commences.

This method is lengthy but allows every person to have an opportunity to speak.

==== Other methods====

There are other methods that a chairman might utilize.

=== Adding an Agenda Item during a meeting ===

There will be times when the prepared agenda does not cover all topics that need to be discussed. In this case, during an appropriate pause, a participant might suggest adding a new agenda item to the end of the meeting. This might fall under a catch-all agenda item of ''other business'' or ''discussion'' near the end of a meeting. It is usually not appropriate to discuss the item until the appointed time, so even if it is a hot-ticket topic, discussion should be postponed until its appointed time.

When the new agenda item is given time in the meeting, the person who requested the item be added to the agenda should be given a moment to speak about the topic before it is dismissed from discussion. If a meeting is running long, it is usually appropriate to set these impromptu agenda items to a future meeting's ''previous business'' agenda item.

===Quotations===
Quotations on communication: (contributed by Vividh jcimargao@sify.com)
*&quot;It is better to keep quiet and let people think that you are a fool than to open your mouth and clear all doubt.&quot;
*&quot;We have two ears and one mouth that we may listen more and speak less.&quot;
*&quot;Learn to listen and listen to learn&quot;.

==Minutes==
===Taking Notes===

Minutes are a written record of what transpired at the meeting. Minutes can be of two types: ''Minutes of resolutions'' wherein only the resolutions taken at the meeting are recorded; or ''Minutes of discussions'' wherein the entire discussion that led to the decision is recorded. Minutes of discussion help us to understand the reasoning behind a certain resolution/decision while minutes of resolution can help the person who was instrumental in initiating a certain decision to remain in the background. If meetings are not properly conducted we may say that &quot;meetings are places where minutes are kept but hours are wasted&quot;!</text>

'''Blanching''' is a [[Cookbook:Cooking techniques|cooking technique]] involving [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] food (usually [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] and [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]]) in water for a very short time.  Blanching is often followed by plunging the food into ice water to stop the cooking process.  Though the word means to make something white or pale, blanching certain vegetables like [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] will make their colors more vivid.

Blanching is commonly used to remove skins from [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Almond|almonds]].

Vegetables are often blanched prior to freezing or canning. This helps preserve the food by slowing down or halting enzyme action that causes foods to break down, losing color, flavor, and nutritional value.

Blanching is similar to [[Cookbook:parboil|parboiling]], which also involves boiling food briefly in water.  Certain vegetables may benefit from being blanched or parboiled before being [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]]. One quick way to blanch vegetables is to boil fresh vegetables in water, with salt, for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, before immediately draining and freezing them.

a &amp; &gt; &amp; 0\\
n+a &amp; &gt; &amp; n\\
n &amp; &gt; &amp; n-a\\

&lt;/math&gt;
:Therefore &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1}}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}&lt;/math&gt;... &lt;math&gt; &gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}&lt;/math&gt;
:When a&gt;b and c&gt;d, a+c&gt;b+d ( [[Algebra/Equalities and Inequalities#Properties|See also]] Replace it if you find a better one).
:Therefore we have:

:Let us call the proposition
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + {n \choose 2} + ... + {n \choose n} = 2^n&lt;/math&gt; be P(n)
:Assume this is true for some n, then
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + {n \choose 2} + ... + {n \choose n} = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;2\times \left \{ {n \choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + {n \choose 2} + ... + {n \choose 2} \right \} = 2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ {n \choose 0} + {n \choose n} \right \} + \left \{ {n \choose 0} + 2{n \choose 1} + 2{n \choose 2} + ... + 2{n \choose n-1} + {n \choose n} \right \} = 2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ {n \choose 0} + {n \choose n} \right \} + \left \{ {n \choose 0} + {n \choose 1} \right \} + \left \{ {n \choose 1} + {n \choose 2} \right \} + \left \{ {n \choose 2} + {n \choose 3} \right \} + ... + \left \{ {n \choose n-1} + {n \choose n} \right \} = 2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:Now using the identities of this function:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose a} + {n \choose a+1} = {n+1 \choose a+1}&lt;/math&gt;(Note:If anyone find wikibooks ever mentioned this,include a link here!),we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\left \{ {n \choose 0} + {n \choose n} \right \} + {n+1 \choose 1} + {n+1 \choose 2} + {n+1 \choose 3} + ... + {n+1 \choose n} = 2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:Since &lt;math&gt;{n \choose 0} = {n \choose n} = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all n,
:&lt;math&gt;{n+1 \choose 0} + {n+1 \choose n+1} + {n+1 \choose 1} + {n+1 \choose 2} + {n+1 \choose 3} + ... + {n+1 \choose n} = 2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{n+1 \choose 0} + {n+1 \choose 1} + {n+1 \choose 2} + {n+1 \choose 3} + ... + {n+1 \choose n} + {n+1 \choose n+1} = 2^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:Therefore P(n) implies P(n+1), and by simple substitution P(0) is true.
:Therefore by the principal of mathematical induction, P(n) is true for all n.

'''Alternate solution'''&lt;br/&gt;
Notice that
:&lt;math&gt;(a + b)^n = {n \choose 0} a^n + {n \choose 1} a^{n-1}b + \cdots + {n \choose n} b^n&lt;/math&gt;
letting ''a'' = ''b'' = 1, we get
:&lt;math&gt;(1 + 1)^n = 2^n = {n\choose 0} + {n \choose 1} + \cdots + {n\choose n}&lt;/math&gt;
as required.

:Let &lt;math&gt;P(x)=x^n + y^n\,&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial with x as the variable, y and n as constants.
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
P(-y) &amp; = &amp; (-y)^n + y^n\\
\ &amp; = &amp; -y^n + y^n(\mbox{When n is an odd integer})\\
\ &amp; = &amp; 0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
:Therefore by factor theorem(link here please), (x-(-y))=(x+y) is a factor of P(x).
:Since the other factor, which is also a polynomial, has integer value for all integer x,y and n (I've skipped the part about making sure all coeifficients are of integer value for this moment), it's now obvious that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n+y^n}{x+y}&lt;/math&gt; is an integer for all integer value of x,y and n when n is odd.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Stylistic Features of Latin Verse and Prose=

This is a brief glossary of stylistic features often found in Latin especially in rhetoric and poetry. 

==Alliteration==

Alliteration is a common poetic technique used in Latin from the earliest surviving fragments to the latest literary age.  In alliteration there is a repetition of the initial consonantal letter.

===Example 1===
&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Latin&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;English&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Caesar cum Cicerone&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Caesar, with Cicero&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Veni,Vidi,Vici&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;I came, I saw, I conquered&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;bellum bonum&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;good war&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

==Hyperbaton==

Hyperbaton is the arranging of words in a particular manner to produce an effect.  Hyperbaton is used often in Latin literature because Latin syntax is far more flexible than English.

===Example 2===

&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Latin&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;magnae periculo opes&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Analysis: The word 'periculo' separates the words 'magnae' and 'opes'.

==Hendiadyon==

Hendiadyon is a rhetorical and poetic technique that uses the juxtaposition of two or more words with a similar meaning to reinforce an idea.

==Parallelism==

Parallelism is a stylistic device common in Latin in which two sentences have similar syntax.

===Example 3===

&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Latin&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;English&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Italia in Europa est.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Italy is in Europe.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Marcus ad scholam currit.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Marcus runs to school.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Analysis: In both sentences the nominative is placed first and the principal verb is last. 

==Chiasmus==

Chiasmus is the reverse of parallelism, because syntactic structures are inverted.  The name is from the Greek letter Chi which resembles an X and illustrates symmetrical crossing.  A good example is the aphorism quod cibus est aliis, aliis est venenum, &quot;What is food to some, to others is poison.&quot; The pattern is: noun, verb, pronoun; pronoun, verb, noun.

===Example 4===

&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Latin&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;English&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Claudiam laudo&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;I praise Claudia.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Venio ad Marcum.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;I come to Marcus.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

==Litotes==

The negation of a verb instead of using an antonym is a poetical device known as litotes.  Litotes is much weaker than simply using an antonym.  Litotes is often used as underestimation.

===Example 5===

&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Latin&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;English&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;non ignorare&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;to not be ignorant of&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;I&gt;As opposed to...&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;tenere&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;to be knowledgable of&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

==Anaphora==

The rhetorical figure called anaphora is often used in conjunction with parallelism where the first word in the first sentence of a paragraph or stanza is repeated in the following sentences. It is sometimes used where the initial word in a sentence must be understood in the clauses or sentences that follow.

===Example 6===

&lt;TABLE border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;Latin&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;English&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;timeo, ne non pueri essent boni in schola&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;I dread that the boys are not good in school,&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;timeo ne non puellae essent bonae domi&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;I dread that the girls are not good at home.&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;

Analysis: &lt;i&gt;timeo&lt;/i&gt; is repeated in the sentence, although not strictly necessary

==Epiphora==

An epiphora is a rhetorical device like anaphora except at the end of a sentence.

==Asyndeton==

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Latin&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;English&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Veni,vidi,vici&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I came, I saw, I conquered&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

As you can see, an asyndeton is a multiple nummeration without the &quot;et (and)&quot;

==Polysyndeton==

This is a nummeration '''with''' et:

Veni et vidi et vici.

Polysyndeton is marked by the repeated use of the same conjunction (et...et...et) or (neque...neque...neque). It is the direct opposite of asyndeton (listing with no conjunctions).

==Pluralis modestiae==

This is an advanced technique, often used in ancient fabulae, by Aesop and others.

It means that the Plural is used to show &quot;modestia&quot;, for example

&quot;officium magnum e nostro est.&quot;

= Component Oriented Programming =

Software components is at the moment one of the most popular buzz words in the software engineering community. This chapter surveys component technology, its reuse concepts and characteristics. Then, we will give a short overview of software architecture and its relation to component based development. Finally, we will examine JavaBeans as an example of a component model.

== The Software Crisis ==
In the year 1968 on a NATO conference in Garmisch Partenkirchen for the first time the &quot;software crisis&quot; was mentioned. It was admitted that software development is difficult, even so difficult that it has to be considered as an own engineering discipline. Also, the hope aroused that a way out from the misery could be the formation of a new software component industry and component market.

The state of software development was compared to that of many industries in the early 19th century: the products were hand-crafted, expensive, and error prone. A characteristic of maturing industries is that it fabricates products that are assembled of many small standardized and exchangeable parts.

An example is electronic engineering, where small electronic components like diodes, resistors and transistors are not designed for a single application but for numerous and different ones. They can be composed on circuit boards to larger integrated circuits (IC). A single part can simply be replaced by others, provided that it offers the same functionality. Standards like the ISO, ANSI, or DIN guarantee that components are compatible and interchangeable.

== Characterization of Components ==
Software development tries to imitate these reuse mechanisms. The idea is to develop software systems by assembling a set of independently developed components off-the-shelf (COTS) in a 'plug and play' manner.  

The notion of a &quot;software component&quot; is already quite old, but in recent time it has changed considerably. While in the early days of programming, software components were mostly seen as source code modules like FORTRAN libraries, one has nowadays more requirements to components. There is no common definition of what a software component actually is. The problems are that the point of view depends much on the background of the author, and that there was in the last years so much discussion about components, that the notion of a component became somewhat fuzzy and ambiguous. 

Yet, there are a couple of generic properties, one usually associates with software components. A good starting point is a definition made at the ECOOP 96 conference:

'&quot;A software component is a unit of composition with contractually specified interfaces and explicit context dependencies only. A software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.&quot;''&lt;small&gt;Clemens Szyperski, Component Software, ACM Press/Addison-Wesley, England, (1998).&lt;/small&gt;

Next, we will describe the unfamiliar terms occurring in the definition in more detail.

=== Component Features ===

=== Information Hiding ===

Probably the most important characteristic is that components completely hide their implementation. The importance was stressed already very early by Parnas' information hiding principle:

''&quot;Every module hides an important design decision as well as its implementation behind a well-defined interface which does not change when the design decision or the implementation changes&quot;''


Components are like black boxes: The programmer knows, how the outside looks like, and what the component can provide, but he does not know how it works internally. At a first glance, this total encapsulation might seem like a limitation, but we will see that it actually is a help.
 
The application builder profits insofar as he can replace the component by another one, if it supports the same interface and functionality. In addition, he needs not understand the inner working, but only the interface of the component.

The component provider, on the other hand, can change the implementation of the component as long as the ''interface'' is still satisfied. The interface is a quite important term in CBSD. It is defined by ''&quot;a named collection of methods representing one functionality&quot;''. An interface serves as a kind of contract between component provider and component user. It should not only mention the services of a component but also its dependencies to its environment. 

The absence of source code imposes some difficulties that need to be solved. First, it must still be possible to adjust a component to the individual requirements of a user. Adaptation without knowledge about the components implementation is called ''customization''. Further, components must offer a mechanism to get information about the their specification. This self-descriptiveness is achieved by ''introspection''.

=== Context Independence ===
Components are easily transferable into different application contexts. As a consequence, components need to be ''self-contained'' software elements, independent from any other components. The independence is so strict that even implementation inheritance is forbidden, because it makes a component dependent from its superclass, and changing the superclass can break the component. Interface inheritance, which is a mere subsumption of feature specifications, is allowed.  
  
=== Implicit Invocation. ===
So that components are exchangeable, components may ideally not address one another directly, but through an indirection mechanism. A central registry stores all information about the components and interfaces. Each time, a client wants to invoke a method, it queries the registry for the required interface, which, in turn returns a reference to the implementing component.

== Component Models ==
The next demand one makes to components is that they are ''interoperable'', that means they must have the capacity to communicate with components programmed in another programming language or located on a different host. In addition, they must be themselves transferable to other operating systems and hardware platforms. These requirements are ensured by virtual machines, cross-compilers and ''middleware'' like [[http://www.sybase.com/products/developmentintegration/avakieii Avaki EII]] from Sybase, CORBA from OMG and DCOM from Microsoft. 

Components are not used in isolation, but according to a software architecture that determines the interfaces that components may have and how components can be composed. A ''component model'' provides a common framework in which components interact. Component models are programming guidelines that have to be followed so that the component can be used. Outside of the framework, the component is not usable. Two important component models are JavaBeans from Sun Microsystems and ActiveX from Microsoft, which is based on the Component Object Model (COM). CSBD owes its attention and success mainly to these two component models. However, no existing component model realizes all features that are expected of components.

== Impacts of CBSD ==
If one day CBSD really gets established in a large scale, it will bring fundamental changes in the way software is developed. Through Component Based Development, the process of programming components gets separated from that of composing components to applications. The hope is that components can be plugged together as easily as Lego bricks without the need for writing source code. Thus, even domain experts with rather few technical skills can assemble applications. 

Furthermore, CBD is expected to have a strong impact on the quality of software development:

* Due to the simplicity, the software development speeds up. There is no need to develop everything from scratch because one can buy third-party components. The shorter development time results in reduced costs.
* Components enhance the reliability of the software, as they are improved, tested and debugged over years. Aside from this, the composer can choose and combine the best components of different vendors.
* The extensibility and evolvability of software systems is improved, because components can flexibly be substituted by another component that satisfies the requirements

A few years ago, this prospect led to a kind of euphoria in the software development community, as components were expected to solve a lot of problems. Now, some disillusion prevails. CBSD turned out to be very difficult, because software consists of many strongly coupled interacting entities, which cannot be wired together in a straightforward way.  

== Differences to Object Oriented Programming ==
Often, components and objects are confused or mixed up. Component Based Development indeed owes many concepts to object-oriented methods. Component Based Development as it is understood today, builds on OOP, but gives a more abstract view of software systems than object-oriented methods. 

The principal difference is that components are totally encapsulated, as we have just seen. Components strictly prevent access to their internals, while in OOP knowledge about the objects' inner working is necessary, for example when inheriting from a class. This reuse mechanism in OOP is also known as ''white box reuse'', because the source code is open for insight and modification. 

Also, the building blocks' granularity is different: Components exist at different sizes varying from single objects inside a library to whole applications. In most cases, however, components are larger entities and contain several objects. 

== Composition Patterns and Software Architecture ==

A difficulty of OOP is the representation of interaction protocols. In object oriented programming, the global control flow is distributed over several objects. Therefore, modifications to the interaction protocols result in the change of several objects, which hinders the straightforward evolution of the system. Another problem is that the objects are only reusable in systems with similar interaction patterns.

Component technologies allow the representation of the architecture of software systems as reusable entities. Architecture Description Languages (ADL) describe a software system in terms of collaborations between abstract ''roles''. A role is a kind of placeholder for a real existing component. At composition time, the roles are filled in with components by means of separate ''connectors''.
 
The benefits are:

* Components contain fewer contextual dependancies and are therefore easier to transfer to other software systems.
* The interaction protocols can be reused.
* Software Architectures promote the creation of a well designed structure for the system instead of ''hacking'' the components together. A good structuring increases the maintainability of the software system, so that later changes can be undertaken more easily.

== The JavaBeans Component Model ==

JavaBeans, the mainstream Java component Model, was introduced in 1996 by Sun Microsystems. It takes into account most important characteristics which constitute a component. JavaBeans are defined as follows:

''&quot;A Java Bean is a reusable software component that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool.&quot;''


Together with the component model, Sun released a simple visual composition tool, the BeanBox. It is rather intended for experimenting with Beans than offering a professional IDE. For real world applications, one should better fall back on one of the Java IDEs like Visual Age or JBuilder that support the visual composition of JavaBeans, too. 

As we can see, JavaBeans do not necessarily differ much from standard Java classes. That makes the beans component model quite easy to use. But JavaBeans can have some features most normal Java classes do not have:


* Persistence
* Properties
* Introspection
* Event Communication
* Customization


=== Persistence ===
The requirements for an object to be a bean is to define a public parameterless constructor, so that beans can be instantiated by builder tools in an uncomplicated way (In the Point bean, the parameterless constructor is given implicitly). Secondly, one of the interfaces '' java.io.Serializable'' or '' java.io.Externalizable'' need to be implemented. The interfaces do not prescribe the implementation of any methods, but are an approval, that the bean may be saved in persistent storage as in a file or database. In doing so, the bean can be restored after an application was shut down or transferred across networks. The ability to store state of a component in persistent storage is called ''persistence''. Java offers a standard serialization mechanism, what makes it very easy to serialize objects. Alternatively, component can be stored in a customized manner (e.g. in xml format) by implementing the '' Externalizable'' interface.

=== Properties ===
The ''properties'' of a bean are all fields that are accessible and modifiable by public methods. These getter and setter methods should be marked as such by following a certain naming scheme: 

 &lt;PropertyName&gt;(PropertyType). 

The accessor methods, on the other hand, are programmed by the pattern 
 public PropertyType get&lt;PropertyName&gt;()
 
=== Introspection ===
The intention behind this naming convention is that it helps builder tools to find out how a bean works and what capabilities it has. As we have seen, a component has to provide information about its services, which is called introspection. Java Beans provides two mechanisms for introspection: reflection and the ''BeanInfo'' class. BeanInfos gives complex information about a Bean component, but have to be implemented explicitly.
    
=== Events ===
JavaBeans interact with each other by means of ''events''. Events are notifications, a component can give to other components, that something interesting has happened. An example for an event might be a mouse click on a button or the closing of a window. Beans can be source and target of events. To be informed about an event, a bean has to register at another Bean as a ''listener''. 

The Java event model realizes the observer design pattern with the effect that the inter-component coupling is reduced. Method calls require tight coupling, as caller and receiver need to know each other at compile time, while with events all communication happens solely via interfaces.

A special kind of event are '' PropertyChangeEvents''. They are used to restrict some properties to take only specific values, for example for a month integer values between 1 and 31. Every time, such a ''bound property'' is modified, notifications to all registered ''PropertyChangeListeners'' will be send.

=== Customization ===
Customization is done via ''Property Editors''. A property editor is a tool for customizing at design time a particular property type. Property editors are activated from so-called ''property sheets'', which display all properties of a bean. If a property is selected for customization, the property sheet finds out the type of the property, displays the appropriate property editor with the property's current value.  

=== Final Remarks ===
A big strength of the JavaBeans component model is that it is designed for simplicity. Developing JavaBeans is very simple, because a lot of behaviour (like the platform independence or packaging mechanism) is supported in the Java Programming Language by default. However, one can optionally equip beans with additional objects like ''BeanInfos'' or custom ''PropertyEditors'' to use the component model in a more flexible way. A second facility is that Sun designed the whole swing GUI library according to the JavaBeans component model. Thereby Swing components can easily be composed in visual builder tools. 
 
However, JavaBeans do not realize all features of a component model. A drawback is that JavaBeans are restricted to the Java programming language, while an important goal of components the independence of an implementation language is.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fuel, water, and space are very limited in a van or small vehicle.  Therefore, it can sometimes be a challenge to eat healthily on the road.  

There are a wide variety of foods that can be eaten without cooking:

Fruit -- bananas, apples, oranges, grapefruit, grapes, 

Vegetables -- broccoli, cauliflower, string beans, tomatoes, &quot;spinach in a bag&quot;.  

Breakfast cereals -- Advantages: convenient, tasty, portable, stores well for moderate lengths of time (a few months).  Disadvantages: somewhat expensive, full of sugar (with a few exceptions).   

Canned soup -- Canned soups are relatively inexpensive, durable, don't require refrigeration, and can be eaten cold or heated.  Disadvantages: often high in salt, more expensive than self-prepared foods.

Tips to reduce fuel usage:

* Presoak beans and grains overnight before cooking.  This will soften them up and reduce the time required for cooking. 
* Use an insulated container to &quot;slow cook&quot; your food. 
* Use waste engine heat.  As Laren Corie writes:  &quot;Even the dash heater can put out temperatures high enough for a lot of cooking, if you build a frame to direct the air over and around the food or container.&quot; It is even possible to cook ''on'' the engine block. After running for any length of time, the engine block should be hot enough to cook on.

==Sprouts ==

Advantages of sprouts:

* Inexpensive
* Nutritious
* Easy to prepare 
* Compact
* Require no cooking or heating
* Easy to find

Disadvantages:

* Require an ongoing water supply
* Require twice daily rinsing
* Some people don't like the taste

Keeping fit on the road can be more difficult, since you don't have a lot of room to store bulky training equipment.  

The ideal excercise equipment for vandwelling would be:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lightweight
&lt;li&gt;compact
&lt;li&gt;inexpensive
&lt;li&gt;durable
&lt;li&gt;effective
&lt;li&gt;multi-use
&lt;li&gt;simple
&lt;/ol&gt;
And such exercise equipment exists! It's your own body.
You don't need anything but your own flesh to stay in shape.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The primary question is whether you want others to know that you live in your van. If that is not an option, then you cannot exercise right next to it. You will have to move some distance away or go to a nearby park or playground.&lt;br&gt;
You will need some kind of workout outfit, which you can pick up on the cheap, because wearing jeans or some other non-sportive clothes will make you look more of a homeless person in the park than a sport minded individual.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The simplest regimen of 3 sets of 20 pushups, 3 sets of 20 situps, 2x12 chinups, and brisk walking or jogging for 15 minutes will give you the necessary workout to mantain health. 
&lt;br&gt;
For better shape, you will need to plan out a more stern regimen.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A simple online search for calisthenics will provide you with enough information to plan out your exercise routine.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
3 times a week is the minimum exercise you should get.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you can work out next to your van, this will save you time and effort.
&lt;br&gt;
Remember, staying in shape means you'll live longer and healthier.
&lt;p&gt;
Other ideas:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register at a (preferably 24 hour) health club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a magnetic resistance bike which doubles as a computer workstation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a soccer ball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an elastic workout device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt; yoga is an excellent form of exercize and you can do it in the center of your van if you stack things on the seats. Also removing one of your back seats will allow for more space.

==Heating==
Note: Much of what follows was gleaned from a post Laren Corie made to the Vandweller's list: 

How can you heat your vehicle on cold, wintry nights?  There are several strategies 

&lt;ol&gt;   
&lt;li&gt;  Heavily insulate your vehicle.  The more your vehicle is insulated, the less heating it will require.  
&lt;li&gt;  Bundle up.  It's much easier to heat you alone, than it is to heat your whole vehicle.  Multiple layers of clothing (t-shirt, sweater, jacket) are better than a one single layer of the same thickness.  Each layer of clothing traps a pocket of air.  The trapped air prevents heat radiated by your body from exchanging with the colder external air.  Layers of clothing also allow you to remove clothing as you get warmer.  This helps you to avoid sweating which can cause excessive cooling as the sweat evaporates.
&lt;li&gt;  Wear a hat.  Roughly [[http://www.merck.com/mrkshared/mmanual/section20/chapter280/280a.jsp 30% of body heat]] is radiated through an unprotected head and neck.          
&lt;li&gt;  Use the vehicles on-board heating.  If you live in a temperate climate, and your vehicle is well-insulated, captured heat (from the on-board heater and solar radiation) may be sufficient to keep you warm enough to sleep throughout the night.  
&lt;li&gt;  Build an air-to-air heat exchanger.  This will allow you to vent the excess humidity and stale air from your living space without losing very much energy.
&lt;li&gt;  Store heat energy in a &quot;thermal battery&quot; such as a tank of heated water, Nalgene &quot;piss jug&quot;, or a container of melted paraffin.  According to Laren Corie, &quot;...8.3 pounds of water (1 gallon) will only store 833 BTU for a 100°F rise. That is less than 1% of
the energy density of propane...&quot;  Melted paraffin can store much more energy in a smaller space.  
&lt;li&gt;  Set up a heat exchange circuit between your vehicles cooling system and the your hot water system.  Idle the engine for a while to charge your hot water tank.
&lt;li&gt;  Make a simple, vented, charcoal, or wood pellet heater, to mount on a wall, and either use it to heat the interior air, or to also put its heat into the heat storage, or both.
&lt;li&gt;  Sleep in your underwear - can be a problem in the event of a nighttime disturbance.
&lt;li&gt;  Personally, I think you don't need any of these methods if you have a good SLEEPING BAG - which is way more effective even than wearing a bunch of layers along with having a bunch of covers.  I've been living the van life for 2 and a half years so far and have got it down to a science.  - From anonymous vanman





You can also combine all of the above approaches.  Here's how Laren Corie describes one potential setup: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At this point [all of the above] may not seem practical, but I can assure you that it was a very practical approach for my Centauri Van, which was a small diesel, box van. The walls were an insulated sandwich of aluminum surfaces, and 1 1/4&quot; of uruethane foam (aprox R 8-10).
&lt;p&gt;
I figured that two 20 gal tanks (under the bed platform) plus the eleven gallons in the heat exchanger tank, would be enough to get me through an eight hour night of 0°F. It would not keep the van at 70°F but it would keep it warm enough for comfortable sleeping.  On nights that
only went down into the thirties, it would stay toasty.  This also considered Reflectix covers over all of the windows.  Fifty gallons of water weighs over 400 pounds, but you need to carry some water anyway.  Paraffin containers, could be arranged to heat the bed platform, instead of the interior air, and would require a lot less storage, while you normal water storage could be used to heat the interior air.
&lt;P&gt;
A two liter bottle of paraffin (votive candle wax)heated to just over 130°F will give off about 400 BTU as it cools to body temperature. It will then give off another 100BTUs or so, as it cools down to the temperature that the van air will cool to.
&lt;p&gt;
Two liters of water will only give off about 4 1/3 BTU per °F, so maybe 80 BTUs as it drops from
130° down to 50°F.
&lt;p&gt;
A two liter bottle of melted wax will store about five times as much heat as a two liter bottle of water heated to the same temperature, and it will also weigh considerably less.  Either one can be heated all the way up to the aprox 180°F that the engine coolant gets to.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Just call these guys, they will keep you warm

==Cooling==

Cooling tends to be more difficult in general than heating.  When you are cold you can add more layers, but it is more circuitous to cool off when warm.
During the summer, most vehicles heat up due to the greenhouse effect.  This is very unpleasant to wake up to.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block sunlight from entering the vehicle, preferably using white material on the outside of the windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with some method to actively circulate air into the vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Park in the shade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep outside the vehicle if possible&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;Install a 12V fan.  Check the power consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build or purchase an air conditioner that works by evaporating water such as a swamp cooler or evaporative cooler.  Note that this works in inverse proportion to the relative humidity.  Heat of vaporization is 5 calories per gram.  It takes 5 times the amount of energy to vaporize water as it does to heat it from 0 to 100 degrees Celsius.  So they are really effective.  (It appears, however, that some swamp coolers output humid, cool air; which in most climates except exceptionally dry ones will not cool you because the water vapor will condense on you heating you up.  You should run that humid air through a heat exchanger, exhaust the humid air, and blow the cool and less humid air over you.)  Apparently, simply cooling your face has a large effect.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleep in your underwear - can be a problem in the event of a nighttime disturbance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a peltier junction cooling device (such as found in 12V coolers).  There is a product that cools just your neck, or you could circulate cooled water over you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave a window open and put a screen to cover the opening.  I personally found the screen-like-material from window sunshades (the black ones with suction cups) to be ideal for this&lt;/li&gt;  -  From Anonymous vanman

=== Ground Source Heating ===



Ground source heating/cooling utilizes thermal energy from the earth to heat or cool a house.  Unlike the temperature of air which fluctuates throughout the seasons, the temperature slightly below ground is consistent year round.  A geothermal system utilizes this phenomenon to control the temperature of the house.  The system consists of three elements: an underground piping system, a heat pump and a distribution system for the house.&lt;ref&gt;Geothermal or Ground source heat pumps. (2006). Retrieved March 24, 2009, from Consumer Energy Center: http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/home/heating_cooling/geothermal.html&lt;/ref&gt;  During wintertime, the temperature below ground is warmer than in the house.  This heat is absorbed by the fluid in the underground pipes which circulates to the house.  The heat pump utilizes refrigerants which extract this energy and distributes it through the ventilation system of the house.  During the summer, this process is reversed.  The heat pump extracts the thermal energy from the house where it gets sent below ground.  In this configuration, the earth acts as a heat sink.  A ground source heating/cooling system only requires a small amount of electricity to power the heat pump which is why it is so efficient.  Unlike traditional systems, the heat is not created through a combustion process but simply extracted from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;What is GeoExchange? (2009). Retrieved March 24, 2009, from Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium: http://geoexchange.org/geothermal/geoexchange-explained/what-is-geoexchange.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermoelectric Solid State Heat Pump ===



A thermoelectric (TE) solid state heat pump operates based on the Peltier effect,&lt;ref&gt;THERMOELECTRICS AND THE 12 MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THERMOELECTRIC COOLING. (2008). Retrieved on March 26, 2009, from Tellurex Corporation: http://www.tellurex.com/12most.html&lt;/ref&gt; in which electrical energy is converted to thermal energy. A thermoelectric module consists of a thermoelectric material, typically semiconductors such as Bismuth telluride (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;THERMOELECTRICS AND THE 12 MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THERMOELECTRIC COOLING. (2008). Retrieved on March 26, 2009, from Tellurex Corporation: http://www.tellurex.com/12most.html&lt;/ref&gt; sandwiched between two ceramic plates joined with electrical interconnects. When a voltage is applied to the device, heat is transferred from one side to the other, typically against the temperature gradient. The direction of heat travel depends on the sign of the voltage, and thus the device is capable of providing both cooling and heating. The term “solid state” refers to the fact that the device has no moving parts, thus enabling it to run fairly quietly and requiring minimal maintenance.

TE heat pumps operate purely on electricity, so precise temperature control can be achieved as we can directly measure and control the current flow into the system. To date, TE solid state heat pumps are primarily used in cooling applications, whether it’s for electronic components that require specific constant temperatures, or portable coolers for personal use as in furnace filters&lt;ref&gt;Furnace filters Canada. Retrieved on March 26, 2015, from Unitedfilter Canada http://unitedfilter.com&lt;/ref&gt;. Large scale applications however, in this case the heating and cooling of an entire residential house, are extremely rare or almost nonexistent, due to the potential cost and complexity of the overall system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Chapter 2. Laboratory Exercises: Microscopy==

It is standard in botany courses, at the high-school level and above if not before, to learn the proper use of a '''microscope''', a tool or instrument of considerable importance to most if not all  biological disciplines. If you have not done so already, you should now follow the link to the Wikipedia article on microscopes:

* Read: [[Wikipedia:en:Microscope|Optical microscope]]

If you are not reading this text as part of a formal course, or for whatever reason do not have access to a microscope, you can make good use of a hand-lens or magnifying lens. If you have intentions of doing field botany, you should certainly invest in a hand-lens such as the one shown on the [[Botany/Plant_cells|previous page]].  Although a loupe will work as well (and some loupes are designed to fit in the eye socket), this device is not really intended for field use, and (like the hand lens) is more appropriate for close-up work at the desk or the laboratory bench.

=== Types of Microscopes ===

There are two basic kinds of optical microscopes used in class work in botany (there are many other kinds of microscopes used by botanists in research work) widely called '''compound''' and '''stereo'''.  These terms may be a bit confusing, because a stereo microscope is technically a compound microscope (the image is magnified by more than one lens) and you will find that all higher quality optical microscopes have binocular eyepieces, although all do not provide a 3-dimensional (stereo) view of the specimen or target. Preferred are the terms '''high power''' and '''low power'''; these better specify the use of the two types in the laboratory and not the quality of the instrument.
 
:'''High power microscope''' &amp;ndash; Provides (depending upon lens system) magnifications between about 300X and 1000X. A very small or thin specimen is placed on the stage (usually on a glass slide under a cover slip) and viewed close to the objective lens, typically illuminated by light passing through from below.  Used to view cells, tissues, very small organisms such as single-celled algae and bacteria. Attention to sample preparation is necessary to achieve good results.   

:'''Low power microscope''' &amp;ndash; Provides magnifications typically in the range of 60 to 500X. Specimen is placed on the stage and lighted from above or the side. There is ample room to access and manipulate the specimen while viewing it and for this property, this type is also called a '''dissecting microscope''' for its use in plant and small animal dissections. Although most low power microscopes have binocular eyepieces and give a stereo view, some student models do not. Sample preparation is not especially important; what you have is what you will see.

== Using the compound ('''high power''') microscope ==

Assuming you have access to a compound microscope, it is important to familiarize yourself with the instrument and the tools used to prepare objects for viewing, BEFORE YOU JUMP IN AND ATTEMPT TO VIEW SOMETHING. The reason being that you can damage the optics or mechanical systems on a compound microscope if you are not familiar with their proper use. Although the microscope is a simple instrument to operate and you will learn proper use quickly, proceed initially with caution. You should first review the diagram of a typical microscope as shown at  [[Wikipedia:en:Microscope|Optical microscope]] and understand where these parts are located on your microscope (which may differ somewhat from the picture shown):
:'''eyepiece''', '''objective lens''', '''coarse focus''', '''fine focus''', and '''stage'''  
You will need to become familiar with other features of the microscope as we proceed, but locating each of the above on your microscope is an essential first step. 

===Exercise 2A===

If you are new to using a microscope, an '''onion tissue mount''' is a good first exercise for a botany student, and you should follow all of the instructions provided in the laboratory module, preparing the mount as described.  Realize that the high power microscope requires light to pass through the specimen in order for you to view it through the eyepiece.  The onion tissue both lacks pigments (such as chlorophyll) and is inherently thin. Thus, it provides a readily available source of plant tissue material requiring minimal preparation for viewing of plant cells. This exercise will introduce you to some of the techniques and accessories used with the high power microscope.
:*Read [[Wikipedia:en:Microscope slide|Glass microscope slide]] and understand '''glass slide''', '''cover slip''', '''stage clips''', and '''wet mount'''.
: For more advanced information: Read [[Wikipedia:en:Microscopy|Microscopy]].
:*Read [[Wikipedia:en:In vivo staining|Cell staining techniques]], introduction and sections on '''iodine''' and '''methylene blue'''.
If you use an iodine solution, you should understand the basics of why it works as a vital stain. Iodine binds to starch, and starch is a storage product made by plant cells from the glucose produced by photosynthesis. The living cells can break the starch polymer down into glucose sugar for use in energy reactions as needed. Onion epidermis cells do not contain a lot of starch, so they do not stain strongly with iodine. Take a small piece of potato and put a drop of iodine solution on it (not under the microscope) and observe the much darker staining reaction.  A potato is a food storage organ for the potato plant.

;'''Wikibooks''': To me a Wikibook is like a sand castle. Imagine a kid constructing a sand castle on a communal sand box, participation is welcomed, but not required and as all people contribute some sand, there is plenty of sand for all, there is no need to fight over it or how the castle should be built, and when the castle is built it is only sand, it will be used again, what is important is that the sand continues to be added and kids come to build new and improved castles.

== [[Elements of Political Communication]] ==

Hi there,&lt;br /&gt;

Since there isn't really a &quot;peer review&quot; process that I know of on Wikibooks, I was wondering if you could do me a favor. I've been working on [[Elements of Political Communication]] for a year or so, off and on when I had the time. At some point (though I'm not sure when) I'd like to nominate it for featured book status, but I still have a number of changes to make. I was wondering if you could skim through it and give me a few thoughts on style, structure, format, or anything else that crosses your mind. I've tried to keep it readable, printable, and most importantly, practical. It uses a [[Template:Quiz|new template]], so that probably should be checked out for any potential issues, too. If it isn't really your thing, could you possibly direct me to an editor who might help? Thanks a ton, &amp;ndash; [[User:Runfellow|Runfellow]] ([[User talk:Runfellow|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Runfellow|contribs]]) 16:51, 16 November 2012 (UTC)

:In regards to functioning and structure beyond the accepted conventions there has been many divergent views. I will gladly take a look and comment according to my preferences.
:I'm not a great supporter of the featured book process, but understand the validity of the goal of providing readers the more complete works.
:If you are after a preview of the process (by having the general community review the book outside of the featured book process itself) you could place an announcement on the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]] or you could first attempt to get an idea from those reading/editing/interested in the specific work ([http://stats.grok.se/en.b/latest60/Elements_of_Political_Communication Elements of Political Communication has been viewed 423 times in the last 60 days]) by adding a information box linking and promoting a dialog on the talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:31, 17 November 2012 (UTC)

:One thing that I dislike but it is more a software limitation is having a large list of references/notes at the bottom of a page and it is one motive why I do not use beyond directly mentioning them in the text (or linking to Wikipedia where the reader can get more details and editors maintain the information).
:As an on-line reader I also prefer larger pages than a need to navigate across the work, especially if some of the pages have no real content in it. I have in my works attempted to join my need as an editor to have a larger view of the content with that reader preference (even useful for section printing) and attempt to provide a full chapter as a single page. Some people like it some don't but it can be done easily with wiki trasclusions and keep both sides happy (don't remember how it works out with the references/notes). 
:I like the entry page, I would only move the search box up a bit since you provide navigation into subsections a online reader that is revisiting or someone that is just browsing may need to use it more than once and having it in the bottom of the page in todays widescreen setups is a bit bothersome.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 07:47, 17 November 2012 (UTC)

::Featured Book status obviously isn't a huge deal, just a way to spread the word a bit more and have a little fun. Regarding the references, I admit the structure is not very intuitive for more novice editors, but I think it works well for the time being as a consistent system that avoids the clutter you're talking about. On the subject of larger pages, I'll look into doing an transclusions, but a) I'm also keenly aware of the average person's reading habits online and b) the eventual goal here is to expand the content of each page, slowly but surely, with practical and useful information.

== Migration of other controversial content ==

Hi Panic,

I was thinking it might be good to migrate most of the content from [[wikiindex:NewgonWiki|NewgonWiki]] and [[wikiindex:BoyWiki|BoyWiki]] over here. I'm not sure what the title of the book(s) would be; perhaps [[boylove]], [[intergenerational sexuality]], or [[sexual emancipation of minors]], or something. This [https://www.newgon.com/wiki/Debate_Guide debate guide] provides some interesting arguments, for instance.

I'm not too familiar with the norms around here. Sometimes policy can say one thing, and practice can be quite another. Are one-sided polemics considered okay for inclusion? I figure, someone can create another book with polemics from the opposing viewpoint, so in that way, balance between different arguments can be achieved.

On some Wikimedia wikis, the topic of adult-child sexual relationships is so touchy that even advocating that this type of content be included could be considered grounds for banning the user. I don't see any such policy here, but I'm not in a mood to get banned, so I thought I'd ask first. Also, even if the reaction wouldn't be a ban, I don't like to create content that's just going to be deleted. Thanks, [[User:Leucosticte|Leucosticte]] ([[User talk:Leucosticte|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Leucosticte|contribs]]) 23:51, 24 October 2014 (UTC)

:First I must confess that the subject in itself is something that I find displeasing in certain circumstances/context, but at the same time will acknowledge the need of making it visible and not hidden or made into a taboo. Humans are complex and society is often restrictive to fringe behaviors and minorities (for many reasons some bad others good). 
:Having established that I would support the creation of a work regarding the subject if it conforms to a textbook with educational value, there are already books that could probably include this subject maybe [[Abnormal Sexual Psychology]]...
:As for keeping a specific viewpoint you will need to cement that as the specificity of the scope of the book and provide for a book specific community record/forum to process and approve changes and core modification so that they may be consensual and reduce interference for non-contributors. Note that due to its controversial nature there will be a high probability that someone will attempt to get the Wikibook's community in general to delete the project. It would certainly need extra care as to stay within our project's guidelines, if so then it is all up for to the  value of the content and the argumentation for its existence here.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:11, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

== Cannot vs. can not on [[Computer Science Design Patterns/Singleton|Singleton Pattern]] ==

My apologies for the hasty edit. After some research, there does seem to be [http://english.stackexchange.com/a/4516 a lot of discussion] on the subject, and [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cannot Oxford Dictionaries] states that can not is also acceptable.

Cheers, [[User:Hardwigg|Hardwigg]] ([[User talk:Hardwigg|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Hardwigg|contribs]]) 18:09, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

:No problem its interesting how any living language evolves and is shaped by its use. Somethings we like or see as logical and acceptable others we dislike or become annoyances by how they create exceptions to normal rules. In this case I see &quot;cannot&quot; as a creep of the way dialog passes into writing and as an unnecessary innovation that at best shows a modicum of laziness as I can't see any added value...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:40, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

:: &amp;lt;dropping in on the conversation&amp;gt;
:: Interesting.  To me &quot;cannot&quot; and &quot;can not&quot; mean different things, and &quot;cannot&quot; is much more often wanted.  If somebody can not do something, I understand that to mean they are able to not do it, where as if they cannot do it, I understand they are unable to do it.  When someone uses &quot;can not&quot; to mean the second thing rather than the first, I find I have to stop and think about what they mean.  Presumably, this is because I find the distinction between the two meanings useful; if I were, occasionally, trying to say the first thing out loud, I would carefully enunciate a pause between &quot;can&quot; and &quot;not&quot; to emphasize that &quot;not&quot; is grouped with the word after it rather than the &quot;can&quot; before it, and I imitate that pause or lack of pause in my orthography.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 22:27, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

Thank you for the corrections. For the &quot;program text&quot; term, I want to say I read it in a few books, one of which was a concurrent programming book. It makes sense when you think about it, however it isn't a widely conjured term and may raise a copyright conflict. Thanks.

== Interwikis from Wikijunior ==

Hi, there are two reasons why I usually remove interwiki links from Wikijunior: WJ is &quot;censored&quot; (in a way) to age appropriate material, and Wikipedia isn't. It therefore seems wrong to encourage the reader to link to Wikipedia. Secondly, given the intended readership of Wikijunior, I don't think it is helpful even if the content is suitable for them to be sent to Wikipedia - they aren't really going to find the Wikipedia article in most cases helpful. Obviously I'm not going to remove the links you re-added, but I wanted to explain why I think it is inappropriate - thanks.  [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 11:45, 27 May 2015 (UTC)

:The Wikilinks in themselves aren't objectionable or guaranteed to violate the expectation of safety (if so then I would agree that they should be removed), that expectation of safety can only exist if other &quot;censorship&quot; is actual, as the reader is most probably using the Internet. Making that logic flawed in the sense that you are censoring content outside of Wikijunior.
:If we took your position further we should remove all links to other Wikibook content or even the communal areas from ever being displayed to a Wikijunior reader.
:The &quot;censorship&quot; guarantees and exists only so that it complements parental control or other intentional censorship used for the reader to stay confined to the wikijunior domain/space and other safe locations.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:12, 27 May 2015 (UTC)

:: Any argument if taken to absurdity becomes absurd; that's irrelevant to the merits of the original argument.  I agree with QU; primary text in wikijunior books oughtn't generally be wikilinked to wikipedia.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:22, 28 May 2015 (UTC)

:::Not if the argument is absurd in the first place, the idea that we should censure links from a wikipage in a wikiproject unless the content is directly objectionable in general and in particular in regards to Wikijunior. With the added trouble that it is even not a consistent and communal agreed censorship task. The only policy we have to guide content on Wikijunior mentions only &quot;kid friendly content&quot;, I strongly believe that the Wikibooks community in general can not easily agree what &quot;kid safety&quot; is let alone be allowed to enforce on others and their content unwritten censorship guidelines that goes beyond a very basic level of common sense.
:::So to me it seems nonsensical that links to Wikipedia be regarded differently to any other link to non-Wikijunior content that is displayed to a Wikibook reader. That was the point I was adding to demonstrate that this type of censorship is mostly pointless and ineffective since the user is already presented links to other sites on the navigational aids and &quot;promotions&quot; inside Wikijunior (including navigational aids, automations like clicking in an image, etc...). 
:::You are free to agree with QU and not wikilink to wikipedia in your own contributions but acting beyond that without any editorial regard is unacceptable. In any case I've been here for a long time and know well those that push for stronger diwikification of our content in general (to a point that I regard it as covert vandalism when not done in considered moderation and try to fix it when I detect the practice) but this is not the topic of the discussion here.
:::The topic as presented by QuiteUnusual is about a generic censorship to outside links (not only wikilinks) from Wikijunior. To what I disagreed and see as futile and impractical if not targeting very specific content.
:::I would object to generic, informal and overreaching censorship of content anywhere, that is an anathema to what out project(s) stand for.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:01, 29 May 2015 (UTC)

== Portuguese books split ==

Thanks for [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Portuguese/Contents&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=2413903 adding the TODO box here]. I agree they should perhaps be merged, but did you notice as well that there's actually a three way split in these books. There's a [[Brazilian Portuguese]] book. And a book which has two bits to it [[Portuguese/Contents#Courses for Portuguese spoken in Brazil]] and [[Contents#Courses for Portuguese spoken in Portugal]]. So that's messy. It seems to me those first two should definitely be merged somehow, even if the brazil/portugal separation remains.  Some old discussion here: [[Contents#Separate_wikibook_Brazilian_Portuguese]].  Very old discussion in fact. One day I should just ''be bold'' and merge it somehow. -- [[User:Harry Wood|Harry Wood]] ([[User talk:Harry Wood|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Harry Wood|contribs]]) 14:10, 28 May 2015 (UTC)

== Suicide is caused by Depression! ==

Suicide people they commuting suicide had Depression.And have not done it in purpose but cause of emotional mental disorder.

:I agree that most suicides are committed under a depressive mental state. I don't agree that depression as a singular and continued mental state exists by itself, manics (the clinical term being manic depressives) focus continually on depressive thoughts but the mania is the problem (this gets more complex if we focus on how the mania is originated it may be because of internal or external stimuli). In any case depressive thoughts are not the singular motive for suicide as the work states (I believe the work is why you are posting on my talk). --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 14:27, 5 November 2015 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Appendice via templates==

I'd like other users' opinions on this idea.  A lot of books on mathematics, especially on more advanced topics, relegate some of the necessary math to appendices.  For example, a book on tensor calculus might in an appendix contain enough topology to define a differential manifold.  I like this organization; it allows readers who are already familiar with the prerequisite material to jump into the real content right away, and it provides a handy reference.

Here is my idea: we could use templates to build up these appendices.  If the book I am working on needs an intro to set theory in the appendix, I just add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{math/set theory}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the appropriate place. [[User:CyborgTosser|CyborgTosser]] 22:24, 23 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:I am a bit confused as to what you mean.  But probably because I don't fully understand what the above code would do.  Is the idea to build up a standard set of appendices that could be used in any wikibook? [[User:Thenub314|Thenub314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 10:14, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

I think this book is a great idea. 

I'm currently studying for a BA in Linguistics at UCL. I'll try to contribute where I can.

--[[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie Roberto]] 02:02, 24 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Sections ==

Does anyone have any thoughts about what sections there should be within this book?

I'm not convinced that [[Linguistics:_Typology|Typoloy]] should be included. Also, perhaps [[Linguistics:_Historical|Historical Linguistics]] should be part of [[History]], not Linguistics? [[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie Roberto]] ('''changed due to mis-read''')

:Well typology is pretty important in modern linguistics -- if you believe that the goal of linguistics is to understand how the human language device works, then typology, as the basic tool of determining what can and can't be considered language, is pretty key. Additionally historical linguistics refers to how languages develop through time, not the history of linguistics per se. [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 20:42, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

== Welcome ==

Hey, Frankie, welcome.  I was beginning to think I was the only one who cared.  Thank you for creating [[template:LinguisticsTOC]].  I'm not a big MediaWiki guru, so any help people can give improving the markup in ways like this will be really appreciated.

::I'm new to wikis in general, so I'm not that good on the markup either. I took the idea from the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]. There doesn't seem to be a clear way to organise the books yet. [[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie Roberto]]

[[User:ACW|ACW]] 18:04, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Hi, I'm quite new to linguistics (and rather interested in reading this wikibook). Nonetheless, I do know something on the subject and would gladly aid in it's development if y'all'll have me. (My knowledge goes as far as my edits in the [[conworld]] wikibook.) - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 19:25, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Historical linguistics ==

The term ''historical linguistics'' doesn't refer to the history of linguistic scholarship; discussion of that, I would agree, belongs to a history book, albeit a rather specialized one, and not to a linguistics book, especially a broad overview like this one.

Instead, historical linguistics is a branch of linguistics proper.  It's the study of how languages change over time, and how those changes contribute to the way a language appears at any given moment.  Sometimes it is called ''diachronic'' linguistics, as opposed to ''synchronic'' linguistics, which studies language at a particular point in time.

Historical linguistics uses a theory very similar to the theory of biological evolution (descent with modification).  People are always accidentally changing their languages in little ways; those changes get passed to children when they are learning to speak; changes that hurt communication tend to be eliminated, while changes that help communication tend to spread.

Just as in biology there are families of organisms that were once single species, in historical linguistics we observe that there are language families which have descended from a single archaic language.

The most famous achievement of historical linguistics to date is the Indoeuropean theory, which shows that most of the languages in a wide band stretching from Europe through Central Asia to India are related, and are descended from a single ancestral language, called Proto-Indo-European.  By careful comparative methods, linguists have been able to reconstruct much of the grammar and vocabulary of this extinct language, the common ancestor of Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, and all the Germanic and Slavic languages as well.  It's a stunning achievement, and one that well deserves discussion in a linguistics textbook.  Well, in my opinion anyway.

[[User:ACW|ACW]] 18:18, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

A historical linguistics section is also the best place to introduce dialectology, and demystify the whole notion of ''dialect''.

[[User:ACW|ACW]] 18:29, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)


I agree; I really think the field ought to be called &quot;Language Change&quot;, since it deals with the general theory of how language changes over time, not only with &quot;historical&quot; languages.

== Language diversity ==

I feel funny that there seems to be no place in the current table of contents for discussing ''the current state of language on our planet''.  A lot of beginners' questions fall into this area.  &quot;How many languages are there?&quot;  &quot;Which languages have the most speakers?&quot;  &quot;What are American Indian languages really like?&quot;  &quot;What about those weird clicks?&quot;

So I think we should really have a section about that, where we can discuss the amazing variety of languages that exist, and give some handle on the most important languages and language families to be aware of, as well as their basic characteristics.

This kind of hooks into historical linguistics, since the historical viewpoint is the most useful way to understand how languages are distributed around the world today.  

It also may be what I had in mind when I proposed a chapter on typology -- some place to show off some weird wonders, and show how wildly languages can vary from each other.

This proposed section would also be a good place to talk about language oppression, endangerment, and extinction.

[[User:ACW|ACW]] 18:27, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)


== Syntax Trees ==

If we're going to go deep into generative grammar, we'll need to be able to draw lots of trees. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Xbar_tree.png X-bar tree] for an example. Anyone got any ideas on how best to do this? [[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie Roberto]]

OpenOffice.org's Draw program tends to work fairly well for these sorts of things. Then there's also Dia, or Microsoft Visio. That's also assuming that we get to the topic of generative grammar in this book. That subject is so large that it may be better to create a book covering just generative grammar to simplify things for the introductory book, and begin the generative grammar book with the assumption that the reader has a basic understanding of linguistics. [[User:NathanClayton|NathanClayton]]

[[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie]] is right that we will need ''some'' trees when we get to talking about syntax.  It's an iconography that everyone in the field uses, and we must at least talk about the basics even if we don't get into debated areas.  So [[User:NathanClayton|Nathan's]] suggestions of how to draw them will definitely be useful.  Assuming we make any more progress on this book at all.  [[User:ACW|ACW]] 22:00, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

It may be worth noting that there are other, more text-friendly forms, like bracket notation that may be useful if we don't want to make large amounts of trees. Although, ACW is right - tree notation is used by just about everyone, so even if we don't use it through this wikibook we should at least include a few so that prospective students can understand how they work. -- [[User:Kirby1024|Kirby1024]] 08:43, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

== Page names ==

Just a quick note to say that I've moved the all the subpages from things like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Linguistics: Hello]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Linguistics/Hello]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  It's much easier to work with and seems to be the new standard in wikibooks.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

== Keep it up ==

I have recently discovered the conlangs (constructed languages) (which I don't know if that's common among linguistics students and teachers) and joined the [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html|CONLANG list], on which I don't know half (actually a lot more than that) the things they're talking about. It looks like this will help me (if it gets finished). So thanks and keep it up! [[User:Leon math|Leon math]] 23:26, 30 July 2007 (UTC)

== Style ==

Reading the introduction I see that italics seem to be way overused. Does Wikibooks have a stylistic policy on this sort of thing? In my opinion italics should probably only be used for introducing new terminology and examples from languages, and bold text very sparingly. [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 20:42, 3 August 2009 (UTC)
::My personal opinion is that ''introduction'' of '''new terms''' should come in bold, italics should be used for ''emphasis'' in ''explanations'', and capitals should be used to indicate stress in ex-AM-ples. And that's how I do it when I write linguistic articles, because that's how I was trained. --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 11:54, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

== Phonetics vs. Phonology ==

I am concerned that the phonetics chapter contains too much information on phonology (e.g. phonemes and allophones). Also, the IPA is arguably more of a phonological tool than a phonetic one. Frankly, I don't even know whether the chapter on phonetics should really come before phonology. [[User:Mo-Al|Mo-Al]] ([[User talk:Mo-Al|talk]]) 21:03, 3 August 2009 (UTC)
: Phonetics -&gt; Phonology is the usual order. I'm not sure how you can study sound patterns without studying the sounds first. [[User:Kayau|Kayau]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Kayau|talk]] · [[Special:Contributions/Kayau|contribs]]) &lt;/small&gt; 16:40, 9 May 2015 (UTC)

== New Sections ==

I'd like to add two new sections: [[Linguistics/Language Acquisition|Language Acquisition]], and [[Linguistics/Creoles|Creoles]].  They're also major fields of study in their own right, and incorporate pretty much every other fields except computational linguistics and phonetics. (And they may incorporate the latter, but I'm not competent to deal with it; I know absolutely nothing about phonetics.)  Specifically, I think Creoles should come after historical linguistics, and Language Acquisition after Psycholinguistics.  I'm going to add them unless anybody can provide a reasonable objection, but I'll add them at the end if people would rather I do that. 

I'd also like to add three more: [[Linguistics/Neurolinguistics|Neurolinguistics]], [[Linguistics/Discourse|Discourse Analysis]], and [[Linguistics/Signed Languages|Signed Languages]] though my experience there would provide fairly minimal articles, albeit more complete than a few on here, and I'm really not sure where to put those. --[[User:Quintucket|Quintucket]] ([[User talk:Quintucket|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Quintucket|contribs]]) 11:51, 30 December 2011 (UTC)

== Restructuring ==

I plan to restructure the book as follows:

* Intro
* Part I: Traditional Areas of Theoretical Linguistics
** Phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, discourse analysis&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* Part II: Language as Signs
** Sign languages, orthography
* Part II: Language and the Human Mind
** Psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;, language acquisition, evolutionary linguistics
* Part III: Variation and Diversity in Language
** Typology, historical linguistics, dialectology and creole*, sociolinguistics, anthropological linguistics**

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;I decided to widen the scope of the Creoles section as a full chapter seems excessive for an introductory book.
&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;New chapters.

I have also decided to scrap computational linguistics as it seems unnecessary for an introductory book. I'll keep this up for a week, and will be bold if there are no objections after a week has passed (as I do seem to be the sole contributor at the moment).

:I cannot judge whether you are right about that or not: you may very well be. However, couldn't you move more advanced stuff into their own subsection or even their own book?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Japanese has two main classes of words that function the same as ''adjectives'' in English.

;Pure adjectives &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;(形容詞; けいようし)&lt;/span&gt;
: Also known as '''い-adjectives''' these are distinctive as their attributive form always ends with the syllable &quot;い&quot;. Many nouns (such as 白 (しろ ''e.'' the colour white) become pure adjectives when appended with an い: 白い (しろい, ''e.'' white). Learners must beware, though, because several な-adjectives also end with the same sound (e.g. きれい).
: Examples of pure adjectives are the colours 赤い (あかい, ''e.'' red) and 青い (あおい, ''e.'' blue), 高い (たかい, ''e.'' high, tall) 小さい (ちいさい, ''e.'' small), 重い (おもい, ''e.'' heavy) and 軽い (かるい, ''e.'' light).
;Adjectival nouns &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;(形容動詞; けいようどうし)&lt;/span&gt;
: Also known as '''な-adjective''' these are ''grammatical nouns'' that form adjectives when affixed with &quot;〜な&quot;. Technically, the な pseudoparticle comes from a contraction of &quot;なる&quot;, the attributive form of the classical Japanese copula &quot;なり&quot;.
: Examples of adjectival nouns are 綺麗 (きれい, ''e.'' pretty), 静か (しずか, ''e.'' quiet) and 素敵 (すてき, ''e.'' lovely).

There is only a single irregular adjective; the pure adjective &quot;良い&quot; (いい, ''e.'' good). Even at that &quot;良い&quot; conjugates regularly and the only irregularity arises from the fact that it's a corruption of &quot;良い&quot; read as &quot;よい&quot;. Conjugations that include the attributive い are read いい while others are read よ〜 (e.g. よく, よかったら, etc.).

== Basic conjugations ==

Like verbs, we can enumerate some common conjugations of adjectives. Also, &quot;いい&quot; isn't special-cased, because all conjugations are identical to &quot;よい&quot;.

It should not come as a surprise that the な-adjectives — being grammatical nouns — &quot;conjugage&quot; by having the copula added. Exceptions are the ''plain present positive'', where the copula is omitted, and the ''polite past negative'' which has an alternative reading.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! || present positive || past positive || present negative || past negative
|-
! plain
| {{Japanese verb style|plain present positive}} |  〜
| {{Japanese verb style|plain past positive}}  |    〜だった
| {{Japanese verb style|plain present negative}} |  〜ではない
| {{Japanese verb style|plain past negative}} |     〜ではなかった
|-
! polite
| {{Japanese verb style|polite present positive}} | 〜です
| {{Japanese verb style|polite past positive}} |    〜でした
| {{Japanese verb style|polite present negative}} | 〜ではありません
| {{Japanese verb style|polite past negative}} |    〜ではありませんでした
〜ではなかったです
|}
The い-adjectives have a somewhat simple conjugation pattern. The politeness is only determined by whether the (polite present positive, in all tenses) copula is added.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! || present positive || past positive || present negative || past negative
|-
! plain
| {{Japanese verb style|plain present positive}} | 〜い
| {{Japanese verb style|plain past positive}} | 〜かった
| {{Japanese verb style|plain present negative}} | 〜くない
〜くはない
| {{Japanese verb style|plain past negative}} | 〜くなかった
〜くはなかった
|-
! polite
| {{Japanese verb style|polite present positive}} | 〜いです
| {{Japanese verb style|polite past positive}} |  〜かったです
| {{Japanese verb style|polite present negative}} | 〜くないです
| {{Japanese verb style|polite past negative}} | 〜くなかったです
|-
|}

== More forms ==

It can be useful to define a few stem forms for adjectives as these form building blocks for other forms.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! Pure Adjectives
! Adjectival Nouns 
|- 
! Stem
| 〜
| 〜
|-
! Attributive form (連体形)
| 〜い
| 〜な
|-
!Terminal form (終止形)
| 〜い
| 〜だ
|-
! Continuative form (連用形)
| 〜く
| 〜で
|-
!Imperfective form (未然形)
| 〜かろ
| 〜だろ
|-
!Hypothetical form (仮定形)
| 〜けれ
| 〜なら
|-
!Imperative form (命令形 )
| 〜かれ
| 〜なれ
|}

These then form the following derived forms:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Pure Adjectives
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Adjectival Nouns
|-
! て-form
| cont. + て
| 〜くて
| cont. 
| 〜で
|-
! conditional
| hyp. + ば || 〜ければ
| hyp. + ば || 〜なら(ば)
|-
! provisional 
| inf. past + ら || 〜かったら
| inf. past + ら || 〜だったら
|-
! volitional&lt;ref&gt;Since most adjectives describe non-volitional conditions, the volitional form is interpreted as &quot;it is possible&quot;, if sensible. In some rare cases it is semi-volitional: 良かろう, meaning OK (lit: let it be good), in response to a report or request.&lt;/ref&gt;
| imperf. + う || 〜かろう 
| imperf. + う || 〜だろう
|-
! adverbial
| cont.    || 〜く
| cont.+に || 〜に
|-
! degree (-ness)
| root + さ || 〜さ
| root + さ || 〜さ
|}

Adjectives too are governed by euphonic rules in certain cases. For the polite negatives of adjectival nouns, see also the section below on the copula.

== Imperative ==

The imperative form is extremely rare in modern Japanese, restricted to set patterns like {{furi|遅|おそ|かれ}}{{furi|早|はや|かれ}} (''e.'' sooner or later) where they are treated as adverbial phrases! It is impossible for an imperative form to be in a predicate position.

== Hypotheticals ==

The ''conditional'' and ''provisional'' forms are used to make conditional statements. There is a slight nuance to the two which is discussed further in [[Japanese/Lesson Conditional|the conditionals lesson]].

The field of '''syntax'''&lt;ref&gt;Colloquially this may be referred to as 'grammar', but this is technically incorrect, as 'grammar' also includes morphology, (as well as other aspects of linguistics in some usages).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the mental 'rules' that we have for forming sentences and phrases. In English, for instance, it is grammatical to say 'I speak English', but ungrammatical to say 'English speak I' &amp;mdash; this is because of a rule which says that subjects normally precede verbs which precede the object.

Academic '''syntacticians''' often study either the grammar of a particular language, or study the various theories of a '''generative grammar''' &amp;mdash; a theory which claims there is a universal underlying grammar in our heads, which different languages activate in different ways. The main concern of generative grammar is discovering the grammatical rules which apply to all languages, and determining how the manifest differences in world languages can be accounted for. 

However, there are many competing theories which do not make &amp;mdash; or at least remain neutral on &amp;mdash; such a strong claim regarding a universal grammar. They include construction grammar and cognitive linguistics. There are a number of grammatical theories that stand more or less in opposition to the perspectives of generative grammar, like systemic functional grammar or word grammar.

At the level of syntax, it is important to understand the distinction between '''grammaticality''' and '''semantic soundness'''. Sentences such as ''Me Tarzan, you Jane'' clearly make sense even though they sound &quot;wrong&quot;. Conversely, the sentence ''Colorless green ideas sleep furiously'', famously created by Noam Chomsky, doesn't sound 'wrong' in the way the last sentence did, but it is hard to imagine anything which it would describe. We can say that these two aspects of acceptability vary independently: grammaticality, or '''well-formedness''', gives the rules for how sentences must be constructed, but does not restrict their content, while semantic acceptibility may occur even in ill-formed sentences. When we say that something may occur ''grammatically'', we mean that well-formedness is preserved, with complete disregard for semantics.

==Units==

The basic units of syntax are '''words''' and '''clitics'''. A word is the smallest free form in language that can be spoken in isolation or in varying positions within a sentence and retain its semantic and pragmatic content, which we can informally refer to as its meaning. As we've seen, a clitic is syntactically indistinguishable from a word, but, unlike a word, it is phonologically dependent upon some other constituent of a sentence.

===Lexical categories===

In general, words and clitics can be divided into groups called lexical categories. This grouping is accomplished by observing similarities in words and clitics according to several factors, such as their distribution within a sentence, the types of affixes that can be attached to them, and the type of meaning they express. All of these factors can be taken into account together because words and clitics that correlate well with each other according to one factor generally also correlate well according to the others. While classifications according to meaning or inflection can sometimes remain subject to significant ambiguity, tests of distribution are generally very reliable. Words of certain categories are restricted to occurring or not occurring alongside words of other specific categories, and these restrictions can allow simple determinations of category based on distributions to be made.

While syntactic categories can vary somewhat from language to language, most languages nonetheless possess a similar set of categories. A typical list of such categories with their most common linguistic abbreviations is given as follows:
&lt;strong&gt;
* Noun (N)
* Proper noun (PN)
* Pronoun (Pr)
* Verb (V)
* Adjective (A)
* Adposition (P)
* Adverb (Adv)
* Degree word (Deg)
* Auxiliary (Aux)
** Modal auxiliary (Mod)
* Interjection (I)
* Determiner (D or Det)
* Conjunction (Con)
** Coordinate conjuction (Co)
** Subordinate conjunction (Sub)
&lt;/strong&gt;
The twice-indented categories can often be treated as simply a part of the categories they fall under; treating them seperately is unnecessary for the purposes of most basic syntactic investigation.

The last several categories in the list, from degree words onward, are referred to as '''functional categories''' in contrast with other lexical categories because their words have little lexical meaning but instead express such things as grammatical relationships and functions between other words in a sentence. Words that fit these criteria but cannot be comfortably placed in any group are sometimes given the generic label of '''particle (Par)''', though the term 'particle' generally refers to a much broader set of words and clitics than this, also encompassing some conjunctions, interjections, determiners, etc.

==Constituent structure==
Theories of syntax generally view sentences as being made up of '''constituents''', which are either made up of constituents themselves or are irreducible units. Constituents which are made up of multiple words are traditionally known as '''phrases'''. For now, we provisionally use this traditional definition. However, some refinements of the theory of constituent structure give a different and more specific meaning to the term &quot;phrase&quot;, which permits the existence of certain types of one-word phrases; we will encounter this meaning later.

===Constituent Categories===
For each lexical category, there is a corresponding constituent or '''phrasal category''', and taken together, these are referred to as syntactic categories. Each constituent is assigned to one of these categories according to much the same criteria as those used for assigning words and clitics to lexical categories. Consequently, because of the reliable distribution factor, constituents of a category generally may always appear in the same position in a sentence. For instance, in the sentence

(1a) I see _____

Constituents of the same category as ''the big man'' (e.g. ''the doll'', ''a fast, red car'', ''this quickly-moving snowflake'', ''Barack Obama'') may occur in the gap, whereas constituents similar to &quot;eats pie&quot; (e.g. &quot;drives fast&quot;, &quot;writes a letter&quot;) cannot. Note that certain phrases similar to the acceptable constituents, such as ''doll'' or ''happy camper'',  do not. The particular structure that can fit into our blank will, for the purpose of this book, be called a '''noun phrase (NP)'''.&lt;ref&gt;Modern syntacticians have taken a different approach, believing that there is a structure above the noun phrase, but this is outside the scope of an introductory book on linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, let's alter (1a) a bit and obfuscate the word ''see'' as well:

(1b) I _________

There are various types of phrases that can fit into this sentence, including ''fly'', ''am completely fed up with this'', ''read a book of linguistics'' and ''have been struggling for years to understood linguistics in vain''. Note that the final sentence is still acceptable, even though it's very long. These are called '''verb phrases (VP)''' in this book.

There are two other basic types of phrases. They fit into (1c) and (1d) respectively:

(1c) I feel ______.
(1d) There is a book ______.

(1c) can be filled by ''happy'', ''foolish'' or ''a little squirmy''. These are '''adjective phrases (AP)'''. (1d) can be filled by ''on the table'', ''in the drawer'' or ''at school''. These are '''prepositional phrases (PP)'''.

The type of analysis we are doing here is '''structural analysis'''. We are trying to analyse what sort of constituent can we can plug inside a certain part of our sentence. However, this does not allow us to see the forest for the trees.

===Constituent Analysis ===
Since our previous analysis has proven to be insufficient, we can take another approach, known as constituent analysis.

=== Hierarchical Organisation of Constituents ===
Yet constituent analysis is still not enough. In constituent analysis, we viewed our sentences as simple blocks of constituents that can be lumped together in various ways, but actual sentences in language do not work that way. Consider this sentence:

(2a) I hit the big man

Reflecting upon the meaning of this sentence, we see that there are three semantic components of what is being stated: 
# There is an action occurring, which is hitting.
# The speaker is the person performing the action.
# The big man is the person undergoing the action.
Thus it seems natural that &quot;I&quot;, &quot;hit&quot;, and &quot;the big man&quot; should function as units, while &quot;I hit the&quot; and &quot;hit the big&quot; should not. This was not clear in our previous analysis.

In addition, there seems to be a '''hierarchical organisation''' in the sentence. The phrase ''hit the big man'' likely makes sense to you, since it describes a real action: hitting a big man. However, ''I hit'' does not make sense: hit is a '''transitive verb''' which needs an object. This seems to tell us that ''I'' and ''hit the big man'' are two larger constituents, known as '''subject''' and '''predicate'''in traditional grammar. For now, sentence (2a) can be separated into constituents like this:

(2b) [I [hit [the big man] ] ]

We can fill up our bracketed sentence with our lexical and constituent categories to produce this:

(2c) &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;S[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Pr[&lt;/span&gt;I&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;] VP[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;V[&lt;/span&gt;hit&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;] NP[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Det[&lt;/span&gt;the&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;Adj[&lt;/span&gt;big&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;N[&lt;/span&gt;man&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

===Rewrite rules===
Going back to our previous example, let's look at a larger set of phrases which can be inserted into (1a);
* a cat; a dog; a fast, red car; a paper; a small toy
* the big man; the doll; the house; the zebra
* this Argentinian hyena; this umpire; this quickly-moving snowflake
* that big-scale event; that wolf
* every impressively large elephant; every person
* Barack Obama; Nelson Mandela; Mao Zedong
* He; she; it

What can we incur from these phrases? Well, we find that they have one of three structures:
* Proper noun
* Pronoun
* Determiner + Noun, sometimes with an adjective in between

We can thus produce a '''rewrite rule''':

(3a) NP → {PN, Pr, Det (Adj) N}

Where the braces indicate 'choose one from the set' and the round brackets indicate optionality.

Similarly, we can produce a rewrite rule for verb phrases and sentences:

(3b) VP → V (NP) (Adv)&lt;br/&gt;
(3c) S → NP VP

All of the rewrite rules so far are '''phrase structure rules''', which deal with phrases. We also need '''lexical rules''' to inject the lexicon into our grammar. Let's add some lexical rules:
(3d) Pr → {he, she, it, I}&lt;br/&gt;
(3e) PN → {Chomsky, Jackendoff, Pinker}&lt;br/&gt;
(3f) Det → {this, that, the, a, my, some}&lt;br/&gt;
(3g) Adj → {happy, green, lucky, colourless}&lt;br/&gt;
(3h) N → {computer, book, homework idea}&lt;br/&gt;
(3i) V → {defended, attacked, do, eat, slept, poisoned}&lt;br/&gt;
(3j) Adv → {furiously, happily, noisily}

Using these rules, we can produce sentences:
# We start with a simple S.
# We rewrite S as NP VP.
# We rewrite NP as PN and VP as V.
# We rewrite NP as ''He'' and VP as ''slept''.

This gives us our final sentence: He slept. Here are some other possible sentences:

* ''Chomsky defended a green idea furiously.''
* ''This green computer attacked Jackendoff.''
* ''She poisoned Pinker noisily.''
* ''It slept furiously.''

Obviously, our grammar is not perfect. There are many things that we did not take into account when we produced this very simplified grammar. However, this should give us a general idea of how rewrite rules work, and that will suffice in our beginner's book.

=== Syntax Trees ===
Bracketed sentences can get fairly ugly, as you've no doubt seen above. Most syntacticians now use another technique known as '''syntax trees''' to map sentences in a schematic manner.

Each of constituent is known as a '''node'''. Nodes are connected by '''branches'''. Lexical categories are '''terminal nodes''' as they do not branch out further.

Phrases are usually made of two constituents. This is known as the '''binary branching condition'''.&lt;ref&gt;Whether this is always true is very controversial. Noam Chomsky's Minimalist theory states that this is always the case, but phrases such as &quot;Andrew and Bob and Carol&quot; create a dilemma.&lt;/ref&gt; The head is defined to be the obligatory element which gives the phrase its defining properties, generally including the constituent category of the phrase. For verb phrases, for example, the head is the verb.

For instance, this is the syntax tree of the sentence ''I hit a man'':

[[File:Syntax Tree - I hit the man.svg]]

You may be wondering how we could fit ''big'' in the sentence without violating the binary branching condition. In fact, there are more layers involved than meets the eye, but the other layers will not be presented here.

== Movement ==
Recall from the introduction that sentences have a different structure in our minds than are actually produced. The process of deriving the surface structure from the deep structure is called '''movement''' since it involves moving things around. English has many types of movements that apply to a wide variety of situations. Compare:

(4a) It seems that Wikibooks is useful.&lt;br/&gt;
(4b) Wikibooks seems to be useful.&lt;br/&gt;
(5a) You will try to steal what?&lt;br/&gt;
(5b) What will you try to steal?&lt;br/&gt;
(6a) Volunteers wrote the ''Linguistics'' textbook.&lt;br/&gt;
(6b) The ''Linguistics'' textbook was written by volunteers.&lt;br/&gt;

In the above set, the a-sentence is the deep structure, and the b-sentence is the surface structure. Note that (2a) is not normally produced except in the case of '''echo questions''', such as the following situation:

(7a) A: The best website on the Internet is Wikipedia.&lt;br/&gt;
(7b) B: The best website on the Internet is ''what''?

B was echoed A's question because of disbelief, perhaps because he considers Wikibooks to be the single best website.

Let's look at one specific type of movement: '''inversion''' in interrogative sentences. Before we can do that, let's change our rewrite rules a bit:

(8a) S → NP (Aux) VP&lt;br/&gt;
(8b) Aux → {will, may, might do}

This caters for sentences like this, which readers are likely intimately familiar with:

(9a) I will do my homework.

Now, let's turn it into a question:

(9b) Will I do my homework?

Can you generalise a rule for this type of inversion? Here it is:

(10) NP Aux VP ⇒ Aux NP VP

Let's wrap up by looking at the two trees .

{|
| [[File:Syntax tree - I will do my homework.svg]]
| ⇒
| [[File:Syntax tree - Will I do my homework.svg]]
|}

Again, this does not satisfy the binary branching condition, but how to alter the tree to satisfy it is not within the scope of our book.

== Recursion ==
=== Adjuncts ===
One of the most important features of human language is the ability to process '''recursion''', which is why it must be introduced in our book, even though it is a more advanced concept. When we have an NP ''a book'', we can expand the NP several times: ''a book on the desk'', ''a book on the desk in the classroom'', etc. Each time, it remains a noun phrase. This is known as '''recursion'''.

[DIAGRAM HERE]

PPs are not the only phrases that can be added to another phrase recursively. Here are some other examples:
* '''Adverbials''': Colourless green ideas sleep ''furiously'' ''all day long''.
* '''Participle phrases''': He was standing by the door impatiently, ''waiting for John''.

=== Complement clauses ===
Another notable type of recursion in linguistics is the complement phrase. Consider the following:

I think John is a genius.
John is happy that I think he is a genius.
It is surprising that John is happy that I think he is a genius.
I believe that it is surprising that John is happy that I think he is a genius.

''that'' is known as a '''complementiser (C)''' in English as it is capable of producing '''complement clauses'''. We can generate lots of sentences in a recursive manner. Other common complementisers are below:

* I was asking ''whether'' John was happy or not.
* He is wondering ''if'' I think he is a genius.
* It would be strange ''for'' him to consider me a genius.

The clauses followed by a complementiser are called '''complement clauses'''. Note that complementisers were erroneously classified as subordinating conjunctions in traditional grammar!

==Grammatical relations==

Constituents bear ''grammatical relation'' (or ''grammatical function''), which detemines how they behave syntactically within a proposition.

In a simplified analysis, the sentence may be viewed as generally consisting of three major constituents, which play the grammatical roles of subject, object, and verb.

== Weird title changes ==

Hey there.  Just wanted to justify my &quot;weird&quot; changes to the linguistics TOC page.  Wikibooks now has a convention of naming books and their modules with slashes, like Linguistics/Introduction instead of with colons (Linguistics:Introduction).  This has a couple of advantages, namely that it allows the wikimedia software to notice that the 'Introduction' module is part of the Linguistics hierarchy.  Hope this helps, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

== More linguistics ==

I have recently taken interest in the [[Linguistics]] textbook and begun revamping the layout as well as adding material. Now, it appears that you are, for the most part, the only other major contributor to the book. Would you be up for a more focused collaboration? I would like to get this project to a usable state within a month or so. (By the way, your writing in the introduction was of excellent quality.)

== Training ==
The proper training  of the canine companion is essential to the coexistence of human and dog. While the task of training a dog or any other pet can seem daunting, the processes for training both everyday behavior and tricks are well established. Many people unfamiliar with dog training believe that it must be difficult, since so few dogs have any modicum of training. In fact, training a dog to be a well-adjusted member of a family is well within the reach of most people. 

Dog owners normally train their dogs to be [[Dog Care/Training/Obedience|obedient]] and loving, to do tricks, and sometimes to compete in dog sports. There are multiple schools of thought on dog training, which run the gamut from training based on escape/avoidance to so-called &quot;positive reinforcement&quot; training in which no correction is used. While positive-only methods such as clicker training are currently in vogue, much if not most dog training is still accomplished using some sort of correction at some point in the training process. The single most important factor in dog training is that whatever method is applied is done so consistently.

Dogs can be trained by amateur enthusiasts to compete in obedience trials, various dog sports, for use in hunting, and to serve e.g. on volunteer search and rescue teams or as therapy dogs.

Moving to the professional side, dogs are trained for personal protection, security, police patrol, drug and bomb detection, evidence identification, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Dog Care]]

Dogs cannot be convinced of the wisdom of taking medication.  They do not ordinarily swallow anything that does not appeal to them as food, and so giving them medication can be an arduous task.  Some dogs swallow pills with little difficulty, while others need their pills wrapped in a meatball or forced down.

==Restraining the dog==

If a dog does not take medication easily, excessive restraint will train him to fear it.  If the methods below do not work, consult your veterinarian for safe techniques to deliver the medication.

To open your dog's mouth, put your hand around his muzzle with your thumb and forefinger behind the canine teeth (curved &quot;fangs&quot;) of the upper jaw; lift the upper jaw with your thumb and forefinger, making sure the other fingers are not in his mouth or between his upper and lower teeth.  This should show you the back of the dog's tongue, where you can rapidly place medication.  Release the dog between squirts of liquid (or pills) to let him swallow.  

Any more restraint than this could lead to accidental dog bite, and will stress your dog.  It is best to consult a vet if this method does not work.

==Liquids==

If a liquid medication has a flavor that appeals to a dog, he might lick it from a bowl or eat it if applied to a small amount of food. Do not use a spoon, as dogs have been known to get carried away and swallow them. 

If the flavor is not appealing, use a plastic [[w:syringe|syringe]] '''without a needle''' or a dropper (either of which should be provided by your vet) to inject the medication into the dog's mouth. 

The easiest way to apply the liquid is to lift one of the dog's cheeks and squirt the liquid behind the last teeth.  Be careful not to squirt in so much at a time that it runs out of the cheek before the dog can swallow it or so much that it makes the dog cough.  

If this fails, for example on some flat-faced breeds that might not have much of a cheek, you might have to pry open the dog's mouth as described under &quot;restraining the dog&quot; above.  Squirt the liquid into the back of the mouth, behind the last tooth and towards the throat.  As before, do not drown the dog or give so much at once that he dribbles the medication.

==Pills==

Many dogs will take a pill as if it is a treat, without tasting it.  This is especially true if you train them to accept strange things from you by giving them a crumb of cheese, bread, meat, or whatever you are eating (do not give so many crumbs and treats that they become more than 5% of the dog's diet; '''avoid toxic substances''' such as grapes, raisins, onions and chocolate).

Placing a pill in your dog's food in the hopes that he will eat it accidentally is a simple way to get the pill down his throat, but it doesn't always work if the taste is unpleasant or the pill is large, even for dogs that normally eat anything.  Watch the dog eat to make sure he swallows the pill.

You can push the pill into a piece of hot dog or cheese (processed cheese slices are ideal - leave out to soften for a bit then just fold off a tiny slice, roll pills up in it, and give to Fido.  Remember to replace film, and refrigerate leftover slice until next dose is due), or wrap it in a meatball of canned dog food.  Try to make this treat small enough for the dog to swallow in one bite.  Some dogs will not take the treat if they see you putting the pill into it.  Watch the dog to make sure he does not spit the pill out after eating the treat (if this happens, you will need to force the pill, as described below).

You can crush a pill or open the capsule (if your veterinarian says this will not decrease its efficacy), placing the powder on a small bit of peanut butter, soft cheese, canned dog food, or similar treat.  Dogs often consume the treat and medication without further fuss, or you can place the peanut butter on the roof of the dog's mouth, where he is forced to lick it off and swallow the medication.

If these methods fail, you can force the pill into a dog's throat.  Open the dog's mouth as described under &quot;restraining the dog&quot; above.  Place the pill on the back of his tongue, either dropping it back there or placing it behind the back teeth with your thumb and forefinger (of the hand NOT holding the upper jaw). Close his mouth with both hands and hold it between your fingers (over the upper jaw) and thumb (under the lower jaw.  Lift his nose gently upward and gently massage his throat.  If this does not make him swallow, blow once into his nostrils while still massaging.  Almost all dogs will swallow.  Release his muzzle.

Observe the dog for a few minutes, to make sure the pill has been swallowed.  Many dogs, especially breeds that have large mouths or extra skin around their mouths, are adept at hiding pills in their mouths.  If you have had trouble with your dog, you can open his mouth and see if the pill is stuck to his lip or around his tongue.  If so, it should fall out and you can try again.

If you are unable to do this, call your vet.

*Mucous membranes should be pink
**Exact shade varies from dog to dog.  Check when you know your dog is healthy to establish a normal baseline
**Mucous membranes include gums, cheeks, and eyelids
*Normal heart rate is 100 to 150 beats per minute, but should be lower in large and giant breeds. 
**Take the pulse where the rear legs meet the body, in a shallow groove between muscles on the inside of the thigh.  Press gently with two fingers.  (Practice on the carotid artery to the side of your own trachea.)

*Normal respiratory rate is 15 to 20 breaths a minute

*Normal body temperature is 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit
**Check to see if the dog's nose is wet and cold as it should be. The nose may become dry during sleep or exercise.

Spaying or neutering your dog can be helpful both for the dog and for you.

*No possibility of accidental puppies (There are already many more dogs than there are people who want them, leading to many deaths.)
*Dogs are less apt to run away and/or attract stray dogs
*Spaying a female dog almost eliminates the risk of uterine infections, genital cancers, and mammary tumors
*Decreases aggressiveness of males to each other in the presence of females in heat (Unfortunately, it will not consistently decrease other types of aggressiveness.)
*Decreases territory marking, which aids in house-training
*Reduces the risk of prostate enlargement in male dogs 
*Avoids disadvantages of female dogs in heat, such as aggressiveness, discomfort, and discharge of fluid from the vagina

== Observation ==

'''General observations'''&lt;br /&gt;
This begins from the moment you lay eyes on the patient. what type of gait they are acquiring while entering to the cubicle? what posture they are acquiring while standing or sitting on the chair? whether they are using any devices or not?  Do they walk with a limp, how pronounced is it? Do they lean to one side?  Once you're in the cubicle you're still observing their movements.  Are they guarded, wincing, nervous, etc.?

'''Local observations'''&lt;br /&gt;
Once you've asked them to remove any relevant clothing in an appropriate manner (wolf whistles are almost never called for), you can take a closer look at the area in question.  Do you see any bruising (haematoma), swelling, inflammation, cuts (lacerations), stitches, bony abnormalities, etc.  Sometimes the clues will be more apparent than others.  One lady I saw had a ruptured head of biceps (she came in with 'shoulder pain'), which meant that her biceps muscle ended up being bunched up near her elbow.  She complained more of discomfort than pain and couldn't remember any traumatic injury to the area.  Needless to say, it wasn't difficult to find the source of her 'shoulder pain'.

== Joint tests ==

=== Integrity tests ===
=== Physiological movements ===


Physiological movements are divided into '''Active''' and '''Passive''' physiological movements ('''APM's''' and '''PPM's''').  All physiological movements can be performed by the person themselves and include the movements of flexion, abduction, rotation, etc.  APM's occur when they actually perform these movements themselves, PPM's occur when the therapist performs the movements for the patient.  The point is that during an APM, the muscle as well as the joint is being stressed, whereas during a PPM, (in theory) only the joint is moving.  However, on some people it's almost impossible to convey the concept of relaxing completely.  The following phrases may be helpful, although in my experience they almost never are:

* “Let your ... become heavy in my hands”&lt;br /&gt;
* “Relax your ... as you breathe out”&lt;br /&gt;
* “Let me move your ...”&lt;br /&gt;

If you are able to reproduce a symptom during a PPM, then you'll usually be inclined to investigate the joint further, as the muscle should have been relaxed during the movement and so may not have contributed to the symptom.  However, even though the muscle shouldn't have been active, it will still have been either stretched or compressed and so a muscular component to the symptom cannot be entirely ruled out.  This is the joy of assessment.  Assume nothing.

== Special tests ==

== Palpation ==
The therapist must carefully select the structures to palpate from the clinical findings they acquired from the subjective interview and physical examination.  Targeted palpation detects variation in temperature, pain, tissue structure and tenderness over certain anatomical features (such as tendons, ligaments and muscle).

'''Cyanosis'''&lt;br /&gt;
Cyanosis is when areas of the body take on a blue-ish tinge.  This occurs mainly around the lips but can also be seen in the fingers.

'''Chest shape'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Clubbing'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''Breathing rate and depth'''&lt;br /&gt;

== Auscultation ==


It's important to auscultate both before your treatment and after.  This is so that you can tell if your treatment has made a difference.  Obviously, if the patient is coughing up loads of purulent sputum after you've gone through the Active Cycle of Breathing, then you know that you're been effective.  However, when the results aren't that apparent, it would help to listen and hear improved air entry throughout, substantially decreased added sounds, etc.

== Spirometry ==
Spirometry (meaning the measuring of breath) is the most common of the Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs), measuring lung function, specifically the measurement of the amount (volume) and/or speed (flow) of air that can be inhaled and exhaled. Spirometry is an important tool used for assessing conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and COPD.

Spirometric maneuvers include slow vital capacity (SVC), forced vital capacity (FVC), tidal volume (TV) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). The measurement of forced vital capacity is the most commonly performed maneuver, sometimes in conjunction with slow vital capacity and/or tidal volume. A plethysmograph can be used to measure functional residual capacity (FRC).

Results are usually given in both raw data (liters, liters per second) and percent predicted - the test result as a percent of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for the patients of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). The interpretation of the results can vary depending on the physician and the source of the predicted values. Generally speaking, results nearest to 100% predicted are the most normal, and results over 80% are often considered normal. However, review by a doctor is necessary for accurate diagnosis of any individual situation.

The spirometry test is performed using a device called a spirometer, which comes in several different varieties. Most spirometers display a volume-time curve, showing volume (liters) along the Y-axis and time (seconds) along the X-axis. Some spirometers also produce a graph called a flow-volume loop, which graphically depicts the flow of air compared to the total volume inspired or expired. Flow is listed along the Y-axis and volume along the X-axis.
 
Flow-Volume loop showing successful FVC maneuver. Positive values represent expiration, negative values represent inspiration. The trace moves clockwise for expiration followed by inspiration. (Note the FEV1, FEV1/2 and FEV3 values are arbitrary in this graph and just shown for illustrative purposes, they must be recorded as part of the experiment).

The basic FVC test varies slightly depending on the equipment used. Generally, the patient is asked to take the deepest breath they can, and then exhale into the sensor as hard as possible, for as long as possible. It is sometimes directly followed by a rapid inhalation (inspiration), in particular when assessing possible inspiratory obstruction or restriction. Sometimes, the test will be preceded by a period of quiet breathing in and out from the sensor (tidal volume), or the rapid breath in (forced inspiratory part) will come before the forced exhalation. During the test, soft nose clips may be used to prevent air escaping through the nose. Filter mouthpieces may be used to prevent the spread of germs, particularly for inspiratory maneuvers.

The maneuver is highly dependent on patient cooperation and effort, and is normally repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility. Since results are dependent on patient cooperation, FEV1 and FVC can only be underestimated, never overestimated.

Sometimes, to assess the reversibility of a particular condition, a bronchodilator is administered before performing another round of tests for comparison. This is commonly referred to as a reversibility test, or a post bronchodilation test (Post BD), and is an important part in diagnosing asthma versus COPD.

The most commonly used guidelines for spirometric testing and interpretation are set by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS).

Spirometry can also be part of a bronchial challenge test, used to determine bronchial hyperresponsiveness to either rigorous exercise, inhalation of cold/dry air, or with a pharmaceutical agent such as metacholine or histamine.

Due to the patient cooperation required, spirometry can only be used on children old enough to comprehend and follow the instructions given (typically about 4-5 years old), and only on patients who are able to understand and follow instructions - thus, this test is not suitable for patients who are unconscious, heavily sedated, or have limitations that would interfere with vigorous respiratory efforts. Other types of lung function tests are available for infants and unconscious persons.

== Thanks ==

Thanks for your welcome, comments , and of course, this book!
BTW, it's quite true as what the title page said that this books in general needs more exercise, through writing the exercise seems to be always the hardest part. (I would also like to tell you that the partial fraction is partly finished, you may want to review it and add some exercises) [[User:Lemontea|Lemontea]] 21:44 25th October, 2004 (GMT+8)

----

&lt;blockquote&gt;εν αρχη ην ο λογος

In the beginning was the word.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Gospel According to St. John, Chapter 1, verse 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Logic is the study of the process of reason. It is concerned with the form of argument. Take the ''syllogism'', for a concrete and rather hackneyed example:


All men are mortal.&lt;br&gt;
Socrates is a man.&lt;br&gt;
_____________________________&lt;br&gt;
Therefore Socrates is mortal.


This can be stripped of its content and generalized to:

All x are y.&lt;br&gt;
a is x.&lt;br&gt;
_________________&lt;br&gt;
Therefore a is y.


You can then substitute what you like for a, x and y:


All cats are carnivores.&lt;br&gt;
Muddypaws is a cat.&lt;br&gt;
___________________________________&lt;br&gt;
Therefore Muddypaws is a carnivore.


Just as it is important to astronomers that their telescopes are functioning properly, it is important to people in all disciplines that their processes of reasoning are working properly. So logic is something fundamental to all science, in the broadest sense of 'science'. But nearly all logicians will tell you that what they are doing is not just philosophy of science.

Though reasoning is carried out by human minds, most logicians would say that what they are doing is not just psychology.  Though it is carried out using language, and we shall be talking about grammar, syntax and semantics, most logicians would want to distinguish logic from linguistics and the philosophy of language.

From the time of '''Aristotle''' and the ''Prior Analytics'', through to the middle ages and beyond, logic was studied in a largely verbal form, indeed &amp;lambda;&amp;omicron;&amp;gamma;&amp;omicron;&amp;sigmaf; (logos)  can mean 'word' or it can mean 'reason'.  There were various forms with nice latin names like ''modus ponens'' and ''modus tollens'', and if you want to become a logician you will need to know what those mean. But certainly from the time of Frege onwards, i.e. late 19th Century, logic has become much more symbolic, and it starts to look like mathematics, with which it has much in common.  But many logicians would say that what they are doing is not just mathematics.

Or if it is mathematics, there is a big question about what mathematics is. Replies to this question are known as ''formalism'', ''platonism'' and ''intuitionism''. Both logic and mathematics are concerned with structure in a rather abstract way - in the case of logic it is the structure of reasoned argument, whereas with mathematics, it is often, though not always, the structure of numbers.

The stuff that looks like mathematics is called 'formal logic'.  There is also a lot of stuff that isn't quite so mathematical that asks questions like: 'What are names?', 'What is truth?', and so on.  

The problem with saying more about what logic is than what I have said at the beginning, is that you start to use logic to define logic.  This is circular and self-referential.  Logicians know that circularity and self-reference can cause problems and ''paradoxes''.  How and when they do and how and when they don't is I suppose interesting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Introduction_to_Philosophy|Introduction to Philosophy]] &gt; [[Introduction_to_Philosophy/Logic|Logic]] &gt; Truth and Validity

Logic can get us from statements to further statements.  So, to go back to the syllogism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All men are mortal.&lt;br /&gt;
Socrates is a man.&lt;br /&gt;
_________________&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first two statements, or cliams, are called the ''premises'', while claim below the horizontal rule is called the ''conclusion''.  In an argument, the premises are things which you hope your interlocutor has already accepted - they may be empirical observations, for example.

Notice the convention of separating the conclusion of an argument from the premises with a horizontal rule.  An alternative is to use the &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; symbol.  A, B &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; C means that C follows from A and B.  Alternative locutions are 'A and B ''entail'' C', 'C is a ''consequence'' of A and B', 'A and B ''derive'' C'.

An argument is ''valid'' if the conclusion follows from the premises.  In logic, ''truth'' is a property of statements, i.e. premises and conclusions, whereas validity is a property of the argument itself.  If you talk of 'valid premises' or 'true arguments', then you are not using logical jargon correctly.

'''True premises and a valid argument guarantee a true conclusion.'''  An argument which is valid and has true premises is said to be ''sound'' (adjective) or have the property of ''soundness'' (noun).

I suppose I ought to say what an argument is in this context.  An argument is a progression from premises to conclusion.  Each statement in the argument is either a premise, or else follows from the previous statements in the argument.  So two kids shouting &quot;'tis&quot; and &quot;'tisn't&quot; at each other does not constitute an argument, neither do two teenagers swearing at each other.  This book is here to help you behave like civilized adults. If you wish to behave like uncivilized adults, please consult our sister project, Wikipedia.

Now sometimes you may see two adults pointing out facts to each other, and making inferences from those facts.  We might say that these two adults are 'having an argument'.  To be technical, it is a ''dialectic'' in which each side advances an ''argument'' in the sense meant here.

A mathematical argument is called a ''proof'', and the conclusion of the argument is called a ''theorem''.  Sometimes only the really interesting conclusions are known as theorems, and the less important ones are given another name like ''lemma''.  Compare how we use the words 'lady' or 'gentleman' - these words can be reserved to refer only to people of status, or they can be used to refer to everyone.  

Euclid, in ''The Elements'', starts off with a set of premises from which he derives several volumes of conclusions, all in a rigorous manner.  Such premises are known as 'axioms'.  Logicians are trying to do something similar with arguments.  We are reasoning about reasoning.

In arguments, mathematical or otherwise, each statement should be intuitively obvious given what has been said before - this is what is meant when we say that one statement follows from its predecessors.  Logicians have tried to replace this appeal to the 'intuitively obvious' with a set of rules, called ''rules of inference'', which form a special class of axiom.  Of course the rules of inference should themselves be 'intuitively obvious' - we can't eliminate intuition completely.

So to abstract from our example about Socrates, we can write down a rule of inference:

From the premises 'all x are y' and 'a is x', we can infer 'a is y'.

So now we have a project: ''can reason be reduced to a small list of simple rules like this?''  Compare this with Euclid's project of showing that the mathematics of his day can be derived from a set of rules.

In a while we shall see how far we can get with a simple set of rules called ''propositional calculus''.  This is a very simple system, in which it is not possible even to properly express the deduction made about Socrates.  But in presenting the propositional calculus I shall introduce some concepts and procedures which are useful for talking about any kind of logical calculus, in particular the ''predicate calculus'', which I'll talk about later on.

This book covers assembly language programming for the x86 family of microprocessors. The objective is to teach how to program in x86 assembly, as well as the history and basic architecture of x86 processor family.

When referring to x86 we address the complete range of x86-based processors (since the original [[w:Intel_8086|Intel 8086]] in 1978). This includes:
*[[w:IA-32|IA-32]] assembly, also commonly referred to as x86-32 assembly (Intel architecture 32-bit, since the [[w:Intel_80386|Intel 80386]]), a 32-bit extension of the original 16-bit Intel x86 processor architecture (used in Intel 8086 - 80286 CPUs). IA-32 has full backwards compatibility with the 16-bit x86.
*[[w:x86-64|x86-64]], also called the AMD64 or AMD 64-bit extension, backwards compatible with 32-bit code without performance loss.
*Intel 64, previously named IA-32e or EM64T, almost identical to x86-64. 

Throughout the book these terms may be used interchangeably when appropriate. A special notice will be given when covering 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit architectures and on any limitations to limit confusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Traditionally philosophy was divided between two 'traditions': those of Western Philosophy, which is commonly considered to have started in Ancient Greece and its colonies; and Eastern Philosophy, which is said to have originated from the regions of India and China, and is centred around the teachings of three philosophical schools which in many ways are like religions, Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.

In the west the study of philosophy has always been bound up with the study of physics and of logic, whilst in the east it tended to be centered around morality and political philosophy (which are also important in the west).

However such a division of philosophy may be a crude one. 'The east' is a huge area from which many different schools of philosophy emerged, and many more came from the middle east and other civilized and 'uncivilised' areas. Furthermore, many religions contain treatises on morality and politics, similar in nature to those of 'eastern philosophy', thus anybody who wishes to define philosophy into traditions must at least consider Semitic, Islamic and Christian philosophies as well as 'Eastern' philosophy when considering competing philosophies to those of the ancient Greeks.

'''Schopenhauer''' started a kind of synthesis between the Eastern and Western traditions by mixing ''Kantian'' ideas with ''Buddhist philosophy''.

Since the early 20th century, Western philosophy has been divided into the ''analytic Anglo-American'' and ''continental European'' traditions. In the 1700s, the English-language philosophers were empiricists, and people in continental Europe were rationalists.  Somewhere along the line, this has got twisted over.  Bertrand Russell was inspired by the German logician Frege and Russell's student and colleague Wittgenstein came to England from Austria.  The British logical positivist '''A.J. Ayer''' was inspired by the ''Vienna Circle'', which was finally broken up by nazism.  So by then, logic-centred analytic philosophy had made its home in Britain.  Meanwhile, ''phenomenology'' and ''existentialism'', which are experience-centred, were rising in Germany and then France with the work of '''Husserl''', '''Heidegger''' and '''Sartre'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|Vegan cuisine]]

== Ingredients ==

*125g dried [[Cookbook:Soy|soybeans]]
*about 3.5L of water

== Yields ==

*2L soy milk 
*about 2 cups of [[Cookbook:Okara|okara]]

== Utensils ==

*a hand blender
*a large pot with, ideally, a transparent lid
*a large can to hold the milk
*a wooden spoon or another tool for stirring
*a sheet of clean cheesecloth or dish cloth
*a sealable container for the okara (optional, you can also elect to dump or compost it, or [[Cookbook:Tempeh|ferment it]])

== Procedure ==

#Put the soybeans and 1L of water into the pot and let them soak for 8 to 12 hours.
#Strip the soaked beans of their hulls by rubbing or crushing them between your fingers. Remove the hulls and pour away the excess water. While the hulls have about the same density as the beans and bean splinters, you can exploit their high flow resistance for separating the two: Fill some water into the bowl, then pour it away quickly enough to drag the hulls with it, but not so quickly that the beans will follow. This process resembles the winnowing of dry chaff from seeds. It's no problem if a few hulls remain.
#Add 1/2 L of fresh water and blend until you get a creamy substance. Add another half liter and blend until totally smooth.
#Bring the raw milk to a boil while stirring, then reduce the temperature to minimum, put the lid on top, and simmer for 20 minutes. Attention: May overboil, check frequently. Removing the lid will allow vapor to escape and reduce the foam. Another possibility is to pour a little bit of cold water on top of the lid.
#The bitter odor of the raw milk should now be gone. Remove the pot from the stove and add 1 liter of cold water.
#Line the inside of the can with the cheesecloth so it is completely covered, and the edges of the cloth hang over the edge of the can. The following process will not work if the body of the can is much wider than the opening, though. In this case, use a large bowl instead.
#Carefully pour the cooked, unfiltered milk into the can. Then fold the cheesecloth together at the top and lift it up out of the can so that the filtered milk drips into the can. Rotate the bottom of the cloth against the top and use your hands to exert additional pressure upon the soy mass. Be careful not to burn yourself.
#When you're no longer able to extract significant amounts of milk from the soy mass, open the cheesecloth, and put the resulting rubberlike, crumbly okara ball into the prepared container. Store it in a cool place for up to three days - you may also freeze it. Note: The okara requires much more heat processing than the milk in order to be digestible, e.g. boil it or bake it for at least one hour before eating it. The heat exposure during the baking of bread which contains okara is usually enough. Alternatively, it can be fermented into a special variety of [[Cookbook:Tempeh|tempeh]].

The soy milk can be kept in the refrigerator for about 5 days. You can also use it to make [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]] right away.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{wikiversity|Pronunciation of Japanese}}
{{wikipedia|Japanese phonology}}

Japanese is characterised largely by its small number of vowels and consonants (five and fourteen, respectively). Pronunciation of each syllable is highly regular with the written system and there are only a few exceptions such as vowel devoicing. This is in stark contrast to English where the written and spoken language can differ a great deal (e.g. the vowel digraph &quot;ou&quot; in &quot;noun&quot; and &quot;cough&quot; and the consonant &quot;g&quot; in &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;giraffe&quot;).

Apart from a single isolated consonant (the moraic nasal, &quot;n&quot;) and double consonants (e.g. &quot;i'''tt'''e&quot; and &quot;ke'''kk'''on&quot;) all consonants must be followed by a vowel to form syllables. Double consonants are always a pair of the same consonant, though vowel devoicing sometimes makes different consonants sound one after the other (e.g. &quot;'''s'''u'''ki'''&quot; and &quot;'''s'''u'''teki'''&quot;).

Japanese has a great deal of homophones that make correct pronunciation quite important. While language learners may have difficulty hearing the difference between nuances like long and short vowels, native speakers are used to these and might not understand incorrectly pronounced words.

== The syllabary ==
There are five vowels in Japanese, normally transcribed into the English alphabet as: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;.

| &lt;u&gt;''o''&lt;/u&gt;ld
|}*This sound has no approximation in English. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel#Close_back_compressed_vowel
Spanish and Italian speakers may note that Japanese vowels produce the same sounds as their Spanish and Italian equivalents.

Japanese vowels always represent distinct phonemes and don't form digraphs — i.e. they don't blend together or sound differently when joined. When one vowel follows another they are pronounced separately. Examples are the names ''Sae'' (sa.e) and ''Aoi'' (a.o.i)

The rest of the syllabary is formed by combining the above vowels with a consonant.

Note that the sound which is written with a &quot;y&quot; is not considered a vowel, but a consonant. This will come as little surprise to German speakers where the same sound is written with a &quot;j&quot;.

The -i line (ki, gi, shi, ji, chi, ni, hi, bi, pi, mi, ri) can be combined with the y- line (ya, yu, yo) to create the ''medial y'' combinations. These are just like regular consonant + vowel syllables, in that they should be pronounced as one mora (syllabic sound).

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 2px solid #fd9;&quot;&gt;From this table one can see that the Japanese syllabary is highly systematic. There are a few exceptions, though, and these have been bolded in the table:
* &quot;si&quot; becomes &quot;'''shi'''&quot;
* &quot;ti&quot; becomes &quot;'''chi'''&quot; and &quot;tu&quot; becomes &quot;'''tsu'''&quot;
* &quot;zi&quot; and &quot;di&quot; become &quot;'''ji'''&quot;, and &quot;du&quot; becomes &quot;'''zu'''&quot;
* &quot;hu&quot; becomes &quot;'''fu'''&quot;
* &quot;wo&quot; becomes &quot;'''o'''&quot;
&lt;/div&gt;

== Mora ==
{{wikipedia|Mora_(linguistics)}}
Japanese is quite regular in the timing and stress of its syllables. The basic timing unit is called mora. Each mora is pronounced with equal stress and should take about the same amount of time. Two morae should sound twice as long as a single one.

The following take up one mora:
* a short vowel
* a consonant followed by a short vowel
* [[#Medial y|a medial y]]
* [[#Moraic nasal|a moraic nasal]]

Whereas these take up two morae:
* a long vowel
* a double consonant

=== Examples ===
* ''a-o-i'' / あおい (''e.'' blue): three morae, each vowel is short
* ''mi-do-ri'' / みどり (''e.'' green): three morae.
* ''sha-shu'' / しゃしゅ (''e.'' car model): two morae.
* ''ni-n-ji-n'' / にんじん (''e.'' a carrot): four morae.
* ''ī-e'' / いいえ (''e.'' no): three morae (note the long vowel &quot;i&quot;, denoted by a macron)
* ''a-k-ka'' / あっか (''e.'' to worsen): three morae (note that the double consonant isn't pronounced twice, just twice as long).
The medial y often takes a long vowel.
* ''gyūnyū'' / ぎゅうにゅう (''e.'' milk): four morae.

== Long vowels ==
A long vowel takes two morae. In rōmaji it's written with a macron: ''ā, ī, ū, ē and ō''.

In [[../Kana#Hiragana|hiragana]], it's written with an extra &quot;あ&quot; (a), &quot;い&quot; (i) or &quot;う&quot; (u) depending on the vowel. In [[../Kana#Katakana|katakana]], it's marked by appending a dash-like symbol &quot;ー&quot;.

== Devoicing ==
In standard Japanese the vowels i and u are not usually voiced when they occur between voiceless consonants (k, s, sh, t, ch, h, f, b, p). The phenomenon seems to have developed to facilitate the falling pitch intonation in the Kanto dialect. The mouth forms shape of the vowel and lasts for one mora, but the sound is not voiced. For final [su] in 'desu' and '-masu', all vestiges of the vowel have disappeared in standard Japanese, leaving a naked sibilant. Devoicing is not otherwise standard for word terminal i or u. Consecutive devoicing is rare, although exceptions exists (e.g. futsuka, 2nd day of the month, pronounced f-ts-ka). Devoicing can depend on context. E.g. 'Suzuki' has no devoicing; 'Suzuki-san' has a devoiced i: Suzuk-san. Some dialects do not demonstrate devoicing, notably Kansai. 

Some examples:

|-
| ta-be-ma-sh''i''-ta || tabemash-ta || ate (''to eat'', past tense)
|}

== Consonant variation ==
{{Japanese todo|This section is dubious at best in its attempt to compare the pronunciation of latin transliterations of Japanese to the English pronunciation of those characters. Once we get audio examples, this section should be removed.}}
There are a couple of consonants that are pronounced differently from English:
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;6&quot; class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Consonant

| &lt;u&gt;''g''&lt;/u&gt;ive or si&lt;u&gt;''ng''&lt;/u&gt;
| approximately halfway between these sounds, it is made almost like ''ng'' depending on the age of the speaker and, in certain cases, dialect. Nowadays, it is beginning to sound more like our guttural g, but the older folks may still say ''ng'', which was also taught in many Japanese grammar classes.
|-
| sh, ch, j
| &amp;nbsp;

|-
| ts
| ba&lt;u&gt;''ts''&lt;/u&gt;
| try saying &quot;fatso&quot; without the &quot;fa&quot;
|-
| f
| &lt;u&gt;''wh''&lt;/u&gt;o (in British English)
| blown between the lips, not between the lips and teeth; as if it were a combination of both H+F
|-
| r
| &amp;nbsp;
| similar to a rolling ''r'', but only trilled once making it sound deceptively like a ''D'' to untrained listeners. The sound is often described as being between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;.
|}
Except for the doubled consonants and the ''n'' (which we will cover later), consonants can never end a syllable. They can only begin it.

== Moraic nasal ==
Normally, Japanese consonants must be followed by a vowel except where double. There is an exception to this; the ''moraic nasal'' which is transliterated as n. It is usually found at the end of words, but can be found in the middle of composite words.

The difference between the moraic nasal and the syllables &quot;na&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;, &quot;nu&quot;, &quot;ne&quot; and &quot;no&quot; can be difficult for language learners to spot, while native speakers may have difficulty understanding incorrect pronunciation.

* ''kin'en'' (''ki-n-e-n'') no smoking vs. ''kinen'' (''ki-ne-n'') commemoration.
* ''hon'ya'' (''ho-n-ya-'') bookstore (not ''ho-nya'')

The pronunciation of the moraic nasal changes depending on what sound follows it. This is not so much an irregularity as a shortcut to bridge the sounds between the two morae. When followed by the bilabial plosives, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, the moraic nasal is pronounced like an &quot;m&quot;. An example:
* &quot;shinbun&quot; is read as: ''shi'''m'''bun''

#Note that before ''a'', ''i'', ''e'', and ''y'', moraic n is written ''n''' (with an apostrophe). This is to distinguish it from the regular consonant ''n'', which is pronounced differently and can produce different words. Some examples of cases where this becomes important are:

== Consonant doubling (gemination)==
There are four consonants that can become geminates (get doubled) in native Japanese words: /p/, /t/, /k/, and /s/. The geminate (represented linguistically as &quot;Q&quot;) takes up an extra mora, with the general effect being to insert a pause that sounds as long as a regular syllable with a short vowel. The geminate is /t/ before ch and ts, /s/ before sh.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Misconceptions about the meaning of quantum mechanics have persisted from its begining up until the present among laypeople and physicists alike. Most physics textbooks on quantum mechanics and quantum field theory focus primarily on the mathematical formalism and only spend a couple of pages, if any, on the interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Even the limited discussion of the interpretation of quantum mechanics is often presented in a confused muddled way. By constrast, most popularizing books for laypeople tend to oversensationalize and hype the &quot;mysticalness&quot; of quantum mechanics in imprecise language, leading to more confusion and misconceptions. In practice, most working physicists adopt a purely formal utilatarian use of quantum mechanics.  They work with it mathematically to obtain mathematical results which they compare to experiments without thinking much about the meaning of what they are doing.

This book intends to correct the confusion and misconceptions about quantum mechanics by presenting a detailed analysis of the pros and cons of various popular interpretations and thought experiments and leave it to the reader to decide which interpretation is the most appealing.

Prior to 1925/1926, there was much confusion about the meaning and implications of quantum mechanics, leading to many radical claims. Even when the mathematical details of quantum mechanics had been worked out, there was still much confusion. It took a couple of years and many philosophical debates before an &quot;orthodoxy&quot; called the Copenhagen interpretation developed. Over the decades since then, gradually, more and more concepts have been clarified and newer interpretations have cropped up.

This book intends to study &quot;problems&quot; like measurement, quantum entanglement, causality, determinism/probabilistic, etc.

Hokay, We used [[Japanese:Basic Japanese sounds]] to introduce people to the concepts of '''''mora''''' and the fact that each mora has a single kana character. (Except for the compound mora)

Now, this writing system page is supposed to gently introduce the reader to the concept of three writing systems. Then maybe link off into specialized Hiragana/katakana and Kanji pages.

My complaint is this - You wanted to delete these specialized pages because there were already pages for this stuff in wikipedia. But the wikipedia articles are meant to be basic raw information, not suitable for teaching. Our pages need to teach, therefore they have to take a different approach. This is why I'd vote for keeping the writing system pages, move the extra info on this page to those pages, and keep this page as a simple intro to the writing system. I'd like to hear your arguments for/against. [[User:GoodStuff|GoodStuff]] 16:42, 25 Oct 2004 (UTC)

is it &quot;yi/ye&quot; or &quot;wi/we&quot;?  As a seminative speaker of japanese I was taught that it was yi/ye and the charts from my time had them it the &quot;ya&quot; column.  Now all I can find are charts with them in the &quot;wa&quot; column.  Am I just insane?

After all, &quot;yido&quot; (well) sounds a lot more like &quot;ido&quot; than &quot;wido&quot;; and nobody ever spells the old name of tokyo &quot;wedo&quot;.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think the article is too mathematical. It claims to be simple, but refers only to maths. Since it is supposedly the situation for &quot;classical mechanics&quot; is there any way in which it can be visualised classically in some sort of physical form?

We can talk about negative curvature all the time, but until you state &quot;like a saddle&quot; no-one really comprehends what it means.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A few questions:'''

* Who precisely is the target audience?
** For example, Some of these texts could be most useful to students ''without'' internet access, particularly students in third-world countries where textbook costs are alone a prohibitive educational expense. But I doubt we could target books to such an audience.
** Another example: Arithmetic begins at the very beginning by introducing addition, but the tone is hardly suited for a typical student of addition: &quot;operations&quot;, &quot;numerical&quot;, and &quot;quantities&quot;, from the first sentence, are probably enough to throw off anyone for whom this section would be useful. On the other hand, if the article quickly becomes more complicated, then perhaps the initial tone is appropriate; so the question remains.

* Are the user names different from wikibooks to wikipedia, etc? If so, why? I wouldn't have chosen this username if I had known that someone else had it for wikipedia...

* Is there a mailing list or discussion page dedicated to the mathematics books collectively? If not, why not?

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Marker. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Marker~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

Python 2.x supports 4 numeric types - int, long, float and complex. Of these, the long type has been dropped in Python 3.x - the int type is now of unlimited length by default. You don’t have to specify what type of variable you want; Python does that automatically.

* ''Int:'' The basic integer type in python, equivalent to the hardware 'c long' for the platform you are using in Python 2.x, unlimited in length in Python 3.x.
* ''Long:'' Integer type with unlimited length. In python 2.2 and later, Ints are automatically turned into long ints when they overflow. Dropped since Python 3.0, use int type instead.
* ''Float:'' This is a binary floating point number. Longs and Ints are automatically converted to floats when a float is used in an expression, and with the true-division &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; operator.
* ''Complex:'' This is a complex number consisting of two floats. Complex literals are written as a + bj where a and b are floating-point numbers denoting the real and imaginary parts respectively.

In general, the number types are automatically 'up cast' in this order:

Int → Long → Float → Complex. The farther to the right you go, the higher the precedence.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 187687654564658970978909869576453
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x)
&lt;type 'long'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 1.34763
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x)
&lt;type 'float'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5 + 2j
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(x)
&lt;type 'complex'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The result of divisions is somewhat confusing. In Python 2.x, using the / operator on two integers will return another integer, using floor division. For example, &lt;tt&gt;5/2&lt;/tt&gt; will give you 2. You have to specify one of the operands as a float to get true division, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;5/2.&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;5./2&lt;/tt&gt; (the dot specifies you want to work with float) will yield 2.5. Starting with Python 2.2 this behavior can be changed to true division by the future division statement &lt;tt&gt;from __future__ import division&lt;/tt&gt;. In Python 3.x, the result of using the / operator is always true division (you can ask for floor division explicitly by using the // operator since Python 2.2).
 
This illustrates the behavior of the / operator in Python 2.2+:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5/2
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5/2.
2.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5./2
2.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import division
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5/2
2.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; 5//2
2
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Poker''' is not a single card game, but a broad class of card games. A poker game can have a simple name like &quot;guts&quot;, or it may have a cumbersome name such as &quot;seven card stud eight-or-better high-low split&quot;. Most common poker variants, including all those covered in this book, share a fifty-two card &quot;poker deck&quot; (though the [[w:Playing card|playing card]] deck itself precedes poker by hundreds of years), and certain rules for hand rankings.

== Variants ==
=== Five Card Draw Games ===
These games are played by dealing exactly five cards to each player and then allowing a number of cards to be replaced or drawn from the deck. Players must make the best (or worst) hand with the five cards that they end up with after the draw. ''Each rule set is based on these simple guidelines but alterations are possible.''
* [[/Five card draw|Five Card Draw]]

=== Five Card Stud Games ===
These games are played by dealing exactly five cards to each player. Players must make the best (or worst) hand with the five cards that they are dealt. ''Each rule set is based on these simple guidelines but alterations are possible.''
* [[/Five card stud|Five Card Stud]]
=== Seven Card Stud Games ===
Generally these games are played by dealing seven cards to each player. Each player must make the best (or worst) hand from five of their seven cards at the showdown. ''Each rule set is based on these simple guidelines but alterations are possible.''

* [[/Omaha|Omaha Hold'em]]
* [[/Omaha8|Omaha Hold'em High-Low]]
* [[/Pineapple|Pineapple]]
* [[Poker/CrazyPineapple|Crazy Pineapple]]

=== Match Pot Games ===
These games are generally played by creating a hand of cards depending on the specific rules and then making a decision of whether to 'hold' or 'drop' their hand. If a player holds their hand and looses in the showdown then they must 'match the pot'. ''Each rule set is based on these simple guidelines but alterations are possible.''
* [[/Guts/]] (Two card guts and Three card guts)
* [[/King Little Man/]]

=== Three Strikes Games ===
These games start with a number (usually three) of &quot;stacks&quot; in front of each player. The loser of each hand must put one &quot;stack&quot; into the pot. Players with no &quot;stacks&quot; may no longer play therefore the winner is the last player with at least one stack on the table. ''Each rule set is based on these simple guidelines but alterations are possible.''

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hand rankings ==
The most fundamental of poker concern the hand rankings, because the hand rankings determine the winner. While betting is extremely important to the game, players are wagering on whether they have won, therefore a complete understanding of hand rankings must come first. These hand rankings do not apply to games played &quot;low&quot;, such as [[../Lowball|lowball]] or [[../Razz|razz]]; see the section on &quot;low hands&quot; below.

The cards are ranked thus, from low to high: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace. An ace is the highest card, but it can also function as the lowest in completing a straight. The two is usually called a &quot;deuce&quot;, and the three is sometimes called a &quot;trey&quot;. Ten, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace are often abbreviated T, J, Q, K, and A, respectively, so that each card name has a single number or letter associated with it. This is commonly used in describing hands, for example, '''A-2-3-4-5''' is a hand with an ace, a two (&quot;deuce&quot;), a three, a four, and a five &amp;mdash; not necessarily in that order, but presenting them in that order makes it clear that the hand is a straight. A hand may also be written, say, '''A-A-x-x-x''', where &quot;x&quot; means any other card.

{| border=1
|+ '''Ranks from lowest to highest'''

|-
| High card || No pair, nothing || (Anything) || A-x-x-x-x || Ace high
|-

|-
| Two pair || || Two pairs || A-A-K-K-x || Aces up; aces and kings; aces over kings
|-
| Three of a kind || Trips, a set || Three cards of same rank || A-A-A-x-x || Three aces; set of aces
|-
| Straight || || Five cards in sequence || 10-J-Q-K-A || Ace-high straight
|-

|-
| Full house || Boat, full boat || Three of a kind plus a pair || A-A-A-K-K || Aces full; aces full of kings

|-
| Straight flush || || Five cards forming straight and a flush || {{cards|10s|Js|Qs|Ks|As}} || Ace-high straight flush (Also called a Royal Flush)
|}

'''A-2-3-4-5''' is considered a five-high straight, and it is called a ''wheel'' or ''bicycle''; this is the only time an ace plays as a low card. An ace-high straight flush is called a royal flush and it cannot be beaten, but it can be tied. Higher cards always beat lower cards, for example, a pair of aces beats a pair of kings, and a flush with a king beats a flush whose highest card is a Queen. If two players have the same pair, a ''kicker'' is used to break the tie if possible (more about them soon). When two players have two pair, the highest pairs are considered, for example, aces up always beats kings up, no matter the other pairs. If, for example, two players both have aces up, then the  higher of the smaller pairs wins: aces over kings beats aces over queens. If, for example, both players have aces over kings, then the kicker card is considered. Kickers also come into play when more than one player has the same three or four of a kind (possible only in community card games or wildcard games). If players have the same straight, flush, full house, or straight flush, it is always a tie and the players split the pot. There is no suit superiority or trump suit; a spade flush with '''A-10-9-6-4''' does not beat a club flush with the same values.

A ''kicker'' is any card that you hold in your hand that does not make part of it, that is, an otherwise useless card. A hand can have more than one kicker; A pair for instance has three kickers and a three-of-a-kind has two, and they are considered in rank order highest-first. When two players hold the same pair, two pair, three of a kind, or four of a kind, the highest kicker wins, for example, '''A-A-K-x-x''' beats '''A-A-Q-x-x''', '''A-A-K-Q-x''' beats '''A-A-K-J-x''', and '''A-A-K-Q-J''' beats '''A-A-K-Q-T'''. A kicker can be higher than the rest of the hand, for example, '''K-K-A-x-x''' beats '''K-K-J-x-x''', so an ace usually makes the best kicker. If the first kicker ties and there is a second or third, they are compared in rank order; '''A-A-K-J-x''' loses to '''A-A-K-Q-x'''. If the hands are totally equivalent, the pot is split.

== Low hands ==
Some games have a high-low split, and some games such as [[../Lowball|lowball]] or [[../Razz|razz]] are played low-only. In a high-low split game, typically a low hand must not have any cards ranked higher than eight and no cards must be paired, or it does not count as a low hand. In low-only games, any cards can be used. ''Many forms of poker do not use low hands, so you need not concern yourself with these until you intend to play games that do.''

There are three common ways of ranking low hands: ace-to-five low, ace-to-six low, and deuce-to-seven low, named after the best possible hands in the respective systems. In all systems, paired cards are bad and cannot be used to beat any hand that does not have a pair. Likewise, a pair beats three of a kind, three of a kind beats a full house, and a full house beats four of a kind. The most common hand ranking system for low hands is ace-to-five, used almost universally in high-low split games and very common in other games. This means '''A-2-3-4-5''' (called a ''wheel'' or ''bicycle'', just as it is as a high hand) is the best possible low hand, and the ace is the lowest card. For a high-low split game, it also forms a high hand: a five-high straight. In order to avoid confusion, we will discuss only ace-to-five low at the moment.

When pairs and any other &quot;bad&quot; hands are not present, then  the winner is the one whose highest card is lowest. For this reason, a low hand is usually described highest card first, to make it easier to tell which is lower. In ace-to-five, '''8-4-3-2-A''' loses to '''7-6-5-4-3''' because the highest card in the first hand (eight) is higher than the highest card in the second hand (seven), even though all the other cards in the second hand are lower. If the highest cards are the same, then the next-highest cards are considered, and so on: '''8-7-6-3-A''' loses to '''8-7-5-4-2''' because the second hand goes lower first.

In ace-to-six low, straights and flushes count for high (that is, they're bad), and the best possible hand is '''A-2-3-4-6''' unsuited, since it's the lowest possible card combination that avoids pairing, straights, and flushes. Deuce-to-seven is identical except the ace is the highest card, so the best possible hand is '''2-3-4-5-7''' unsuited. Therefore, in deuce-to-seven low, the hand that would make the worst possible high hand in traditional poker is the best possible low hand, and vice versa: a royal flush is the worst possible hand.

== Advanced data structures and algorithms ==

Hi Macneil, sorry about deleting your &quot;Advanced..&quot; book from the template without asking first, but is there really a need to display a link from the main page to a book that is so far only a place-holder for future modules? Both of your books link to the &quot;Advanced&quot; book, so the interested reader will find it anyway. Furthermore, it is still displayed on the [[IT bookshelf]]. I hope you don't get the wrong impression, that I want to take anything away... I know there are books there, that even less deserve to be listed on the &quot;Main Page&quot;, but I have to start somewhere. I'll work my way through, to make things more focussed (as you were taking away my links to Wikipedia - I guess it is the same philosophy, and actually, after your edits, I like the Newton root method even more - looks more professional.) Don't worry - I won't touch the link to your book in the near future - at least not before I sorted out the many other stub links. PS: If you have a minute, go to the main page, and vote for the book of February! Thanks! :-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 00:44, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:Hey Andreas: My reason was a little too complex to put in the edit summary field, and I figured you'd follow me up: The reason it's important to include links to all three books is that they are essentially a series. While the Advanced book has very little content (right now) it serves the important role of making the Data Structures and Algorithms books tractable: Consider it a defense against creeping featuritis. The tendency is for people to think &quot;oh wow, this is just like wikipedia, let me put in my obscure piece of knowledge to add to it&quot;-- and thus a book that is meant to be a very basic tutorial on fundamental topics could be turned into an eclectic mix of advanced topics with little relevance to even advanced students. Thus, the Advanced book serves as a stop gap: unwanted, but still high quality, contributions could get funnelled away from the basic books and to the advanced book. If links were not equal contributors might be miffed that they were being moved to a less important book.

:Thus, the Advanced book is more important than just a &quot;suggested&quot; book, it is part of a larger project, which is very time consuming, but well on its way to becoming a useful resource for students. (I do actually have some content for it, wrt FFT algorithms, but it's lower in priority for me.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:59, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

:: Sure, but right now nothing is in the book. So since nothing is in there, I assume nothing of what you fear happened so far (creeping featuritis). As soon as somebody does write something, you don't want to have in the book, why not move it then over there, and as soon as there is content in the book, I have no problem with it being linked to from the main page. But, frankly, just to prepare things before they happen seems overprotective to me - especially in a medium like Wikibooks. But there is a qualitative difference: You are a highly motivated writer, and you care about your work. I guess if I take away links to some of the &quot;Howto&quot; books, where the authors barely made it beyond a splendid introduction of what the book will be, nobody will even notice. So, since you care about your book, probably its the best I don't waste my and your time, and let you continue to write your great books! Keep the work, don't feel distracted by me. ;-) --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas Ipp]] 01:44, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::: The content of the Advanced book was taken from the other books: They existed mostly only as outline content. Rather than lose track of a good idea, they have a home. (So, indeed, creeping feature has happened.) Perhaps it won't be long even before someone returns to fill in the gaps (work cycles are very slow sometimes-- a great author did some work in November, and just now they've returned back to continue). But please be mindful of the systems as they are right now (no matter how faulty) before you change them: sometimes the baby could get thrown out with the bathwater, and some faults aren't actually faults.

:&quot;His&quot; exploration might not be considered vandalism if he changed it back, but even then that's a thin line. Content does not need to be spam or gross images to count as vandalism.

Talk about pot calling the kettle black - sorry about my quick response and not giving you the benefit of the doubt - unfortunately something similar happened to me when I first came upon wikipedia (as an anon) and kind of drove me off for a few months (thinking I was violating some kind of policy and could lose access to the encyclopedia - which I liked to use fairly regularly)  - and now I push back pretty hard on such things. Thanks for all you do to keep the trolls and the sock puppets from driving policy. [[User:Trödel|Trödel]] 22:32, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:Feel free to delete it and my response. Looks like it could be deleted anyway - by Jimbo - and that there are quite a few books and &quot;articles&quot; that are created to push a POV - Is there a policy on what is and is not a &quot;textbook&quot; and if not I would be happy (as a user for now) to contribute to the discussion. [[User:Trödel|Trödel]] 22:43, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== response ==

not sure if this belongs here or on my talk page, so...

:The &quot;Getting a girl&quot; book was given a proper vote. While I do obviously dislike the results, I will accept that a very loose interpretation of &quot;concensus&quot; might apply. (destruction of someone's blood, sweat, and tears had ought to require 85% agreement at a 95% statistical certainty) When in doubt, the article or book needs to stay, so this deletion was borderline.

:The Cookbook:Human article did not lose a vote. It never got a vote.

:As for inuendo and slandering, you're right. I surely have my faults. You might consider being not so quick to call people sock puppets, and not so quick to assume that articles that offend you have been intentionally designed to offend you.

:I seriously do encourage you to help write factual non-offensive replacement text for articles that may be controversial.

:Hopefully someday you can see the need for comprehensive coverage in the cookbook. If this is at odds with the rest of wikibooks, then the Cookbook should move to its own domain name and wiki. I have in fact already proposed this for unrelated reasons. Note that the Cookbook is by far the most active book around here.

== recipes and the GFDL ==

Quoting you: &quot;If I come upon a good vegan recipe I'll add one, but all of the vegan recipes I use are from extant cookbooks, and cannot be put under GFDL.&quot;

This is not necessarily the case. You may be able to convert a recipe, especially if you live in the USA. I haven't done it, but it has crossed my mind. You may have ethical problems with this, but do remember that nearly all cookbooks are recycling the same old recipes passed down for generations.
(in other words, your cookbooks probably have swiped recipes via the procedure below)

Procedures are subject to patents, not copyright. The wording used to describe the procedure is another matter, distinct from the actions of the procedure. The list of ingredients is not protectable; this has been the subject of court decisions.

So, you simply need to put the procedure into your own words. To be sure you aren't accidentally copying something that would be subject to copyright, you may wish to work from memory or have somebody else describe the procedure to you.

If you have any doubts, consult a lawyer. (the above is not to be construed as legal advice, etc.)
The EU, in case you live there, has the concept of author's rights (if you took the meat out of a non-vegan recipe, that could be considered a perversion of the author's artistic work) and might not
have court decisions or law prohibiting copyright on recipe procedures and ingredient lists.

:When there's a vegan pizza dough recipe I'll add that to get that pizza delivery place texture you should freeze the dough overnight and then thaw it in the refridgerator. Somehow that changes the texture, in parcticularly how it rises, so you don't get stuck with that &quot;gormet pizza&quot; feel. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 05:54, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

::Got one, right [[Cookbook:Pizza|here]], unless you're hard-core enough to avoid killing yeast. The topping is another matter of course, but I hear you can get fake cheese. Simply eliminating the cheese wouldn't be all that bad I think. You could try deep-fried tofu as well, added late if it would burn otherwise. Maybe also try some sort of crumb topping, like the one for [[Cookbook:Apple Crisp|Apple Crisp]] but with less sugar.

:::Cool. Garlic is a good cheese substitute: has some of the properties, but it's hard to beat Follow Your Heart Soy Mozerella. Good topings for a vegan pizza are artichoke hearts, olives, and mushrooms: veggies that have a good amount of calories (so that it doesn't feel like a cellulose pizza).

:I would change my vote to an abstain if Albert gave a reasuring reply to my question about &quot;anti-deletionism.&quot; I don't think there is any &quot;deletionists&quot; here, so persuing that agenda just sounds scary to me. In particular, the How to Get a Girl book shouldn't be undeleted. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:56, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
::I don't even suggest undeleting that book. It kind of lives on now, in slightly modified form, and just recently passed a VfD. So there isn't any point to undeleting the old one. I do insist that &quot;real&quot; books, ones with human effort that is, go through a VfD with consensus to delete before being deleted. 51% is not consensus. Without a consensus requirement, the VfD becomes a simple popularity contest. There are a good number of books and even cookbook pages that I'd rather do without, but you won't see me trying to delete them. That just wouldn't be right. It is very unfortunate that non-admins can not view deleted pages; I may be wrong in my impression that admins are habitually destroying things they just don't agree with. BTW, the docs around here suggest that the vote counter (judge) be neither the one who proposed deletion (prosecutor) nor the one who performs the deletion (executioner). This would be a good practice to follow. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 05:02, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)
:::Let's say I'm a little nervous that you thought &quot;Human&quot; might be a good recipe for the cookbook. I understand that you think it was deleted without following process. I'm not sure how you have that impression, but I can assure you that wasn't the case.

::::It makes no sense as a recipe. As an ingredient, it makes about as much sense as marijuana. When I showed up here, nearly the first thing I saw was that people were complaining about pages being deleted without following procedure. Things don't look quite as bad now, but it still appears that admins with a conflict of interest (an opinion on the outcome) tend to both count the votes and perform the deletion. There is often little time to object to the vote counting before deletion occurs. I hope you can see how this looks really arbitrary and unfair. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:31, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::I think you probably '''should''' mention cookbook pages that should be deleted. If I gave you a 10,000 recipe cookbook, but only 10% of the entries were even barely acceptable (with perhaps 30% of those being excellent) would you use it much? I bet you'd rather use a 1,000 recipe cookbook, that only had that good 10%. The empty set and the set of everything contain the same amount of information. Allowing bad entries to persist just makes wikibooks the result of a million monkeys on a million typewriters.

::::I'd much rather find a way to rate recipes. A good system would be something like a music recommendation service, so that you see recipes rated highly if they have been rated highly by people with similar interests as yourself. So for you, meat-containing recipes would rank at the bottom and vegan recipes would rank at the top. (with non-vegan vegetarian generally in the middle) Some way to assign ''searchable'' attributes (spicy hot, herbal non-hot spicy, metric, requires scale or balance, has creamy sauce, Americanized Asian...) would be good too, perhaps as a software enhancement to categories. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 18:31, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Also, it seems like you have no trust in the wikispirit: Voting is not a popularity contest. For example, people change their votes after discussion brings up good points. Just as voting for your own adminship, I'll be glad to change my vote, but I need something at least somewhat reassuring that you understand my concerns and have legitimate reasons to agree or disagree. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 17:56, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== adminship ==

Thing is, I do lots of edits. I'm well over 1500. I think the wiki software has lost track even; I'm probably near 2000 right now. Supposing that 99% of that is good, I'll still generate a lot of bad edits by sheer numbers. General apathy and hesitation means that vote counts are normally low. People will hesitate to vote unless given a strong reason to do so.

Most people pass an adminship vote with only 1 or 2 votes total. Step on just a few toes, even with a good edit, and enemies will win the vote.

One person didn't like that I insisted that &quot;bonito&quot; is considered a tuna in many (most, AFAIK) countries. Well, it is, and all the top Google results agree that bonito is a tuna. Another person didn't like how Google revealed that &quot;cookie sheet&quot; is a whopping '''38.7''' times as popular as his preferred &quot;baking tray&quot;. As the cookbook needs to be readable to the rest of the world, this matters. Well of course that's two ememies right there.

You're right to guess that I might be discouraged. I keep asking myself why I bother, what with all the politics. It'd be different if this gave me a salary, but politics in my spare time??? Ugh. In fact, a couple months ago I disappeared for about a month over this. I still wound up being one of the top-10 wikibooks editors though.

The funny thing is that non-admins can be almost as destructive as admins. Note that a non-admin can overwrite an image, and an admin can undelete something that has been deleted. What a non-admin can't do is ''clean up messes'', of all things!

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 02:37, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

:I actually came to Wikibooks because Wikipedia was a little too political. I still do some Wikipedia edits every now and then, but I make certain it's in areas I have little emotional attachment.

:: Hi MShonle and Albert. I've been following the process about Albert's adminship loosely (have not voted yet) but I would nevertheless like to comment on a point: It is not the sole number of edits that makes an editor better. If there are not only one, but already a couple of people that disagree with Alberts edits (and I have certain personal reservations after a peripheral discussion on [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]), then in Alberts position I would think about decreasing the number of edits, but increasing their quality. It is a matter of preference.. would you mind 2 innocent editors that have been blocked, after 10 true vandals? Or 5 good stubs deleted in 50 really useless stubs? This happens if you are very active? Anyway, Albert will find arguments to justify anything he thinks is right, so I would not mind if he read a page twice before he edits it, and have half as many edits... Just my personal opinion. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 08:54, 5 May 2005 (UTC)

:::That's not what I meant to say of course. (besides, those are more-serious actions that deserve more consideration) I certainly have a highly biased opinion about my own editing, so never mind what I say of it. For any given level of quality though, a frequent editor will manage to annoy more people. That's all I meant to say. The edits people hate are the ones they remember.

== unease with &quot;food&quot;s ==

Here are two new recipes:

*[[Cookbook:Spicy Australian Placenta|Spicy Australian Placenta]]
*[[Cookbook:Placenta with Broccoli|Placenta with Broccoli]]

I doubt I'd like the first, but the second one is really tasty. I'll get a photo scanned if the lighting was OK enough.

You might find it interesting that I feel more uneasy about eating beans. I was feeling pretty proud of myself a month ago when I managed to put aside my gag reflex long enough to eat a whole burrito. Admittedly I added lots of cheese, olives, tomatoes, and even chicken &amp;mdash; but I got it down, somehow. (probably 1/3 beans) Then, a couple weeks ago, I even managed to get one down without the chicken.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:00, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:Yes, I noticed those new entries. I'm thinking we should perhaps add a warning to all of the related articles that placenta eating can pass both HIV and Hepatitis. BTW, did you see the straight dope article on it, where he says it made a vegetarian queezy? It's no surprise... after not eating meat for a while, the thought of meat becomes disgusting. I know that meat eaters like you like to secretly think we're all sitting there, lusting for dead animal flesh, but nothing could be farther from the truth. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 06:06, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::The warnings should be on the Placenta page, or possibly on a Human page. Note that HIV and hepatitis are only problems prior to cooking. (I have heard of placenta [[Cookbook:Sashimi|sashimi]].) After cooking, I suppose you could spread mad cow disease, but that's extremely unlikely. Note that in the Straight Dope article the vegetarian did try the placenta. In other words, he did not find it morally or ethically objectionable. He was merely grossed out a bit, just as I am with beans. I don't imagine you'd have any craving for a steak or a burger, but passing up things like real ice cream (milk) and real brownies (eggs) sure doesn't look easy. Avoiding burgers and bacon is probably good for you, but avoiding canned salmon and anchovies is probably not good for you. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 20:35, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)

:::Soy and rice-based ice creams can be wonderful, and there are plenty of vegan brownies out there (in San Diego I can get both vegan brownies and blondies). Eggs and Milk aren't exactly the two most crucial ingredients out there: there are plenty of alternatives. As for salmon, that ain't so healthy for you either, considering the levels of mercury and other toxins that get amplified through bio-accumulation. I'm sure a meat-eating diet could be healthy, but if it's not necessary for survival, it's immoral. Unless you have no other means to survive, and are not scavaging what's already dead, there's no moral justification. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:12, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Hi Garrett: I think we need to step back and ask not if the ''MoC'' is legal or useful, but if it's appropriate for the project. This sounds like something for a wikicity for me. It's not like we're a censor board, with infinite power, determining what can be on the web or not.

:It looks like .odg formats are restricted, and even putting it into .zip isn't allowed. So, the only way I could think of getting them there is putting them in one of the usenet-style compressed ASCII formats, but that's probably not recommended. In the meantime, you could upload special versions of your PNGs that don't have English labels on them (so that it will be easier, say, for the German version of the image to be made).

I allways though it's a database and expeced any language to have it's own name (like Oracle and PL/SQL ;-) .

Anyway since I have no idea what kind of language could you fill in the  [[Programming languages bookshelf]] and the [[Template:Programming languages bookshelf]]. Thanks.

: I think the database implementations also have the same name, but SQL itself is a structured query language with its own syntax and semantics. However, even though HTML is a language I wouldn't consider it a programming language. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 18:06, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Well SQL iself on the [[Meta-languages bookshelf]] as it should be - however PL/SQL (there is currently no wikibook for PL/SQL) with it's [[Ada Programming|Ada]] inspired syntax is a full blown programming language used for stored procedures.

== regarding C plus plus ==

Hey Garrett. I noticed some edits to [[Programming:C plus plus]] in July where you said &quot;please don't use transclusions&quot; and then some comments about a merge. Since you seem to know more about this than I do, what's the story? What did you mean by no transclusions (as that would be the solution to the fork problem)? It seems going forward we should have a single C++ book. Or, perhaps two: one as a complete reference, the other as a tutorial on the basics. What are your thoughts and can you fill me in on the story? Thanks! :-) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:06, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

:There's a difference. He was using transclusions unnecessarily to insert the first few paragraphs into the book, BUT that intro wasn't shared by the other book. There's no reason to transclude something that only appears in one place, it will end up confusing people trying to edit the page.
:I cannot see having the two books remaining separate. Panic forked his off for the sole reason of having a single-page gargantuan guide, and it no doubt is still 80% identical to the other book. Therefore they need to merge, somehow or other.
:As for the solution, I really don't know enough about the topic to sort things out myself. All my attempts so far to reach compromises have come to naught. Bah. [[User:Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:17, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

Mshonle, as I'm taking an extended holiday, I just wanted to say continue the great work with your policy proposals (the Wikibooks vision and the book charters). Methinks the next few months will be very interesting on Wikibooks; so good luck with your ideas. [[User:Serge|Serge]] 11:30, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

== Computing Bookshelves ==

I don't think I agree with you in the usage of three separate bookshelves for CS-related books, as it makes it difficult for newbies to navigate to the correct bookshelf (the ''IT''/''programming''/''CS'' separation is not especially intuitive). Subjects like ''humanities'', ''art'' and ''science'' are much broader in diversity compared to CS, but they still have only one bookshelf each.

What about creating sub-bookshelves/subcategories for ''cs'', ''programming'', ''IT'' etc. under a common ''Computer Science'' bookshelf? This would both unify CS-content and open up for internal diversity. --[[User:Orderud|Orderud]] 19:00, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

:Computer Science is a subject quite separate from programming and information technology. For example, learning and using Photoshop or GIMP is a subject we vitally need to teach, but under no stretch of the imagination is it a CS topic. As for computing, I don't think it makes much sense to have an umbrella shelf to cover all of them, since CS is not a sub-branch of computing either. Perhaps there can be a separate CS shelf and an IT shelf with IT/Programming and IT/Computing, but as I said, any single merge would be like putting autorepair in with Physics. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:06, 9 October 2005 (UTC)

== [[Programming:C plus plus]] ==

Hi,

I just read your email about the merge (I don't get to read non-work mails regularly nowadays :( ). It has been pointed out earlier that the fork predates the policy on merges, so hope that has been taken care of before merging.

I'd also like to mention that there were some reports that some of what Panic2k4 had added are from some other C++ book (I don't remember the name but going through the talk pages for the 2 books as well as their archives/page history and probably older versions of the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]] should reveal the name). I vaguely recollect seeing instances of some material from Wikipedia being pasted here without proper version history (i.e. without going through the transwiki process) as required by the GFDL (I might have discussed this with Panic in the talk pages of the two books or his user talk page or the Staff lounge so the older versions of these pages might have some clues). Hence part of the material might be infringing on the copyright(s) of the author(s) of the other C++ book and the copyrights of contributors to various Wikipedia articles on C++.

I don't get much time nowadays to work on Wikibooks. Even my activity on Wikipedia has come down quite a bit. Hence I'm not able to search through the books and talk pages and find out more about the material that has been pasted into [[Programming:C -/- -/-]]. I'm sorry for that but I do hope someone with time in hand would do so and remove infringing content (if any still remain...). I just wanted to mention these issues since these would be easier to resolve sooner than later.

I'd like to clarify that I didn't want to just write a reference text on C++ but rather an entire book but just couldn't get the time and inclination (inclination -- mainly due the fork) to do it. The sensible thing to have done is to get all the non-copyvio material from the fork on to the original book but this was getting increasingly difficult for me since the page became huger as days passed, and I couldn't find what is copyvio and what isn't.

Also, I didn't intend the &quot;Hello world&quot;, &quot;Data types&quot;, &quot;Variables and expressions&quot; pages to be part of the appendix as they are now. I wonder if they are there just temporarily since these things don't seem to make sense in an appendix. Rather they were intended to be part of the main book, either expanded into larger chapters, or as sections (I'd like chapters to span multiple pages with each page being a section or a subsection). -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:06, 29 October 2005 (UTC)

:Thanks for coming back online! I agree that it's odd for the Hello World, et cetera parts to be put into an appendix. I think some of the problems with the C++ book reveals the huge difference between WB and WP. My main concern is that the book is so far off from its goal that others won't want to do all of the many steps necessary to make it better. --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 20:46, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

== My Next Book ==

I wanted to get your opinion on a new book i've been working on, that is currently only an outline on my user page: [[User:Whiteknight/Communications]]. I would like to introduce this book sometime within the next week, assuming too many people dont have too many problems with it. Because of the size and the scope of the proposed books, i've been asking people whether this book would &quot;step on the toes&quot; of other bookshelves (I would like to put this book on the EE bookshelf). Since you are a frequent contributer to the CS bookshelf, i would like to ask if you think this new book would overlap too too much with books currently on the CS shelf. The &quot;Berkley API&quot; section in particular might raise some eyebrows, but i think that either a) this new books should contain at least a brief introduction to network programming, or b) link frequently to other wikibooks on the topic. Either way, this book would need space for it. Also in question are subjects of routing algorithms, CRC checksums, packet formation (i would much rather focus on packet structure, rather then packet formation, or packet parsing) and data compression. I would like to point out that Electrical Engineers may use all of these subjects, and many of them might not think to find them in a CS book to find them. I would like to introduce this book by next week, so a reply would be greately appreciated. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:33, 6 November 2005 (UTC)
:I think it's a fine outline and suitable for the EE shelf. I also don't see much concern about duplicate material with CS books. By their nature some books are going to repeat some of the information in other books. Any &quot;solutions&quot; to this duplication &quot;problem&quot; are far worse than the minor headaches duplication can sometimes have. By being free to overlap some content books can be more focused, more helpful, and clearer over all. Forcing users to read another submodule written in a different context will lead to a worser learning experience. I'm sure some CS types will find some &quot;duplication&quot; (i.e., teaching a single concept in more than one book; not to be confused with forking) ineligant, so I suggest you stick with making the treatments somewhat different. An introduction to network programming with an emphasis on EE details is quite different than a programming introduction. Indeed, you could claim that CS books are in the EE territory whenever they mention a wire or a bus. But really, the reality is that it happens. There are probably at least three introductions to Big-O notation around here, for example. Anyway, it sounds like a great project! --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:25, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Expected Value (EV) is the average return on each dollar invested into a pot.  If a player can expect, given probability to make more money than he or she bets, the action is said to have a positive expectation (+EV).  Conversely if a bet or a call will, according to probability, likely result in less money being returned the action is said to be negative (-EV).  

An example may assist in the understanding of this concept.  In Texas Holdem it is quite common for someone to flop 4 to a flush.  The person should only draw to that flush if to do so would be +EV.  In order to calculate the EV it is necessary to compare the size of the bet with the size of the pot.  A flopped flush draw will come in approximately 1 in 3 times by the river, thus in order for a call to be +EV the final pot must be larger than 3 times the call.  This is a complicated issue so it may be useful to elaborate with a specific example.

Say you are playing 5-10 limit poker on the button, there are 3 limpers to you and you call with A4 diamonds.  Both Blinds call so there is $30 in the pot.  You flop the nut flush draw.  The player in the small Blind bets $5 and there are four callers.  Should you call, raise or fold?

Well, there is now $55 in the pot and it will cost you $5 to call so the pot is giving you 11:1 odds (i.e. you must pay $5 to win $55).  We already know that the flush draw will get there 1 time in every 3 (2 to 1) so making the call is +EV.  However, calling is not necessarily the best play in this situation.  If you raise and the other 4 people in the pot decide to call your raise then you will be adding $5 to the pot whilst they will collectively be adding $20.  This ratio is 4:1 but the chance of making your flush is only 2 losses to 1 win, so on average in the long run you are making money from every extra bet from all 5 of you that goes into the pot.  Notice that even though you have only a 33% chance to win the pot, the correct thing to do is actually to bet, despite knowing that you will probably not win that particular single hand: you will win about 1 in 3 such hands in the long run, minus the few percent of the time when someone beats your flush with a full house or quads or straight flush.

Notice that all that has been done so far is compare the current pot with the bet size needed to call to calculate EV.  However it is important to also compare the expected pot size by the end of the hand with the current bet.  For example say you are playing no limit holdem and have a gutshot straight draw (giving you 4 outs to complete - approximately 1:12 against).  If the pot is $30 and you are faced with a $10 bet the pot is not giving you the correct odds to call (it would need to be $120 total, plus your $10 call).  However you also need to take into account the amount of money you may be able to extract from your opponents if you make your hand.  If you expect your opponent to call a $100 bet if you make your hand, then the pot is really offering you 13:1 odds (the $30 pot at the time plus the $100 added on later streets)  Therefore in this situation the +EV play would be to call.  Thus when making decisions about whether to call a bet it is crucial to take into account both the stack sizes of yourself and your opponents and how willing they are likely to be to call big bets if you make your hand.

To make it easier to understand why this move is correct even though it usually loses, suppose you have a six-sided die. If you correctly guess what side it lands on, you will win $50. If you are wrong, you lose $5. You will be wrong five times out of six, but you stand to gain a lot over the long run! This is because the probability of guessing correctly is 1/6, sometimes expressed as ''odds'', &quot;5:1 against&quot; (five losing possibilities, one winning possibility). However, the payoff odds are 50:5 ($50 won for a $5 bet), which can be reduced to 10:1, and 10:1 is twice as large as 5:1. The payoff odds are called ''pot odds'' in a poker game. Comparing the odds of winning to the pot odds is how you can estimate your expected value.

Ideally, you want to avoid ''all'' situations where you have a negative expectation. Even slightly negative situations can pile up and bleed away your bankroll. Casinos worldwide make MILLIONS of dollars lost by players against a 0.6% craps dice game house edge: even 0.1% is enough of an edge to wipe out all the billions of dollars of the richest man on earth, over time in the long run, which is why Bill Gates wisely bets only $5/hand for fun at blackjack!

 == Calculating expected value ==
You cannot always get a good idea of the chances of winning your hand &amp; calculate the pot odds: at least, not without knowing what your opponents have, and they're not going to tell you! However, you will often have a draw which, if you hit, you will very likely win the pot. The exact arithmetic involved varies from game to game. In [[../Hold'em|Texas hold'em]] and [[../Omaha/]], once you see the flop, the percent chance of making your hand within one card is generally your number of ''outs'' (cards that will make your hand) multiplied by two, and the odds of making your hand within two cards is your number of outs multiplied by four. For example, if you have four hearts and you need one more for a flush, you have nine outs, because there are thirteen hearts in the deck, and subtracting the four hearts you already have gives nine. 9 &amp;times; 2 is 18, so you have about an 18% chance of making the hand in the next card, and 9 &amp;times; 4 is 36, so you have about a 36% chance of making it in two cards.

To make this easy, you want to turn this percent chance into odds, like 5:1 against. Fortunately, they are easy enough to memorize:

 50% =  1:1
 33% =  2:1
 '''25% =  3:1'''
 '''20% =  4:1'''
 '''16% =  5:1'''
 14% =  6:1
 12% =  7:1
 11% =  8:1
 '''10% =  9:1'''
  9% = 10:1
  8% = 11:1
  7% = 13:1
  '''5% = 20:1'''
  '''4% = 25:1'''

The odds in bold are the most important to commit to memory; the others can be easily estimated.

Now, take the ''x'' in the ''x'':1 figure and multiply it by the bet size. For example, if the odds of making your hand are roughly 4:1, and the next bet costs $5, multiply 5 &amp;times; 4 = 20. That means you want there to be at least $20 in the pot (be sure to include bets that have not been added to the pot proper yet!), preferably a bit more just in case unless you're certain to win if you hit your draw. If there is not at least $20 in the pot you will lay down your hand, unless you can check instead. If the table is really loose, and a lot of players are in the hand and are likely to stay in, and the pot will get really big, you may even want to raise. Normally, however, checking or calling is the correct move.

Notice we did not calculate the exact expected value. This is not necessary or indeed practical for most people. If it is negative, you get out, and if it is positive, you call. If you're a favorite to win the pot, you raise. However, as has been shown you can usually figure out if the value is only barely positive, for instance, the size of the pot is a dollar more than the odds of making your hand (and this dollar is small in proportion to the pot size). When faced with this situation, you might want to lay down your hand sometimes: you may be losing just a little money in the long run, but you keep your bankroll from taking big swings. But if you don't mind taking a gamble, by all means go for it!

I don't think the character forms should be separated. Both should be displayed together - one on top of the other - so that people can learn both. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 00:57, 30 Dec 2003 (PST)

:The aim of this textbook is to first familiarize the learner with the spoken Mandarin and its syntaxical and grammatical structure and then proceed with the character memorization. If someone would care to add the Traditional text later on, then I will not object. The convoluted issue of Simplified vs. Traditional is too blown out of proportion as it is. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Listing both does not mean one has to memorize both. I don't see how it would hurt.

As I repeat, they don't speak Mandarin in HK and Macau. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]]

:I must have been in a parallel world, then, when I visted Hong Kong and the shopkeepers understood my Mandarin. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Barely...it certainly isn't their native tongue. It's seldom spoken. I couldn't get by with Mandarin. Besides, HK is part of the PRC. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]]

:No, but it is being adapted into mainstream society as one of the official languages. HK and Macau are parts of PRC, however, being that they are both Special Administrative Regions, I felt obligated to provide them with separate flags until they become wholly part of the PRC. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Cantonese is de facto in LegCo. Though under the British, English was mandated in the schools, the average Hong Konger has very poor English skills. 

Including HK and Macau will leave the impression to people that they can get by using Mandarin, and that Mandarin is commonly spoken, when this is not the case. It's misleading. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 06:08, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:While I do acknowledge that Cantonese will forever be the &quot;official&quot; dialect of Hong Kong, it is impossible to deny that Mandarin is rapidly being integrated into its society. Even prior to 1997, a large Mandarin user base was already present in HK, and this is reflected in the amount of HK huaqiao (first generation) in the US who are able to converse understandably well in Mandarin. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Until it is integrated to a considerable degree, listing both SARs are misleading. We could do fine without them. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]]

:People can generalize their own conclusions. If they're willing to put forth the effort to learn a language, then chances are that they won't be misled by such trivialities. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

People seriously wanting to learn the language won't come here or come here alone. It's the people who are simply browsing that we are misleading. What is there to gain from listing them? --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 07:59, 22 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:I don't see how it is misleading. It's simply asserting the fact that a percentage -- albeit small -- speaks the dialect. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

Should we also add the flags of the USA, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam? --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]]

Yes, if you believe them to be specialized regions of the PRC. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

:Then &quot;asserting the fact that a percentage -- albeit small -- speaks the dialect&quot; isn't really an issue then? The issue is that they're part of the PRC. A dependency is a dependency and I see no reason to include them if this is the case. --[[User:Jiang|Jiang]] 22:25, 23 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::Alright, this is counterintuitive and cannot be argued past deadlock. Remove it if you so wish, but with all the energy that you've expended in discussing this, you could have at least helped with the textbook. -[[User:Taoster|Taoster]]

:I thought you just list the countries where Mandarin Chinese is one of the official languages? For instance, the French lesson has a Canadian flag, even though French is rarely spoken outside of Quebec. I figure that whether or not there is a large Mandarin Chinese speaking population, you might as well include the countries where the government has it as an official language. 
-[[User:Alex S|Alex S]]

==Please contribute==

The Chinese book has gone a bit stagnant.. and I know many people out there know chinese as a primary language and english as a second. So if you do happen to know Chinese, don't be afraid to add!!

hahahaha, i find it funny that the front page has been updated more times than the book's contents

== Splash Page Debate ==

I don't think a splash page contributes to the Wikibook. It just makes one more page to click through. It's like having a Flash intro to the book--totally useless for learning. If you take a look at all the other [[Languages bookshelf|Language Books]], most have now dispensed with the cover page. If we wanted to make a cover picture for eventual printed versions of the text, we could just keep a link to it from the contents page. And the flags can still get their chance to shine in our [[Chinese:Introduction|Introduction]]. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 19:21, 26 Nov 2004 (UTC)</text>

== Basic networking configuration ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''The candidate should be able to configure a network device to be able to connect to a local network and a wide-area network. This objective includes being able to communicate between various subnets within a single network, configure dialup access using mgetty, configure dialup access using a modem or ISDN, configure authentication protocols such as PAP and CHAP, and configure TCP/IP logging.''

Key '''files''', ''terms'', and &lt;tt&gt;utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:

 /sbin/route 
 /sbin/ifconfig 
 /sbin/arp 
 /usr/sbin/arpwatch
 /etc/ 

Interface configuration is usually done with the ifconfig command
Ifconfig will usually bring up the specified interface and create a route for its IP address in the kernel's routing table
To access various subnets within a single network, use the netmask flag of route or ifconfig
With route, you can setup multiple interfaces with the same IP but route packets depending on which subnet connects to what interface
With ifconfig, you can have multiple IP for your host, one per subnet, and thus become a bridge between multiple subnets

=== Introduction to Getty ===

getty is the program you run for dialin. You don't need it for dialout. In addition to presenting a
login prompt, it also may help answer the telephone. Originally getty was used for logging in to a
computer from a dumb terminal. A major use of it today is for logging in to a Linux console. There
are several different getty programs but a few of these work OK with modems for dialin. The getty
program is usually started at boot-time. It must be called from the /etc/inittab file. In this file you
may find some examples which you will likely need to edit a bit. Hopefully these examples will be
for the flavor of getty installed on your PC.

There are four different getty programs to choose from that may be used with modems for dial-in:
mgetty, uugetty, getty_em, and agetty. A brief overview is given in the following subsections.
Agetty is the weakest of the four and it's mainly for use with directly connected text-terminals.
mgetty has support for fax and voice mail but Uugetty doesn't. mgetty allegedly lacks a few of the
features of uugetty. getty_em is a simplified version of uugetty. Thus mgetty is likely your best
choice unless you are already familiar with uugetty (or find it difficult to get mgetty). The syntax
for these getty programs differs, so be sure to check that you are using the correct syntax in
/etc/inittab for whichever getty you use.

In order to see what documentation exists about the various gettys on your computer, use the
&quot;locate&quot; command. Type: locate &quot;*getty*&quot; (including the quotes may help). Note that many
distributions just call the program getty even though it may actually be agetty, uugetty, etc. But if
you read the man page (type: man getty), it might disclose which getty it is. This should be the
getty program with path /sbin/getty. 

Getty &quot;exits&quot; after login (and can respawn) :

After you log in you will notice (by using &quot;top&quot;, &quot;ps -ax&quot;, or &quot;ptree&quot;) that the getty process is no
longer running. What happened to it? Why does getty restart again if your shell is killed? Here's
why : after you type in your user name, getty takes it and calls the login program telling it your
user name. The getty process is replaced by the login process. The login process asks for your
password, checks it and starts whatever process is specified in your password file. This process is
often the bash shell. If so, bash starts and replaces the login process. Note that one process replaces
another and that the bash shell process originally started as the getty process. The implications of
this will be explained below.

Now in the /etc/inittab file getty is supposed to respawn (restart) if killed. It says so on the line that calls getty. 

Example: getty entry from /etc/inittab
S0:12345:respawn:/sbin/agetty -L 9600 ttyS0 vt102


But if the bash shell (or the login process) is killed, getty respawns (restarts). Why?
Well, both the login process and bash are replacements for getty and inherit the signal connections
establish by their predecessors. In fact if you observe the details you will notice that the
replacement process will have the same process ID as the original process. Thus bash is sort of
getty in disguise with the same process ID number. If bash is killed it is just like getty was killed
(even though getty isn't running any more). This results in getty respawning.

When one logs out, all the processes on that serial port are killed including the bash shell. This
may also happen (if enabled) if a hangup signal is sent to the serial port by a drop of DCD voltage
by the modem. Either the logout or drop in DCD will result in getty respawning. One may force
getty to respawn by manually killing bash (or login) either by hitting the k key, etc. while in &quot;top&quot;
or with the &quot;kill&quot; command. You will likely need to kill it with signal 9 (which can't be ignored).


The cycle illustrated:

       init - spawns -&gt; getty -- starts -&gt; login - starts --&gt; shell
         \                                                      /
          \---------------&lt;&lt;  returns control to &lt;&lt;------------/

You can identify the login shell by a minus in start of the name.

Example: ps output (filtered)
walter   32255  0.0  0.7  4012 1772 pts/36   Ss   14:53   0:00 -bash

=== About mgetty ===

mgetty was written as a replacement for uugetty which was in existence long before mgetty. Both
are for use with modems but mgetty is best (unless you already are committed to uugetty). Mgetty
may be also used for directly connected terminals. In addition to allowing dialup logins, mgetty also
provides FAX support and auto PPP detection. It permits dialing out when mgetty is waiting for an
incoming phone call. There is a supplemental program called vgetty which handles voicemail for
some modems. mgetty documentation is fair (except for voice mail). To automatically start PPP one
must edit /etc/mgetty/login.conf to enable &quot;AutoPPP&quot; You can find the latest information on mgetty
at http://www.leo.org/~doering/mgetty/ and http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty/

=== About uugetty ===

getty_ps contains two programs: getty is used for console and terminal devices, and uugetty for
modems. Greg Hankins (former author of Serial-HOWTO) used uugetty so his writings about it are
included here. See Uugetty.

=== About getty_em ===

This is a simplified version of ``uugetty''. It was written by Vern Hoxie after he became fully
confused with complex support files needed for getty_ps and uugetty. It is part of the collection of
serial port utilities and information by Vern Hoxie available via ftp from
scicom.alphacdc.com/pub/linux. The name of the collection is ``serial_suite.tgz''.

=== About agetty ===

This subsection is long since the author tried using agetty for dialin. agetty is seemingly simple
since there are no initialization files. But when I tried it, it opened the serial port even when there
was no CD signal present. It then sent both a login prompt and the /etc/issue file to the modem in
the AT-command state before a connection was made. The modem thinks all this an AT command
and if it does contain any &quot;at&quot; strings (by accident) it is likely to adversely modify your modem
profile. Echo wars can start where getty and the modem send the same string back and forth over
and over. You may see a &quot;respawning too rapidly&quot; error message if this happens. To prevent this
you need to disable all echoing and result codes from the modem (E0 and Q1). Also use the -i option
with agetty to prevent any /etc/issue file from being sent.

If you start getty on the modem port and a few seconds later find that you have the login process
running on that port instead of getty, it means that a bogus user name has been sent to agetty from
the modem. To keep this from happening, I had to save my dial-in profile in the modem so that it
become effective at power-on. The other saved profile is for dial-out. Then any dial-out programs
which use the modem must use a Z, Z0, or Z1 in their init string to initialize the modem for dial-out
(by loading the saved dial-out profile). If the 1-profile is for dial-in you use Z1 to load it, etc. If you
want to listen for dial-in later on, then the modem needs to be reset to the dial-in profile. Not all
dial-out programs can do this reset upon exit from them.

Thus while agetty may work OK if you set up a dial-in profile correctly in the modem hardware, it's
probably best suited for virtual consoles or terminals rather than modems. If agetty is running for
dialin, there's no easy way to dial out. When someone first dials in to agetty, they should hit the
return key to get the login prompt. agetty in the Debian distribution is just named getty.

=== About mingetty, and fbgetty ===

mingetty is a small getty that will work only for monitors (the usual console) so you can't use it
with modems for dialin. fbgetty is as above but supports framebuffers. 

'''Basic networking configuration'''

'''Configuring PAP/CHAP authentication for PPP'''

if the server to which you are connecting requires PAP or CHAP
authentication, edit your PPP options file and add the following lines :
 #
 # force pppd to use your ISP user name as your 'host name' during the authentication process
 name &lt;your ISP user name&gt; # you need to edit this line
 #
 # If you are running a PPP *server* and need to force PAP or CHAP uncomment the appropriate
 # one of the following lines. Do NOT use these is you are a client connecting to a PPP server (even if
 # it uses PAP or CHAP) as this tells the SERVER to authenticate itself to your machine (which
 # almost certainly can't do - and the link will fail).
 #+chap
 #+pap
 #
 # If you are using ENCRYPTED secrets in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file, then uncomment the
 # following line. Note: this is NOT the same as using MS encrypted passwords as can be
 # set up in MS RAS on Windows NT.
 #+papcrypt

Basic networking configuration
'''Using MSCHAP'''

Microsoft Windows NT RAS can be set up to use a variation on CHAP (Challenge/Handshake
Authentication Protocol). In your PPP sources tar ball, you will find a file called
README.MSCHAP80 that discusses this.

You can determine if the server is requesting authentication using this protocol by enabling
debugging for pppd. If the server is requesting MS CHAP authentication, you will see lines like :

 rcvd [LCP ConfReq id=0x2 &lt;asyncmap 0x0&gt; &lt;auth chap 80&gt; &lt;magic 0x46a3&gt;]

The critical information here is auth chap 80.
In order to use MS CHAP, you will need to recompile pppd to support this. Please see the
instructions in the README.MSCHAP80 file in the PPP source file for instructions on how to
compile and use this variation.

You should note that at present this code supports only Linux PPP clients connecting to an MS
Windows NT server. It does NOT support setting up a Linux PPP server to use MSCHAP80
authentication from clients.

=== The PAP/CHAP secrets file ===

If you are using pap or chap authentication, then you also need to create the secrets file. These are:

 /etc/ppp/pap-secrets
 /etc/ppp/chap-secrets

They must be owned by user root, group root and have file permissions 740 for security.
The first point to note about PAP and CHAP is that they are designed to authenticate computer
systems not users. Huh? What's the difference? I hear you ask. Well now, once your computer has
made its PPP connection to the server, ANY user on your system can use that connection - not just
you. This is why you can set up a WAN (wide area network) link that joins two LANs (local area
networks) using PPP.

PAP can (and for CHAP DOES) require bidirectional authentication - that is a valid name and
secret is required on each computer for the other computer involved. However, this is NOT the way
most PPP servers offering dial-up PPP PAP-authenticated connections operate.

That being said, your ISP will probably have given you a user name and password to allow you to
connect to their system and thence the Internet. Your ISP is not interested in your computer's
name at all, so you will probably need to use the user name at your ISP as the name for your
computer. This is done using the name user name option to pppd. So, if you are to use the user
name given you by your ISP, add the line :

 name your_user name_at_your_ISP

to your /etc/ppp/options file. Technically, you should really use user our_user name_at_your_ISP for
PAP, but pppd is sufficiently intelligent to interpret name as user if it is required to use PAP. The
advantage of using the name option is that this is also valid for CHAP.

As PAP is for authenticating computers, technically you need also to specify a remote computer
name. However, as most people only have one ISP, you can use a wild card (*) for the remote host
name in the secrets file.
It is also worth noting that many ISPs operate multiple modem banks connected to different
terminal servers - each with a different name, but ACCESSED from a single (rotary) dial in
number. It can therefore be quite difficult in some circumstances to know ahead of time what the
name of the remote computer is, as this depends on which terminal server you connect to!
Basic networking configuration

=== The PAP secrets file ===

The /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file looks like :
 # Secrets for authentication using PAP
 # client        server       secret     acceptable_local_IP_addresses

The four fields are white space delimited and the last one can be blank (which is what you want for
a dynamic and probably static IP allocation from your ISP). Suppose your ISP gave you a user
name of fred and a password of flintstone you would set the name fred option in
/etc/ppp/options[.ttySx] and set up your /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as follows :
 # Secrets for authentication using PAP
 # client        server  secret  acceptable local IP addresses
 fred  * flintstone

This says for the local machine name fred (which we have told pppd to use even though it is not our
local machine name) and for ANY server, use the password (secret) of flintstone. Note that we do
not need to specify a local IP address, unless we are required to FORCE a particular local, static IP
address. Even if you try this, it is unlikely to work as most PPP servers (for security reasons) do not
allow the remote system to set the IP number they are to be given.

=== The CHAP secrets file ===

This requires that you have mutual authentication methods - that is you must allow for both your
machine to authenticate the remote server AND the remote server to authenticate your machine.

So, if your machine is fred and the remote is barney, your machine would set name fred
remotename barney and the remote machine would set name barney remotename fred in their
respective /etc/ppp/options.ttySx files.

The /etc/chap-secrets file for fred would look like :

 # Secrets for authentication using CHAP
 # client        server  secret            acceptable local IP addresses
 fred  barney flintstone
 barney  fred wilma

and for barney :

 # Secrets for authentication using CHAP
 # client        server  secret            acceptable local IP addresses
 barney          fred    flintstone
 fred  barney wilma

Note in particular that both machines must have entries for bidirectional authentication. This
allows the local machine to authenticate itself to the remote AND the remote machine to
authenticate itself to the local machine.

=== Handling multiple PAP-authenticated connections ===

Some users have more than one server to which they connect that use PAP. Provided that your
user name is different on each machine to which you want to connect, this is not a problem.

However, many users have the same user name on two (or more - even all) systems to which they
connect. This then presents a problem in correctly selecting the appropriate line from /etc/ppp/pap-
secrets.

As you might expect, PPP provides a mechanism for overcoming this. PPP allows you to set an
'assumed name' for the remote (server) end of the connection using the remotename option to pppd.

Let us suppose that you connect to two PPP servers using the username fred. You set up your
/etc/ppp/pap-secrets something like :
 fred pppserver1 barney
 fred pppserver2 wilma

Now, to set connect to pppserver1 you would use name fred remotename pppserver1 in your ppp-
options and for pppserver2 name fred remotename pppserver2.

As you can select the ppp options file to use with pppd using the file filename option, you can set up
a script to connect to each of your PPP servers, correctly picking the options file to use and hence
selecting the right remotename option.

Key terms, files and utilities :
 /sbin/route
 /sbin/ifconfig
 PAP, CHAP, PPP
 /etc/*

'''Chocolate''' is a common ingredient in many kind of sweets. It is made from the fermented, roasted, and ground seeds of the tropical cacao tree. The substance yielded is intensely bitter. In the U.S. this substance is usually sweetened and the sweetened product is referred to as chocolate.

__FORCETOC__

==History==

The word &quot;chocolate&quot; comes from the Aztecs of Mexico, and is derived from the Nahuatl word ''xocolatl'', which is a combination of the words, ''xocolli'', meaning &quot;bitter&quot;, and ''atl'', which is &quot;water&quot;.

When it was first introduced into European culture, '''chocolate''' referred to a bitter beverage, often with [[Cookbook:Chili pepper|Chili pepper]] and/or [[Cookbook:Corn|Corn]] added.  It became popular in Europe only after these ingredients were replaced with [[Cookbook:Vanilla|Vanilla]] and [[Cookbook:Sugar|Sugar]] to make the beverage we now know as [[Cookbook:Hot Chocolate|hot chocolate]].

==Chocolate Making==

To prevent the fatty skin that forms on hot chocolate, a defatted product known as '''cocoa''' was developed.  The terms &quot;hot cocoa&quot; and &quot;hot chocolate&quot; are now often used interchangeably, but they denote a difference in the amount of cocoa butter in the beverage.  Excess cocoa butter from this process is now used to make chocolate bars more durable and palatable, so that cocoa and chocolate are almost always made in tandem.  As a general rule, elite cocoa makers (Hershey, Nestle) make good-but-not-excellent chocolate, and elite chocolate makers (Scharffen Berger, Ghiradelli) make good-but-not-excellent cocoa.

A further elaboration was the development of '''Dutch process''' cocoa, in which some of the acids in the chocolate liquor are neutralized to reduce its sour taste and allow more subtle flavors to come to the fore.  A given amount of Dutch cocoa therefore tastes more chocolatey than the same amount of unprocessed cocoa.  In the ingredients list of commercial foods, it is often listed as &quot;cocoa processed with alkali&quot;.

==Types of Chocolate==

[[Image:Chocolate.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Chocolate most commonly comes in dark, milk, and white varieties, with cocoa solids contributing to the brown coloration.]]
There are many kind of chocolate, including:

===Unsweetened or Baking Chocolate===

Unsweeted chocolate, or baking chocolate, is simply chocolate with nothing added. It has a very bitter flavor so is not often eaten plain, but it is used in baking.

===Dark Chocolate===

Dark chocolate has no added milk, but does have sugar added, and is sometimes called plain chocolate. The U.S. government calls this Sweet Chocolate and requires 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify 35% cocoa solids.

Researchers in Scotland and Italy say dark chocolate has much better anti-oxidant properties than milk chocolate - and much like drinking red wine in moderation, it may help protect against heart disease and cancer.

===Bittersweet and Semi-Sweet Chocolate===

Bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolates are dark chocolates with high percentages of cocoa liquor (bittersweet having more than semi-sweet) and added sugar. They have a bitter flavor and are mostly used for cooking, but can be eaten plain. The two are interchangable in most recipes.

===Milk Chocolate===

Milk chocolate is chocolate with milk and sugar added. The U.S. government requires 10% concentration chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 25% cocoa solids.

===White Chocolate===

White chocolate is a confection based on cocoa butter and sugar, but not the cocoa solids.

===Cocoa Powder===

Cocoa powder is an unsweetened chocolate with most of the cocoa butter removed and pulverized into a powder, making it more convenient for cooking since melting is not required.

===Chocolate Chips===

Chocolate chips are small chunks of sweet chocolate, often sold in a round, flat-bottomed teardrop shape, usually 1 cm in diameter.

==Storing Chocolate==

Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 degrees Celsius (59 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit), with a relative humidity of less than 50%.

Chocolate should be stored away from other foods as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate should be protected from light by storing in a dark place or wrapping in paper.

Various types of &quot;blooming&quot; effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot day can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, these conditions are perfectly safe for consumption.

'''Carbohydrates''', also known as '''carbs''', refer to '''starches''' (complex carbohydrates) and to [[cookbook:sugar|sugars]] (simple carbohydrates).

==The Role of Carbohydrates in the Human Diet==

Strictly speaking, carbohydrates are not necessary for human nutrition because [[cookbook:protein|proteins]] can be converted to glucose, which the body uses for energy. The traditional diet of many peoples consists of nearly no carbohydrates, and these people have been shown to be perfectly healthy. However, carbohydrates require less [[cookbook:water|water]] to digest than do proteins or [[cookbook:fat|fats]].

Problems have been cited for the long term effects of a no-carbohydrate diet. These include reduced athletic performance, possible brain damage, and nephrotoxicity.{{Citation needed}} The brain can only utilize carbohydrates for energy, and protein may not supply enough in many cases. The increase in protein means that more ammonia groups need to be removed from the blood.

Carbohydrates have a varying degrees of [[w:glycemic index|glycemic index]]. People with [[w:Diabetes|diabetes]] or hyperglycemia (elevated blood glucose levels) need to carefully monitor their carbohydrate intake to prevent complications related to prolonged high blood glucose levels or acute hypoglycemia (too little blood glucose), and avoiding foods with high glycemic indexes can help.

==Cooking with Carbohydrates==
===Baking===
The dry heat of baking changes the structures of starches, partially sealing in the food's moisture. Browning can occur by caramelization of sugars and the Maillard reaction.

The most common baked item is bread. Variations in the ovens, ingredients and recipes used in the baking of bread result in the wide variety of breads produced around the world. Over time breads become hard in a process known as going stale. This is not primarily due to moisture being lost from the baked products, but more a reorganization of the way in which the water and starch are associated over time. This process is similar to recrystallization, and is promoted by storage at cool temperatures, such as those of a domestic refrigerator.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I mentioned reductionism on the main page.  'Is such reductionism healthy?' might be a good topic for a student essay, but probably not for a student doing their first course in logic.

When learning logic, it took me a long time to grasp the difference between &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; and &amp;rarr;, and I still haven't worked out how best to explain this.  Anyone care to offer a succinct statement of their differences, and how they are related?
--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 12:00, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)


'''conclusion 'follows from' premises.'''  What does 'follows from' mean?  Well, we could reduce this to something syntactic, that one is making moves permitted by the formal language game, but this is side-stepping the issue.  Or it could could describe that eureka feeling when you see that q really is a consequence of p - 'follows from' here is a psychological event.  But this doesn't seem to be enough.  It is as if one needs to have a doctrine Clear and Distinct Ideas that the psychological 'eureka' is not a deception.

The reductionist program of reducing reason to rules of inference - Well, cool enough.  But these rules have been distilled from our experience of the big world out there.  Our rules aren't necessarily god the creator of the world, rather the world is creator of our rules.

--[[User:Publunch|publunch]] 12:48, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)

'intuitively obvious' - I think there is a conversation between Achilles and a tortoise somewhere in Hofstadter and Dennett's ''Godel Escher Bach''.  The tortoise in this conversation refuses to take even the most basic rule of inference as being intuitively obvious.  It is a rather long conversation.  This is a mildly entertaining little piece and I can recommend it to anyone who can lay their hands on the book.  Indeed the whole book is entertaining.
I'll try to find the full bibliographic details, then I'll put in a proper reference to it in the main text and then delete this note.

'''

----

I grew up believing my surname rather unique and my given name to be only shared with father and a distant uncle.  Imagine my surprise when I entered the world of the wide web.  

Not only is Klan McKenzie prolific, but Roberts were abundant within.  Because I perceive many, including my father, much more dignified, distinguished, and reserved than myself I sought to create an identity that would protect them from unjust credit or blame.  

Since my written signature was already an abbreviation of an otherwise long name that required a middle initial to distinguish me from &quot;Robert son of Kenzie, the elder&quot; it wasn't a great leap to my current username.  

It harkens to days when spaces had to be signified with underscores that required a two handed reach, and pays tribute to search engines habit of using spaces as delimiters to find reference to the multitudes aforementioned.  Since most input fields are tolerent of the Universal Resources Locator format the periods seemed a natural fit since they also connotate abbreviations.

Of course there's exceptions to every rule.  So it's likely you'll find me designated RobtDMcKenzie as well.  If I'm lazy or in a hurry, even just Robt.  

Robt and ROBT is more popular that you'd think, so it is sometimes expressed R0BT.  Go ahead and read it a robot if you must.  I don't care.

Another identity you may find me writing/posting under is alteredEG0.  It involves having ptsd and the responses I got when I was trying to identify (along with everyone else) what was wrong with me and why.    It's an in you face slap at those who beat me up with 'get over it', take responsibility, and 'just think happy thoughts'.  There are many other cliche those erzatz folks who ignore cause and effect favor but that's fodder for other gardens.

= The Sentential Language =

This page informally describes our sentential language which we name &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  A more formal description will be given in [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax|Formal Syntax]] and [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Semantics|Formal Semantics]] 

== Language components  ==

=== Sentence letters ===

The ''sentence letters'' are single letters such as
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P},\ \mathrm{Q},\ \mathrm{R},\ \mbox{etc.}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Some texts restrict this to lower case letters, and others restrict them to capital letters.  We will use capital letters.

Intuitively, we can think of sentence letters as translating English sentences that are either true or false.  Thus, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can translate 'The Earth is a planet' (which is true) or 'The moon is made of green cheese' (which is false).  But &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can not translate 'Great ideas sleep furiously' because it is neither true nor false.  Translations between English and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; work best if we restrict ourselves to timelessly true or false [[w:Present tense|present tense]] sentences in the [[w:Indicative mood#Indicative_mood|indicative mood]].  You will see from the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/The Sentential Language#Translation |translation section below]] that we do not always follow that advice.  The truth or falsity of those sentences is not timeless.

=== Sentential connectives ===

''Sentential connectives'' are special symbols in Sentential Logic that represent truth functional relations.  They are used to build larger sentences from smaller sentences.  The truth or falsity of the larger sentence can then be computed from the truth or falsity of the smaller ones.

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Conjunction:}\ \land\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* Translates to English as 'and'.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''conjunction'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are its ''conjuncts''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true if both &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are true&amp;mdash;and is false otherwise.
:* Some authors use an '''&amp;''' (ampersand), '''&amp;bull;''' (heavy dot) or juxtaposition.  In the last case, an author would write
:: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PQ}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:instead of our
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Disjunction:}\ \lor\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* Translates to English as 'or'.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''disjunction'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are its ''disjuncts''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true if at least one of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are true&amp;mdash;is false otherwise.
:* Some authors may use a vertical stroke: '''|'''.  However, this comes from computer languages rather than logicians' usage.  Logicians normally reserve the vertical stroke for nand (alternative denial).  When used as nand, it is called the [[w:Sheffer stroke|Sheffer stroke]].

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Negation:}\ \lnot\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* Translates to English as 'it is not the case that' but is normally read 'not'.
:* &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''negation''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false&amp;mdash;and is false otherwise.
:* Some authors use '''~''' (tilde) or '''&amp;minus;'''.  Some authors use an overline, for example writing 
:: &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathrm{P}}\ \ \mbox{and}\ \ (\overline{(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q})} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
: instead of 
::&lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\ \ \mbox{and}\ \ (\lnot(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor \mathrm{R})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Conditional:}\ \rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* Translates to English as 'if...then' but is often read 'arrow'.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''conditional''.  Its ''antecedent'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and its ''consequent'' is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true if either &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is false or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true (or both)&amp;mdash;and is false otherwise.
:* By that definition, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the more verbose &lt;math&gt;(\lnot \mathrm{P}) \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
:* Some authors use '''&amp;sup;''' (hook).

&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Biconditional:}\ \leftrightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:* Translates to English as 'if and only if'
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''biconditional''.
:* &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is true if &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; both are true or both are false&amp;mdash;and false otherwise.
:* By that definition, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the more verbose &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \lor ((\lnot \mathrm{P}) \land (\lnot \mathrm{Q}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. It is also equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}) \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{P})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the conjunction of two conditionals where in the second conditional the antecedent and consequent are reversed from the first.
:* Some authors use '''&amp;equiv;'''.

=== Grouping ===

Parentheses &lt;math&gt;(\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are used for grouping.  Thus 

: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} ) \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land (\mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}))\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

are two different and distinct sentences.  Each negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, and biconditionals gets a single pair or parentheses.

== Notes ==

(1) An ''atomic sentence'' is a sentence consisting of just a single sentence letter.  A ''molecular sentence'' is a sentence with at least one sentential connective.  The ''main connective'' of a molecular formula is the connective that governs the entire sentence.  Atomic sentences, of course, do not have a main connective.

(2) The '''&amp;sup;''' and '''&amp;equiv;''' signs for conditional and biconditional are historically older, perhaps a bit more traditional, and definitely occur more commonly in [[Main_Page|WikiBooks]] and [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]] than our arrow and double arrow.  They originate with [[w:Alfred North Whitehead|Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[w:Bertrand Russell|Bertrand Russell]] in [[w:Principia_Mathematica|''Principia Mathematica'']].  Our arrow and double arrow appear to originate with [[w:Alfred Tarski|Alfred Tarski]], and may be a bit more popular today than the Whitehead and Russell's '''&amp;sup;''' and '''&amp;equiv;'''.

(3) Sometimes you will see people reading our arrow as ''implies''.  This is fairly common in [[Main_Page|WikiBooks]] and [[w:Main_Page|Wikipedia]].  However, most logicians prefer to reserve 'implies' for metalinguistic use.  They will say:

: If P then Q

or even

: P arrow Q

They approve of:

: 'P' implies 'Q'

but will frown on:

: P implies Q

== Translation ==

Consider the following English sentences:

: If it is raining and Jones is out walking, then Jones has an umbrella.
: If it is Tuesday or it is Wednesday, then Jones is out walking.


To render these in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, we first specify an appropriate English translation for some sentence letters.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt; It is raining.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt; Jones is out walking.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt; Jones has an umbrella.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt; It is Tuesday.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{T}\ :\,\!&lt;/math&gt; It is Wednesday.


We can now partially translate our examples as:
: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If}\ \mathrm{P}\ \mbox{and}\ \mathrm{Q},\ \mbox{then}\ \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{If}\ \mathrm{S}\ \mbox{or}\ \mathrm{T},\ \mbox{then}\ \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;


Then finish the translation by adding the sentential connectives and parentheses:
: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;((\mathrm{S} \lor \mathrm{T}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Q})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Quoting convention ==

For English expressions, we follow the logical tradition of using single quotes.  
This allows us to use &lt;nowiki&gt;'&amp;nbsp;'It is raining'&amp;nbsp;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; as a quotation of 'It is raining'.

For expressions in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L_S}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, it is easier to treat them as self-quoting so that the quotation marks are implicit.  Thus we say that the above example translates &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S} \rightarrow \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (note the lack of quotes) as 'If it is Tuesday, then It is raining'.

Kids will probably mostly like chicken and meats. If you've got a kid who doesn't eat anything but chicken, which most people do, try making foods that '''''look''''' like chicken, but are healthy. If that doesn't work, don't give in. Just try to make your kid's favorite thing but with a healthy ingredient added in. It works every time!

This is somewhat an interpretive recipe, so you have to get a little creative.  But creativity is what spawned it, and no two people come up with exactly the same sauce.  Regardless, what results will be very hot, and very delicious provided you like hot sauce.  If you don't, make Swiss pudding instead. 

Usually I get 6 to 10 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounces]] (about 1 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]], or 180 to 300 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) per batch.

== Ingredients ==

* 1 to 5 cloves of [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], depending on size and taste
* [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] (any kind will do... apple, balsamic, red wine)
* [[Cookbook:Lime|lime]] juice (fresh, frozen, cocktail... you decide.)
* a squirt or three of [[Cookbook:Honey|honey]]
* 10 or so [[Cookbook:Habanero|habanero]] peppers, de-stemmed
* [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==

# Mix all ingredients except peppers and honey in [[Cookbook:Blender|blender]] until you think you've got enough liquid.  It doesn't matter how much of anything you use&amp;mdash;just throw it all in.  As a general rule though, your total liquid volume should be about the size of 3 or 4 peppers.  It is important though, that you make sure it covers up to the middle of the blades your blender.
# Pulse until smooth.
# Add habaneros and pulse more, until they're fairly chopped up, still chunky.
# Add a squirt or three of honey, and blend for about 30 seconds.

Your resulting [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]] should be fairly thick, but contain only very small particles of peppers and garlic.  If there are chunks bigger than grains of salt, keep blending until they are tiny.

Depending on how much you threw in, and how strong your taste buds are, this should make 50-200 servings.

''Morphology'' is the identification, analysis and description of the structure of words, practiced by ''morphologists''.

This chapter will largely follow the morpheme-based theory of morphology, but a description of other views of morphology will be presented at the end.

== Morphemes ==

A ''morpheme'' is roughly defined as the smallest linguistic unit that has semantic meaning.  For example, the word ''boy'' cannot be broken down into any further unit of meaning.  We can have: 
*''b''; 
*''o''; 
*''y'';
*''bo''; 
*''by'' and 
*''oy'' – none of which mean anything.  We say that ''boy'' is made of only one morpheme.

But the word ''antigovernment'' can be broken down into:
* ''anti-'' = against
* ''govern'' = to rule/administrate
* ''-ment'' = noun suffix
Therefore, we say that ''antigovernment'' is made of three morphemes.

One should be careful not to break a single morpheme into multiple constituent morphemes. This is a common error in the analysis of some languages, such as Chinese. The word ''youyu'' (猶豫), meaning ''hesitate'' is a notorious example. As most Chinese characters represent a single morpheme, linguists before the Qing Dynasty believed that ''all'' characters represented a single morpheme. As a result, the word ''youyu'' has become the subject of much nonsensical speculation. One scholar during the Tang Dynasty believed that it originated from the description of a deer-like monkey that would look left and right before climbing a tree. Later generations discovered that ''youyu'' was, in fact, a single disyllabic morpheme, disproving these odd claims.

=== Classifying Morphemes ===
Morphemes are categorised thus:
* '''Bound morphemes''': They cannot stand alone, i.e. they are affixes.
** '''Derivational morphemes''': We change the grammatical category or the meaning of the word. Examples are ''re-'', ''de-'', ''un-'', ''-ness'', ''-ly'' and so on.
** '''Inflectional morphemes''': We do not change the meaning or grammatical category of the word with these. We use them to mark plurality, tense, agreement, case and so on.
* '''Free morphemes'''. They can be used alone.
** '''Lexical morphemes''': They represent the concepts of the message we wish to bring across. ''Ship'', ''orange'' and ''president'' are some examples. They are an open set of words in a language.
** '''Functional morphemes''': They are functional words, like determiners, pronouns, conjunctions and so on. ''Whatever'', ''because'' and ''against'' are some examples.

== Affixation ==

'''Affixes''' are our workhorse morphemes&amp;mdash;the tools we use again and again to assemble new words. There are several kinds of affixes:

* '''Suffixes''' Suffixes are morphemes that attach to the end of a word. Examples are ''-ion'' in ''motion'' and ''-ate'' in ''investigate''. Suffixes are written with an initial hyphen.
* '''Prefixes''' Prefixes attach to the beginning of a word. Examples are ''re-'' in ''redo'' and  ''un-'' in ''unthinkable''. Prefixes are written with a terminal hyphen.
* '''Infixes'''. Although English generally does not have infixes, or morphemes that go &quot;in the middle&quot; of a word, other languages do. An exception in English might be ''-bloody-'' in the following: 
:Q: Are you going to the concert tonight?
:A: Absobloodylutely.
:Infixes are written with initial and terminal hyphens, as above.
*'''Circumfixes'''. Circumfixes are affixes that &quot;surround&quot; the word, attaching to the beginning and end of the word. Although English has few examples of this type of affix, other languages use it. The circumfix is probably most widely known from the German past participle (''ge- -t'' for regular verbs). Probably the only circumfixes in English are ''en- -en'' in ''enlighten'' and ''em- -en'' in ''embolden'', which are essentially the same circumfix, as we will see below. In older usage, however, the present participle could be formed using the circumfix ''a- -ing'': ''a- -ing'' in ''a-flying'' or ''a- -ing'' in ''a-caroling''. Circumfixes are written with initial and terminal hyphens.

Sometimes, multiple affixations can take place. The original word, which is a free morpheme, is known as the '''stem''' or '''root'''. We can attach affixes to it in a continual manner:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:36px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;anti-&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;inter-&lt;/span&gt; 
govern 
&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;-ment&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange;&quot;&gt;-al&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:purple;&quot;&gt;-ist&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Here, ''govern'' is a root, ''anti-'' and ''inter-'' are prefixes, and ''-ment'', ''-al'' and ''-ist'' are suffixes.

== Inflection and Derivation ==
=== Inflectional Morphology ===
[[Image:FlexiónGato.png|thumb|Illustration of the possible inflections of the Spanish word &quot;gato&quot;, meaning &quot;cat&quot;, for gender and number.]]
Inflectional morphology is a type of morphology that deals only with the grammatical function of the word. In other words, it marks the '''grammatical categories'''. For example, you'd add ''-ing'' when you want to put a verb in the progressive aspect. English only has eight inflectional morphemes, all of which are suffixes:

* ''-s'' (after a noun) indicates plurality
* ''-'s'' indicates the possessive case
* ''-s'' (after a verb) indicates the third-person singular
* ''-ing'' indicates the progressive aspect, or participles
* ''-en'' indicates the perfect aspect in some irregular verbs
* ''-ed'' indicates the the past tense
* ''-er'' indicates comparatives
* ''-est'' indicates superlatives

Technically, ''-'s'' is actually not an affix, but a '''clitic'''. This is because it does not necessarily attach to the end of a noun. For example, you can say ''The man from Moscow's book''. Here, ''-'s'' attaches to Moscow, even though the book belongs to the man, not Moscow. This shows that although ''-'s'' attaches itself onto another word, it functions, in terms of its position in the sentence, like a word in its own right.

The types of inflection that occur depends very much on the language. The most common grammatical categories marked by inflection are below:
* '''Tense''': Verbs are inflected based on when an action or stated occured, such as ''-ed'' in English.
* '''Mood''': Verbs are inflected based on the probability that the proposition is true (we will look at propositions in the semantics chapter). For example, in English, we strip down the verb to the root form in the '''imperative mood''' (''Get out!'') and the '''subjunctive mood''' (''that he get out'', in sentences such as ''I insisted that he get out''). This is a 'zero morpheme', which we will cover below.
* '''Person''': Verbs are inflected based on the subject, such as ''-s'' for the third person in English.
* '''Number''': Words are inflected based on the number, such as ''-s'' for plural nouns in English. Note that some languages, like Chinese, have no plurals, while others, like Arabic, can have a '''dual''' value, i.e. two, that is distinct from plurality.
* '''Gender''': Words are inflected based on noun class, such as ''-e'' for French adjectives. For example, in French, you would say ''un homme chantant'' (a singing man) but ''une femme chantante'' (a singing woman). Note how ''chantant'' ('singing') becomes ''chantante''.
* '''Aspect''': Words are inflected based on whether it is finished, such as ''-ing'' and ''-ed''/''-en'' in English.
* '''Comparison''': Adjectives are '''positive''' (no inflection in English), '''comparative''' (''-er'' in English) or '''superlative''' (''-est'' in English).
* '''Case''': Nouns are marked according to their roles in a sentence. For example, in Latin, ''nauta'' ('sailor') is in the '''nominative case''' (subject position), ''nautae'' is in the '''genitive case''' (usually marks possession) or the '''dative case''' (marks '''indirect objects'''), and ''nautam'' is in the '''accusative case''' (marks '''direct objects''').
* '''Evidentiality''': Although it is not present in major languages, a quarter of the world's languages have this category. Consider this example from McLendon (2003):


{| align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ Evidentials in Eastern Pomo
|- style=&quot;background: #e0e0e0;&quot;
! Evidential type
! Example verb
! Gloss
|-
| nonvisual sensory
| {{unicode|pʰa·békʰ'''-ink’e'''}}
| &quot;burned&quot;&lt;br&gt;[speaker felt the sensation]
|-
| inferential
| {{unicode|pʰa·bék'''-ine'''}}
| &quot;must have burned&quot;&lt;br&gt;[speaker saw circumstantial evidence]
|-
| hearsay (reportative)
| {{unicode|pʰa·békʰ'''-·le'''}}
| &quot;burned, they say&quot;&lt;br&gt;[speaker is reporting what was told]
|-
| direct knowledge
| {{unicode|pʰa·bék'''-a'''}}
| &quot;burned&quot;&lt;br&gt;[speaker has direct evidence, probably visual]
|}

Sometimes, a single inflection can handle multiple grammatical categories. For example, in French, the suffix ''-ions'' can mark:
* First person + Plural number + Subjunctive mood: ''que nous allions''
* First person + Plural number + Imperfect tense: ''Nous allions''

It is important to note that grammatical categories are not always marked by inflection. They can also be marked using function words.

=== Derivational Morphology ===
While English is poor in inflectional morphology, it has a complicated system of deriving new words from old.

==Word-formation processes==

===Concatenative morphology===

Concatenation is a process which deals with the formation of new lexical items by putting at least two distinct morphemes together. Concatenative processes are by far the ones which happen to be the most productive in the Indio-European language family. Thus, they are of major concern when it comes to discussing word-formation processes in English. These include compounding, affixation and incorporation. Their presence in the language varies with the last one being even non-existent in English.

===Non-concatenative morphology===

When a word is created as a result of linguistic operations on one morpheme, such process belongs to the branch of non-concatenation. Here are some examples:
*'''Clipping'''/'''Truncation''': A polysyllabic word is reduced. ''Advert'' and ''ad'' are clipped from ''advertisement''.
**'''Apocope'''/'''Back-clipping''': We cut off all but the beginning of the word, like ''hippo'' from ''hippopotamus''.
**'''Apheresis'''/'''Fore-clipping''': We cut off all but the end of the word, like ''bot'' from ''robot'' and ''phone'' from ''telephone''.
**'''Syncope''': We cut off the middle part. This is rare and occurs in ''ma'am'' from ''madam''.
**'''Mixed clipping''': We cut off both the beginning and the end, e.g. ''fridge'' from ''refrigerator''.
**'''Hypocorism''': It is a type of clipping associated with child talk. We take the first syllable, then add an /i/ sound to the end. Examples are ''Aussie'' and ''telly''.
*'''Backformation''': A word is reduced to a simpler form be removing a supposed affix, e.g. ''swindler'' (noun) → ''swindle'' (verb).
*'''Conversion''': A word is changed to another category without changing its form at all, e.g. ''chair'' (noun) → ''chairman'' (verb). Many linguists suggest, however, that this is a case of '''zero-derivation''', which means an empty morpheme is concatenated with the word.
*'''Ablaut'''
*'''Reduplication''': An element of a word is repeated. This is not found in English. Chinese uses reduplication for a variety of purposes. For example, ''qiao'' (knock) is reduplicated to produce ''qiaoqiao'', which can be used as a polite command to knock once.
*'''Acronymisation''': An acronym becomes a word. ''Scuba'' (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus), ''radar'' (RAdio Detection And Ranging) and ''laser'' (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) are common examples.

== Issues in Morphology ==

=== Morphs and Allomorphs ===

=== Morphotactics ===


=== Other Morphemes ===
Certain processes which apply to words are often considered to be &quot;morphemes&quot;, despite having no single surface realization.

== Other Theories of Morphology ==

Lexeme-based morphology views words as being the result of the application of rules to lexemes, rather than the concatenation of morphemes.

Word-based morphology or Realizational morphology views what would traditionally be considered derived or inflected words to be paradigms which bear internal similarity and often systematic relationships to other paradigms due to analogy.</text>

== Probability ==

In  ''probability'' tells us how likely something is to happen. 

If something is absolutely certain to happen, we say its ''probability is one''.  If something cannot possibly happen, we say its ''probability is zero''.  A probability between zero and one  means we don't know for sure what will happen, but the higher the number the more likely something is to happen.  If something has a probability of 0.25, most people would say &quot;it '''probably''' won't happen&quot;.

Unfortunately, children have a hard time understanding what a probability of 0.25 suggests. Children are much more adept in understanding probability in terms of percentages (25%), and fractions (i.e., &quot;It will happen about ¼ of the time&quot;), so it is very important that connections between probability and the development of those skills and understandings occur together.

=== Models ===

It can be difficult but Probability is best taught with models.  Two of the most effective and commonly used models used to teach probability are ''area'' and ''tree diagrams''

Area diagrams give students an idea of how likely something is by virtue of the amount of space reserved for that probability. Consider the toss of a coin:

[[Image:HeadsTailsRectangle.jpg]]

Students can imagine that every time they toss a coin, they need to place that coin into the appropriate side of the rectangle.  As the number of throws increases, the amount of area needed to enclose the coins will be the same on both sides. The same probability can be shown using a tree diagram:

[[Image:HeadsTailsTree.JPG]]

In this simple tree diagram, each line (or event path) will be followed ½ of the time.  Note that both diagrams show '''all''' of the possibilities, not just the probability of one event.

Both of these models can become more complex.  Consider all of the possibilities of throwing two coins in series:

[[Image:TwoTossesRectangle.JPG]]

In the above area rectangle the instances where heads has been tossed twice in a row is represented in the upper left hand corner.  Note that whereas the probability of tossing both heads and tails (in any order) is 50% or 1/2, and the probability of tossing two heads in a row is 25% or 1/4.

[[Image:TwoTossesTree.JPG]]

While the tree diagram gives us the same information, the student needs to understand that all of the events at the bottom have an equal chance of occurring (This is more visually evident in an area diagram).  However, the tree diagram has the advantage of better showing the chronology of events (in this case the order of events is represented by downward motion).

While it may appear that both of these models have strengths and weaknesses, that is not the point.  By becoming familiar with these and other models, students gain a more robust and diverse understanding of the nature of probability.

Consider the following problem:

'''''If at any time a Dog is just as likely to give birth to a male puppy as she is to give birth to a female puppy, and she has a litter of 5 puppies, what is the probability that all of the puppies will be of the same sex?'''''

While this problem can be easily answered with the a standard formula, &lt;math&gt;P = 2 \left ( \frac{1}{2} \right ) ^n&lt;/math&gt;, where n is the number of puppies born, this nomenclature is not only unintelligible to students, but teaching it to students gives them no understanding of the underlying concepts.  On the other hand, if they have explored problems similar to this with a tree diagram, they should fairly easily be able to see patterns emerging from which they can conjecture the &quot;formula&quot; that will find the correct answer.  Consider that a student has drawn a tree diagram that shows the permutations with three puppies in the litter: 

[[Image:3puppiesonly.png]]

If a teacher was to have this student share their work, the class of students in looking at this model would be able to see that there are 8 possible outcomes.  They should also notice that the only instances where litters of all males or all females can be found are on the far ends of the tree.

Students are always encouraged to look for patterns in many of their mathematical explorations. Here, students start to notice that the number of possibilities can be determined by multiplying the number 2 by itself exactly the number of times there is to be a new outcome.  In this case there are three outcomes (puppies born) in a row. So 2 x 2 x 2 = 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, or 8 possible outcomes.  Once the student sees a connection to this pattern, they may conjecture that if there are 5 puppies in a litter, the possible number of outcomes is 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, or 32, of which only 2 (represented by the combinations MMMMM, and FFFFF on the extreme ends) will result in a litter puppies of all the same sex.

Teachers are always looking for students to make connections with other skills they are learning.  In this case the teacher might ask the students to state the answer as a reduced fraction (1/16) and a percentage (6.25%).

Since we're using math to help us understand what will happen, it may help us to be able to write an equation like this:

Pr(X) = y

If this equation is true, we would say &quot;the probability of X happening is y&quot;.  For example, we can say:

X = A coin toss coming up heads

Pr(X) = 0.5

Since the letter X is standing for an event, not a number, and we don't want to get them confused, we'll use capital letters for events, and lower-case letters for numbers.  The symbol ''Pr'' represents a ''function'' that has some neat properties, but for now we'll just think of it as a short way of writing &quot;the probability of X&quot;.

Since probabilities are always numbers between 0 and 1, we will often represent them as percentages or fractions.  Percentages seem natural when someone says something like &quot;I am 100% sure that my team will win.&quot;  However, fractions make more sense for really computing probabilities, and it is very useful to really be able to compute probabilities to try to make good decisions, so we will use fractions here.

The basic rule for computing the probability of an event is simple, if the event is the kind where we are making a definite choice from a known set of choices based on randomness that is fair.  Not everything is like that, but things like flipping a coin, rolling a single die, drawing a card, or drawing a ticket from a bag with your eyes closed are random and fair since each of the possibilities is equally likely.  But the probability of things a little more complicated, like the sum of two dice, is not so easy---and that makes it fun!

Suppose we have a single die.  It has six faces, and as far as we know each is equally likely to be face up if we roll the die.  We can now use our basic rule for computing probability to compute the probability of each possible outcome.  The basic rule is to take the number of outcomes that represent the event (called X) that you're trying to compute the probability of, and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.  So, for rolling a die:

Pr(&quot;getting a one&quot;) = 1 face that has one dot / 6 faces = 1/6

Pr(&quot;getting a two&quot;) = 1 face that has two dots / 6 faces = 1/6

Pr(&quot;getting a three&quot;) = 1 face that has three dot / 6 faces = 1/6

Pr(&quot;getting a four&quot;) = 1 face that has four dots / 6 faces = 1/6

Pr(&quot;getting a five&quot;) = 1 face that has five dot / 6 faces = 1/6

Pr(&quot;getting a six&quot;) = 1 face that has six dots / 6 faces = 1/6

So we have 6 possibilities, and each has a probability of 1/6.  We know that 6 * (1/ 6) = 1.  In fact, that is an example of a fundamental rule of probabilities:

The sum of probabilities of all possibilities is equal to one.

But you probably know that each face of a die is equally likely to land face-up, so so far we haven't done anything useful.  So let's ask the question:  What is the probability of throwing two dice and having their sum equal seven when we add them together?  Knowing that can help us win at a lot of games (such as Monopoly(trademark Parker Brothers)), so it's pretty valuable to know the answer.

To find out the answer, we apply our basic rule, but now it is not so easy to know how many possible outcomes of TWO dice thrown together will equal seven.  However, it is easy to know how many total possible outcomes there are: 6 times 6 = 36.  One way to find out how many possible dice throws add up to seven is just to make a table of all possible dice throws that fills in their sum and count the number of sevens.  Here is one:

   ***| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
   ===========================
   1  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
   2  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8
   3  | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
   4  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
   5  | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11
   6  | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12

The numbers along the top represent the value on the first die and the values on the left represent the values of the second die when you throw them together.  The values inside the table represent the sum of the first and the second dice.  (Note that the numbers range from 2 to 12 --- there's no way to throw two dice and get a number less than two!)

So if we look carefully, we can see that there are exactly 6 sevens in this table.  So the probability of getting a seven if you throw two dice is 6 out of 36, or:

Pr(getting a 7) = 6 / 36 = 1 / 6.

(1 / 6 is a simple fraction equal in value to 6 / 36.)

Maybe that doesn't surprise you, but let's look at all the probabilities:

Pr(getting a 2) = 1 / 36
 
Pr(getting a 3) = 2 / 36

Pr(getting a 4) = 3 / 36

Pr(getting a 5) = 4 / 36

Pr(getting a 6) = 5 / 36

Pr(getting a 7) = 6 / 36

Pr(getting a 8) = 5 / 36

Pr(getting a 9) = 4 / 36

Pr(getting a 10)= 3 / 36

Pr(getting a 11)= 2 / 36

Pr(getting a 12)= 1 / 36

What do you think we would get if we added all of those probabilities together?  They should equal 36 / 36, right?  Check that they do.

Did you know that the probability of a getting a 5 is four times that of getting a two?  Did you know that probability of getting a five, six, seven or eight is higher than the probability of other 7 numbers all together?  We can tell things like that by adding the probabilities together, if the events we're talking about are completely independent, as they are in this case.  So we can even write:

Pr(getting a 5, 6, 7 or 8) = Pr(getting a 5) + Pr(getting a 6) + Pr(getting a 7) + Pr(getting an 8)

But we can substitute these fractions and add them up easily to get:

Pr(getting a 5, 6, 7, or 8) = (4+5+6+5)/36 = 20/36.

Since we know the probability of all possible events must equal one, we can actually use that to compute the probability:

Pr(getting a 2,3,4,9,10,11 or 12) = 1 - (20/36) = (36/36 - 20/36) = 16/36.

This way we didn't have to add up all those individual probabilities, we just subtracted our fraction from 1.

Mathematically we could say:
Pr(some events) = 1 - Pr(all the other possible events)

You might want to take the time now to get two dice and roll them 3*36 = 108 times, recording the sum of them each time.  The number you get for each sum won't be exactly 3 times the probabilities that we have computed, but it should be pretty close!  You should get around 18 sevens.  This is fun to do with friends; you can have each person make 36 rolls and then add together all your results for each sum that is possible.

The fact that if you make a lot of rolls it is likely to get results close the probability of an outcome times the number of rolls is called the Law of Large Numbers.  It's what ties the math of probability to reality, and what lets you do math to make a good decision about what roll you might get in a game, or anything else for which you can compute or estimate a probability.

Here's a homework exercise for each of you: compute the probabilities of every possible sum of throwing two dice, but two different dice: one that comes up 1,2,3 or 4 only, and the other that comes up 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8.  Note that we these dice (which you can get at a gaming store, if you want) the lowest and highest possible roll is the same but the number of possible rolls is only 4 * 8 = 32.

  ***| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8
   =====================================
   1  | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
   2  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10
   3  | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11
   4  | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12

Pr(getting a 2) = 1 / 32
 
Pr(getting a 3) = 2 / 32

Pr(getting a 4) = 3 / 32

Pr(getting a 5) = 4 / 32

Pr(getting a 6) = 4 / 32

Pr(getting a 7) = 4 / 32

Pr(getting a 8) = 4 / 32

Pr(getting a 9) = 4 / 32

Pr(getting a 10)= 3 / 32

Pr(getting a 11)= 2 / 32

Pr(getting a 12)= 1 / 32

(You should check our work by making sure that all these probabilities sum to 32/32 = 1).

So this is interesting: Although the possible scores of the throwing two dice are the same, the probabilities are a little different.  Since 1/32 is a little more than 1/36, you are actually ''more'' likely to get a two or a twelve this way.  And since 4 /32 = 1/8 is less than 6 / 36 = 1/6, you are less likely to get a seven with these dice.  You might have been able to guess that, but by doing the math you know for sure, and you even know by how much, if you know how to subtract fractions well.

So let's review what we've learned:

* We know what the word probability means.
* We know probabilities are always numbers between 0 and 1.
* We know a basic approach to computing some common kinds of probabilities.
* We know that the probabilities of all possible outcomes should add up to exactly 1.
* We know the probability of a result is equal to one minus the probability of all other results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page had very little relevence to showing educators how to teach probability, and even less in explaining to parents how probability is (currently) taught.  With the exception of the roll of a die, which is too lengthy, there is little reference to manipulatives, models, or even simple examples from the real world that children can understand and relate to (such as a series of coin tosses).   Very simply, probability is not taught to the elementary grades with equations, at least not initially. This page needs to show and explain the various models actually used to teach probability to primary grade learners, such as '''tree diagrams''' and '''area diagrams'''.  I have just finished a simple primer on this page that shows those two manipulatives in action and attempts to make connections to other skills students should be learning at this age.

I'm presenting a lecture like this to my child's 5th grade class soon.

I would like to add some, and more vivid examples.

== p(x) ==

Rather than the 'pseudo-but-actualy-far-more-confusing' use of the shortening of probablity to &quot;Pr()&quot; use the convention used in mathematics and statistics &quot;p()&quot;.

Don't create havoc later when someone is trying to teach algebra and the kid goes on and on about how &quot;Pr()&quot; is probablity and not &quot;P * r&quot;.

I think this lesson is great! But maybe a bit too much! It can and should be spread over many lessons! :) [[User:Guaka|Guaka]] 19:58, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

----
I removed reference to 'thou' as the English formal used in Bibles, because 'thou' has never been the formal second person singular; it was the informal with 'ye' being the formal. Eventually, the objective 'you' spread to take over the nominative 'ye' and 'thou' to become nominative itself, and the other forms died out. Therefore, it destroys the entire analogy used, so I removed it.

This Lesson is very iformative.  I just want to say thank-you for your help. [[User:206.176.108.126|206.176.108.126]] 14:54, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

== Possesives? ==

Uhm, do the people writing this book honestly not know Russian?

What do prepositional case possesive pronouns have to do with anything? 
1. They're under the topic &quot;verb conjugation, past tense&quot;
2. Have you said anything about normal possesives and if yes then where? How about a link to that place?
3. Oh yeah, and the opposite of &quot;have to&quot; is actually &quot;not have to&quot; &quot;nye dolzhen&quot;.

[[User:Ladywater|Ladywater]] 06:27, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

== about the articles ==

&lt;&lt;Russian does not distinguish &quot;a student&quot; from &quot;the student&quot;; that is, it does not use articles (&quot;a&quot;, 
&quot;an&quot;, &quot;the&quot;). So the above sentence could also be translated as &quot;I am ''the'' student.&quot;&gt;&gt;

It is actually incorrect. &quot;I am ''the'' student.&quot; implies that speaker says he's the student mentioned before. I guess it should be translated &quot;Я ''тот'' студент.&quot; (literally, I'm that student) or &quot;Студень - это я&quot;. Russian doesn't have articles, but it has different means to convey the meanings for which articles are used in English.

== Formal and Informal ==

'The word &quot;your&quot; also comes in formal and informal: вас (formal) and тебя (informal).'

This is incorrect. Your would be ваш (formal) and твой (informal) (nominative case of possessive pronouns) while вас and тебя are genitive forms of pronouns вы and ты and cannot be translated as yours. 

Bogdan

The acronym FYI is used. This may be familiar to an American reader but it is not to this English one. Having looked it up, however, I still cannot make sense of the the sentence in which it is used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, Attention-tunnel:
Welcome to Wikibooks.
Did Edan say that you could reproduce the Mythos and Ethos:
http://www.aspergia.com/terms/index.htm
According to the terms and conditions here, I don't really think he did, or he would.
As to ''making up'' the ethos and mythos and whatever else, Wikibooks is not really for fiction. It is rather for textbooks.
Reproducing Autism and Computing: I do think we are in a grey area. I do think the material there is copyright, and therefore not subject to the GFDL or the Creative Commons, or any similar public domain licence. Did you write to Andrew and Dinah?
Sincerely and thank you,
[[User:EuropracBHIT|EuropracBHIT]] 06:58, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC).

Hello EuropracBHIT,
I like to answer you. Is this the way I send messages??

To answer your question:
1) No, I did not ask Edan for approval to use the name 'Aspergia'. Therefore I should maybe change the name to something else. I don't want to cause any trouble. My intent was to rembmer people of the idea of 'Re-Branding Aspergia' of which an explenation is on Aspergia. It really doesn't have to have the names Aspergia. Its about the spirit.
2) Murray and Lesser both agreed and are very happy to have their content made publicly available. I have not yet gotten a response from Walker. They like both Creative Commons and GNU. The idea is 1) to translate the papers by the hlp of wiki technology, 2) have it freely available for everyone, 3) encourage delevopment of this model of mind.


:Attention-tunnel
:Yes, this is how you send messages. I would have preferred some indenting and horizontal lines, even I have not mastered this yet though. Some Wikibookians like to reply on the talk page of the receiver, some like to put it on their own talk page. Your way is good as it shows both sides, therefore I will do the same.
:In reply to (1) :
I like the 'new' title of the book, even if it does exclude four-fifths of the diagnosable (not necessarily the diagnosed) autistic spectrum. It is certainly a relief from the intellectual property point of view. I do agree with your letter-spirit contrast, and it would most certainly be about the spirit; specifically the personal flavour and the history and the communual side.
:In reply to (2):
Thank goodness that Murray and Lesser are not nearly as averse to Creative Commons and GNU as I believed they were, both relatively traditional scientists if what I know of their reputations is correct. Wiki technology is indeed a resplendent success in teaching and educative uses. I will be waiting for the Walker response with bated breath, as he has contributed a great deal to the model of mind we are discussing.
:Let's hope the language translation goes as we would wish it.

:It seems we have both misunderstood each other.
:[[User_talk:Perl|Perl]] reminded me of that possibility, and I want to deal with it as soon as I can.
:I know that the vast majority of &quot;The Interest System&quot; (Wikibook) is taken ''directly'' from ''Autism and Computing'', specifically these pages:

The only ''original'' parts of the Interest System are the last three pages on the introduction page.


This wholesale copying (not 10 percent, the WHOLE lot of the website) isn't really allowed under the GFDL. What you said about the GNU isn't completely relevant, even though they do run the GFDL.
Perl did suggest that the content making up ''The Interest System'' would be better placed in Wikisource.
He also suggested that you should put up a link. I think you have done this, but not so directly and clearly.
I do appreciate that you did attempt to put up a link where we can all see where this information comes from. But the point of Wikibooks is ''writing the information yourself'', or at least one of the most ''important'' parts.
Thank you for your understanding,

= Truth Tables =

In the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax|Formal Syntax]], we earlier gave a formal semantics for sentential logic.  A ''truth table'' is a device for using this form syntax in calculating the truth value of a larger formula given an interpretation (an assignment of truth values to sentence letters).  Truth tables may also help clarify the material from the [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Syntax|Formal Syntax]].

== Basic tables ==

=== Negation ===

We begin with the truth table for negation.  It corresponds to clause (ii) of our definition for extended valuations.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|- 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
|}
|}

T and F represent ''True'' and ''False'' respectively.  Each row represents an interpretation.  The first column shows what truth value the interpretation assigns to the sentence letter &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  In the first row, the interpretation assigns &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the value True.  In the second row, the interpretation assigns &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the value False.

The second column shows the value &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; receives under a given row's interpretation.  Under the interpretation of the first row, &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the value False.  Under the interpretation of the second row, &lt;math&gt;\lnot \mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the value True.

We can put this more formally.  The first row of the truth table above shows that when &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[\mathrm{P}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = True, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\lnot \mathrm{P}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = False.  The second row shows that when &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{v}[\mathrm{P}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = False, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathfrak{v}}[\lnot \mathrm{P}]\,\!&lt;/math&gt; = True.  We can also put things more simply:  a negation has the opposite truth value than that which is negated.

=== Conjunction ===

The truth table for conjunction corresponds to clause (iii) of our definition for extended valuations.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
|align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|}
|}

Here we have two sentence letters and so four possible interpretations, each represented by a single row.  The first two columns show what the four interpretations assign to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The interpretation represented by the first row assigns both sentence letters the value True, and so on.  The last column shows the value assigned to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  You can see that the conjunction is true when both conjuncts are true&amp;mdash;and the conjunction is false otherwise, namely when at least one conjunct is false.

=== Disjunction ===

The truth table for disjunction corresponds to clause (iv) of our definition for extended valuations.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \lor \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|}
|}

Here we see that a disjunction is true when at least one of the disjuncts is true&amp;mdash;and the disjunction is false otherwise, namely when both disjuncts are false.

=== Conditional ===

The truth table for conditional corresponds to clause (v) of our definition for extended valuations.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \rightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|}
|}

A conditional is true when either its antecedent is false or its consequent is true (or both).  It is false otherwise, namely when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

=== Biconditional ===

The truth table for biconditional corresponds to clause (vi) of our definition for extended valuations.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot;| &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|}
|}

A biconditional is true when both parts have the same truth value.  It is false when the two parts have opposite truth values.

== Example ==

We will use the same example sentence from [[Formal Logic/Sentential Logic/Formal Semantics#Example | Formal Semantics]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q} \rightarrow \lnot( \mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\ .\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

We construct its truth table as follows:

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor\ \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}) \rightarrow \lnot(\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-

| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-right:solid black&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | F 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T 
| align=&quot;center&quot; | T
|}
|}

With three sentence letters, we need eight valuations (and so lines of the truth table) to cover all cases.  The table builds the example sentence in parts.  The &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; column was based on the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; columns.  The &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; column was based on the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; columns.  This in turn was the basis for its negation in the next column.  Finally, the last column was based on the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P} \land \mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lnot (\mathrm{Q} \lor \mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; columns.

We see from this truth table that the example sentence is false when both &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are true, and it is true otherwise.

This table can be written in a more compressed format as follows.

{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;
| width=&quot;20px&quot; | &amp;nbsp; ||
{|- cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;

| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black; border-right:solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{P}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | (1)&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\land\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | (4)&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | (3)&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\lnot\,\!&lt;/math&gt; 
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Q}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:solid black&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{R})\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A hard drive with important data on it should be treated like a firearm, a helicopter, or a race car engine: if it starts doing anything out of the ordinary, you should find out what's going on, and why-- quickly.  Hard drives have gotten quieter, which is pleasant, but not necessarily helpful.  &quot;Odd noises&quot; from a hard drive, particularly noises the drive has &quot;never made before&quot; when things haven't changed much, are usually bad signs; so are a few other things, listed below.

Three caveats, however.  First, some of these symptoms can be signs of virus or other malicious code.  Run virus scanners frequently!  Second, poor performance that follows a software or hardware change may be related to that change-- though hard drives have occasionally been known to fail after being banged around during a case change, or after a power supply change.  Finally, while users of normal IDE, SATA, and SCSI drives generally don't have to worry about this, RAID users need to watch out for possible driver bugs (and if you think you find one, check the discussion groups for your RAID card/motherboard &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; upgrading).  Those said, here is the list.

Failure is imminent for drives which:
* Take a very long time to spin up on power-on, or frequently do not spin up at all.  This is particularily common with 2.5&quot; (laptop) hard drives, which have comparatively weaker spindle motors.
* Take a very long time to access certain areas of the disk; this is particularily worrisome if that area is the file allocation table (FAT) on FAT32 drives.
* Otherwise have periods of inaccessability exceeding several seconds, even when the machine is largely idle.
* Never turn off their drive activity LEDs-- but used to, and nothing else has changed.
* A hard to track down random computer freeze for up to several minutes at a time, often ending with a pop-up message saying it was unable to write to $MSFT.

Be extremely wary of drives which:
* Change noticeably in audible pitch while running (excluding spindown for suspend, power off, etc.); you are hearing the spindle motor rate change, which is not good.  If this corresponds with a period of drive inaccessability, back up and replace the drive immediately.
* Develop bad sectors.  Modern hard drives do not have this problem; the media may be oxidizing or otherwise degrading.

Additionally, be wary of drives which:
* Have &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; been physically dropped onto a hard surface at any point, in any orientation-- running or not.
* Have &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; overheated (failed to operate properly, and then you realized the cooling fans were off, etc.)-- even once.
* Have ever experienced a significant brownout.
* Have ever experienced a significant power spike.
* Seem to be running very hot.

Be somewhat wary of drives which:
* Have had their physical mounting orientation changed (flat to side-mount, for example) well into their run life (say, after a year or so).
* Have been rough-handled in shipping (but were properly packed in foam, etc.).
* Have exceeded 50% of their warranty period and are being used in a RAID-0 stripe set under high demand.
* Are operating or have operated continuously in a high humidity or marine environment.
* Are exposed to strong vibration, such as automotive, marine, and aircraft applications.

Drives which seem to be heading for doorstop duty should be backed up and replaced as soon as possible.  Drives in a RAID-5 array can usually be left in service until they actually get disqualified by the controller or operating system, assuming you have a hot spare.  However, if you have no choice but to live with a drive that is on its way out for a while, and cannot back it up immediately, following these guidelines:
* Do not use the drive any more than absolutely necessary.
* If at all possible, do not use the drive to host the swapfile.
* Try to avoid writing to the drive more than necessary.
* Do not defragment the drive.  This will stress the actuator or voice coil assembly.  Additionally, if the drive is having write problems, this will effectively destroy otherwise readable data.
* Do not power-cycle (turn off and on) the drive any more than absolutely necessary-- doing so places a lot of stress on the spindle motor.  This usually means leaving the computer on all the time.  Note that modern drives are designed to be power-cycled all the time; this is only a concern for drives which are already failing, or suspected of starting to fail.
* Shut off automatic spin-down in &lt;b&gt;Power Saving&lt;/B&gt; options, for the same reason.

These are just tips to help you limp home.  Treat the drive as a spare tire.  Hard drives never &quot;kind of&quot; work-- if one is starting to fail, you &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; replace it, or it is not a question of &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/I&gt; you will lose the data on it, just &lt;/i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt;.

==[[Japanese]]==
I'm not sure how to write the lessons for this wikibook so I'm still figuring out which method is best for constructing the lessons. I would like to make the lessons become instantly practical, something the reader can put into use right away.

At the moment, I'm consulting different materials such as textbooks, audio, and video. Some of the lessons might be too close to the actual material so I'm going to try fiddling around with the lessons for a bit and try to figure out what's a good structure and format to use for the basic lessons.

I've noticed that there is still a demand for romaji in the wikibooks, so probably it would be best to have it in the beginner's section.

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Past conditional}} ==

The past conditional is fairly simple to form. It is used to express what you would have done if a certain condition had been met. (''I would have gone to school.'')

To form the past conditional, you put the auxiliary verb into the conditional and add the past participle of the verb:
: {{French/Word|Je serais allé{{French/Section|(e)}} à l'école, mais j'étais malade.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">I looked for some of the terms mentioned in the text, but not yet expanded on. Found that these are well covered in Wikipedia. To a large extent the Wikipedia texts are better than the Wikibooks texts on Cell biology. This is not to wonder about. The Wikipedia project has been going for much longer. The point is that there is a risk of effort spent on producing something that already exists. 

We need to find a way to determine what it is that is needed in a textbook and is not expected to be found in Wikipedia and design a process that produces this as a complement to Wikipedia. 

Maybe: 
Light introductions,  
Illustrations,  
Concretizations,  
Examples,

(I know it is incomplete).  I'm not sure how to do that, or if what 
the policy would be, but it seems weird the that High School one is
here but the Primary School one is not.
:Sure; put it on this page. It definitely needs the attention. BTW, don't worry about incompleteness; most of the books on this site are less than 1/3 is there. - [[User:SamE|SamE]] 03:15, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

This template doesnt have any kind of subject-wise organization the way other bookshelf templates do. Should we add some?

== Foci ==
This space is reserved for reminding me where I'm at and what I'm doing there (something my watchlist can't exactly do). Eventually, it could be of use to you, as well. Once I figure out how to make those neat boxes, that is.

*[[Computer Science bookshelf]]
**The organization is haphazard, to say the least. We should look at a CS library (any will do, really) and steal ideas from them on organization.
*[[Wikiversity:School of Computer Science]]
**Work on a basic curriculum.

== Mission statement ==
*To contribute to anything related to [[Computer Science]]; to turn the Wikibook section into an organized library/study hall/university for computer science.
*To keep reminding people that this is a wiki, and that there's no one true way of organizing information, nor should there be.
*To keep reminding people that this is not Wikipedia, and that Wikibooks should be structured (but since it is a wiki, structured in many ways).
*To explore and establish connections with other disciplines.
**There's CS and [[mathematics]], CS and [[physics]], CS and [[linguistics]] and CS and [[psychology]], to name a few. Clearly, I'm not talking about people just ''using'' computers, but using them in ways that extend both the CS and the other discipline in directions that wouldn't exist without CS.

== Personal background ==
I have a bachelor's degree in CS and am close to getting my master's, so I consider myself not completely ignorant on the topic -- that said, I don't consider myself the world's foremost expert either. :-) My favorite topics include compilers, formal correctness, computational complexity and with a more mathematical flavor, proof checking (in various lambda calculi). And I'm not completely devoid of practical knowledge, either. :-)

== Availability ==
I wish I could devote lots of time, but alas, I'm quite busy right now getting my master's, working part-time and oh, did I mention I'm going to move soon? You can expect some batch editing from me, and don't be upset if I don't react right away -- or even for a few days. That said, I do make a point of checking up on the wikisomethings once a day, even if I can't do much. I have a talk page, use it!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A basic concept required to understand real property in Canadian law is this:  in the Middle Ages, the king technically owned all the land in England, which he gave or rented out in large parcels to his most trusted barons (or &quot;lords&quot;) in return for keeping him in power.  The barons let the peasants live on his land and protected them; in return, he extracted large amounts of rent from them.  This system binding the peasants to the barons was known as the &quot;land tenure&quot; system, as the peasants were &quot;tenants&quot; of the barons.  This system was the basis for the proper ordering of society.

Therefore, it was in the interest of the king and the barons that everyone knew at all times who had &quot;seisin&quot; of the land, i.e., which peasants had to pay rent to the lord for which piece of land.  Any land where this was unclear was &quot;wasted&quot;.  The Medieval rules of real property transfer were therefore very strict in ensuring that it was always very clear who was receiving the land; any lack of clarity (&quot;abeyance of seisin&quot;) was forbidden, and the transfer was nul.

== Type of Estates ==
As English society evolved, the &quot;incidents of tenure&quot; (i.e., obligations to the lord) became regularized, and decreased over time.  By the time Canada inherited British property law, the only incident of tenure left was &quot;Escheat&quot;, that is, when a tenancy ends, the land reverts back to the lord.  Even today, when someone dies without an heir, their land becomes property of the Crown (i.e., the government).

With the passage of the ''Tenures Abolition Act'' in 1660, although all land was still technically owned by the Crown, peasants could buy and sell their rights to the land they were living on, as well as pass it on by will or by gift.  This type of property right became known as an &quot;estate in free and common soccage&quot; or a &quot;free estate&quot;.  This is why property rights over land are known as &quot;real estate&quot;.  

An &quot;estate&quot;, in English medieval legal parlance, was an amount of time over which one held property rights. There are three types of estate: '''Fee simple''', '''fee tail''' and '''life estate'''.

=== Fee Simple ===
This is the most prevalent type of common law estate.  It is what most people think of when they speak of &quot;owning&quot; land.  Although the land is technically owned by the Crown, the holder of fee  simple can use the land, exclude others from it, and dispose of it.

Under fee simple, the rights to land transfer automatically from the holder of the fee simple to his heir.  The holder of the rights in fee simple can grant the land to someone other than his heir.  In order to do this, he must use the phrase '''to [the new owner] &lt;b&gt;and his heirs&lt;/b&gt;'''.  Any other phraseology will not legally transfer fee simple by grant. It will instead be regarded as a &quot;life estate&quot; (see below).  

=== Life Estate ===

The other main type of estate is the life estate.  Very simply, this means that someone holds the rights to the land for the duration of his life, after which it reverts back to the owner in fee simple or his heirs.  For instance, an elderly landowner might remarry late in life.  He may then wish to leave the estate to his new wife for the remainder of her life; when she dies, the land will revert to his heirs, rather than her heirs.

There is no particular phraseology required to grant a life estate.  Something such as &quot;to X for life&quot; is usually sufficient.  If the phrase &quot;to X and his heirs&quot; is not used, then the transfer is presumed to be a life estate.

=== Fee Tail ===

Fee tail is a rare estate, abolished in Canada everywhere except for Manitoba, in which only the lineal heir may inherit land.  One can only transfer one's property rights in the land for as long as one lives; afterwards, the property rights revert to one's lineal descendents.  This limits how land can be bought and sold, therefore reducing the value of the land.

== Conveyancing ==

=== Grants and Wills ===
Grants of land were regarded with suspicion by common law courts (why would anyone give away their land, which was their main source of income?).  That is why it became difficult to grant land in fee simple.  The words &quot;to X and his heirs&quot; became absolutely necessary to make such a grant possible.  Even the words &quot;to X in fee simple&quot; was not good enough.

Wills were interpreted much more flexibly.  Legislation ensured this.  The intention of the testator is usually the decisive factor for a judge in deciding whether the land was given in fee simple or as a life estate.

Conditions for Adverse Possession

Actual and exclusive possession: is a question of fact. Things to consider are: surveyed boundaries, construction of a fence, construction of permanent improvements.

Open and notorious possession: is possession which is not secretive. If  the true owner were to visit the area he/she  should have knowledge of the possessory facts.

Continuous possession: Refers to the statutory time period. An interruption in adverse possession will restart the count.

Hostile possession: Does not imply violence. It is merely possession which is against the true owner’s will.

* any type of agreement between the possessor and the true owner will destroy a claim of adverse possession.

== Adverse possession ==

== Future Interests and Conditional Conveyancing ==

=== Limitations on private authority ===

=== Remainder rules ===

1) No remainders after a grant in fee simple

2) A remainder must always be supported by a precedent freehold estate

3) The benefit of a condition subsequent cannot be enjoyed by a stranger

=== Rule against perpetuities ===
The rule against perpetuities is a rule in property law which prohibits a contingent grant or will from vesting outside a certain period of time. If there is a possibility of the estate vesting outside of the period, regardless how remote, the whole interest is void, and is stricken from a grant. The rule is concerned with the utility of unused property and tries to prevent people from tying up assets for too long a period of time—a concept often referred to as control by the &quot;dead hand&quot;. 

== Leaseholds ==

===Landlord and tenants===

===Assignment and Subleases===

===Bailment===

== Concurrent estates ==

===Joint Tenancy===

===Condominiums===


== Non-possessory interests in land ==

=== Easements ===
An easement is the right of use over the real property of another. Historically it was limited to the right of way and rights over flowing waters. Traditionally it was a right that could only attach to an adjacent land and was for the benefit of all, not a specific person. The right is often described as the right to use the land of another for a special purpose. It is distinguished from a license that only gives one a personal privilege to do something on the land of another usually the permission to pass over the property without creating a trespass.

Typically, an easement is composed of two tenements (types of land). There is the dominant tenement which is the plot of land to which the benefit an appurtenant easement is attached. Second, there is the subservient tenement which is the plot of land which bears the burden of the easement.

Easements may be considered public or private. A private easement is limited to a specific individual such as the owner of an adjoining land. A public easement is one that grants the right to a large group of individuals or to the public in general, such as the easement on public streets and highways or of the right to navigate a river. An appurtenant easement is one that belongs to the owner of the land that benefits from the easement, as compared to other easements (easements in gross) that do not require ownership to obtain the use.

An easement may be implied or express. An express easement is typically included in a document such as a deed or other officially recorded grant, or incorporated by reference to a subdivision plan, or restrictive covenants in an association agreement.

In Torrens jurisdictions easements must be registered to bind successive purchasers.

=== Convenants ===

===Mortgages===

== Land Registration ==

&lt;br&gt;
I've started this book largely to separate the &quot;Troubleshooting&quot; section out of the [[Windows]] manual that's in progress, which I'm also contributing to.  The &quot;Performance&quot; section of that manual will, likewise, also probably be pulled out at some point.&lt;br&gt;

Please feel free to contribute, question, or correct!&lt;br&gt;

===Change Discussion===
&quot;Odds are that you will have spyware on your system. Anyone who browses the internet for any length of time generally does.&quot; -- This is simply not true.  This should be replaced with a list of symptoms users may experience when spyware is running.  For example, &quot;If you find that pop-up advertisements are appearing inexplicably, you may have spyware on your computer...&quot; -- Micah Henning

===New Layout===
It is of my opinion that readers of this book may, more often than not, be looking for a solution to a problem the users have recently incurred.  Therefore, this book should be structured based on symptom and/or the location of the symptom.

For example, if my copy of Windows XP does not boot (the symptom), I will immediately navigate to a section within this book that talks about what to do when Windows does not boot.  Under this section, one may find subsections like &quot;Due to a Bluescreen failure&quot; or &quot;Without any symptoms.&quot;</text>

I would encourage you ''not'' to use &quot;course codes&quot; for Wikiversity, though this possibly needs more discussion as a whole. Wikiversity should be as uniform as possible in its &quot;administrative character&quot;, ideally.

Perhaps this should warrant discussion at [[Talk:Wikiversity]]? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:35, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Don't take that stuff as gospel-- it just occurred to me that putting it down that way would be a good way to get our thoughts together and check for consistency.  The course codes themselves turned out to be a gigantic pain in the neck as soon as I realized I got a number wrong... =]

Still, being able to present that information in a table, concisely, is part of the reason they HAVE course codes for universities.  Any alternatives come to mind?

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Breakpoint. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Breakpoint~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== A method of prime factorization for children ==

In math, the way you get to the correct answer is just as important as getting the right answer.
Sometimes the way one gets the answer can be thought of a proof.  People don't usually use
the word proof when talking about arithmetic problems, but I think it is a good idea and good
habit to get into.  This is a method of doing prime factorization that constructs a proof that
your answer is correct as you arrive at the answer.  It keeps you from getting lost and
shows your work.  More importantly, I think it helps you understand the process.  It
starts out very easy, so that beginners can use it, but later on lets you skip some steps
to save time.

The basic point of prime factorization is to take a number and find the prime factors.
Since each prime factor may occur more than once, for example in the number 4, which
has prime factors (2,2), we know that the factors of a number are not a set but a multi-set.
(The difference will be important as you get to more advanced math.)  So the basic way
we are going to do our work looks like this:

    pf(X)
 = { a reason we believe this}
    (a list of factors)

For example, for the number 4, we could factorize it like this:

    pf(4)
 = { 4 = 2 * 2 }
    (2,2)

This is a very simple proof, and also represents what is sometimes called &quot;showing our work&quot; or
our &quot;scratch paper&quot;.  Learning math is often about learning the language and symbols of math,
and we need to do that now.

I use the symbol pf(X) to mean &quot;the prime factors of X&quot;.  I use a comma list of numbers of &quot;pf(X)&quot; symbols between
parentheses to mean a multi-set of prime factors.  So (pf(45),2,5) means &quot;multi-set that includes
the prime-factors of 45 and the prime number 2
and the prime number 5&quot;.

Now, for doing prime factorization, we are only going to allow certain reasons to go from one step to the next
toward the answer.  For example, &quot;my friend Harold
said so&quot; is not a good reason.

The first reason that we will allow is a  simple multiplication equation of the form x = y * z.   In particular, we are
allowed to do this:

    pf(x)
 = { x = y*z }
    (pf(y),pf(z))

so long as the equation x = y* z is true (and y and z are both greater than 1, otherwise we'd be going in circles!)

The second rule that we are allowed to use is to replace pf(x) with (x) if we know for sure that x is a prime.
For example, you should probably memorize the first ten primes: (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29), so it's
OK to go from substitute the number 23 for pf(23), since we should know by heart that 23 is prime.  When
we do this, we give the reason &quot;23 is prime&quot;.  

Finally, we need to note that ((X)) = (X), no matter what X is , so we never need to write parentheses inside
parentheses (this is not true of multiplication, it is only true because we are using parentheses to mean something
special.

So let's do an example:

    pf(4)
 = { 4 = 2 * 2 }
    (pf(2), pf(2)
 = { 2 is prime}
    (2,2)

So, in this example, we've chained together two steps, with a reason for each one that is very simple.  This
is a good idea when you are starting out.  However, mathematicians also want to be efficient, so if you are
sure of what you are doing, you could do two steps at once:
   
    pf(4)
 = { 4 = 2 * 2, 2 is prime}
    (2,2)

Notice that whether we perform one, two, or even more steps, we are really creating an equation.  If we drop out
the intermediate steps, the result is pf(4) = (2,2), which is probably about what someone would want
on a test.

Now let's do a harder one:

    pf(60)
 = { 60 = 6 * 10 }
    (pf(6), pf(10))
 = { 6= 2* 3, 10 = 2* 5 }
    (2,3,2,5)
 = { commutativity of multiplication}
    (2,2,3,5)

Commutativity of multiplication is a rule that just lets us reorder the factors.  It's nice to have them in
order in our list, so we will often do that at the end.  But that's a lot of writing, so we'll abbreviate it
{ com. of mult. }  Also, notice that in the second step I dropped the unnecessary parentheses, instead
of writing ((2,3), (2,5)).

Now let's do an even bigger one, that's still easy, since the prime factors are all small, and it's
easy to see the factors.

    pf(450)
 = { 450 = 45 * 10 }
    (pf(45), pf(10)}
 = { 45 = 5 * 9, 10 = 2 * 5 }
    (5,pf(9),2,5)
 = { 9 = 3 * 3 , com. of mult.}
    (2,3,3,5,5)

Now we see a way in which we could have made a mistake --- if we forgot that 9 is not prime and
had written (5,9,2,5).  Hopefully we would have noticed, but we need to be careful!

=== When the factors aren't obvious ===

I think this is a nice method when the factors are easy to see.  But unfortunately, sometimes they
aren't easy to see at all, and we need a new symbol for expressing our work in that case.

Consider the number 143.  Is it prime, or does it have factors?  Well, its not obvious.  
The basic approach to finding any factor, or proving that a number is prime, is to
start at the first prime (the number 2) and see if it is a factor.  By going systematically
up through each prime, we either find a factor or reach a prime that is bigger than the
square root of the number, in which case we know the number is prime.

However, this is sometimes a big job, and we would really like to
show our work in a way that helps us keep track of where we are and also can be quickly
checked over to make sure we haven't made any mistakes.

The way we can do this is with the symbol nu(X,Y), which means &quot;the multi-set of
prime factors of Y, understanding that none of the
numbers up to and including X evenly divide Y&quot;.  I'm thus using the &quot;not divisible up to&quot; function nu
both to help remember what has already been checked, but I've defined it so that my equation remains technically
true at all times.  The reason we want this symbol is that we
know that is how you prove something is prime---you prove nu(sqrt(Y),Y), and then you know
Y is prime.  For example, if you know nu(13, 123), you know 123 is prime since 13*13 &gt; 123.
We can introduce nu(2,X) with the reason { X is not even}.  If we know nu(2,X), then we
can introduce nu(3,X) with the reason { sum of X's digits not divisible by 3 }.

So let's try this:

    pf(143)
 = { 143 is not even }
    (nu(2,143))
 = { 1+4+3 not divisible by 3 }
    (nu(3,143))
 = { 143 doesn't end in 5 }
    (nu(5,143))
 = { 143 / 7 = 20 and 3 / 7 }
    (nu(7,143))
 = { 143 / 11 = 13!!}
    (11,pf(13))
 = { 13 is prime }
    (11,13)

So that is our answer.  Now in this case, we had to use a reason that we derived by division: 143/ 7 is not a whole number, but 20 and 3/ 7s.
And, we were surprised to learn that 11 evenly divides 143.  Let's try an even harder one.  (Note, I am using the divisibility test from the
Dr. Math website: http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.divisibleto50.html rather than doing division for many of these divisibility tests
at noted, but if I had to do it on a test, I would use division, since I don't have those rules memorized.)
    pf(1709)
 = { not even, doesn't sum to 3, doesn't end in 5 }
    (nu(5,1709))
 = { 170+45 = 215, not divisible by 7 (x5 and add rule for 7) }
    (nu(7,1709))
 = { 1709/ 11 leaves 609, 609/ 11 leaves 59 (short division)}
    (nu(11,1709))
 = { 170+ 4*9 = 206, 20+24 = 48 not divisible by 13 (x4 and add rule for 13) }
    (nu(13,1709))
 = { 170-45 = 125, not divisible by 17 (x5 and subtract rule for 17) }
    (nu(17,1709))
 = { 170+18 = 188, not divisible by 19 (x2 and add rule for 19)}
    (nu(19,1709))
 = { 170+63 = 233, not divisible by 23 (x7 and add rule for 23)}
    (nu(23,1709))
 = { 170+27 = 197, 19+21 = 40, not divisible by 29 (x3 and add rule for 29)}
    (nu(29,1709))
 = { 170 - 27 = 143, 14 - 27 = -13, not divisible by 31 (x3 and subtract rule for 31)}
    (nu(31,1709))
 = { 170 - 99 = 71, not divisible by 37 (x11 and subtract rule for 37)}
    (nu(37,1709))
 = { 170 - 36 = 134, 41* 3 = 123 (x4 and subtract rule for 41) }
    (nu(41,1709))
 = { 4*43 = 172, 3 * 43 = 129, 1720+129 = 1849, so by nu rule we are done!}
    (1709)

By systematically working our way up from 2 to the square root of the number, we can always keep track of
where we are.  For example, if we had started with 6 * 1709 = 10254, we would have ended up with:

    pf(10254)
 = { even}
    (2,pf(5127))
 = {5+1+2+7=15 = 3 * 5 }
    (2,3,pf(1709))
 .....
    (2,3,1709)

and then the proof would proceed as it did above, carrying with it the prime factors 2 and 3 the whole time.

It is recommended that children use this method of writing out their work in order to build good habits that will pay off in algebra and other more advanced mathematical calculation, and introduces gently the all-important concept of the proof.

One sometimes sees factor trees suggested as a notation.  Factor trees may be useful for visualizing some things
but are not useful at all if one can't see the factors!

I have already edited this page (a few minutes ago) in order to clarify
two equations given on this page.  The first one concerns the F = ma form
of Newton's Second Law.  This is a standard form which appears in most basic
textbooks, but it is not the general mathematical form of the Law, because
it assumes that the mass is constant.  Consequently, I have added some comments
to clarify this.

The second clarification concerns the form of the Second Law in terms of
change of momentum.  In the equation as originally given, the delta p was
divided by time; this should actually be &quot;change in time&quot; or &quot;elapsed time&quot;.
Consequently, I modified the equation to reflect this.  I also clarified
the comment about the &quot;equality&quot; of these two forms of Newton's Second
Law and the statement concerning acceleration being the rate of change
of velocity.

The basic reasons for these edits is that the originals were fundamentally
in error, and needed to be corrected.  I hope the changes make the subject
clearer for the reader, as well as being more correct.

----

: Would it be helpful to give some examples of forces ? Maybe even define the term &quot;force&quot; ? In particular, I want to avoid giving the false impression that the definition of force is &quot;mass times acceleration&quot;. For example, I can push on the bumper of my car with quite a few Newtons of force. But if the parking brake on my car is set, it's not going to move ( a = 0 m/s^2 ). If I just blindly plug numbers into the f=ma equation, I get roughly (20 Newtons) = (1 000 kg)*( 0 m/s^2), which is nonsense. (perhaps we should emphasize that ''the f=ma formula is the definition of *mass*'').

''It's true that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is really the exact formula. This is approximately equal to F=ma only at speads much less than the speed of light.''


----

Some examples would really clarify the formula f = ma!

----

The statement about Einstein should be removed. He can hardly have had anything bad to say about the third law, which just expresses that  momentum  is conserved. As for the first and second, they're still fine of you adapt the definition of momentum to p = (gamma) m v.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no smoke without fire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::&amp;mdash;old proverb

You will need to know about at least two 'modes' before skipping to propositional calculus.

==modus ponens==

First premise: If you drive too fast, you will have an accident.&lt;br&gt;
Second premise: You drive too fast.&lt;br&gt;
___________________________________________&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion: you will have an accident.


Well, that was pretty obvious.  Here is another example:

smoke implies fire&lt;br&gt;
smoke&lt;br&gt;
__________________&lt;br&gt;

fire


Generally: 'From the premises &quot;p implies q&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, we can infer &quot;q&quot;.'

==modus tollens==

Sometimes we want to reason backwards:

First premise: If you drive too fast, you will have an accident.&lt;br&gt;
Second premise: You will not have an accident.&lt;br&gt;
________________________________________________________________&lt;br&gt;
Conclusion: You do not drive too fast.

The second premise is in the future tense.  Only a clairvoyant would assert such a thing in real life.
The argument is valid, though it is not possible to know in advance the truth of the second premise.

Here is another example:

smoke implies fire&lt;br&gt;
no fire&lt;br&gt;
__________________&lt;br&gt;
no smoke

Generally: 'From the premises &quot;p implies q&quot; and &quot;not q&quot;, we can infer &quot;not p&quot;.

==some bad reasoning==

smoke implies fire&lt;br&gt;
no smoke&lt;br&gt;
__________________&lt;br&gt;
no fire

Someone who reasons like this could end up being burned alive in an accident involving smokeless fuel.  Whereas modus ponens and modus tollens are examples of ''deduction'', our last example is an example of ''abduction''.  It works some of the time, it can suggest what ''might'' be the case, but it is unreliable.
This ''logical fallacy'' is known as ''denying the antecedent''.

We used to have a safety officer who would come from head office and say 'if it is tidy, it is safe'. He concluded things were safe if they were tidy. This did not impress the computer programmers in the department since to be a programmer you need to have a bit of sensitivity to logic.  To conclude things were safe if they were tidy, he would have more correctly said 'if it is untidy, it is unsafe', or 'if it is safe, it is tidy'.

The Wikipedia has a long list of different kinds of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Logical_fallacies logical fallacy].  I suggest you have a look at it, and read some of the entries.  Not only will you find it amusing, it could stop you from being duped by bad arguments.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John#Authorship_and_date Wikipedia Article]

''John:  The last Gospel'' - Introduction:

''John'' is the fourth and last Gospel in the New Testament. This Gospel contains many distinctive accounts that are not found in the other Gospels. Only about 10% of the Johannine Gospel is shared with the Synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. The differences of note include:
* The emphasis on the Person of Jesus as the Messiah and God's Revelation of Jesus as &quot;Light of the World&quot;
* The generality of the Gospel, which is not addressed to a specific audience
* Repetitive use of distinctive words not found in the other Gospels (light, life, love)
* Several events and discourses in the life of Jesus not found elsewhere. 

Some may argue that this gospel contains many of the principles that would become instrumental in later missionary developments. The fact that most of the book is centered around Jesus' work on earth would also lead many to this distinction about the book.
  
The similar relationships between the Fourth Gospel and the Synoptics are the accounts of the passion story, basic structural similarity with order of Jesus' ministry, and similar pattern of dialogues/metaphors (Dodd, 1953).  On the other hand in the Fourth Gospel there is no account of several common themes from the Synoptic Gospels:
* Jesus' birth and Baptism and Temptations
* Early years of ministry
* Calling of the Twelve Disciples
* Sermon on the Mount
* The parables about the Kingdom of Heaven
* Teachings on Service, Prayer
* Teachings of the Disciples

In comparison, the Synoptics have no wedding at Cana, no raising of Lazarus, no washing of the feet of the disciples, and no conversation with Nicodemus.

The literary structure of the story of Jesus flows by a public ministry of Jesus, a private teaching of his disciples, a public trial and execution, and a series of private appearances to his disciples.  The author leads the reader through sequences and the reader experiences the story through their emotions.  The use of emotion helps the book create a different kind of connection in the reader. Instead of merely presenting the story of Jesus' life in a vague unevoking manner, the author uses words and phrasing to create emotional attachment.  It is almost as if the book was written with the intention that it would be used to evangelize those who read it, which of course is the purpose of all the Gospels-- To bear witness to the Truth of Scripture and God's purposes toward men.

Although one would perhaps ask why there are such differences, it is clear that John's Gospel is directed toward those who already are familiar with one or more of the Synoptic Gospels. Thus, John does not repeat the Synoptic content but concentrates on the compelling Personage and Purpose of Christ. 

Finally, some individuals might say the purpose of its writings are to evoke faith or convince readers that Jesus is the Messiah.  John 20:31 states, &quot;But these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God: and that believing, you may have life in his name.&quot;  It appears, from this verse, that the purpose of the Fourth Gospel is to evangelize its readers.  However, scholars debate about the translation of the original Greek.  Some say the translation reads, &quot;may continue to believe.&quot;  If this is the case, the Gospel of John was probably written to strengthen Christians in their struggles at the time (see John 20:28).  Robert Kysar, author of &quot;John the Maverick Gospel&quot; believes that the latter purpose mentioned, that the Fourth Gospel was written to sustain Christians' faith, makes sense when the Fourth Gospel, as a whole, is studied.  Kysar points out that the Gospel of John consistently shows  Jesus as both &quot;sent from God and one who has divine status but is still subordinate to the Father&quot; (Kysar 21).  Perhaps this was a response to all the Jewish people who were hesitant about Christianity, charging it with being a religion that supports two gods.  When the historical struggle between Jews, who were afraid of losing the &quot;stability of the synagogue&quot; (Kysar 21), and Christians, who were afraid of not being able to practice what they believed, is taken into account, it makes a great deal more sense to view the Gospel of John as an attempt to strengthen Christians' beliefs so they could defend themselves when their faith was questioned.

The themes in this Gospel are all related to the claims which Jesus made about himself, and the evidence that supports those claims. Here are eight claims which Jesus made about himself:

1) That he can give (and is) living water.
2) That he is the bread of life
3) That he is the light of the world
4) That he is the door of the sheep
5) That he is the good shepherd who gives his life for the sheep
6) That he is the resurrection and the life
7) That he is the way, the truth, and the life
8) That he is the true vine
9) That he and the Father are one.

Notice that &quot;living&quot; or &quot;life&quot; appears repeatedly in these claims. Life is a very prominent theme in John's Gospel, and light is closely related to it. Evidence is presented to convince the reader of the truth of the above and other similar claims. Therefore, faith and believing are also prominent themes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Matrix Chain Multiplication==
===Defining the problem===
Say that you need to multiply a series of n matrices together and form a product P. 

:&lt;math&gt;M_1 M_2 M_3 \cdots M_{n-1} M_n = P&lt;/math&gt;

What is the fastest way we can form this product? Even though matrix-multiplication is not commutative it is associative. I.e.

:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 M_2) M_3 = M_1 (M_2 M_3)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 M_2 \ne M_2 M_1&lt;/math&gt;

This means we can decide in what way to parenthesize a matrix product but we cannot change the order which we multiply them. Since you can only multiply two matrices at a time the product &lt;math&gt;M_1 M_2 M_3 M_4&lt;/math&gt; can be paranthesized in these ways:

:&lt;math&gt;(((M_1 M_2) M_3) M_4)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((M_1 (M_2 M_3)) M_4)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 ((M_2 M_3) M_4))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;((M_1 M_2) (M_3 M_4))&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 (M_2 (M_3 M_4)))&lt;/math&gt;

Two matrixes &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; can be multiplied if the number of coulums in &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; equals the number of rows in &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;. The number of rows in their product will equal the number rows in &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and the number of columns will equal the number of columns in &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt;. I.e if the dimensions of &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;b \times c&lt;/math&gt; their product will have dimensions &lt;math&gt;a \times c&lt;/math&gt;

Two multiply two matrices with eachother we will use a function called MatrixMultiply which takes two matrices and returns their product. We will leave implementation of this function alone for the moment as it is not the focus of this chapter (how to multiply two matrices in the fastest way has been under intensive study for several years and really merits it's own chapter). The time this function takes two multiply two matrices of size &lt;math&gt;a \times b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \times a&lt;/math&gt; is essentially proportional to the number of scalar multiplications which is proportional to &lt;math&gt;a b c&lt;/math&gt;. This means that the paranthezation matters. Say that we have three matrices &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_3&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;5 \times 100&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;100 \times 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_3&lt;/math&gt; has dimensions &lt;math&gt;100 \times 50&lt;/math&gt;. Let's parantezise them in the two possible ways and see which way requires the least amount of multiplications. The two ways are

:&lt;math&gt;((M_1 M_2) M_3)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 (M_2 M_3))&lt;/math&gt;

To form the product in the first way requires 75000 scalar multiplications (5*100*100=50000 to form product &lt;math&gt;(M_1 M_2)&lt;/math&gt; and another 5*100*50=25000 for the last multiplications.) This might seem like alot, but in comparison to the 525000 scalar multiplications required by the second parenthesization (50*100*100=500000 plus 5*50*100=25000) it is miniscule! One understands why such an algorithm is important, imagine what would happen if we needed to multiply 50 matrices!

===Forming a recursive solution===

Note that in this discussion we will concentrate on finding a how many scalar multiplications are needed instead of the actual order. This is because once we have found a working algorithm to find the amount it is trivial to create an algorithm for the actual paranthezation. It will, however, be discussed in the end.

So how would an algorithm for the optimum paranthezation look? By the chapter title you might expect that a dynamic programming method is in order (not to give the answer away or anything). So how would a dynamic programming method work? Since dynamic programming algorithms are based on optimal substructure, what would the optimal substructure in this problem be?

Suppose that the optimal way parenthesize 
:&lt;math&gt;M_1 M_2 \dots M_n&lt;/math&gt;
splits the product at k, i.e
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 M_2 \dots M_k)(M_{k+1} M_{k+2} \dots M_n)&lt;/math&gt;
Then the optimal solution contains the optimal solutions to the two subproblems
:&lt;math&gt;(M_1 \dots M_k)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(M_{k+1} \dots M_n)&lt;/math&gt;
I.e, just in accordance with the fundamental principle of dynamic programming, the solution to the problem depends on the solution of smaller sub-problems.

Let's say that it takes &lt;math&gt;c(n)&lt;/math&gt; number of scalar multiplications to multiply matrices &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; is number of scalar multiplications to be performed in an optimal paranthesation of the matrices &lt;math&gt;M_m \dots M_n&lt;/math&gt;. The definition or &lt;math&gt;f(m,n)&lt;/math&gt; is the first step towards a solution.

When &lt;math&gt;m-n=1&lt;/math&gt;, the formulation is trivial, it is just &lt;math&gt;c(n)&lt;/math&gt;. But what is it when the distance is larger? Using the observation above we can derive a formulation. Suppose an optimal solution to the problem divides the matrices at matrices k and k+1 (i.e &lt;math&gt;(M_m \dots M_k)(M_{k+1} \dots M_n)&lt;/math&gt;) then the number of scalar multiplications are.

:&lt;math&gt;f(m,k) + f(k+1,n) + c(k)&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the amount of time to form the first product, the amount of time it takes to form the second product and the amount of time it takes to multiply them together. But what is this optimal value k? The answer is, ofcourse, the value that makes the above formula assume the minimum value. We can thus form the complete definition for the function:

:&lt;math&gt;f(m,n) = \begin{cases} \min_{m &lt; k &lt; n}f(m,k) + f(k+1,n) + c(k) &amp; \mbox{if } n-m&gt;1 \\ c(m) &amp; \mbox{if }n-m=1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

A straight-forward recursive solution to this would look something like this ''(the language is  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikicode Wikicode])'':

 '''function''' f(m, n) {
     '''if''' m-n = 1
         '''return''' c(m)
 
     minCost = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
 
     '''for''' k '''from''' m + 1 '''to''' n - 1 {
         v = f(m, k) + f(k + 1, n) + c(k)
         '''if''' v &lt; minCost
             minCost = v
     }
 }

This rather simple solution is, unfortunatly, not a very good one. It spends mountains of time recomputing data and its running time is exponential. 

[TODO: write an analysis of the straight-forward-recursion method]

===Using Memoization===

It is straightforward to convert the recursive solution into one that uses memoization. You just have to modify the code so that results are stored so no values need to be recomputed. 

 '''int'''[,] x;
 
 '''function''' f(m, n) {
     '''if''' x[m][n] != null
         '''return''' x[m][n]
     
     '''if''' m == n
         x[m][n] = 0
         return 0
 
     '''if''' m-n = 1 {
         x[m][n] = c(m)
         '''return''' c(m)
     }
 
     minCost = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
 
     '''for''' k '''from''' m '''to''' n - 1 {
         v = f(m, k) + f(k + 1, n) + c(k)
         '''if''' v &lt; minCost
             minCost = v
     }
 
     x[m][n] = minCost;
 
     '''return''' minCost
 }

As you can see, there is very little modification needed to the original code. This is a huge optimization, down to a polynomial-time algorithm.

''[What is the exact runtime? My qualified guess would be O(n^2*log n) but i haven't analyzed it properly.]''

===Using Dynamic Programming===

So how do we make it into a full-fledged bottom-up dynamic progragramming algorithm? To illustrate that point, lets use an example. Suppose we have 6 matrices with the following dimensions:

:&lt;math&gt;M_1 : 6 \times 15&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2 : 15 \times 8&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_3 : 8 \times 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_4 : 1 \times 17&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_5 : 17 \times 7&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_6 : 7 \times 15&lt;/math&gt;

This will make the cost-function c(n) assume the following values:

:&lt;math&gt;c(n) = \begin{cases} 
720 &amp; n=1 \\
120 &amp; n=2 \\
136 &amp; n=3 \\
119 &amp; n=4 \\
1785 &amp; n=5 \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix which will hold the optimum values (called x in the memozation example) can be seen like this:

[[Image:Matrix-chain-1.png]]

This is only half of the entire array, but since the values m&gt;n are never used it would be redundant to display them. The reason that it is tilted to the side is that it conveinently shows the how the process &quot;builds&quot; the result up from the bottom. So, what can we do to this matrix. If we look at the definition of f(m, n) it says that for all the values which m=n the value in the array is zero. Let's fill in those values:

[[Image:Matrix-chain-2.png]]

Allright! Let's boldly continue. The row just above the one we filled in contains all the values with adjacent indexes (i.e 1,2 2,3 3,4 4,5 and 5,6). Those values are just the values of the cost-function, so let's fill in those too.

[[Image:Matrix-chain-3.png]]

Now we continue to next row and just use the definition to fill in the blanks. What, for instance should be in 1,3? Just use the definition:</text>

Writing notes to yourself, within your code, is the only way to keep track of a large file. Coming back to an uncommented 300-line page of code can be a nightmare.

To insert a single line comment within php code type // before the line. To insert a multi-line comment within code start the comment with /* and end it with */. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php

$example = 1

//this is a comment that will be ignored. But will help me remember what the code means.

if (!randomfunction($_POST[dart])){function(example); $example ++;}


/*This is a long

==Basic Templating==

The simplest use of templates in PHP is very powerful for reducing errors and time spent on your pages. First, make sure your server has PHP enabled, etc., etc.

When you're ready to start, make one page that will be the template for all your pages. For example:

 This is a title at the top of my page
 
 This is the body of my page
 
 This is a copyright notice

Now, say you want 2 more pages with the same header and footer. You don't have to code it again. You can save the header as one template and the footer as another. Just take all the header html up to the part where your body text begins:

 &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&amp;lt;p&gt;This is a title at the top of my page&amp;lt;/p&gt;

Now save this as a separate file. I like to use the extension .inc
(do the same with the footer)

 &amp;lt;p&gt;This is the bottom of my page&amp;lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

Now, in your main page, just type:

 &lt;?php require('header.inc'); ?&gt;
 &amp;lt;p&gt;this is the body of my page&amp;lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;?php require('footer.inc'); ?&gt;

And that's your page. Save it as a .php, upload it, and check it.

==Notes==

You can also use the '''include()''' or '''include_once()''' functions, if the page should continue loading, even if the file(s) can not be included.

The '''require()''', '''include()''' and '''include_once()''' functions will work with other file types, and can be used anywhere on a page. 

Advanced: Try using this with an if statement for DYNAMIC templating... ooh...

==Managed Templating==
Managed Templating allows you to create and use PHP Templates with a Template Engine. The PHP Developer/Designer doesn't have to create the engine for it to be used. The most reliable PHP Templating Engine is Smarty ( [[http://smarty.php.net]] ).
Managed Template Systems are easy to use and are mostly used in big websites because of the need for dynamic paging. MediaWiki is one example of a Managed Template System.
Managed Templating is easy to use for new and advanced users, for example:

* index.php
 // This script is based on Smarty
 require_once(&quot;libs/Smarty.inc.php&quot;);
 // Compiled File Directory
 $smarty-&gt;compile_dir = &quot;compiled&quot;;
 // Template Directory
 $smarty-&gt;template_dir = &quot;templates&quot;;
 // Assign a Variable
 $smarty-&gt;assign(&quot;variable&quot;,&quot;value&quot;);
 // Display The Parsed Template
 $smarty-&gt;display(&quot;template.tpl&quot;);

* template.tpl
 The Value of Variable is : &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;{$variable}&lt;/span&gt;
* Output
 The Value of Variable is : &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;

==Roll Your Own==
Template engines work great, however if you are just looking for the basic Search and Replace template functionality, writing your own script is a snap.

* Simple template function
&lt;pre&gt;
function Template($file, $array) {
	if (file_exists($file)) {
		$output = file_get_contents($file);
		foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $val) {
			$replace = '{'.$key.'}';
			$output = str_replace($replace, $val, $output);
		}
		return $output;
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Using the function
&lt;pre&gt;
$fruit = 'Watermelon';
$color = 'Gray';

//parse and return template
$Template_Tpl = Template('template.tpl',
	array
	(
		'fruit'	=&gt; $fruit,
		'color'	=&gt; $color
	));

//display template
echo $Template_Tpl;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* template.tpl, Template used for the above function
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Your Favorite Food Is: {fruit}&lt;/b&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Your Favorite Color Is: {color}&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Parsed template output
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Your Favorite Food Is: Watermelon&lt;/b&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Your Favorite Color Is: Gray&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Image:USDA petit pan squash.jpg|right|thumb|Petit pan squash (patty pan)]]
[[Image:USDA_summer_squash.jpg|right|thumb|Summer squash (cousa-type and yellow straightneck)]]
'''Squash''' is a yellow [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]]. (botanically, the fruit of any of four species in the genus ''[[w:Cucurbita|Cucurbita]]'') Squash is related to [[Cookbook:Cucumber|cucumbers]] and most [[Cookbook:Melon|melons]].

There are two general types of squash, summer and winter. Summer squash are eaten unripe, when they have thin edible skins and small soft seeds. Long ago, such squash were only available in summer. They do not keep well. Winter squash are eaten when fully ripe, when the seeds and skin have become hard. Long ago, such squash were valued for their ability to keep during winter. They are generally harvested in [[Wikipedia:Autumn|fall]].

==Summer Squash==
Summer squash includes those varieties which are harvested while still immature and when the entire squash is tender and edible. They include the yellow crookneck, the large straightneck, the greenish-white patty pan (petit pan), and the slender green zucchini. The EPA would also include crookneck squash, scallop squash, spaghetti squash, Chinese okra, bitter melon, balsam pear, balsam apple, Chinese cucumber, and chayote. Some of these squash are available at all times of the year.

Look for squash that are tender and well developed, firm, and fresh-appearing. A tender squash has skin is glossy instead of dull, and it is neither hard nor tough. Avoid stale or overmature squash, which will have a dull appearance and a hard, tough surface. Such squash usually have enlarged seeds and dry, stringy flesh. Also avoid squash with discolored or pitted areas.

Among substances present in summer squash are two phytochemicals, coumarins and flavonoids. The skin and rind of summer squash are rich in the nutrient beta-carotene, but the fleshy portion of this vegetable is not. To gain the full nutritional benefits of this vegetable, the skins or rinds must be eaten.

==Winter Squash==
Winter squash are those varieties which are marketed only when fully mature. Some of the most important varieties are the small corrugated acorn squash (available all year-round), butternut squash, buttercup squash, green and blue hubbard squash, green and gold delicious squash, and banana squash. Winter squash is most plentiful from early fall until late winter.

Look for full maturity, indicated by a hard, tough rind. Also look for squash that is heavy for its size (meaning a thick wall and more edible flesh). Slight variations in skin color do not affect flavor. Avoid squash with cuts, punctures, sunken spots, or moldy spots on the rind. These are indications of decay. A tender rind indicates immaturity, which is a sign of poor eating quality in winter squash varieties.

To cook a decent-sized winter squash in the traditional way, first slice it in half from stem end to blossom end. If the squash is very large, cut it a few more times. Place the pieces into a baking dish. Cover the dish with foil to keep the squash from getting dry. Cook the squash for a fairly long time, not at a very high temperature, so that it gets soft all the way to the inside. The squash is done when you can easily shove a spoon into it. Serve the squash as it is. Add [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], and [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]] at the table.

==Types of squash==
* [[Cookbook:Acorn Squash|acorn squash]]
* [[Cookbook:Butternut Squash|butternut squash]] (butternut pumpkin)
* [[Cookbook:Chayote|chayote]]
* [[Cookbook:Gem Squash|gem squash]]
* [[Cookbook:Marrow|marrow]] (a UK-specific subset of squash)
* [[Cookbook:Pumpkin|pumpkin]]
* [[Cookbook:Spaghetti Squash|spaghetti squash]]
* [[Cookbook:Zucchini|zucchini]] (courgette)

[[Image:Large Cayenne.jpg|right|thumb|Cayenne Chili Pepper.]]
Cayenne pepper is a very hot red powder used to flavor dishes. The powder comes from the dried fruit of various extra-hot [[Cookbook:Chilli Pepper|&lt;i&gt;Capsicum&lt;/i&gt;]] pepper plants, especially &lt;i&gt;C. frutescens&lt;/i&gt;. The name is derived from the Tupi word kyinha, literally &quot;hot pepper.&quot;

It is used in cooking various spicy hot dishes. Cayenne is generally rated at 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville Units.

Cayenne pepper is an essential ingredient in [[Cookbook:Cajun cuisine|Cajun cuisine]].</text>

'''Powdered sugar''' is a type of highly refined, finely powdered [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]].
It is also known as '''confectioners' sugar''' and '''icing sugar'''.

In North America, powdered sugar usually contains about 5% [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] to prevent clumping.
This can have a thickening effect in recipes that are heated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is a copula? ==

In English, the verb 'to be' serves two purposes: It acts as the copula, and it acts as the verb for existence. However, in many languages, including Japanese, these two verbs are separate—so it helps to have an understanding of the difference between the two usages.

A copula can be thought of as an equals sign: it equates two things to each other. In the sentence &quot;That is a dog,&quot; 'is' is the copula. In the sentence &quot;The dog is inside,&quot; you don't mean that 'the dog' and 'inside' are the same thing; you mean that the dog exists inside.

These two usages have different verbs in Japanese, so it'd be good to get used to it now. Here are some examples:

Using 'to be' as a copula:
* That man is the president.
* Joe is a salesman.
* The dog is a golden retriever.
* This paper is my report.

Using 'to be' to mean existence:
* Sara is outside.
* The plate is on the table.
* The watch is on my wrist
* They are at the mall.
* There is John.

=== Origin of copula ===
; で ある, or だ
: to be (am, is, are) 
: The verb だ is a contraction of the で ある, which can replace the full form in any sentence, except in front of sentence-ending particle か, as will be noted later. The full form is very rarely used nowadays. The ある verb itself means &quot;to be, to have, to exist“, and prepending it with で makes it a special verb - copula. Note also that Japanese である is not being used as wide as its English counterpart: である may only be used to describe attribute, not action (i.e., it cannot be used in constructions like &quot;I am doing something&quot; as a translation of &quot;am&quot;).

== The Japanese Copula ==

In Japanese, です (desu) is the copula. It is used to equate two things. Let's look into translating the sentence, &quot;That is a pen,&quot; into Japanese.

Japanese uses subject-object-verb word order. This means that the copula and all other verbs come ''last'' in the sentence, after the object. If we were to form the English sentence in this way, it'd go like this: &quot;That a pen is.&quot; This is a little unclear without some separation between the subject and the object. This brings us to particles.

Particles are small words which are simply used to denote what role a word plays in a sentence. There are quite a few particles, but we'll only concern ourselves with one of them for now—the topic marker, は (wa)*. This particle marks the topic and subject of the sentence. Incorporating this into our example, our sentence would become: &quot;That は a pen is.&quot;

Finally, in order to complete the conversion to japanese, we just need to translate the words themselves. 'Is', as I mentioned above, becomes です (desu). We can use それ (sore) and ペン (pen) for 'that' and 'pen', respectively. Now, our sentence is &quot;それはペンです。&quot; (sore wa pen desu.), which is a complete, understandable Japanese sentence.


&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; The topic-marker, は, is prounounced 'wa' even though it is written with the kana for 'ha'.

== Existence ==

The other usage of the verb 'to be' is for existence. This gets slightly more difficult, as there are two verbs for existence: いる (iru) and ある (aru). Don't worry, though, it's pretty easy to differentiate between the two. いる (iru) is only used for animate objects, whereas ある (aru) is only used for inanimate objects. For example, you'd use いる (iru) for yourself, another person, or an animal, whereas you'd use ある (aru) for practically anything else, such as a pen, some paper, or a book.

In order to say, &quot;I exist,&quot; or, &quot;I am,&quot; (a sentence which will come in much more handy later) you'll follow a formula similar to what you did for the copula above. The verb always comes last, and the subject is marked with the topic marker, は (wa). わたし (watashi) is the pronoun for 'I', so the sentence, &quot;I am,&quot; becomes &quot;わたしはいる。&quot; (watashi wa iru.).

You can use this exact form to say &quot;the pen exists&quot;, but keep in mind that the pen is inanimate, so you must use ある (aru). The sentence becomes &quot;ペンはある。&quot; (pen wa aru.).

== Thoughts ==
I realized after I started on the topic of Existence that this page was getting a little loaded.  So, it'd be fine with me to separate this up if ya want.

It's 2:30 am, so I don't really think my prose is up to snuff, but it should be decent.  I'll look into cleaning it up a bit when I'm more awake.  I just really wanted to get something up tonight, for some reason.

Anyway, the two things I debated with myself about for a bit:
# Whether to use は, or が.  Doesn't really matter to me, I was taught は first, and it seems to  be used with basic sentences more often.
# Plain versus Polite forms of verbs.  Now that I think back on it, it probably would've been better to use the polite forms, as it'd be better to teach them to conjugate those first, just cause it's easier.  But, truthfully, it doesn't really matter on this page, so if someone feels like going through and editing them all to います, and あります, then feel free.

--[[User:Xepo|Xepo]] 06:32, 29 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:Personally, I think it'll be better to be consistant; you used です so you might as well stay polite. --[[User:151.203.51.100|151.203.51.100]] 17:45, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

== Necessity of the だ copula ==

Compare these two sentences in the text:
: 1) これ は ほん だ (uses the だ copula)
: 2) きみ は つよい (doesn't use the copula)
My guess is that if you want to write &quot;/noun/ is /adjective/&quot; (example &quot;you are strong&quot;), either
: 1) the だ copula is optional (which is ommited in the example), or
: 2) the だ copula cannot be used

I think this should be explained and some accompanying samples should be added to the は section. My creations:
: かのじょ は きれい (she is beautiful)
: あの ぼうし は しろい (that hat is white)
I just learned these stuffs so if the examples are wrong please write out :).
[[User:Agro1986|Agro1986]] 11:05, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

: There are two classes of adjectives. Unfortunately, there is no agreement about what to call these word classes in English.
:: ''i''-adjectives (also called attributive verbs, etc). Notice the final ''i'', which we will later learn conjugates. The copula だ ''cannot'' follow i-adjectives, although we will see that the polite form です can be used to indicate politeness.
:::つよい
:::しろい
:: ''na''-adjectives (also called noun adjectives, attributive nouns, etc.) Like nouns, these words generally ''require'' some form of the copula, although there are rules for omitting だ in informal speech. (''na'' comes from the use of な when these words are used in front of a noun,)
:::きれい　(the ''i'' here is part of the long ''ei'' and does not conjugate)
:::げんき
: Your example above for きれい is missing the copula.
:: かのじょ は きれいだ。 (She is beautiful.)
:It would be best to avoid using かのじょ in examples since pronouns are usually omitted/avoided.
: In summary, Japanese has these basic sentence structures.
:: [noun/ ''na''-adjective] だ。
:: [''i''-adjective]
:: [verb]
: These are all complete sentences. Note that だ may change form.

==である==
There's another verb I've seen that acts as a copula, that one being である. Unless I'm mistaken, だ/です is actually a contraction of である. And there's also でございます. Should these be mentioned? --[[User:151.203.51.100|151.203.51.100]] 17:45, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

'''Someone, please fix this page'''

== Dynamic allocation ==

In Objective-C (unlike in C++), all objects are created dynamically. This means that they continue to exist until they are explicitly destroyed.

To create an object, send its class an &lt;tt&gt;alloc&lt;/tt&gt; message: &lt;tt&gt;[aClass alloc];&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that this returns a new instance of the class but does not initialize its data. Typically you want to immediately send the new object an &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt; message to remedy this. Allocation and initialization are usually combined in one line:

&lt;tt&gt;aClass *newobj = [[aClass alloc] init];&lt;/tt&gt;

There is a class method called &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt; which allocates and provides a bare-bones initialization of the object, but has been deprecated in favor of &lt;tt&gt;alloc&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;init&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Reference counts ==

In C++, every dynamically created object needs to be explicitly deleted (using the &lt;tt&gt;delete&lt;/tt&gt; operator). In Java, every dynamically created object (that is, every object) will be automatically deleted when the garbage collector detects that the object is no longer referenced. In Objective-C neither of these approaches is used.

An Objective-C object keeps a &lt;em&gt;reference count&lt;/em&gt;. When an object is created, its reference count is initialized to 1. When the reference count reaches zero, the object will self-destruct.

=== Release ===

To tell an object that you will no longer use it, send it a &lt;tt&gt;release&lt;/tt&gt; message: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;[anObject release];&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. This decrements the object's reference count by one. If you were the last user of the object, the object will destroy itself.

After sending &lt;tt&gt;release&lt;/tt&gt; to an object &lt;em&gt;it is not safe to use that object anymore&lt;/em&gt; since the object may have self-destroyed.

=== Retain ===

When you want to retain an object, i.e. prevent it from disappearing, send it a &lt;tt&gt;retain&lt;/tt&gt; message: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;[anObject retain];&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. Note that you should not send a retain message to an object you have created with an &lt;tt&gt;alloc&lt;/tt&gt; message, because &lt;tt&gt;alloc&lt;/tt&gt; always implies &lt;tt&gt;retain&lt;/tt&gt;. Therefore, &lt;tt&gt;retain&lt;/tt&gt; is only needed, if you need to use an object that is created elsewhere (and will be sent the &lt;tt&gt;release&lt;/tt&gt; message from there when it's not needed in that part of the program anymore).

=== Equilibrium ===

Every &lt;tt&gt;retain&lt;/tt&gt; needs to be matched by one and only one &lt;tt&gt;release&lt;/tt&gt;. Note that the &lt;tt&gt;new&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alloc&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;copy&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;mutableCopy&lt;/tt&gt; methods also implicitly &lt;tt&gt;retain&lt;/tt&gt; the returned object, so those methods also need to be balanced with &lt;tt&gt;release&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Autorelease pool ==

Sometimes an object cannot be released immediately: for example, a function creates an object and wants to return it to the caller. Now, the callee should release the object it has created and won't be using anymore. However, the caller need to get access to the returned object. If the callee would &lt;tt&gt;release&lt;/tt&gt; the created object, the caller would never see the return value. One solution
is to skip releasing the object in the callee and demand that the caller will release it. This is error-prone and breaks the principle of &quot;match every retain with one release&quot;.

In Objective-C/OpenStep runtime, it is possible to send an object an &lt;tt&gt;autorelease&lt;/tt&gt; message. This will cause the object to be added to the current &lt;em&gt;autorelease pool&lt;/em&gt;. Objects in an autorelease pool will be released at some point in the future (when the current autorelease pool is destroyed). They are safe to use prior to that.

If the caller wants to keep the returned object, it must &lt;tt&gt;retain&lt;/tt&gt; it. Otherwise, the object will be automatically released. Example:

   /* In class Environment, responsible of telling details of current environment: */
   - (id) nameOfLang        /* the callee */
   {
       id name = [[NSString alloc] initWithCString: &quot;Objective-C&quot;];
       [name autorelease];
       return name;
   }

   /* In another class where environment info is needed */
   - (void) getName        /* the caller */
   {
       myLangName = [environment nameOfLang];   /* myLangName is an instance variable */
       [myLangName retain];              /* Will be released when this object no longer needs it */
   }
&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">You will have to do a lot of reading, and some writing and some talking and listening.  Then you will have to do some thinking.

==courses and classes==

If you can register for a course, this will give you the opportunity to do all these things.  There may be adult education 'introduction to philosophy' evening courses available.  But you are unlikely to have courses beyond introductory level outside the largest of cities.

You could register as an undergraduate at a university.  Here you could study the course in depth over three or four years.  You will probably also have to pay out quite a lot of money in course fees and living expenses.

'Distance learning' may be available to you, with such institutions as The Open University, based in the United Kingdom, or [[w:Athabasca University|Athabasca University]], based in Canada, or the College of the Humanities &amp; Sciences (http://www.chumsci.edu), based in the United States.

But it may be that none of the above are available or suitable to your needs.  Fortunately, on line resources are beginning to fill the gap, and Wikibooks, Wikipedia, and the Wikiversity are here to help you.  The present work is here to fill this need.

Remember though that much of the world remains off-line.  One hopes that this defect will eventually be remedied.

==reading==

The present work is an introduction to philosophy.  It is here to get you started.  You could try reading Wikipedia articles at random, or in alphabetical order like the autodidact in Sartre's ''Nausea''.  But some of those articles are not for the beginner, and the beginner needs to be guided through the maze.  Rather than duplicating what has already been written in the [http://en.wikipedia.org Wikipedia], we shall provide links.  The Wikipedia is succinct.  If you want a lot of detail, the [http://plato.stanford.edu Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] and the [http://www.iep.utm.edu Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy] may be what you need.  For absolute beginners an excellent book to read is Joestien Gaarder's &quot;Sophie's World&quot;.

You will have to read a lot.  And some passages you will have to read many times slowly and carefully.

==writing==

If you don't write, then at best you end up with a vague feel for the subject you are researching.  If you do write, the people at the philosophy department of the Wikiversity might give you some friendly advice and feedback on what you have written.

:[[the dissertation]]

==talking and listening==

Hopefully, there will be discussion forums at the Wikiversity for this.  Irc should also be useful.

In physical sciences, experiments can be conducted by isolating factors to see what causes lead to what effects.  For instance, if you put baking soda in a test tube full of vinegar, and it starts to bubble, you can be pretty sure that the baking soda caused the bubbling.

In politics, one cannot conduct an experiment in a test tube.  The only way that one can make scientific study of politics is by examining it in daily life and comparing it with other situations.  Through observation and comparison, one can hopefully learn enough about politics to make reliable predictions.  That is the goal of comparative politics:  observe two or more political situations, analyse their similarities and differences, and try to isolate causes and effects in order to make reliable predictions.  

This wikiversity course will first start out by comparing basic theoretical concepts in politics.  Then, it will compare political situations of different states with different political systems.

In order to speak scientifically about politics, it is useful to know the terminology that political scientists use.

'''State''':  in political science, &quot;state&quot; means what most people think of when they say &quot;independent country&quot;: i.e., France, Italy, Russia, etc.  The definition of &quot;state&quot; includes a ''people'' permanently living in a ''territory'' (not nomads, e.g.), over which a ''government'' exercises ''sovereignty''. Thus, the constitutive elements of a state are a people, a territory, a government and sovereignty (some authors don't distinguish between government and sovereignty, so perhaps it would be best to speak of &quot;a government exercising sovereign authority&quot;).  Some ''federations'' refer to their constituent parts as &quot;states&quot;, in order to emphasize their relative importance and independence (e.g., the United States of America, the Federated States of Micronesia).  Political scientists tend to use the term &quot;state&quot; to emphasize the governmental aspect of the country:  government officials are called &quot;state officials&quot;; a government minister may have the title of &quot;secretary of state&quot;, etc.

'''Sovereignty''': full powers over a given territory.  Kings and queens were once called &quot;sovereigns&quot; because they had full power over their subjects and lands.  Political scientists do not talk of persons having sovereignty, but states. There are two kinds of sovereignty; internal sovereignty generally recognized as being a monopoly on the use of force and external sovereignty which is generally recognized as being control over ones own internationally recognized borders (illegal immigration can be seen as having a negative impact upon a states external sovereignty).

'''Nation''' a group of people sharing a common trait that creates a primary political bond.  This trait is most often linguistic, but can be  religious, racial, cultural, territorial, or a combination.  

'''Nation-State''':  A state that is generally conceived of as the &quot;homeland&quot; of a given nation.  For instance, France is a nation-state of French people.

'''Government''': Each state has a government, a body that wields state power.  

'''Power''':  The ability to convince people to do what they otherwise would not have done. This can be done through a variety of means but typically is accomplished through the following: the use of force (coercion), diplomatic means (bargaining, influence et al.) and Ideological control (setting the agenda so that opposing points of view cannot be heard).

'''Authority''':  The recognized ability to wield power.

'''Sovereign authority''': The recognized ability to use power to exercise state sovereignty.  

'''Legitimacy''':  The recognition that someone ''should'' have authority.  This may or may not imply that the possessor of legitimacy also possesses authority.  For instance, if a country is invaded, that country's former government might be exiled and have no real power, but still be recognized by other states as the &quot;legitimate authority&quot; of the country that they were exiled from.

'''System''': A way of organizing as well as interpreting.

== Federal, unitary, and confederate states ==

There are in general three types of states: ''federal'', ''unitary'', and ''confederate'' states.  A unitary state is where only one government has sovereign power.  That central government can create other bodies to exercise its power, but the central government can also eliminate them.  The typical example of a unitary state is France, which has a central government located in Paris.

A federal state is where sovereignty is shared between relatively sovereign state governments, and an &quot;umbrella&quot; government of very limited, clearly defined power.  Neither state nor federal governments have the power to interfere with the other's powers.  The United States of America had been an excellent example of a federal state, with a federal government located in Washington, D.C. - which was a non-state, neutral and federal territory.  Some consider &quot;The War Between the States,&quot; which eliminated the right of secession, the end of the federal era.  But elements of federal government lingered until at least 1913, when the states' voice in federal government, a state-appointed senate, was lost under the 17th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  

A confederate state is where sovereignty is given mostly to the regional governments, with minimal power given to the central government.  Two good examples of this form of government include the original United States government under the Articles of '''Confederation''', as well as the Confederate States of America, which believed in states' rights.  In current times the best example of confederal government is the European Union.

== Democratic Systems versus Authoritarian Systems ==

Political scientists have identified two basic types of government system: Democracies and Authoritarian Systems.  At its base, a democracy is where the heads of government in a state's are chosen by a vote of the citizens of the state; their votes must be made without coercion and after voters have had the opportunity to hear the candidates. Robert Dahl, a leading scholar on democracy, has provided a framework for when a country is a democracy; these five criteria include: 

''Effective participation'' meaning that the people should have an adequate and equal opportunity to have their voices heard in the decision making process, ''voting equality' meaning that all votes should count equally (for instance, Bill Gates's vote is no more important than yours or mine), ''enlightened understanding'' which means that the people should have adequate and equal access to information so that they can make the best possible decision, ''control of the agenda'' meaning only the people should be able to decide what decisions are debated and voted upon and, finally, the system must be ''inclusive'' meaning that all adults in the society, unless incapable, should be authorized to participate in the political process and not precluded therefrom. (Adopted from Dahl, Democracy and Its Critics pg 108-118 and 129-131)

Authoritarian systems are the antithesis of democracy. As opposed to the democratic principles of rule by the people, authoritarian systems are lead by either an individual or a small group of individuals. There are dozens of authoritarian systems, but all share the general characteristic of exclusiveness, which means keeping the vast majority of people out of policy and decision-making processes. Often a government will display multiple forms of authoritarian rule, a short list of these different forms is as follows:

Kleptocracy: A government lead by a leader whose sole objective is to use the state to enrich himself (ex. Saddam Hussein)

Totalitarianism: An authoritarian government where the leader(s) has an all pervasive presence, usually established through secret police agencies, mass repression and surveillance. Another element of totalitarianism is the lack of independent civil society organizations; those that may exist are extensions of the state. Examples of totalitarianism include the USSR (esp. under Stalin), Nazi Germany and North Korea. 

Military Junta: A government ran entirely by a group of military officers, this system was common found in South and Central America and can include elements of both totalitarianism and kleptocracy. Myanmar (Burma) is run by a military junta.

Monarchy: The &quot;classical&quot; western authoritarian regime, composed of a single leader whose legitimacy is often religious or tribal. The main difference between this and other authoritarian regimes is the concept of hereditary rule.

Under speculation are ''anarchic'' and ''libertarian'' systems of government, which are below democracies in terms of government power, with some having no government at all. However, due to lack of real world examples (anarchic Somalia an obvious exception) these are usually discounted.

== Presidential Systems, Parliamentary Systems, and Mixed Systems ==

As we have seen, democratic systems have elected officials.  Most democratic states have many elected officials, who share power in predetermined ways.  The two most popular models for sharing power amongst elected officials is the Presidential System and the Parliamentary System.

The Parliamentary System is the most popular model.  In this system, a body of many representatives is elected by voters.  This body might be called a '''House of Commons''', a '''national assembly''', a ''legislative assembly''', a '''lower house''', or any number of other names (for this discussion, we shall refer to it as a Legislature). Each member of the Legislature has one equal vote.  The Legislature has the power to pass legislation, which has the force of law.  To become law, the proposed law must receive the approval of the majority of the Legislature.

Usually at its first meeting after an election of new members, the Legislature chooses from amongst its membership an '''Executive body''', i.e., the officials in charge of making sure that legislation is enforced.  This body is usually called a '''cabinet''', but is sometimes called a Council of Ministers.  Each member of the cabinet usually has a specific portfolio, over which he/she is responsible: finances, foreign policy, defence, agriculture, transport, etc.  The chairman of the cabinet is the most powerful person in a Parliamentary system, and is usually given the title of '''Prime Minister''' (aka., &quot;chancellor&quot;, &quot;premier&quot;, or &quot;first minister&quot;).

The Legislature also chooses the &quot;President&quot; of the state, who is usually a ceremonial figurehead for the state (called the ''head of state'').  Sometimes, the President is given the duty of settling deadlocks in the Legislature over the choice of members of the Cabinet.  (Some states maintain a king or queen as their ceremonial head of state.  Such states are called &quot;constitutional monarchies&quot;, while systems with presidents are called &quot;republics&quot;.  There is little difference between these two types of states in practice).

Most members of the Legislature are part of a faction within the body that wishes to pursue a common political agenda.  This is called a '''political party'''.  If one political party constitutes a majority of the members of a Legislature, then that party can dictate who gets chosen for the Cabinet and what legislation gets approval. This is called '''majority government.''' The leader of the majority party automatically becomes Prime Minister, and as long as he/she maintains the confidence of his/her party, he/she can dictate who is in the cabinet and what legislation gets passed.  This makes the Prime Minister a very power official.  The Prime Minister can even decide to dissolve the Legislature and call a new election.  

Parliamentary systems are prevalent in western Europe, as well as the former colonies of Great Britain.

The Presidential system was first developed by the framers of the United States Constitution in the 1780s.  The framers disapproved of the way in which the Prime Minister of Parliamentary systems could accumulate so much power.  They therefore developed a system designed to spread power more evenly over many different elected officials.  This is known as the '''separation of powers'''.

In a typical presidential system, the president is not purely symbolic.  Not only is the President the head of state, but is also in charge of naming the members of the cabinet (called &quot;administration&quot; in the United States).  The President also has some powers specifically mandated by the constitution, particularly in foreign policy and defence.  The president is not chosen by the legislature, but directly elected by the voters.  The President is not allowed to be a member of the legislature.

The legislature (or ''congress'' in the United States), the leader of the majority party does not automatically become the Prime Minister.  In fact, in many presidential systems, the position of Prime Minister does not exist; the President instead chairs the cabinet.  The legislature holds elections at fixed intervals (usually every four years), instead of being dissolved by a Prime Minister.  Because the majority party of the legislature does not control the executive, political parties play a less important role in a Presidential system, and members of the same party may often vote differently in the legislature.

The Presidential system is used in the United States and states strongly influenced by the United States, such as Mexico.

Mixed systems incorporate attributes of the Parliamentary system and Presidential System.  Often, these mixes result in a directly elected President with powers equivalent to a Prime Minister.  For instance, in France, the President is directly elected by the people every five years.  The President of France may dissolve the National Assembly.  If the President has the following of a majority of the National Assembly, then he may appoint the Cabinet; if he does not have the following of the National Assembly, then he may only appoint members of the Cabinet who are responsible for foreign policy and defence.

Mixed systems have proven popular amongst relatively new democracies, such as Russia, the Ukraine, and Iraq, since they give a lot of power to the President.

== Proportional Representation, Single-Member Plurality, and Mixed Representation ==

In a proportional representation system, parties are allotted seats in the legislature based on the percentage of the votes that they receive in the polls. Each voter will select a party instead of an individual candidate, after which parties will be assigned seats according to percentages. In many countries there is a threshold that a party needs to pass before getting a seat (generally between 2 - 5 percent). The seats that would have gone to parties receiving under this threshold are divided up by the parties that passed the threshold. Some countries using proportional representation include Israel, Italy, and Iraq.

In a single-member plurality system, members are elected to the legislature from electoral districts. Only one member can be elected from each district. The member who is elected is the person who receives the most votes in that district, even if he does not receive a majority of the vote. Some countries that use this system are the United States and Britain.

In a mixed representation system, some members are elected from electoral districts after receiving a plurality of the vote, while the rest of the seats in the legislature are assigned according to proportional representation. Voters in these countries generally vote for a candidate and a party. Countries employing mixed systems include Russia and Mexico.

A single-member system favors major parties, and will generally allows for only two or three healthy major parties. In the US, for example, only Democrats or Republicans typically win seats; in Great Britain, only the Labour, Conservative, and Liberal parties win seats. This forces the parties to moderate to gain votes and may make compromise in government easier.

A proportional system allows smaller parties to gain seats. This will result in many views represented in the legislature but may make the government less stable. In addition, it may be difficult to employ in a big country because the votes of the entire nation need to be pooled and then divided. A recount in a close election would therefore be impractical.

== Introduction ==
== Plant Tissues ==

Most plant cells are specialized to a greater or lesser degree, and arranged together in '''tissues'''. A plant tissue can be simple or complex depending upon whether it is composed of one or more than one type of cell. The simplest tissue found in plants is called '''parenchyma'''. The cells are not very specialized, more or less rounded or angular where packed together, and thin-walled. A type of parenchyma called '''chlorenchyma''' because the cells contain chloroplasts forms tissue (usually in the leaves) responsible for most of the photosynthesis occurring in the plant. Note that in simple tissues at least (tissues comprised mostly of one cell type), the tissue name follows from the cell type. However, tissues may also have unique anatomical names related to where in the plant they occur.

=== Meristems ===  

The growth of a plant requires a source of undifferentiated cells located in places where growth is needed and can be initiated to further the body plan (in comparison to animals, plants are rather open in this regard).  Some enlargement in size is always possible by elongation or enlargement of existing cells, or by existing cells simply dividing. But differentiation of one cell type into another is only possible if the initial cell (mother cell) is not very specialized.  Tissues comprised of cells that remain undifferentiated and supply, by their divisions, cells to form new tissues and organs, are called '''meristems'''. Meristem tissue occurs in places that allow for a very orderly pattern of growth.

*vertical angles are congruent
*when parallel lines are cut by a transversal corresponding angles are congruent
*when parallel lines are cut by a transversal alternate interior angles are congruent

I'm a little concerned about the OpenStep (?) influences on the book. For example on this page, it talks about using the &quot;new&quot; class method to create an object, when in Cocoa you'd usually use a method the same as the actual class name. For example, to create an array you'd either use [[NSArray alloc] init] or [NSArray array] (or more often, something like [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfURL:url]).

[NObject new] is rarely used in Cocoa. I'm not sure, but I think they do something slightly different (am I right that the object returned by new isn't autoreleased? [NSArray array] returns an autoreleased object).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Kinetic energy is the energy of motion regardless of the direction. Any object (with mass) in motion has kinetic energy. There are several types of kinetic energy. It should be noted that many times several of these types of kinetic energies occur simultaneously.

== Transitional ==

This is the energy due to motion from one location to another. It is defined by the integral of momentum with respect to velocity:

&lt;math&gt;K = \int \mathbf{p}\,dv = \int m\mathbf{v}\,dv = \frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{v}^2&lt;/math&gt;

== Rotational ==

This is the energy due to rotation around one point (the center). It is defined by the integral of angular momentum (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt;) with respect to angular velocity (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;):

&lt;math&gt;K_r = \int \mathbf{L}\,d\omega = \int I\mathbf{\omega}\,d\omega = \frac{1}{2}I\mathbf{\omega}^2&lt;/math&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position. There are several types of potential energy.

== Gravitational ==

Gravitational potential energy, involves the line integral of the force between two objects (&lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;). By Newton's universal law of gravity, the force is

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_g = -\frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}\;\hat r&lt;/math&gt;

We integrate to get potential energy:

&lt;math&gt;U_g(r) = -\int_\infty^r \mathbf{F}_g\,dr' = \int_\infty^r \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r^2}\,dr = -\frac{Gm_1 m_2}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we have taken the reference point (where the potential energy equals zero) to be at &lt;math&gt;r=\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Sometimes, when dealing with small distances where the difference in acceleration due to gravity will be negligable we simplify the energy equation by assuming that &lt;math&gt;r = R +y&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Earth's radius and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;&lt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the height above the Earth's surface.  Taking &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; to be the mass of the planet: 

&lt;math&gt;F_g = \frac{Gm_1 m_2}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;g = \frac{Gm_2}{R^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the vector &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; points in the &lt;math&gt;-\hat r&lt;/math&gt; direction.  Inserting this into the integral for &lt;math&gt;U_g&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;U_g = -\int_0^y (-m_1g\hat r)dr'= m_1 gy&lt;/math&gt;,

where now, the reference point is on the surface of the Earth.

== Elastic ==

Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in a compressed or elongated object (a spring, for example). The amount of energy stored in the object depends on spring constant (&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;) and the displacement from the rest position (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;). It should be noted that the amount of energy is the same regardless whether the object is compressed or elongated. Given the force:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_s = -k\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;

We integrate to get energy:

&lt;math&gt;U_s = -\int \mathbf{F}_s\,dx = \int -k\mathbf{x}\,dx = \frac{1}{2}k\mathbf{x}^2&lt;/math&gt;

''[[Programming:Objective-C|Objective-C]]'' is the native language of Cocoa applications. It is an object-oriented superset of ANSI C, allowing the developer to include &quot;plain C&quot; statements and code into the program. Any ANSI C program is a valid Objective-C program.

== NSObject ==

The Objective-C used in Cocoa is a bit different from &quot;plain&quot; Objective-C, because of the Cocoa runtime system which defines a new root class, &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;. All Cocoa objects should be descendants of &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; in order to gain from its improved memory management model.

&lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; is defined in the header &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;Foundation/NSObject.h&amp;gt;&lt;code&gt;.

=== The NSObject life cycle ===

To create an &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;, send its class either an
&lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
id anObject = [NSObject new];  // Creates and returns an initialized object

id anotherObj = [NSObject alloc];   // Not yet ready for use...
anotherObj = [anotherObj init];     // ...now it is.

// good style: combine alloc and init:
id oneMoreObj = [[NSObject alloc] init];  // identical to using new
&lt;/source&gt;

Although &quot;&lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;&quot; methods 
appear to be identical, Apple documentation seems to give preference to the latter method.
This gives developers the ability to override &lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; separately to achieve a certain result, if necessary.

Note that initializing an object may sometimes fail: for example a
file containing the initialization data may be unavailable. In that
case, &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; will return &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, it is
always necessary to check the return value of &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; before
using the object!

After an object has been initialized, it is ready for use. To use an object,
send it messages:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
[anObject aMessage];
&lt;/source&gt;

If the object understands the message, it will react to it. Otherwise,
a trap is generated.

When an object is no longer used, it must be ''released''. To release an object, send it a &lt;code&gt;release&lt;/code&gt; message. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
[anObject release];
&lt;/source&gt;

This will lead to the destruction of the object (unless it's still in use somewhere else, see [[../Memory management|Cocoa memory management]] for details).

When an object is about to be destroyed, it will receive a &lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;/code&gt; message. If the object has reserved any resources, it should release them now.

== Extending NSObject ==

All classes in an Cocoa/Objective-C application should be derivatives of &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, when defining a new class you should follow some basic rules:

* Derive from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;:
* Either directly or from a derivative
* Define initializer &amp; deallocator
* Call base class initializer &amp; deallocator

=== Deriving from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; ===

To create your class as a subclass of &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;, define it as follows (in the interface definition file &quot;MyClass.h&quot;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
#import &lt;Foundation/NSObject.h&gt;

@interface MyClass : NSObject
{
@private
  /* instance variable declarations */
  AnotherClass* myMember;
}
/* method declarations */
@end
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Defining initializer and deallocator ===

An ''initializer'' is a method that initializes an object. In Cocoa, the initializer for &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; is called &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; method for &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; does not know about user-defined classes and cannot therefore initialize their instances properly. Thus, it is essential to write an initializer method for your class. If the initialization does not require any parameters, the method to define is called &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; (i.e., you should ''override'' the base class initializer). This makes it possible to create instances of your class by using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; class method derived from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
MyClass* myObj = [[MyClass alloc] init];   // allocate and initialize the object
&lt;/source&gt;

The above code creates a new instance of &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt;.  Since &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; has no methods called &lt;code&gt;alloc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt;, the messages are automatically sent to its base class.  

To override the initializer for your class, optionally define it in the interface file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
/* In MyObject.h, in the method declarations part */
- (id) init;
&lt;/source&gt;

and implement it in the .m file:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
/* In MyObject.m */
@implementation MyObject
- (id) init
{
    /* first initialize the base class */
    self = [super init]; 
    /* then initialize the instance variables */
    myMember = [AnotherClass new];
    /* finally return the object */
    return self;
}
@end
&lt;/source&gt;

If the initialization requires additional parameters, you should define an initializer like &lt;code&gt;initWithParam:&lt;/code&gt;, for example

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (id) initWithMember: (AnotherClass) member
{
    self = [super init];
    myMember = [[AnotherClass alloc] initWithValue: member];
    return self;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Even then, it is often advisable to define a &quot;default&quot; initializer that calls your &lt;code&gt;initWithXXX&lt;/code&gt; method with suitable default parameters:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (id) init
{
    return [self initWithMember: someDefaultValue];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A ''deallocator'' is a method that is responsible to release all resources an object holds. The deallocator is called before an object is released, thus making sure everything gets cleaned up properly. In Cocoa, the deallocator method is &lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;/code&gt;. Every class that holds any resources should define a &lt;code&gt;dealloc&lt;/code&gt; method. For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
- (void) dealloc
{
   [myMember release];
   [super dealloc];
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Calling the base class initializer and deallocator ===

When a class is derived from some other class (as the &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; was derived from &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt;), the instances created from it are not only instances of the derived class, but also instances of the base class. This is called the ''is-a'' relation. A derived class is an extension of the base class: it can do more than the base class, but it can do everything the base class can. Therefore, objects of a derived class always contain everything that objects of the base class contain. If an &lt;code&gt;NSObject&lt;/code&gt; contains a retain count member variable, then also &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; objects will contain it. Thus, the &quot;base class part&quot; of a derived object needs to be initialized and deallocated when initializing and deallocating the derived object.

To initialize the base class part of an object write

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
self = [super init];
&lt;/source&gt;

to the ''very beginning'' of the initializer of your class. To deallocate the base class part of the object write

&lt;source lang=&quot;objc&quot;&gt;
[super dealloc];
&lt;/source&gt;

to the ''very end'' of the deallocator of your class.

== Expectations ==

This textbook will assume that you have no prior knowledge of Chinese, but are willing to take Chinese as a serious subject of study. Each lesson contains a combination of new vocabulary and new grammar in a gradual progression, building on previous lessons. 

Each lesson should be appropriate for a week's worth of daily classes, so don't feel overwhelmed by the amount of material per lesson. Learning to write new characters will probably be your limiting factor, so split up the memorization of a lesson's characters over two or three days and use class time mostly for work on grammar and speaking skills.


== Lesson Sections ==

Each lesson consists of five parts:

#'''Dialogue'''. Here you will see a dialogue carried out by two or more people. All texts are given in 4 versions: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Hanyu Pinyin, and an English translation.
#'''Grammar'''. This section breaks down all of the new sentence structures introduced in the dialogue and shows example sentences to reinforce them.
#'''Vocabulary'''. New vocabulary for the lesson, with translation and pronunciation. Every newly introduced character will be linked to an image or animation showing its stroke order.
#'''Examples'''. A page of sentences and phrases giving more examples based on the lesson material.
#'''Exercises'''. Questions and activities to test comprehension of the material. May be used as homework or as review material for lesson exams.


&lt;div class=&quot;noprint&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- class=&quot;noprint&quot; makes this box disappear when printing --&gt;
== Wikibook Navigation ==

All the lessons and appendices of this Wikibook are arranged as subpages of the Chinese main page (the Table of Contents). Navigating between lessons is done by clicking the appropriate link in the green mini-Table of Contents box found at the top and bottom of every page. To navigate to less-commonly-accessed pages from a subpage, you must first return to the Chinese main page by clicking on &quot;&lt; Chinese&quot; which appears in the top left corner of all subpages.

Additionally, lesson subpages have subpages branching off of them which contain supporting material for the lesson such as examples, exercises, and animations demonstrating the stroke orders of new characters. You'll also find &quot;Traditional&quot; listed as a subpage, which is a toggle button for accessing the traditional version of the page. Click on it, and &quot;Simplified&quot; replaces it, meaning you can easily switch back and forth between the simplified and traditional character versions of this text.

There is a deduction of the Lorentz transformation from the first postulate alone that does not require the speed of light to be observer independant. The calculation gives as a ''result'' the existence of a special constant velocity which is observer independant but leaves the numerical value to be determined by experiment. The result includes the Galileian case as a limit case if the special velocity tneds to infinity.
I think this calculation would be very instructive here but at the moment I can't remember or find the details. [[User:217.230.21.104|217.230.21.104]] 13:57, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</text>

In Python, classes are themselves objects.  Just as other objects are instances of a particular class, classes themselves are instances of a metaclass.

=== Python3 ===

The [http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3115/ Pep 3115] defines the changes to python 3 metaclasses.
In python3 you have a method __prepare__ that is called in the metaclass to create a dictionary or other class to store the class members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3115/&lt;/ref&gt;
Then there is the __new__ method that is called to create new instances of that class. &lt;ref&gt;http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/14/python-metaclasses-by-example/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Class Factories===

The simplest use of Python metaclasses is a class factory.  This concept makes use of the fact that class definitions in Python are first-class objects.  Such a function can create or modify a class definition, using the [[Python Programming/Classes#Defining a Class|same syntax]] one would normally use in declaring a class definition.  Once again, it is useful to use the model of [[Python Programming/Classes#Viewing Class Dictionaries|classes as dictionaries]].  First, let's look at a basic class factory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def StringContainer():
...     # define a class
...     class String:
...         def __init__(self):
...             self.content_string = &quot;&quot;
...         def len(self):
...             return len(self.content_string)
...     # return the class definition
...     return String
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; # create the class definition
... container_class = StringContainer()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # create an instance of the class
... wrapped_string = container_class()
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # take it for a test drive
... wrapped_string.content_string = 'emu emissary'
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped_string.len()
12
&lt;/source&gt;

Of course, just like any other data in Python, class definitions can also be modified.  Any modifications to attributes in a class definition will be seen in any instances of that definition, so long as that instance hasn't overridden the attribute that you're modifying.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def DeAbbreviate(sequence_container):
...     sequence_container.length = sequence_container.len
...     del sequence_container.len
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; DeAbbreviate(container_class)
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped_string.length()
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped_string.len()
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
 AttributeError: String instance has no attribute 'len'
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also delete class definitions, but that will not affect instances of the class.

 &gt;&gt;&gt; del container_class
 &gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped_string2 = container_class()
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in ?
 NameError: name 'container_class' is not defined
 &gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped_string.length()
 12

===The type Metaclass===

The metaclass for all standard Python types is the &quot;type&quot; object.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(object)
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(int)
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(list)
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Just like list, int and object, &quot;type&quot; is itself a normal Python object, and is itself an instance of a class.  In this case, it is in fact an instance of itself.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type)
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

It can be instantiated to create new class objects similarly to the class factory example above by passing the name of the new class, the base classes to inherit from, and a dictionary defining the namespace to use.

For instance, the code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClass(BaseClass):
...     attribute = 42
&lt;/source&gt;

Could also be written as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; MyClass = type(&quot;MyClass&quot;, (BaseClass,), {'attribute' : 42})
&lt;/source&gt;

===Metaclasses===

It is possible to create a class with a different metaclass than type by setting its __metaclass__ attribute when defining.  When this is done, the class, and its subclass will be created using your custom metaclass.  For example

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class CustomMetaclass(type):
    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print &quot;Creating class %s using CustomMetaclass&quot; % name
        super(CustomMetaclass, cls).__init__(name, bases, dct)

class BaseClass(object):
    __metaclass__ = CustomMetaclass

class Subclass1(BaseClass):
    pass
&lt;/source&gt;

This will print

 Creating class BaseClass using CustomMetaclass
 Creating class Subclass1 using CustomMetaclass

By creating a custom metaclass in this way, it is possible to change how the class is constructed.  This allows you to add or remove attributes and methods, register creation of classes and subclasses creation and various other manipulations when the class is created.

===Facts===

====Banks and Money====
Germany's main banks are Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank. There are many banks of all kinds throughout the country. Banks are open Mon-Fri 9am-12pm and 2:30-4pm. On Thursdays, they are open until 5:30 or 6pm. Changing money is best done at a bank because their rates will be better than exchange services located at a Bureau de Change. Major post office branches and travel agents also offer currency exchange. Germany is one of 15 European countries that have replaced their national currencies with the Euro, which is stronger to the U.S. Dollar, but weaker than the British Pound.

Now even though many of these are common phrases you and I would say in everyday life, some of these are rather used when you are on a visit to grandmother's, or things your mother would say. Maybe you notice some of these in the dialogue. Now you might be asking &quot;How am I going to speak fluent German, if I just learn phrases?&quot; Like I said, these are basically from the dialogue, and you can study these to look at the word order. Also certain things are just different in German, like &quot;Wie heißt du?&quot; which translates literally to &quot;How are you called?&quot; when we use  &quot;What is your name?&quot;. Okay let's get started on these common phrases...

'''Du bist ja richtig groß geworden.'''

''You have grown up so much'' (usual sentence used by Opa und Oma)

 
'''Hast du uns etwas mitgebracht?'''

''Have you brought something for us?'' (usual sentence used by Enkel and Enkelin)


'''Nun sei nicht so aufgeregt.'''

''Now don't be so excited.''
 

'''Komm rein.'''

''Come in.''


'''(Sie) Wurden schon ausgepackt.'''

''(They) Have already been opened.''


'''(Sich) Bedanken für etwas.''' 

''To thank for something.''

====Using Formal and Informal Pronouns in the Family====

Some very conservative families might still use '''Sie''' with grandparents or even parents! This is sometimes practiced in families of nobility or exterritorial cultural islands in which older German customs have survived. However, using &quot;Sie&quot; feels very outdated to the vast majority of people. In practically every family all members use '''du''' with each other.

===Describing People===
----

I can't describe in words how important this section of the lesson is. Even though you have already learned to describe to some degree, here we will introduce a new aspect of describing, and we will review. But how could we describe if we didn't have vocabulary? Here it is...

|Evil||böse
|}                                                                                                                                The verb used most often for describing is &quot;''to be''&quot; which we learned in the first lesson. Some examples are: ''He '''is''' wet, This '''is''' stupid, I '''am''' lazy''. But you do use other verbs like feel, look, etc. This lesson we will be sticking mostly with the verbs we've learned in the past. We will, however, learn one new verb. All sentences we will create will be in the nominative case. Okay, let's get started!

In term of beauty, you can say four basic things. These aren't the all but these are the easiest and simplest ones.


'''She is beautiful.'''

''Sie ist schön.''


'''He is ugly.'''

''Er ist hässlich.''


These two use the verb ''to be'', and the next one will use the verb ''to look'' which would need something else in order to make sense.

'''She looks beautiful, but that shirt is ugly.'''

''Sie sieht schön aus, aber dieses Hemd ist hässlich.''


'''He looks ugly, but he looked handsome yesterday.'''

''Er sieht hässlich aus, aber gestern sah er schön aus.''


And in the last sentence it says &quot;ausgesehen.&quot; Don't worry about that--it wouldn't be taught until Level 3. So since you get the idea of describing, let's learn a new verb! And the new verb is
'''klingen''' which is ''to sound''. As in &quot;He sounds weird.&quot;, &quot;She sounds boring.&quot; Since we know how to describe, we really don't have to cover it. It's works just like other verbs.

'''He sounds nice.'''

''Er klingt nett.''


'''They sound funny.'''

''Sie klingen komisch.''


Remember that when describing it's S+V+A, or subject, verb, then adjective. Exactly like in English. For right now, that's all for describing things. We are going to have some small describing lessons with some parts of this lesson.

===Related Verbs===
Okay we just went over the verb in the previous section. This will basically be a list that will help you memorize them better, and there is not a lot. Other than &quot;'''klingen'''&quot; and &quot;'''fühlen'''&quot; you should know all of these. The &quot;Er sieht aus&quot; is to show you it is a separable-prefix verb.

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Verbs|Verben|102|2}}
!English||German
|-
|To be||sein
|-
|To look||aussehen, ausschauen (Austrian German)
|-
|He looks||Er sieht aus
|-
|To feel||(sich) fühlen
|-
|To sound||klingen
|}

===Nationality===
----
This is also a large section of this lesson: nationality, and it's very important. There are many nationalities, too many to go over in this lesson, but you will learn more nationality as this level and book goes on. Right now we are just going to have a vague little list, and as this section goes on there will be more. Finally, gentlemen, get ready to have your minds blown... 



====Some Nationalities====
This is the small list, make sure you memorize this list and the next one.

{| {{German table|Vocabulary|Nationalities|Nationalitäten|127|2}}
!English||German
|-
|German(s)||(masculine) der Deutsche, (m. plural) die Deutschen; (feminine) die Deutsche, (f. plural) die Deutschen
|-
|American(s)||der Amerikaner, die Amerikaner; die Amerikanerin, die Amerikanerinnen
|-
|Englishman||der Engländer, die Engländer; die Engländerin, die Engländerinnen
|-
|Spaniard(s)||der Spanier, die Spanier; die Spanierin, die Spanierinnen
|-
|Italian(s)||der Italiener, die Italiener; die Italienerin, die Italienerinnen
|-
|Frenchman||der Franzose, die Franzosen; die Französin, die Französinnen
|}

====Describing People with Nationality====
It is no surprise you can describe people with nationality, most times, it's stereotypical, like Norwegians are blonde, tall, etc. or Germans wear lederhosen, drink beer, and play polka all day long, but that is just not true. However you can just use it for what it is, a nationality. If you do describe people by nationality this will help. Okay, you should already know how to describe, right? 

This part we will get more in to detail later, but right it is an important part of describing people with nationality, even though in English we most times don't do this, in German they do. The difference between nationality and language, like in English, '''French''' ''and'' '''French'''. But in German it is '''französisch''' ''and'' '''Franzose, Französin'''. This also is how it works for nationality describing by noun or adjective, which we are going to learn right now. 

=====Noun or Adjective Nationality=====
There are two ways to describe someone. With a noun-based nationality word or an adjective-based nationality word. But note that in German the noun-based form is used more often.  

''Example:'' ''Ich bin '''Schwede''''' (I am Swedish) and ''Ich bin '''schwedisch''''' (I am Swedish)

''Example:'' ''Ich bin '''Franzose''''' (I am French) and ''Ich bin '''französisch''''' (I am French)

====More Nationalities====

===Age===
----
Now we are all familiar with the word &quot;'''''alt''''''&quot;, which means ''old''. And in English, to find out somebody's age we ask &quot;''How old are you?''&quot;. In German it is exactly the same. The &quot;''alt''&quot; kind of belongs to the interrogative adverb, so in both German and English it may be in front of the verb:

'''Wie alt bist du?'''

''How old are you?''


Now to ask the question with 1st person it is...

'''Wie alt bin ich?'''

''How old am I?''


And as response you might get...

'''Ich bin __ Jahre alt.'''

''I am __ years old.''


'''Du bist __ Jahre alt'''.

''You are __ years old.''


And now the plural version of the 1st person...

'''Wie alt sind wir?'''

''How old are we?''


The responses you will get is...

'''Wir sind __ Jahre alt.'''

''We are __ years old.'' 	


'''Ihr seid __ Jahre alt.'''

''You all are __ years old.''


To ask this important question in the 2nd person. First, we will learn the biggest question here, &quot;''How old are you?''&quot; which is...

'''Wie alt bist du?'''

''How old are you?''


And there is only one response to this it is...

'''Ich bin __ Jahre alt.'''

''I am __ years old.''


For the equally important plural 2nd person...

'''Wie alt seid ihr?'''

''How old are you all?''


Which the response is...

'''Wir sind __ Jahre alt.'''

''We are __ years old.''


And formal question, for both singular and plural is...

'''Wie alt sind Sie?'''

''How old are you?''

''How old are you all?''


You should all ready get the pattern for this, but we are going to keep on doing this list, if you aren't sure of something or you are confused. So for the 3rd person...

'''Wie alt ist er/sie?'''

''How old is he/she?''


The responses to this are...

'''Er ist __ Jahre alt.'''

''He is __ years old.''


'''Sie ist __ Jahre alt.'''

''She is __ years old.''


And now the plural 3rd person of question and response...

'''Wie alt sind sie?'''

''How old are they?''


And of course the response...

'''Sie sind  __ Jahre alt.'''

''They __ years old.''


Now with some people you might be able to guess their age, and you could ask them directly about it. This is usually pretty of rude, but it illustrates nicely how the phrase has to be changed if you ask a yes-no-question, so let's get started, anyway!


'''Bist du __ Jahre alt?'''

''Are you __ years old?''


'''Ist er/sie __ Jahre alt?'''

''Is he/she __ years old?''


'''Sind sie __ Jahre alt?'''

''Are they __ years old?''


'''

Note the inversed order between &quot;Wie alt bist du?&quot; und &quot;Bist du __ Jahre alt?&quot; This is exactly the same as in English!

&lt;td&gt;their&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;''ihr''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

'''Note''': 'Euer' is irregular. When 'euer' has to have a different ending the '''e''' before '''r''' is dropped, so it turns into 'eur-'.

For two triangles to be similar, all 3 corresponding angles must be congruent, and all three sides must be proportionally equal.
Two triangles are similar if...
*Two angles of each triangle are congruent.
*The acute angle of a right triangle is congruent to the acute angle of another right triangle.
*The two triangles are congruent.  Note here that congruency implies similarity.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vertical angles''' are a pair of angles with a common ''vertex'' whose sides form opposite rays.  An extensively useful fact about vertical angles is that they are ''congruent.''  Aside from saying that any pair of vertical angles &quot;obviously&quot; have the same measure by inspection, we can prove this fact with some simple algebra and an observation about ''supplementary angles.''  Let two lines intersect at a point, and angles A1 and A2 be a pair of vertical angles thus formed.  At the point of intersection, two other angles are also formed, and we'll call either one of them B1 without loss of generality.  Since B1 and A1 are supplementary, we can say that the measure of B1 plus the measure of A1 is 180.  Similarly, the measure of B1 plus the measure of A2 is 180.  Thus the measure of A1 plus the measure of B1 equals the measure of A2 plus the measure of B1, by substitution.  Then by subracting the measure of B1 from each side of this equality, we have that the measure of A1 equals the measure of A2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, I liked that part about not using coersion in a relationship.  Did you (the author) make that up yourself?

----
This section was obviously written by a woman. This section does nothing to address the fundamental hipocricy of women; they say one thing, but do another. This is a common historical critisim of women by men that dates back hundreds of years, if not more. For example, us men know of many women who have sex with men they know are losers, yet they want to hang out with us who are not losers. They want to be our &quot;friend&quot;, but when shit hits the fan, they usually dont do much to help us. However, they will ask us for countless favors. The losers these young women chose to have sex with have one thing going for them: confidence. Women are genetically programmed to be attracted to confidence, and this is the strongest theory in my opinion of why they tell us one thing, but do another. Specifically, they say that they want the knight in shining armor, but they have sex with players who they know have already done most of the other girls in town, have been in jail, have no job or a bad job, and no prospects for a future. 

The last part of this section, titled &quot;Vulnerability&quot;, is quite ignorant. It needs to be clarified by addressing the issue of young women being attracted to the &quot;bad boys&quot;, and then LATER (trying to) change them into good-bad guys. Women want a combination of losers and winers. They want a confident loser who knows how to pick up women, then they want to try to change this loser after they are with them. Don't believe me? Ask women in their 30's who are single/divorced. They will tell you how they used to be attracted to a certain type of man, but have now realized that they want quality men. What they wont tell you is that they will probably cheat on you and still have sex with the losers.

I suspect this &quot;Vulnerability&quot; section was written by a lesbian.

This entire masculinity section is a complete joke. You people should be ashamed of writing such crap. You think that showing respect towards motherhood is going to get a guy laid? Who wrote this stuff? A typical nerd virgin with no life who lives in his moms basement, or worse, a woman?</text>

'''Radiology''' is the branch of medical science dealing with medical imaging.  It may use x-ray machines or other such radiation devices. It also uses techniques that do not involve radiation, such as MRI and ultrasound.
== General Types of Radiology ==
As a medical specialty, radiology can refer to two sub-fields, diagnostic radiology and therapeutic radiology. 

Diagnostic radiology is concerned with the use of various imaging modalities to aid in the diagnosis of disease. Diagnostic radiology can be further divided into multiple sub-specialty areas. Interventional radiology, one of these sub-specialty areas, uses the imaging modalities of diagnostic radiology to guide minimally invasive surgical procedures. 

Therapeutic radiology—or, as it is now called, radiation oncology uses radiation to treat diseases such as cancer using a form of treatment called radiation therapy.

== Imaging Modalities ==
Commonly used imaging modalities include plain radiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, and nuclear imaging techniques. Each of these modalities has strengths and limitations which dictate its use in diagnosis. 

=== Radiography ===
Radiographs are image created with X-rays, and used for the evaluation of many bony and soft tissue structures. Fluoroscopy and angiography are special applications of X-ray imaging. Fluoroscopy is a technique where a fluorescent screen or image intensifying tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system to image internal structures of the body. Angiography uses methods to demonstrate the internal structure of blood vessels, highlighting the presence and extent of obstruction to the vessel, if any. In medical imaging,  contrast media are substances that are administered into the body, usually injected or swallowed, to help delineate the anatomy of blood vessels, the genitourinary tract, the gastrointestinal tract, etc. Contrast media, which strongly absorb X-ray radiation, in conjunction with the real-time imaging ability of fluroscopy and angiography help to demonstrate dynamic processes, such as the peristalsis of the digestive tract or blood flow.

=== CT scanning ===
CT imaging uses X-rays in conjunction with computing algorithms to image tissues in the body. Imaging is usually performed in the axial plane; however, computer reconstructions can be rendered in other planes or to produce 3D images. Contrast media is often used to delineate anatomy and allows 3D reconstructions of structures, such as arteries and veins. Although the resolution of radiographs is higher for imaging of the skeleton, CT can generate much more detailed images of soft tissues. CT exposes the patient to more ionizing radiation.

=== Sonography ===
Medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time. No radiation is involved, but the quality of the images obtained using ultrasound is highly dependent on the skill of the person performing the exam.
Ultrasound procedures are best used for ante natal checkups. It is not harmful to fetus nor to the mother.

=== MRI Magnetic Resonance Imaging ===
MRI uses strong magnetic fields to align spinning atomic nuclei (usually hydrogen protons) within body tissues, then disturbs the axis of rotation of these nuclei and observes the radio frequency signal generated as the nuclei return to their baseline status. MRI scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities. With advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution, and improvements in computer 3D algorithms and hardware, MRI has the potential for great development in the next few years. One disadvantage is that the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed.

=== Nuclear medicine ===
Nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of substances labelled with radionuclides or radiopharmaceuticals which have affinity for particular tissues. Generally speaking, Technecium-99m (half-life 6.02 hours) is the radionuclide used. The heart, lungs, thyroid, liver, gallbladder, and bones are commonly evaluated for particular conditions using these techniques. While anatomical detail is limited in these studies, nuclear medicine is useful in displaying physiological function. Processes such as the growth of a tumor can be monitored this way, even when the tumor cannot be adequately visualized using any of the other imaging modalities. Nuclear medicine also involves the therapeutic administration of isotopes labeled to antibodies or other substances, therefore delivering a high dose of radiation to specific targets such as tumors or the thyroid gland.

&lt;/center&gt;
----
== Introduction ==
'''Plant morphology''' is the study of the external structure or form of plants. The concept was put in circulation by the author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in the early 1800s. You have already covered important aspects of plant morphology in the previous chapters on plant organs (leaves, stems, roots), flowers, and fruits.  Those chapters emphasized both '''plant anatomy''' (the internal structure) and  plant morphology (the external form) of specific parts or organs. Here, we will be concerned especially with the various growth forms that plants take and how such morphologies contribute to the success of each species. 
[[image:Lichen_fruticose2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A branching lichen - a 'plant' form called '''fruticose''']]
== Simple plant forms ==
The forms taken by simpler &quot;plants&quot; (e.g., algae) will be considered in greater detail in Section II of ''The Guide''.  However, lichens offer a good general introduction to basic plant forms in a group whose members are sometimes informally classified on the basis of morphology.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Lichen|Lichens]] (&lt;small&gt;You need not follow links except to clarify unfamiliar terms&lt;/small&gt;) 

Imagine an early earth, with most life in the oceans, but the beginnings of terrestrial life represented by primitive photoautotrophic organisms spread over rocky surfaces. In the seas, the autotrophs would be floating forms and encrusting slimes, or calcareous rich crusts.

When we think about the evolution of more complex forms, even within such groups that today appear rather primitive such as the multicellular algae, we need to consider what forces were operating on the mechanism of natural selection to drive evolution in certain directions. We must also always be mindful of realistic limitations. 

When you previously read the article on [[Wikipedia:en:Algae|algae]], you may recall the following description of life forms of these simple &quot;plants&quot;: Most algae are unicellular, flagellates or amoeboids, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the algal groups. The more common organizational levels beyond unicellular forms are:

:'''Colonial''' &amp;ndash; small, regular groups of (usually) motile cells 
:'''Capsoid''' &amp;ndash; individual non-motile cells embedded in a common mucilage 
:'''Coccoid''' &amp;ndash; individual non-motile cells with adherent cell walls 
:'''Palmelloid''' &amp;ndash; non-motile cells embedded in common mucilage 
:'''Filamentous''' &amp;ndash; a string of non-motile cells connected on end together and sometimes branching 
:'''Parenchymatous''' &amp;ndash; cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues

== Complex plant forms ==
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Tree|Trees]] (&lt;small&gt;You need follow links only to clarify unfamiliar terms&lt;/small&gt;) 
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Shrub|Shrubs]] (&lt;small&gt;You need follow links only to clarify unfamiliar terms&lt;/small&gt;)

Shouldn't this be named as something else? I tend to think of applied math as mathematical models of physical systems and their solutions (numerical or closed-form).
----
''I agree. From the table of contents, it only seems to cover the sort of math I expect everyone adult to be able to do. Elementary school math ? pre-algebra ? Primary school math ? I think of &quot;applied math&quot; as also including all other kinds of specialized math that can be applied to the real world (trig in carpentry and surveying; boolean algebra in digital electronics and programming; tensor calc in mechanical engineering; probability in medicine; etc). I call the leftover bits of math (outside of applied math) (various kinds of infinity; surreal numbers; etc.) &quot;pure math&quot; or &quot;theoretical math&quot;. -- [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 19:34, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)''
----
-Well, is this Book meant to make an electronic device that can calculate? So that it has a mathematical 'intelligence'? Or should it clear up some logic in really calculating things for humanbeings? I guess both.
----
From the outline of the text, it would seem that this is a textbook aimed at developing basic math skills for people who are training for an entry-level job. (In my opinion this is a wholly legitimate use of Wikibooks, and I can envision such a text being used in job training programs for adults.) As such, perhaps the title should be something along those lines; perhaps something like &quot;Applied Basic Math Skills&quot; or something similar.
----
Also, the outline needs to be rethought, as each skill needs to build on skills previously acquired and mastered. For example, multiplication of fractions builds on the previous knowledge of both multiplication and fractions. As it stands, the outline of the book seems to be a document plagarized from elsewhere on the Web listing merely the competencies expected of a student. --[[User:Chuckhoffmann|Chuck Hoffmann]] 12:43, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
Agree with you there (the last person before me). I also think that more text is required to give people indept insight so the problem is covered from a wide angle. Yet, I think that this wikibook shouldn't be underestimated. How many of you use (and found) efficient methods for calculations? Unless you do head-calculating as a hobby, I think most of us need some shaving of the edges to become more competent. And if we add some more text maybe it'll show a more scientific look.
By the way, I found a nasy mediawiki error I think. I'm currently working on whole number multiplications. Look a the code yourself, I can assure you that there are '''no''' errors or incompleteness in the code itself. Well, edit it (I wiki-dare you ;-)).
----
I know nobody is actually looking at this, but is there a way to strike &lt;nowiki&gt; using &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; any numbers inside the TeX markup? I'm trying to use this for reducing numbers. [[User:Water Bottle|WB]] 08:20, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Hmm. This book discusses elementary level math concepts, but is written at an 11th grade reading level. Something is not quite right there. - [[w:User:KeithTyler]]
*true... easy concepts for grade 11s... hard terminology for elemetary school... - [[User:Water Bottle|WB]] 06:11, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Maybe we should divide this into several pages? [[User:Water Bottle|WB]] 06:11, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)

This book indicates that a number ending in 5 should be rounded up, and that a number ending in 0 should be rounded down.  I realize that this is the way that it is often taught(inaccurately), and accepted on tests, but it is not completely accurate.  In fact, any last digit from &gt;0 to &lt;5 should be rounded down, and any last digit from &gt;5 to &lt;0(.95 is greater than .9) should be rounded down.  A number ending in exactly 5 can go either way:  15 is equally far from 10 and 20(-5 and +5 away).  I think it would be better if this book was more accurate on rounding. [[User:CatastrophicToad|CatastrophicToad]] 19:15, 14 January 2006 (UTC)
----
To skip back to the last topic: I agree that the name needs to be changed. I think that the title in the table of contents should be more descriptive. &quot;Basic Math for Adults&quot;, for example, or &quot;Adult Math Basics&quot;. I think there should be another textbook for kids, too. Maybe &quot;Math for Kids&quot;. The &quot;Primary School Mathematics&quot; text is for parents and teachers, which doesn't help precocious children much, who will be growing up with the Internet. This solves the 'reading level' problem. Just target your diction for kids or adults, depending on the text. (Of course, then you have the problem of deciding on the reading level for the kids or the adults, but at least you can narrow the gap somewhat.)

= Multiplying Whole Numbers =

My math aint that good, but is Multiplying Whole Numbers 
Single number times Single number producing a Single number

Take the first number as 'n1' Take the second number as 'n2' Repeat 'n1' 'n2' times and add the 'n1 's together

    n_1 = 3 \times 10^0
    n_2 = 2 \times 10^0
    (n_1)\times(n_2)= 2(3 \times 10^0) = 6 \times 10^0 = 6 
ai'nt the answer 5?

'''OsiriX''' is an image processing software dedicated to DICOM images (&quot;.dcm&quot; / &quot;.DCM&quot; extension) produced by medical equipment (MRI, CT, PET, PET-CT, ...) and confocal microscopy (LSM and BioRAD-PIC format). It can also read many other file formats: TIFF (8,16, 32 bits), JPEG, PDF, AVI, MPEG and Quicktime. It is fully compliant with the DICOM standard for image communication and image file formats. OsiriX is able to receive images transferred by DICOM communication protocol from any PACS or medical imaging modality (STORE SCP - Service Class Provider, STORE SCU - Service Class User, and Query/Retrieve) .

'''OsiriX''' has been specifically designed for navigation and visualization of multimodality and multidimensional images: 2D Viewer, 3D Viewer, 4D Viewer (3D series with temporal dimension, for example: Cardiac-CT) and 5D Viewer (3D series with temporal and functional dimensions, for example: Cardiac-PET-CT). The 3D Viewer offers all modern rendering modes: Multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), Surface Rendering, Volume Rendering and Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP). All these modes support 4D data and are able to produce image fusion between two different series (for example: PET-CT).

'''Osirix''' is simultaneously a DICOM PACS workstation for medical imaging '''and''' an image processing software package for medical research (radiology and nuclear imaging), functional imaging, 3D imaging, confocal microscopy and molecular imaging.

'''Osirix''' supports a complete plug-in architecture that allows you to expand the capabilities of OsiriX for your personal needs! This plug-in architecture gives you access to the powerful Cocoa framework with an easy, object-oriented and dynamic language: Objective-C.

'''There are two ways to import DICOM images in OsiriX:''' 

#'''via a network:''' 
#'''from local media:'''

'''You can then view and edit the DICOM headers.'''

==Importing DICOM Images into OsiriX via a Network==

Images can either be pushed from the PACS using a DICOM &quot;store&quot; function, or they can be &quot;pulled&quot; by the DICOM query-retrieve function of OsiriX.

===Using OsiriX as a Passive DICOM Listener===

If you are working in a PACS environment, the easiest way to import DICOM images into OsiriX is to configure OsiriX as a “DICOM Listener”.  In this configuration, DICOM images are sent from a PACS workstation to a Mac computer running OsiriX, which passively receives the images.  
&lt;p&gt;
OsiriX and the PACS workstation must be first configured: Assign an AETitle and a Port number to OsiriX in the “Preferences” window. Then, contact your “friendly” PACS manager to configure the PACS. Don't forget to leave OsiriX running -- the DICOM Listener works only if OsiriX is active! 
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriXListenerSetup2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''“Preferences” window to configure the “DICOM Listener”''&lt;/center&gt; 

'''Configuration for multiple users:'''

If your OsiriX workstation is configured for multiple OsiriX users who log in via the fast user switch, then each user must have a separate AE title and port number.

===Using OsiriX as a Query-Retrieve PACS Workstation===
As of version 1.7.1 OsiriX cannot be queried by another workstation.  

OsiriX can query other DICOM devices such as workstations, CTs, MRIs, etc.   Queries can be performed even if the other device is not configured to send to OsiriX.   To query, first go to the preferences and under Locations add the AE Title, port, and hostname ( IP address) of the remote location.  Go to the query window.  Select the location and verify the connection if you want to.  Type the name or part of a name in the search field and hit the return key.  The query field has a pull down menu with more options.
However, if you want to retrieve studies, the remote devices needs to be set up to send to OsiriX.  The AE Title, port, and hostname (IP address) of OsiriX need to entered into the remote device of PACS.

==Importing DICOM Images into OsiriX from Local Media==

If you have DICOM files on your hard drive, or have a DICOM CD-Rom, you simply need to click on the “Import” button of the “Local database” window. You then select either files or folders containing files. Multiple files and/or folders can be selected by clicking while holding the ‘shift’ key. You can also “drag-and-drop” files directly from the desktop into the “Local Database” window.

=== Special Notes for Importing Images from early versions of Vitrea Workstation software ===

Earlier versions of Vital Images Vitrea workstation software (prior to version 3.8) did not follow the DICOM standard in that they did not write a DICOMDIR when exporting to a CD or DVD. All versions of Vitrea 3.8 or higher (current version as of 2008 is 4.1)do support the DICOM standard and do include a DICOMDIR upon export to CD/DVD. For earlier versions of Vitrea follow this process to successfully import images:

# the preferences in Osirix must be changed from:
# &quot;Load only files described in the DICOMDIR file&quot; to &quot;Load all &quot;DICOM&quot; files available on the CD/DVD ( this doesn't rely on the DICOMDIR file) as in the screen shot below:
# Also, you must have the latest software upgrade from VITREA. In the past, they have used a GEARWORKD CD Driver that the Macintosh could not read.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriXDICOMDIRPreferences.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''CD/DVD Preferences for importing images from a Vitrea CD or DVD''&lt;/center&gt;

=== Opening Other Mac-Unfriendly CD's with OsiriX ===

Some CDs apparently have a strange corruption that prevents Macs from viewing the files, so there is no direct way to access the images from OsiriX.  However, the [http://groups.yahoo.com/group/osirix/ OsiriX Discussion Group] has come up with several workarounds for reading poorly formatted image CD's:

* '''Virtual PC''' 

# Run Virtual PC.
# You should now be able to access the CD as if you were on a PC. 
# From within Virtual PC you can now copy the data to a Mac folder.
# Osirix should now be able to read the image data. 

* '''Flash drives''' (or your new iPod Shuffle)

# Place the &quot;bad&quot; CD in any old PC that has a USB port.
# Plug the flash drive into the PC.
# Copy the CD data onto a folder on the flash drive.
# Take the flash drive and plug it into the Mac.
# '''OsiriX''' should now be able to read the image data.

* '''Ejecting an unrecognizable CD''' 

# If the CD does not show up in the Finder or on the Desktop:
# Press F-12 for 5 seconds to eject the CD.
# If that doesn't work, restart the Mac and hold down the left mouse button during start-up.

* '''Burning a more Mac-friendly CD on a PC'''

# When burning the CD, try the &quot;most compatible&quot; option if available.
# Try not using Drive Letter Access (DLA) or drag-and-drop for burning from a PC.
# Try burning the CD in a single session.
# Try finalizing the CD.
# Use a CD-R, not a CD-RW disc.

There also seems to be an issue when using a VPN conncetion to retrieve images.

==Viewing and Saving the DICOM Header of DICOM Images==

In the main OsiriX window, select the patient/study you want, then open the images by clicking on &quot;2D-3D viewer&quot;, once the study has opened, you have the ability to modify the tool bar of the viewer window in OsiriX.
One of the tools you can add is the Meta-Data button.

To add this button to your viewer:
Under the OsiriX Format Menu, select Customize Toolbar...
There will be a whole new set of icons;
drag the Meta-Data button (in the top right corner) into your toolbar where you want it.

Select Done on the toolbar customization window.

There you go!
You can save the Metadata as a text file or XML..

==Wikiversity==

I saw your name on the Wikiversity participant's list, you may be very experienced in mathematics already, but I'm trying out instructing a Calculus course if you're interested, go to Wikiveristy, check out the mathematics department, pure mathematics, and in the course list is included Calculus.

==Prácticas de traducción==

Hola. Me acabo de apuntar como profesor-científico al [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversidad:Pr%C3%A1cticas_de_traducci%C3%B3n curso de traducción]. Si tienes interés en traducir artículos científicos, puedo supervisarlo. Y, si no sabes por dónde empezar, puedo hacerte algunas sugerencias :)

Hi, I just joined the translation course as scientific supervisor. If you have interest in practicing some spanish by translating scientific articles, just make me know. If you don't have any ideas, I am ready to make suggestions :)

[[User:4lex|4lex]] 17:10, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

OK, I've been thinking about this, and I have an idea that might work: [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actualidad Actualidad] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_events Current events]). Texts are pretty short (one or two sentences, usually), and you will be probably familiar with the content. In spanish, the section exists, but there are usually several days each month without any news  (see, for example, [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octubre_de_2004 last month]). You could 
# pick such a no-news-in-spanish-day (or a few of them), 
# look into the english version, 
# pick the two main news for this day, 
# copy/paste them into your user page (maybe somewhere like [[User:Sma/Prácticas de traducción]]), 
# try to translate them to rough spanish and
# notify me in my discussion page.
Then, I can take a look, make some minor corrections or suggestions, and, when we are both happy, you can copy/paste them into the spanish version, and loop again to 1. Hopefully, with each iteration you will learn something and the spanish section of news will get a little better.
[[User:4lex|4lex]] 16:02, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I did the first iteration of suggestions :) If you want, you may try again, I will take a second look, and possibly then you might like to copy-paste the events [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003 there]. -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 21:17, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Maybe some of the talk we have could be performed more efficiently through IM (not major corrections, but minor details). You can contact me through jabber.org. -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 14:01, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== De Wikiversity a Wikiversidad ==

We are [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversidad:Portada moving]. When (and if) you come back and want to go on with the course, be sure to contact me [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Usuario_Discusi%C3%B3n:4lex there]. -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 15:55, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:OK, we'll keep in contact when you are back to work, enjoy your travel :) Just post me a comment in es.wikibooks when you want some work revised, because I don't visit en.wikibooks regularly since the spanish wikiversidad moved. -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 20:28, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</text>

OsiriX has many functions and it is sometimes useful to modify the Graphic User Interface (GUI) for your personal needs. All windows in OsiriX are customizable. You can modify the tools displayed in the toolbar. Select “Customize Toolbar” from the “2D Viewer” or “3D Viewer” menus. You can also directly click in the toolbar by holding the ‘ctrl’ key. The “Customize” window will appear. Then simply “drag-and-drop” any tools from this window to the toolbar.

How does one simultaneously open multiple series? Open a patient file and select multiple series thumbnails by holding down the ‘Shift’ key for a continuous selection or the ‘Apple’ (Command) key for a noncontinuous selection. Then click  on the “2D Viewer” icon from the toolbar to open all selected series. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_5.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The “Local Database” window ''&lt;/center&gt;

You can open a new series at any time. Simply go to the file menu and select “Local Database” to open the database window.

How does one simultaneously view multiple series? Select the “Tile Windows” from the “2D Viewer” menu. This function will tile all opened windows and you will be able to see all opened series at the same time. 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_6.1.jpg]]&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;''4 series opened simultaneously. Note that if all series are from the same study, you will able to see where the slice in the series you are navigating is located on the other series.''

Two things are important to understand about your local database:

#If you receive your images with the DICOM listener, they are stored in the “DATABASE” folder in the “OsiriX Data” folder, located in your “Documents” folder. OsiriX will manage these files. This means that if you delete them from the “Local Database” window, Osirix will definitively delete these files. 
#If you import your files with the “Import” button or menu item, OsiriX can either keep a link to these files or copy them in the “DATABASE” folder. This means that if you delete them from the “Local Database” window, OsiriX will either delete the links to files or delete files located in the “DATABASE” folder. 

OsiriX keeps information of all images in the “DATA.DAT” file. This file is located in the “OsiriX Data” folder. 

This file can be deleted. It does not contain any important data, only links to DICOM files. 

You can also rebuild the database at any time. This will delete the “DATA.DAT” file and reconstruct a new one. Simply select '''Rebuild Database''' from the '''File''' menu. This function will re-scan all files displayed in the “Local Database” window, remove all unavailable files and add all files available in the “DATABASE” folder (received from the PACS network). 

You can modify the database management in the Preferences window.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_8.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The Preferences window. ''&lt;/center&gt; 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_8.2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The “OsiriX Data” folder: ''&lt;/center&gt; 

* “DATABASE” folder contains ‘local’ DICOM files.
* “INCOMING” folder contains temporarily files that are received by the listener.
* “TEMP” folder contains files during conversion time. This folder is deleted when you exit OsiriX.
* “ROIs” folder stores ROIs of DICOM images.

OsiriX has limited support for image fusion. Images obtained during the same imaging session will be automatically aligned by OsiriX. If the two image series have the same number of slices and the same slice spacing, then stack synchronization (under the 2D Viewer menu) can be useful in linking the two series.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ThighT1STIRFusion.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Fusion image between axial STIR and T1 images of a football player with a hamstring hematoma.  These images were performed during the same imaging exam and were '''automatically''' aligned by OsiriX.''&lt;/center&gt;

There is currently no way to '''automatically''' align images obtained on different machines or on the same machine at different times.  However, one can '''manually''' align such image series to create fusion images, using the Osirix &quot;Move&quot; [[Image:OsiriXMoveIcon.gif]] and zoom [[Image:OsiriXZoomIcon.gif]] tools.  When fusing two images from series with different numbers of slices, it is necessary to first turn off stack synchronization (under the 2D Viewer meu).

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsirixFusionEpendymomasmall.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Image fusion of plain radiograph and T2W MR image of lumbar spine in a patient with an ependymoma centered at L1 and a limbus vertebra at L4.  These images were registered '''manually''' using the OsiriX Zoom and Move tools.''&lt;/center&gt;

To create a fusion between any two image series, simply open the two series you want to mix and then “drag-and-drop” the window icon from one on the other: 

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_9.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The window icon is located at the left of the window name.''&lt;/center&gt;  

When initiating the drag of the window icon for fusion, you have to click on the icon and then wait a second or so before starting the drag. Otherwise the entire window will be dragged.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX 9.2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Image fusion between a CT and PET series.''&lt;/center&gt;  


You can control the fusion intensity with the “Fusion Percentage” slider from the toolbar. Note that if you close one of the two series, the fusion will be stopped. If you make a modification on the first series (CLUT, zoom,rotation, ...), these modifications will be applied to the second one. 

Image fusion is also available for 2D and 3D reconstructions implying that you can use image fusion along with MPR, Volume rendering, etc...

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_10.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Image fusion in the 3D MPR window''&lt;/center&gt;

OsiriX supports non-DICOM images and movies. That means you can handle any images or image sequences in OsiriX as if they were DICOM images. In other words, you can then rotate them, zoom in or out, and manipulate the window, level and color look-up table (CLUT).  

Once you have imported these images into OsiriX, you can then export them to a file on your disk or to a PACS system in DICOM format.  OsiriX will also let you export them in RAW, JPEG, TIFF or Quicktime format or even directly to your e-mail program.
&lt;br&gt;

With OsiriX, you can export your DICOM images as TIFF, JPEG, RAW or DICOM images or as a Quicktime sequence. This allows you to capture selected images in a format that will allow you to bring them into, for example,  PowerPoint or Keynote presentations or import them into a Microsoft Word document. 

To export a single image, you can either press apple-copy (Command-C) to copy it to the clipboard or select '''Export''' from the '''2D Viewer''' menu. The '''Export''' menu item has a submenu to allow specification of the particular image format (TIFF, JPEG etc.). Using the default preferences, OsiriX will export the image as it appears on the screen -- same size, zoom, rotation, window level, etc. You can find the exact size of the image on the upper left corner of the window: 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_12.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The exported image resolution will be 1266 x 709''&lt;/center&gt; 


The same principle applies for images sequence. Select '''Export to Quicktime''' from the '''Export''' submenu or click on the Quicktime button from the toolbar. With Quicktime export, you have the possibility to export the image fusion dimension of the 4D viewer dimension, if these modes are activated: 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_12.2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Select which ‘dimension’ you want to export''&lt;/center&gt;


You can also change the compression mode and playing rate. We recommend the JPEG compression for best quality. 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_13.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Modify the compression mode and playing rate (frames per second)
''&lt;/center&gt;

The preferences can be changed so that when an image is exported, it retains the original image size. This option is found under the Viewers tab in the '''Preferences...''' window ('''OsiriX''' menu). If this option is enabled, then a 512 by 512 matrix CT will be exported as a 512 by 512 image. In addition, only the image itself is exported, not the alphanumerics such as the patient name. This is often the appropriate choice for capturing images for presentations or papers.




To view and edit the DICOM header before exporting to DICOM, go to OsiriX Format Menu, select Customize Toolbar, drag the Meta-Data button into your toolbar where you want it, select Done on the toolbar customization window. You can save the Metadata as a text file or XML.

OsiriX supports a 4D viewer. You can load multiple series of a study that is acquired dynamically.  For example, multiphase reconstructed series from a cardiac CT can be loaded for a CINE mode review. Simply select all series in the “Local Database” window and then click “4D viewer”. All series will be loaded into the same window. You can navigate and review in a ‘dynamic’ fashion by using the “4D player” function from the toolbar. 

Select multiple series and then click on the “4D viewer” icon. 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_14.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The “4D player” function from the toolbar''&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_14.2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The “4D player” function is also available in MPR reconstruction windows.''&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IPA Table ==

Instead of going through the trouble of making an IPA table, isn't it just easier to link to [[IPA|here]]? - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 22:08, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Possibly, though that doesn't use the right symbols. Alternatively, we could just use the graphic from wikipedia. The advantage of having an IPA with the correct symbols is that it will be useful for quickly copying and pasting when we need to use those symbols elsewhere... [[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie Roberto]] 16:48, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::What do you mean not the right symbols? They're exactly the same as the ones here. Anyway, if it's so bad then just edit it. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 15:51, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::It's a different table completely. Compare with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet#Chart IPA chart] - the symbols in that table have been built using diacratic marks. I could just edit it, but there's not much point now that I've created the HTML table. See [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-unicode.htm IPA symbols in Unicode]  [[User:Frankie Roberto|Frankie Roberto]]

::::It uses diacritics only for those parts of the table that do not have their own symbol. It is more comprehensive than the regular IPA charts that one sees on the web, because it fills in the blank spaces for you.

::::I don't suppose there's much point now, since you've already done most of the work. Oh, and rest assured, my computer can display IPA characters fine. - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 21:29, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::: I would like a way of shading in some of the boxes though. I've put in class=&quot;impossible&quot; tags, but there's no way I can find of doing custom CSS.

::::::I've edited the table so that it uses inline CSS; not the best solution, but the only implementable one. Is it okay? - [[User:Ingolemo|Ingolemo]] 23:21, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I took the liberty of filling in the symbols that hadn't been entered with their Unicode symbols. I know it's not a perfect way of doing it, but unless we're willing to make PNG files for every non-latin IPA symbol I think this is the best way to do it. I haven't entered any of the diacritic-type symbols since they're not part of the standard. Also, are we going to include the vowel and non-pulmonic charts as well? The vowel chart may be a tad difficult to do properly in pure table form, but the non-pulmonic table should be easy.

Oh, as a note, [http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-unicode.htm this page] has a list of all the Unicode IPA symbols, as well as a list of fonts that carry them (although I'm not sure of it's last update). -- [[User:Kirby1024|Kirby1024]] 08:25, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">As you probably already know, Greek and English use different alphabets. Because of this, you need to download and install a Greek font to properly view any of the following pages. If you don't, they will appear as jibberish.

The font used throughout this textbook is SPIonic, a free font developed primarily for Biblical researchers. To download and install it, follow these simple instructions:

#Visit the Society of Biblical Literature's [http://www.sbl-site.org/Resources/Resources_BiblicalFonts.aspx Biblical Fonts]&lt;sup&gt;[deadlink - guessed replacement: [http://www.sbl-site.org/educational/biblicalfonts_splegacyfonts.aspx Biblical Fonts - SPlegacy Fonts] ]&lt;/sup&gt; page. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
#The second item from bottom reads, in part, &quot;SPIonic is a Greek font.&quot; Click the attached MAC or WIN button to download the zipped font file.
#When the download is complete, open the zip file. It should contain one file, named SPIONIC_.TTF. Copy the file into your system's fonts folder.
# To test the installation, open any page below. It may be necessary to completely close all browser windows before the font will display correctly.

Before you begin, a word on prerequisites. This course assumes no previous foreign language knowledge. As I mentioned above, learning a third or fourth language is usually easier than learning a second, but all this course presumes is English fluency.

I have tried to avoid rote memorization where possible, but the fact is that memorization is impossible to avoid completely. Rules of grammar, of accent, even the alphabet itself must simply be memorized. This is not as difficult as many people seem to think, however, and the text will try to provide helps where possible.

----

OsiriX supports fours different MPR modes: 2D MPR, 2D Curved-MPR, 2D Orthogonal MPR, and 3D Orthogonal MPR. Curved MPR is discussed elsewhere in this manual.

'''a) 2D MPR''' 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_15.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''The 2D MPR window''&lt;/center&gt;


This 2D MPR Viewer allows generating a MPR slice in any position and orientation through the 3D volume. This mode shows three viewing ports. In the picture above, the two on the left are labeled A and B. The third, on the right, is labeled C.

The primary purpose of the A and B view ports is to specify the plane that will be shown in the C view port. The A and B view ports are partially obscured by lines used specify the plane to be seen in C. These lines cannot be hidden. In this sense, the C view port is designed for diagnostic viewing and the other two view ports are primarily to specify what is to be shown in C. The view ports are not all equal, which may be different from what users of other MPR interfaces are expecting. View port A shows a blue line which corresponds to the orientation of what is being seen in C and also contains a red line that corresponds to what is seen in B. View port B shows only a blue line that also corresponds to what is seen in C. View port C has no lines.

The specifying view port A will show the original images in the plane that they were originally acquired, most commonly the axial plane. You can scroll through these images to choose the one that you want to work off. The specifying view port B shows planes that are orthogonal to view port A. If A is showing an axial image then on initially opening the 2D MPR Viewer, B will show a sagittal image. The specific orthogonal plane that is being created in B is indicated in the A view port as a red line. Under these initial circumstances, C will be showing a coronal reconstruction that corresponds to the blue line.

If you are interested in seeing a sagittal image, one can simply look at the B view port but this is not really what a specifying view port is for. The specifying view ports are smaller and obscured by lines. To see a clean sagittal image, you want to grab the blue line in view port A and swing it 90 degrees. At this point, the C view port will show a sagittal image. The red line, indicating the plane of view port B, will maintain itself perpendicular to the blue line. This line, indicating the orientation of view port B, will now be documenting the coronal plane that is visible in B. You cannot grab the red line to do this rotation. Only the blue line can be grabbed. You can move the intersection of the two lines by grabbing within the red circle. This will center the point of rotation

Simply by using the A specifying view port, you can show any orthogonal plane between sagittal and coronal in the C diagnostic view port. However, to specify oblique planes requires the simultaneous use of view port B. When you specify an oblique plane, it requires that you look primarily at the blue line in B to understand what plane is being shown in C. It is possible, for example, to have the blue line in A completely outside the body part being shown in A and yet something is still being shown in C. Once you are looking at oblique planes, the blue line in A is of limited value in terms of understanding what you are looking at in C. 

A common clinical scenario is to create an image that is at and parallel to a lumbar endplate in a lordotic spine. By grabbing the intersection point in A to place it over the spine and grabbing the blue line to rotate the red line into the desired sagittal plane, you can specify the sagittal view of the spine in view port B. In B, you can move the blue line so that it is oriented parallel to the endplate of interest. The desired image is now displayed in C.

A limitation of this interface is that you cannot specify a plane off of an oblique image. The specifying view ports, A and B, will not show an oblique image. So to deal with a more complicated scenario, such as creating a plane parallel to an endplate in a lordotic and scoliotic spine, requires a certain agility of mind in 3D visualization. For this case, you could rotate the blue line in A such that the red line goes through the highest and lowest points of that interspace. Then the B port will show you some sort of half sagittal half coronal image that you can use to orient B’s blue line to show the desired plane in C. One way or another, you can specify any plane in C.

Another limitation of the interface is that once you have established a plane for C, you cannot simply scroll (i.e. move back and forth through the volume showing planes parallel to the established plane). You can grab the red circle in B and move it to establish roughly the same functionality.

The zoom tool is useful to optimize the use of the space of the view ports. Moving the metallic bars that separate them can redistribute the area of the view ports. Finally, the rotation tool can be useful when the image in C is peculiarly oriented.

(This MPR mode is quite computationally intensive. It cannot pre-process images and all images are displayed with cubic interpolation.) 


'''b) 2D Orthogonal MPR''' 

This mode shows three orthogonal planes, the original data set the and the major two perpendiculars to it. Unlike the 2D MPR mode, all the view ports are equal and behave similarly. Green lines on each window show the location of the other two orthogonal planes. You can move the green indicator lines freely in any of the view ports. Zooming and windowing will affect all the ports simultaneously. A scroll wheel will work in any of the windows to move back and forth through the stack. If you are content to be viewing only the orthogonal planes, this mode is easier and more informative than the 2D MPR.

It is important to realize that hitting the space bar allows toggling through three states. The first state shows only the green lines, the second state adds intersecting hairlines to show the common point of the three view ports and the third state hides all the lines. 


'''c) 3D Orthogonal MPR''' 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_16.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''3D orthogonal MPR mode''&lt;/center&gt;


This mode allows you to display a 3D representation of the volume with 3D orthogonal MPR slices. You can change the position of the orthogonal slices by using the 3 sliders located in the toolbar: 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_16.2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Positions of orthogonal slices''&lt;/center&gt;


Hide or show slices by clicking in the check boxes.

Yes, you can use OsiriX as a PACS workstation! You don’t have to to buy multi-thousand $$ PACS workstation licenses! Save your bucks and buy Macintosh computers instead! 

You only have to configure your modalities to automatically send exams to your OsiriX computer: configure the AETitle and Port number in OsiriX (see [[Online OsiriX Documentation/Importing DICOM images into OsiriX and Viewing DICOM headers|Importing DICOM images into OsiriX and Viewing DICOM headers]]). 

Note: OsiriX website defines it self as a DICOM Client and explains how to get a free PACS system.  It does not make it clear, however, what limitations OsiriX has over a PACS system.

OsiriX supports a 2D thick slab mode in the 2D viewer. This mode is particularly interesting if you are working with multi-slice CT. It will allow you to navigate more efficiently through a huge series. 

Thick slab mode is controlled in the tool bar: 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_21.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Thick Slab controller''&lt;/center&gt; 


There are actually 3 modes:
* Mean: all slices are added and the mean is computed.
* Maximum Intensity: maximum intensities of all pixels are extracted and displayed.
* Minimum Intensity: minimum intensities of all pixels are extracted and displayed. 

You control the number of slices with the slider. You can view the thick slab information in the lower left hand corner of the window: 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_21.2.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Images 1 to 9 are displayed, and the total thickness is 27 mm.''&lt;/center&gt;

The following functions are helpful in the rapid and efficient interpretation of images: 
* window level adjustment
* translation
* zoom
* rotation
* series browsing
* measurements
* regions of interest

The following small icons in the toolbar represent these basic functions: 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_22.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''Basic functions''&lt;/center&gt;


To use these functions, simply click on them. 

To save time, you can also use one of the following keyboard and/or mouse combinations: 

:a) '''Mouse + keys''' &lt;br&gt;
::You can change your current mouse functions by using following combinations:
::* Option + Click = Window level adjustment
::* Apple + Click = Translation
::* Shift + Click = Zoom
::* Cntl + Click = Rotation 

:b) '''3 button mouse + wheel'''&lt;br&gt;
::We highly recommend that you use OsiriX with a multi-buttons and wheel mouse. You will be able to navigate more efficiently than by using a simple unique button mouse.
::*Left button = currently selected function
::*Right button = zoom (The toolbar will allow you to choose a different function to be assigned to this right button)
::*Wheel = navigate in the series

:c) '''Jog-wheel'''
::OsiriX is compatible with these new jog-wheel devices from Contour Design (http://www.contourdesign.com/ ). OsiriX is able to fully exploit these devices to quickly navigate in 5 dimensions.

There are two limitations to OsiriX: memory and processor power. 

:'''1) Memory:''' 

::OsiriX requires a lot of memory if you try to open a large series of images! If OsiriX does not have enough memory, MacOS X will try to free memory by using the “Virtual Memory” (VM) mode: it will use your hard drive as RAM... But VM is about 1000 times slower than RAM!! You see the problem... Here is how to compute memory the amount you need: do the following simple calculation for the number of images you want to view and handle at the same time: 

::: '''Memory required = Height X Width X Number of images x 4 / 1048576'''

:::''For example: 512 x 512 x 100 x 4 / 1048576 = 100 MB of RAM for 100 CT images'' 

::This means that you need at least 100 MB of RAM ONLY for your 100 CT images. MacOS X requires a minimum of 256 MB to work “normally”. You will need at least 256 + 100 MB = 356 MB to avoid Virtual Memory mode. 

:'''2) Processor power:''' 

::OsiriX needs high processing power for 3D reconstruction: MIP and Volume Rendering. OsiriX is a multithreaded application that can use all of the processors available in your computer. If you want the best performance you should buy a quad G5 or a MacPro intel quad! 

::Another solution is to use a computer cluster with the [http://www.apple.com/acg/xgrid/ Apple X-Grid /MPI technology]. Run and install the package.  You then need to install the “OsiriX plugin”: copy it in the “Plug-ins” folder of “Xgrid” folder located in your “Library” folder. More information about this technology in future releases. 

::Another solution would be to use a VolumePRO PCI graphic board from [http://www.terarecon.com/ TeraRecon]. This solution is currently under investigation to make OsiriX run faster than a Vitrea3D workstation! All 3D reconstructions in OsiriX are based on VTK and VTK fully supports the VolumePRO graphic board...

OsiriX supports three 3D reconstruction modules:


'''1) Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP)''' 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_17.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''3D MIP Reconstruction''&lt;/center&gt;


This reconstruction uses a ‘ray-tracing’ technique to identify which pixel has the maximum intensity on each ray. This technique is useful for contrast MRIs or CTs, and bone CTs.


'''2) Volume Rendering''' 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_18.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''3D Volume Rendering''&lt;/center&gt;


This reconstruction uses a ‘ray-tracing’ technique to apply a transparency/opacity to each pixel depending on their position and their intensity. This technique produces nice images of soft tissues for MRI and CT. It is actually the most used 3D technique and will produce the nicest images in many situations.


'''3) Surface Rendering''' 


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:OsiriX_19.1.jpg]]&lt;br&gt;''3D Surface Rendering''&lt;/center&gt; 


This reconstruction produces surfaces that are based on an “iso-contour” defined by the user. This technique is useful for virtual endoscopy and bone CTs. The user can define two different surfaces to render.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== IMPORTANT! ==

Though this is an online guide to Saxophone, we recommend that you first seek a qualified and reputable saxophone teacher in order to monitor your progress. It is possible to self-study an instrument, however it is extremely difficult for an instrument such as the saxophone, where there are various aspects such as intonation and [[../Embouchure|embouchure]] which are very difficult to self-monitor. That said, we hope you enjoy the tips from this book!

== Getting Started ==
You may or may not currently own or have access to a saxophone. Whether or not you have one, and whatever type of saxophone it is (alto, tenor, soprano, baritone), there are some basic technical aspects you need to understand about the saxophone.

== Family ==
Many people wrongly consider the saxophone to be a brass instrument. Strictly speaking, the saxophone is a member of the woodwind family as a result of the method of sound production. Under the woodwind family, the saxophone is a member of the single-reed instruments, which include the clarinet and saxophone.

== Reeds ==
[[File:Mouthpiece tenor saxophone.jpg|thumb|right|Two mouthpieces for tenor saxophone: the one on the left is rubber; the one on the right is metal]]

The fundamental sound-producing mechanism of your saxophone is the reed and mouthpiece. As you blow through the mouthpiece, the reed vibrates, which produces the sound. This sound resonates throughout the rest of the instrument and by changing the length of this resonating tube of brass (by pressing different keys), we achieve a wide range of pitches. When you first open your instrument, You should try to locate the mouthpiece, which should look like this. If it doesn't have one, you can try buying one from the music store; for starters you can just buy a cheap student mouthpiece which shouldn't cost more than about $20. '''Make sure the size of the mouthpiece fits the size of your instrument!!!''' For example, if you have an alto saxophone, make sure you buy an alto-saxophone mouthpiece. If in doubt, take the whole lot to the music shop and they should be able to help you. Next, if there is a reed attached to the mouthpiece, loosen the metal clamp (this is called the ligature) and remove the reed. This is very important for hygiene reasons, as we will soon discover! Avoid using a second hand reed at all costs. Again, reeds can be purchased at the music shop for about $2 each, or they also come in boxes of 5, 10, 20. When starting, we recommend using soft reed because these are the easiest to make a sound on. They will also prevent your cheeks from getting sore, which can occur for the beginner. Again, make sure when purchasing these that they are the right size for your mouthpiece and instrument! Reeds are highly fragile and special care should be taken when handling them.

== Preparing the reed ==
The reed will only work properly when it is wet. To do this, soak the reed in a glass of water for about 1-2 minutes. This should get the reed soaked enough to vibrate freely. Alternatively, you can moisten the reed in your mouth by sticking it in your mouth while you assemble your saxophone.

Reeds come in sizes ranging from 1-5 and usually also come in half sizes. Some companies gauge the reed's strength with soft, medium, or hard. Be aware that these strengths are somewhat subjective and there is no definitive scale, so one vendor's 3 may be 'harder' than another vendor's 2.5 size. Beginners usually play with a size 2 or 2.5 reed, and as they progress and develop as a player may choose to use harder reeds. The higher the number, the harder the reed. 

Harder reeds provide more air resistance at the mouthpiece, and therefore allow the player to play louder but require more control and diaphragm support. In general, it is easier to play low notes on a softer reed and easier to play high notes (especially altissimo tones) on a harder reed. It is common practice for a saxophone player to keep between 4 and 10 good reeds on hand and rotate their use so that their performance stays consistent and so that there is always an available reed in case of breakage.

A common practice by some saxophone players (particularly in pop and jazz music) is to keep their reeds soaked constantly in a water/alcohol solution (diluted mouthwash or vodka). This method requires harder reeds and more embouchure control, but the reeds' quality remains consistent and they are immediately ready to use. As with all aspects of playing music, every player has differing opinions and tastes as to what works for them, and the only way to find out what works best for oneself is to try it.

== Positioning the reed on the mouthpiece==
The reed should have a thick end and a thin end. The thin end should have a rounded edge which corresponds to the rounded edge of the mouthpiece. Place the reed on the flat part of the mouthpiece so it covers the rectangular hole and the top, rounded edge of the reed matches the rounded edge of the mouthpiece. Move the reed down slightly just so that there is 1-2mm gap between the top of the reed and the top of the mouthpiece. If the reed is too high up, it will block the air and you won't be able to make a sound. If it is too low, the air will flow too quickly and the reed won't be able to vibrate. Once this is done, pop the ligature over the ensemble, and tighten it, making sure the ligature has been put through the right way (wide end down), and the screws sit above the reed. Make sure while you tighten it that the reed doesn't move out of position. Tighten the screws just enough so they are finger-tight. Try blowing through this mouthpiece ensemble. It should make a terrible yelp. Congratulations, you have blown your first note on the saxophone (mouthpiece)!

Advanced tip: Positioning the reed slightly higher or lower on the mouthpiece will make the reed harder or softer respectfully.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The following has been translated from the french philosophy wikibook:

The dissertation is the philosophical exercise par excellence.  It permists the evaluation of the assimilation of knowledge by the student, and has the capacity to serve as a personal yet rigourous reflection.  These two aspects mean that the dissertation does not reduce to a simple scholastic exercise.  Great philosophers have written dissertations, which are also great works.  But one cannot expect a student to produce such a work: it is therefore necessary to start by learning to write the dissertation purely as a school exercise, and to this end it is good to formulate some rules which sure enough are a formal, but whic guide the reflection and give it the maximum rigour possible.

To succeed in a philosophy dissertation, it is necessary first of all to know that there exist many possibilities of good argument.  Thus there is no single method which drives infallibly to success, but many good methods from which the author can choose.  The choice of a plan thus indicates the understanding, good or bad, of the subject.  However it remains possible to formulate some general rules:

* a philosophy dissertation divides into three parts (introduction, development, conclusion);

* there are rules to follow for each of these parts.

==types of subject==
* question
* idea or group of ideas

==introduction==
* introduce the subject
* say what the problems are
* announce the plan
* follow the plan

==development==
* several types of plan

==conclusion==
* recapitulate
* conclude by answering the question

==how to organize oneself==
* read the subject
* work on the draft
* write a proper introduction
* write the development

The study of International Relations in political science gained strength during the Cold War.  Many political scientists feared that the Soviet Union and the United States would launch themselves into a global nuclear war.  It was hoped that by studying how countries interact with each other, it would be easier to predict what the reactions of the United States or Soviet Union would be in any given situation, making it easier to avert war.

The study of International Relations has been, until very recently, the study of how states interact with other states.  However, the New World Order of the post-Cold War state system has required a redefinition of actors.

== Liberal International Theory vs.  International Realism Theory ==
The two modern major schools of International Relations theory are [[/International Liberal Theory/]] and [[/International Realism Theory/]].

Liberal theory is often marked by an analysis of an ideal, or utopian, outcome. Realist theory, however, focuses on the ways and means that states interact. An excellent discussion on the differences of the natures of these two theories can be found in Edwards H. Carr's &quot;The Twenty Years' Crisis, 1919-1939&quot; (he uses the term 'utopianism' for 'liberalism') or in Hans Morgenthau's &quot;Politics Among Nations.&quot;

Realists often credit Thucydides as the first realist thinker for his desire to leave an account of war as a &quot;possession for all time,&quot; his writing style in which he was only concerned with facts from reliable sources, and for his concentration on power in [http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.html &quot;The History of the Peloponnesian War.&quot;]  The Melian Dialogue is often given extra attention due to the unique use of dialogue, leading many to believe that Thucydides is trying to highlight an important event.  From this comes the quote &quot;The strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they must,&quot; expressing the realist theme of might-equals-right.  However, for an interesting look at the worldview that shaped Thucydides' writing, see RG Collingwood's &quot;The Idea of History.&quot;

Realism has traditionally focused on power, and in the Westphalian state system, the state is seen as having the most power.  Because it is concerned with power, realism has tended to focus more on high politics than low politics.  However, with most wars since the early 1990s being fought within states instead of between states, this is currently being redefined within realism.

Other formative thinkers in the realist tradition include:
* [[w:The_City_of_God|St Augustine of Hippo (City of God)]]
* [[w:The_Prince|Niccolo Machiavelli (The Prince)]]
* [[w:Leviathan_%28book%29|Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan)]]
* [[w:Carl_Schmitt|Carl Schmitt (Concept of the Political)]]
* [[w:Hans_Morgenthau|Hans Morgenthau (Politics Among Nations)]]
* [[w:Henry_Kissinger#Partial_bibliography|Henry Kissinger]]
* [[w:Hedley_Bull|Hedley Bull (The Anarchical Society)]]
* [[w:John_Mearsheimer|John Mearsheimer (The Tragedy of Great Power Politics)]]

Liberalism (also called &quot;Idealism&quot; pejoratively) gained popularity following the end of World War I and the triumph of Wilsonian liberalism.  Liberalism in international relations theory is generally associated with internationalism, institutionalism, and socialism.  Essentially, they believe human nature is good, war can be avoided, and there is a moral universalism.  They do not trace a long history of their theory, like realists do.  Key themes include international law, sovereignty, international organisations, and global governance.

Formative thinkers in the liberal tradition include:
* Francisco de Vitoria &amp; the School of Salamanca (De Indis debates) [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/salamanca.htm]
* Immanuel Kant (Perpetual Peace) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Peace]
* Vladimir Lenin (Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism)
* David Held (Democracy and the Global Order)

Some Properties of the Logical Connectives


&amp;and; and &amp;or; are ''commutative'':

* p &amp;and; q gives the same result as q &amp;and; p;
* p &amp;or; q gives the same result as q &amp;or; p.

&amp;and; and &amp;or; are ''associative'':

* (p &amp;and; q) &amp;and; r gives the same result as p &amp;and; (q &amp;and; r);
* (p &amp;or; q) &amp;or; r gives the same result as p &amp;or; (q &amp;or; r).

&amp;and; is ''distributive'' over &amp;or;:

* p &amp;and; (q &amp;or; r) gives the same result as (p &amp;and; q) &amp;or; (p &amp;and; r);
* (p &amp;or; q) &amp;and; r gives the same result as (p &amp;and; r) &amp;or; (q &amp;and; r).

&amp;or; is ''distributive'' over &amp;and;:

* p &amp;or; (q &amp;and; r) gives the same result as (p &amp;or; q) &amp;and; (p &amp;or; r);
* (p &amp;and; q) &amp;or; r gives the same result as (p &amp;or; r) &amp;and; (q &amp;or; r).

I say 'gives the same result as' since we have yet to talk about equality.

Those of you who know a little bit about abstract algebra will recognise that ({T, F}, &amp;or;, &amp;and;) is a  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28mathematics%29 ''ring''] - indeed it is a ''commutative ring with identity'', and with only two elements, it is as simple a ring as you can get without being totally trivial or degenerate.
To prove this, we need to observe, in addition to the ''commutative'', ''associative'' and ''distributive'' properties above, that:

* F acts as a ''zero'': F &amp;or; p is the same as p for any p &amp;isin; {T, F};
* T acts as a ''one'': T &amp;and; p is the same as p;
* F is the &amp;or;-inverse of all the elements of our ring: p &amp;or; F is the same as p.

If you are not familiar with abstract algebra, just observe that &amp;or; and &amp;and; with T and F behave a bit like addition and multiplication with numbers.  Note that &amp;or; ('or') is the connective that corresponds to addition in this analogy, even though we often say 'and' when we mean 'plus' as in '3 and 4 equals 7'.

That our connectives &amp;and; and &amp;or; behave as a ring could be considered be an interesting result about the nature of reason - it shows that our propositional calculus has a structure similar to structures to be found elsewhere in mathematics.

==What is Register Globals?==

A common security problem with PHP is the &lt;code&gt;register_globals&lt;/code&gt; setting in PHP's configuration file (&lt;code&gt;php.ini&lt;/code&gt;). This setting (that can be either '''On''' or '''Off''') tells whether or not to register the contents of the EGPCS (Environment, GET, POST, Cookie, Server) variables as global variables. For example, if &lt;code&gt;register_globals&lt;/code&gt; is on, the url &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.com/test.php?id=3&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will declare &lt;code&gt;$id&lt;/code&gt; as a [[PHP Programming/Variables|global variable]] with no code required. Similarly, &lt;code&gt;$DOCUMENT_ROOT&lt;/code&gt; would also be defined, since it is part of the &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/code&gt; 'superglobal' array. These two examples are the equivalent of placing the following code at the beginning of a script:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
$id = $_GET['id'];
$DOCUMENT_ROOT = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
&lt;/source&gt;

This feature is a great security risk, and you should ensure that &lt;code&gt;register_globals&lt;/code&gt; is '''Off''' for all scripts (as of PHP 4.2.0 this is the default). It's preferred to go through PHP Predefined Variables  instead, such as the superglobal $_REQUEST. Even more secure is to further specify by using: $_ENV, $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, or $_SERVER instead of using the more general superglobal $_REQUEST.

==Example==
Let's say that this PHP code is on the receiving end of a form. The user has just entered an incorrect password. The $_POST array variable handles it. The code will describe that if the password is correct (&quot;correct password&quot; being, let's say, &quot;12345&quot;), the variable $admin will be set to TRUE. The site's configuration says that if $admin is set to TRUE, that user will have administrative privileges. This code is PHP5 compatible.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if (isset($_POST['password']) &amp;&amp; $_POST['password'] == &quot;12345&quot;) {
    $admin = TRUE;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

register_globals does not discriminate between $_POST variables and $_GET variables. So, suppose the user input the form and it took him or her to that above page. The user could decide that he or she deserves admin privileges even though they do not know the password. So, that user could append ?admin=1 to the [[Wikipedia:URL|URL]] of that page. What that would do, with register_globals '''On''', would be to force the creation the variable $admin and automatically set the value to 1, making it equivalent to TRUE. So register_globals '''On''' allows the user to '''inject''' variables and values into the program! Here, whether or not they input the correct password, the user would now have administrative privileges just by doing something with the URL.

As you can see, this sort of situation can happen at anytime by someone who does enough thinking to figure out how the page was coded. It could happen in many other situations.

Another example is that of sessions. When register_globals = on, we could also use $username in our example below but again you must realize that $username could also come from other means, such as GET (through the URL).

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 // We wouldn't know where $username came from but do know $_SESSION is
 // for session data
 if (isset($_SESSION['username'])) {
     echo &quot;Hello &lt;b&gt;{$_SESSION['username']}&lt;/b&gt;&quot;;
 } else {
     echo &quot;Hello &lt;b&gt;Guest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;
     echo &quot;Would you like to login?&quot;;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

==Best Practices==

The best way to avoid it is to make sure that register_globals is set to '''Off''' in your php.ini. But as a general coding recommendation, always initialize your variables. The following code makes a small addition to the previous code example, but first sets $admin to FALSE so that the user cannot get administrative privileges except via the conditional statement:

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
 $admin = FALSE;
 if (isset($_POST[&quot;password&quot;]) &amp;&amp; $_POST[&quot;password&quot;] == &quot;12345&quot;) {
     $admin = TRUE;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

== Regarding Wikibooks test ==

(note: I'm not the one who deleted your test) When an edit is made to a page, even an entire content deletion, the version of the page before that is saved so someone can revert (i.e. reverse) it. By clicking on the &quot;history&quot; tab at the top of the page you can view all the edits that have been made to it, latest edit first. To send a message to a user you go to the page &quot;User talk:[username]&quot; (no quotes, replace [username] with the username of the person you want to talk to) and edit that page. For more information see [[Help:Wikibooks]]. [[User:Exabyte|'''Exabyte''']] ([[User_talk:Exabyte|talk]])[[User_talk:Exabyte|&amp;shy;]] 01:49, 10 Nov 2004 (UTC)

: One other thing: For comments about a page (reading or writing, of course) you can click the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top. Discussion pages begin with &quot;Talk:&quot; or &quot;User talk:&quot;. I'm curious: how did you get here?

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Apkawel. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Apkawel~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Hola. Me acabo de apuntar como profesor-científico al [http://es.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikiversidad:Pr%C3%A1cticas_de_traducci%C3%B3n curso de traducción]. Si tienes interés en traducir artículos científicos, puedo supervisarlo. Y, si no sabes por dónde empezar, puedo hacerte algunas sugerencias :)

Hi, I just joined the translation course as scientific supervisor. If you have interest in practicing some spanish by translating scientific articles, just make me know. If you don't have any ideas, I am ready to make suggestions :)

      <text xml:space="preserve">hi 4lex,

Yes, I am interested in practicing Spanish, but I think the problem is, that I dont know a lot of Spanish, I just had one year in school, so it might be difficult to translate some texts. But I think the best is if I pick some 'simple' texts and try to translate them the best I can. But I am not sure if it will be scientific stuff because this is abit to high in language level I think.
What do you think? Please make your suggestions too :) [[User:Sma|Sma]] 21:08, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Hi,

I did my first steps today  :-).

Visit and correct it please [[User:Sma/Prácticas_de_traducción|my Translations]]

Thanks :)

[[User:Sma|Sma]] 19:08, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== hola ==

Estoy deacuerdo con tus planteamientos, todos los libros en wikibooks, las definiciones y conceptos en Wikcionary, los articulos en Wikipedia.
Necesitamos más gente que sepa química que este interesada en ayudarnos, pues una Universidad no se crea por tres personas.
[[User:Gmagno]]

== Stop adding junk please ==

Hi,

Please stop adding junk. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 09:18, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Spanish pages ==

Hi,

I noticed that there are still a lot of Spanish pages here, although there is a Spanish Wikibooks.
Aren't Spanish articles not moved there ? Thanks for your help. [[User:Yann|Yann]] 09:32, 13 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Hola. ==

Hola. 

Comentarte acerca de los nombres de los departamentos, bueno use directamente el nombre del departameto al que estoy adjunto en la universidad. Veo que no ha gustado por que directamente lo han reeditado :(. De todas formas como alguien ha creado otra Bueno voy incluime en la nueva facultad :)

== Departamento de filosofía ==

Saludos, recibí tu mensaje. Estaría encantado de echar una mano con el departamento de filosofía en Español. De momento, estaba pensando en aportar a la facultad de filosofía en Inglés, y traducir lo que fuera apareciendo al castellano, si tenía tiempo y energías. Tengo poca experiencia con wikipedia y la wikiversidad, así que acepto todo tipo de sugerencias sobre la organización de los materiales y la gestión de la facultad. &lt;br /&gt; En cuanto al contenido... sigo trabajando en ello. &lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por escribir.
([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 20:27, 24 Nov 2004 (UTC))

Saludos de nuevo,&lt;br /&gt;Gracias por contestar tan pronto. Me encantaría contribuir a nivel organizativo en el departamento de filosofía, pero no sé por dónde empezar. Originalmente, tenía intención de contribuir más bien con contenido, así que fundé la facultad para poder ir añadiendo contenido. Tenía la esperanza de que otros se encargarían de la gestión de los contenidos. Pero si no hay nadie más... alguien tiene que hacerlo. Hasta pronto.

      <text xml:space="preserve">a). The ascending powers of 2 are added to the previous number.

We start with 1 and add 2^0 to get 2, then add 2^2 (4) to get 6, plus 2^3 (8) equals 14, + 2^4=30, + 2^5=62

1, 2, 4, 6, 14, 30, . . .


b). The sequence in question is 1, 2, 6, 14, ... (without the 4). We can describe this sequence as follows:
          X(1):= 1 
          X(2):= 2 
          X(n)= 2*[X(n-2) + X(n-1)] - 2*(n-3)  (for n &gt; 2)

We obtain: '''1''', '''2''', '''6''', '''14''', 36, 94, ...

== Language summary keywords ==

Most Ada “keywords” have different functions depending on where they are used. A good example is '''[[Ada Programming/Keywords/for|for]]''' which controls the representation clause when used within a declaration part and controls a loop when used within an implementation.

In Ada, a keyword is a '''reserved word''', so it cannot be used as an identifier. Some of them are used as [[Ada Programming/Attributes|attribute]] names.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many definitions of art, rising and falling in popularity at different points in human history. The loosest definition of fine art today is artifice: the creation of a thing, not by nature itself, but by the will of a person or group. It can be visual, meant to be seen; it can be music or poetry, meant to be heard; it can be a novel to read, a play to watch or a dance to take part in; it can be buildings or clothing; digital or virtual; it can be the disciplined training of plants or animals. So broad is the possible definition of &quot;art&quot; that some say one can make an art out of living life itself. This definition, however, is not complete, because it includes many things people do and objects created that we do not consider art. So, what separates a painting from a carburator? Here again, people try to make a distinction through over-simplification: art is anything made, lacking useful purpose. This is also a fallacy, as fine art also serves many purposes, crucial to society. In more familiar terms, art is usually defined as that which was made in order to express feelings, communicate information, make a philosophical point, entertain someone, or beautify one's surroundings.

Art is differentiated from science in two ways. First, the definition of science and its branches are not widely debated, whereas art is. Second, scientific study relies on observation, experimentation, and peer revue, with one overarching goal - to increase human understanding of the universe. It's assumed that this will lead to a better way of life through better health, increased life span, more leisure time, etc. The effects of the scientific method are directly cumulative, with advances in different branches often coming together to form new insights and technology. While art also incorporates many of these same tenets and principles, it's much more chaotic, taking as many steps back as it does forward. While scientists look for puzzles to solve concretely, artists search for a way to leave a mark on the world, to comment on it, basing their work as much on intuition (or more so) as on fact. Artists often look to solve puzzles that can't be answered with science. Often times, the purpose of art making is less akin to problem solving than to a gut reaction of the artist to his/her environment, compelling one to create. In addition, while scientists share their findings in a wider community, working together to build consensus, artists often find themselves alone, ignoring vast amounts of art history and theory they find objectionable. Even so, the two may overlap: scientists sometimes feel that their work approaches the aesthetic dimension of art; artists sometimes feel that they have explored their subject matter with scientific precision.

Throughout time, art has not always been made by individual artists, or even by people who would dare to identify themselves as artists. Some of the most ancient and profound art is &quot;folk art,&quot; created by anonymous people under unknown circumstances. Folk art may be religious in nature - perhaps even an attempt to create a magical object. It may have been made by itinerant or untrained artists. It may not have been considered art at all at the time of its creation. Art as we know it today, is a fairly modern concept.

In the twenty-first century, the question &quot;what is art?&quot; has been debated for so long that, in terms of creating an art survey text, we now tend to accept Marcel Duchamp's inclusive definition, &quot;Art is whatever an artist says it is.&quot;  

Today, we also accept that industrial and graphic design are forms of art. These forms, like the old folk art mentioned above, were once not considered art at all. But now they have taken their place alongside painting and poetry; the artisan, or skilled worker practicing a trade or handicraft, is an artist if he calls himself one. And that means art can be everywhere--from the shoes on your feet to the car you drive to the teacup you sip from. We have functional art (objects you use) and art pour l'art (art for its own sake). We have &quot;high&quot; art and &quot;low&quot; art (whatever you wish those divisions to signify), high street fashion and Haute Couture, &quot;real&quot; art and &quot;kitsch&quot;. 

Today's world is a world of possibility and freedom. Although it is (and perhaps has always been) fashionable to groan that &quot;true art is dying out&quot;, such a thing can never happen. As long as there are people who want to create, there will be artists. If you look carefully around you, you will see that almost every tradition and genre of art making, ever begun, is still going strong today.

==Introduction==
PHProjekt is a web-based groupware and project management suite available at no charge under the GNU General Public License at [http://www.phprojekt.com/ www.phprojekt.com].

===Keeping up with development===
At present, PHProjekt has reached version 4.2.3, while the manual is at version 4.1. PHProjekt is distributed with a number of help files, but these are also out of date.
You can file bug reports/wishes to the Bugtracker on the home page, or try your luck in the Forum. This WikiBook is a user manual for PHProjekt, written by the end-users themselves. It is our hope to keep up with development by using this wiki.

===Feel free to contribute===
You can contribute too, by hitting &quot;edit this page&quot; at the top of this page. Free (as in freedom) software needs free (as in freedom) manuals. Please read the GNU Free Documentation License for details.

==User interface==
===Login===
Enter the address of your PHProjekt web server into your browser.  This may be something like yourprojectserver.com/index.php or your domain.com/phprojekt/index.php.  If you do not know the address, you need to contact the administrator who setup PHProjekt on your system.

If the web server requires you to accept a security certificate - do that.

You should see
* a logo
* a login field: Enter the user name given to you by your PHProjekt administrator.
* a password field: Enter the password you have been provided with.

===Summary===
The summary table has the following rows and columns:
* The text &quot;Summary&quot;, followed by a red button for signing in on the timecard, followed by a search field.
* Today's Events, followed by New Notes
* Current projects, followed by Current todos
* New forum postings, followed by Help Desk Requests
* New polls
* New files

===Calendar===
* &quot;Calendar Views&quot; - a link to a help file explaining how to use the calendar.
* The week day, date, your full name and the full name of the active group you are in is displayed.
* Self - show your calendar
* Group - show the calendars of group members
* ...write - don't know what this does yet
* Resource list
* Events list
* &lt; - show the month before
* Select month
* Select year
* Enter button
* &gt; - show the month after
* Label names for calendar columns: ''We'' - Week, Mo - Monday, Tu - Tuesday, We - Wednesday, Th - Thursday, Fr - Friday, Sa - Saturday, Su - Sunday
* Week number column - click on week to show entire week.
* Day columns - click on a day to display
* Create event - select start and end time by clicking in the day view, add some text, hit Create.
Extended view - One of the more interesting features of PHProjekt is that it lets you input an all-day event which can be one-time or perpetual. Such an event doesn't block the time blocks of the daily schedule, but shows up as a textline above the daily schedule table. It's useful for things like holidays.

===Contacts===

===Chat===
===Forum===
===Files===
===Projects===
php projects are widely developded in modern era .php has a large scope for development .In php ,using it various types of projects can be created easily as well as it can be mdifies as we can .so changes in php can be done very easily

===Timecard===
1. Sign in by hitting the button on the summary page or on the time card page. You will be taken to the time card page automatically from the summary page. Hit the graphical OK-button below the text &quot;Start&quot;.

2. You will see your sign in time to the right, for example 1000. Enter an end time, for example 1010. Click the enter button on screen. If your browser supports it, just hit the enter key on your keyboard.

3. To the left on you should see projects with status &quot;in progress&quot;, but only if you are a participant. If you don't see any projects, fix the status or get yourself added as a participant - or both.

4. Below the projects you will see a sum of all available time. If you follow this example, you should see 0 hours and 10 minutes.

5. Enter the available hours and minutes in the fields for the correct project, add a comment if you want, then hit the white enter button on screen.

IMPORTANT NOTE - A BUG: at present (4.2) the button next to the comment field does not work.

SECONDARY NOTE: On the project page, you can get statistics about yourself and others in relation to time spent on one or more projects.

===Notes===
===Helpdesk===
   The Helpdesk module, formerly called RTS, is a means to submit trouble tickets from outside clients. It's somewhat unique in that in can allow remote access without going through a formal login process.

===Mail===
===Todo===
===Other===
===!===
   The exclamation point is an icon to take each user to a setup screen for their personal preferences.

===?===
This is the link to the help files for PHProjekt.

===&amp;copy;===
This is a link to copyright information.

===&gt;&gt;===
   The double greater-than sign is a means to logout of PHProjekt and the underlying database such as MySQL. In general, the logout mechanism is put in place to cut a &quot;persistent&quot; connection to the database before it bounces a user for inactivity. 

   When you log-out, it takes you back to the login interface.

==Tips&amp;Tricks==
Giving credit where credit is due is a good thing. However, I've long ago figured out how to disable this to pick up more screen real estate on the menu. Here's the trick:

Open /layout/o.php 

remark out the lines for copyright thus:

// ... and the copyright messages ...
//if (ereg($langua,&quot;cz|de|es|fi|fr|nl|ro|si|tr|zh&quot;)) { $mod_arr[] = array(&quot;copyright&quot;,&quot;href='$doc/copy.html' target='_blank'&gt;&quot;,&quot;&amp;copy;&quot;); }
//else  { $mod_arr[] = array(&quot;copyright&quot;,&quot;href='../help/en/copy.html' target='_blank'&gt;&quot;,&quot;&amp;copy;&quot;); }

== Visual ==
=== Smoke signals ===
A smoke signal is a form of visual communication used over a long distance, developed both in the Americas and in China. By covering a fire with a blanket and quickly removing it, a puff of smoke can be generated. With some training, the sizes, shapes, and timing of these puffs can be controlled. Puffs may be observed from long distance, apparent to anyone within its visual range. With this in mind, signaling stations were often created to maximise the viewable distance. Stone bowls used by Native Americans and the towers of the Great Wall of China are examples of signaling stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_signals&lt;/ref&gt;

As the signals were visible to all, unless they had a secretly understood significance they would be conveying the information alike to friend and enemy.  There were, however, certain more or less recognized abstract smoke signals, of which the following are a few.  One puff meant '''attention'''.  Two puffs meant '''all's well'''.  Three puffs of smoke, or three fires in a row, signifies '''danger''', '''trouble''', or '''a call for help'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inquiry.net/outdoor/native/sign/smoke-signal.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current loop ===
There are two types of current loops, analog and digital. An example of analog current loop is 4-20 mA (&quot;four to twenty milliamp current loop&quot;) where 4 mA represents 0% and 20 mA represents 100%. In a digital current loop, an absence of current represents high, and the presence of current represents low.

A communications current loop, as used in teletype/Baudot codes was 0-20mA/0-50mA on/off.
Cryptographic teletype current loop ( the red side ) was/is 0-80uA due to electromagnetic snooping capabilities circa 1966 timeframe( TEMPEST program ).

The 4-20mA current loop is not a communications current loop but a process control standard for chemical/industrial sensors and actuators. The 4-20mA is analog and linear or square-root(rate of flow). The minimum 4mA is to get the low end above the noise level possible in an industrial enviroment. 4-20mA standard was developed so that the sourcing current had enough power to drive electromechanical devices at the receiving end of the current loop.

The first digital communications serial links required the sending unit to provide all the (current)loop power. The receiving devices were all electro-mechanical with the output a mechanical motion.

=== Morse code ===
[[Image:Morse telegraph.jpg|thumb|right|Original Samuel Morse telegraph]]

On the sea voyage home in 1832, Samuel F.B. Morse encountered [[w:Charles Thomas Jackson|Charles Thomas Jackson]] of Boston who was well schooled in [[w:electromagnetism|electromagnetism]]. Witnessing various experiments with Jackson's electromagnet, Morse developed the concept of a single wire telegraph. He was devising his telegraph code even before the ship docked. In time the Morse code would become the primary language of telegraphy in the world.

[[w:William Fothergill Cooke|William Cooke]] and Professor [[w:Charles Wheatstone|Charles Wheatstone]] reached the stage of launching a commercial telegraph prior to Morse, despite starting later. In England, Cooke became fascinated by electrical telegraph in 1836, four years after Morse, but with greater financial resources. Cooke built a small [[w:electrical telegraph|electrical telegraph]] within three weeks. Wheatstone also was experimenting with telegraphy and (most importantly) understood that a single large [[w:battery (electricity)|battery]] would not carry a telegraphic signal over long distances, and that numerous small batteries were far more successful and efficient in this task (Wheatstone was building on the primary research of [[w:Joseph Henry|Joseph Henry]], an American physicist). Cooke and Wheatstone formed a partnership and patented the [[w:electrical telegraph|electrical telegraph]] in May 1837, and within a short time had provided the [[w:Great Western Railway|Great Western Railway]] with a 13 km stretch of telegraph. However, Cooke and Wheatstone's multiple wire signaling method would be overtaken by Morse's superior code within a few years.

Morse encountered the problem of getting a telegraphic signal to carry over more than a few hundred yards of wire. His breakthrough came from the insights of Professor Leonard Gale, who taught chemistry at [[w:New York University|New York University]] (a personal friend of Joseph Henry). With Gale's help, Morse soon was able to send a message through ten miles (16 km) of wire. This was the great breakthrough Morse had been seeking.

Morse and Gale were soon joined by a young enthusiastic man, [[w:Alfred Vail|Alfred Vail]], who had excellent skills, insights and money.  Morse's telegraph now began to be developed very rapidly. 

In 1838 a trip to Washington, D.C. failed to attract federal sponsorship for a telegraph line. Morse then traveled to Europe seeking both sponsorship and patents, but in London discovered Cooke and Wheatstone had already established priority. Morse would need the financial backing of Maine congressman Francis Ornand Jonathan Smith.

In 1839, from Paris, Morse published the first American description of [[w:daguerreotype|daguerreotype]] photography by [[W:Louis Daguerre|Louis Daguerre]].

Morse made one last trip to Washington, D.C., in December 1842, stringing &quot;wires between two committee rooms in the Capitol, and sent messages back and forth -- and, for some reason, this time some people believed him, and a bill was finally proposed allocating $30,000 towards building an experimental line&quot;.³

The general public was highly skeptical, and there were also a great many skeptics in Congress. A thirty eight-mile (61km) line was constructed between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. The most convincing demonstration was when the results of the [[w:Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] National Convention at Baltimore in the spring of 1844 reached Washington via telegraph prior to the arrival of the first train. On 24 May, 1844 the line (which ran along the [[w:Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] between the Capitol and Baltimore) was officially opened as Morse sent his famous words &quot;What hath God wrought&quot; along the wire.
[[Image:Samuel Morse plaque.jpg|thumb|200px|The first telegraph office]]

In May 1845 the Magnetic Telegraph Company was formed in order to radiate telegraph lines from New York City towards Philadelphia, Boston, Buffalo, New York and the Mississippi.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Morse also at one time adopted Wheatstone and [[w:Carl August von Steinheil|Carl August von Steinheil's]] idea of broadcasting an electrical telegraph signal through a body of water or down steel railroad tracks or anything conductive. He went to great lengths to win a lawsuit for the right to be called &quot;inventor of the telegraph&quot;, and promoted himself as being an inventor, but Alfred played an important role in the invention of the Morse Code, which was based on earlier codes for the electromagnetic telegraph.

Samuel Morse received a patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present [[w:Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi Palace]] was built in 1861-1865 on the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan [[w:Abdülmecid|Abdülmecid]] who personally tested the new invention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbulcityguide.com/history/body_mansions_palaces.htm Istanbul City Guide: Beylerbeyi Palace]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;

The Morse telegraphic apparatus was officially adopted as the standard for European telegraphy in 1851. [[w:United Kingdom|Britain]] (with its British Empire) remained the only notable part of the world where other forms of electrical telegraph were in widespread use (they continued to use the needle telegraph invention of Cooke and Wheatstone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Franklin and his Electric Kite-Prosecution and Progress of Electrical researches--Historical Sketch of the Electric Telegraph--Claims of Morse and others--Uses of Electricity--Telegraphic Statistics. |url= |quote=It was in the month of June, 1752, a century ago, that Franklin made his celebrated experiment with the Electric Kite, by means of which he demonstrated the identity of electricity and lightning. |publisher=New York Times |date=November 11, 1852, Wednesday |accessdate=2007-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teletype ===
=== Baudot code ===
=== ASCII code ===
Work on ASCII began in 1960. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963,[1] a major revision in 1967, and the most recent update in 1986. It currently defines codes for 128 characters: 33 are non-printing, mostly obsolete control characters that affect how text is processed, and 95 are printable characters.
(stub)

The non-printing ASCII codes were needed to actuate the teletype's mechanical mechanisms:

* line-feed, carrage-return, upper-lower case, etc.

The ASCII codes were re-coded to Baudot codes used by the mechanical teletype.

The teletype was the only standard I/O device until about 1970. From 1970 on, the teletype was the most economic hobby I/O due to the military surplus of teletypes.

== The development of the CAN bus ==

The controller area network (CAN) is a serial bus protocol designed to allow devices to communicate within a vehicle without a host computer.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.totalphase.com/support/articles/200472276-CAN-Background &quot;CAN Background&quot;].
Retrieved 2014.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Bosch GmbH started development of CAN in 1983 and officially released CAN at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) congress in Detroit, Michigan in 1986.

CAN bus is one of the protocols used in the two most common on-board diagnostics standards: OBD-II  -- mandatory for all cars and light tricks sold in the US since 1996 -- and EOBD -- mandatory for all diesel and petrol vehicles sold in the European Union since 2004.

The CAN protocol is also used
in aircraft (CANaerospace, ARINC 825, etc.),
in automated industrial systems (SafetyBUS p, CAN Kingdom, CANopen, etc.),
in home automation (Very Simple Control Protocol),
etc.

RS 232 is one of the oldest and simplest asynchronous communication standards used in the computer and electronics industries. It can support a number of communication methods including null modem, modem with handshake, etc.

== Requirements ==

== Limitations ==

Limitations of the RS-232 standard include:

* Large voltage swings are required between the positive and negative supplies. This creates a high power demand and also limits the speed at which the interface can operate.
* Use of a common earth or ground limits the length of the cable as the ground will degrade over distance.
* There is no method for sending power to the connected device, although a small amount is available this is generally only sufficient for very low power devices (for example, a computer mouse). This limits the usefulness as every device must have its own independent power supply.
* The connector is very large meaning all devices will be relatively large.

== [[wikipedia:DE-9|DE-9s]] and Other Lies ==
It's true-- there is no such thing as a 9-pin RS-232 serial device.  So why do you seem to see this everywhere-- PCs and laptops, for example?

Well, primarily because of three reasons:
* There often isn't enough room to put [[wikipedia:DB-25|DB-25]] connectors on everything.
* Properly-shielded RS-232 cables are expensive and bulky.
* Most of the signals &quot;lost&quot; in the [[wikipedia:DE-9|DE-9]] connector aren't really critical, and can be worked around.

== Physical Limitations in Practice ==

If you're designing new hardware, please consider using RS-485 ([[Serial Programming:RS-485 Technical Manual]]) or Ethernet (____) rather than RS-232. The RS-485 hardware can communicate faster over longer distances than RS-232, and the hardware cost is usually less (2 wires instead of 3).

RS-422 describes a serial data link that is technically superior to [[../RS-232|RS-232]].
Apple Macintosh computers from 1984 to ___ all had a RS-422 port.

If you are designing new hardware, you'll generally want to design to the RS-485 standard instead (see the [[Serial Programming/RS-485]]). That way your new hardware will be able to communicate with ''both'' RS-485 ''and'' RS-422 equipment.

In today's modern real world RS422 is mostly used as a data extension cord, for example to extend RS232 over several hundred feet. Used as a data extension cord the RS232 signal would be converted to RS422 and then back again to RS232 at the other end of the link. For this purpose a device called a [http://www.usconverters.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=65: RS232 to RS422] converter is used.

{{Wikipedia|RS-232|RS-422|RS-485}}

== Introduction ==
ANSI/TIA/EIA-485, commonly called RS-485, is a standard defining the physical layer of a two wire multipoint communications network.  This standard is one of the more misunderstood of EIA’s standards.  Many engineers have worked on an RS-485 application and think that since their application worked, they understand exactly what the standard is.  Yet few of these engineers have ever seen the standard, let alone read it.

The RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485 standards are not comprehensive communications protocols, but are electrical layer standards that are intended to be used in conjunction with other standards.  These other standards provide the protocol and other requirements that are needed for two devices to transfer information.  Just because a protocol is used with a particular implementation of RS-232 or RS-485, does not mean it is part of the standard.

A direct quote from the RS-485 standard’s scope: 
:“&lt;tt&gt;This Standard does not specify other  characteristics, such as signal quality, timing, protocol, pin assignments, power supply voltage, operating temperature range, etc., that are essential for proper operation of interconnected equipment.&lt;/tt&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
The RS-485 standard states that it does not include protocol, but a common belief is that the RS-485 standard includes the asynchronous start-stop communication bit protocol (the UART bit protocol commonly used with a &quot;RS-232&quot; serial port), a “standard” connector, etc.

This appendix will attempt to explain what RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485 are and are not; then discuss one of the more common implementations of RS-422 and RS-485, [[w:Asynchronous_start-stop |asynchronous start-stop ASCII]] communication with a UART.

==History==
The [[w:Electronic_Industries_Alliance|EIA]] once labeled all its standards with the prefix &quot;RS&quot; (Recommended Standard), but the EIA-TIA officially replaced &quot;RS&quot; with &quot;EIA/TIA&quot; to help identify the origin of its standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1224773 | title = Trim-the-fat-off-RS-485-designs | publisher = EE Times | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EIA has officially disbanded and the standard is now maintained by the TIA.  The RS-485 standard is obsolete and has been superseded by TIA-485, but many engineers and applications guides continue to use the RS designation even though it has officially changed.

Because the EIA was accredited by ANSI to help develop standards in its areas, this standard may be described as an ANSI standard e.g. ANSI/TIA/EIA-485

==Document Conventions==
This document is primarily directed at discussion of RS-485 but also includes information about RS-232 and RS-422.

Direct quotations from one of the standards are shown &lt;tt&gt;&quot;inside quotation marks in a fixed width font&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

All three standards have annexes.  These annexes clearly state that they are not a part of the standard, and are included for informational (informative) purposes only.  These annexes are discussed in this document but it should be clear that they are &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; a part of the standard even though they are included in the standard.

Many references and examples are made to &quot;asynchronous start-stop communication with a UART&quot; or &quot;UART&quot; communications.  This is the 7 or 8-bit protocol commonly associated with serial ports.  This was done since this protocol is a very common bit format used with serial communications. It does not mean that this protocol is part of the standards or that only this protocol may be used with the 232/422/485 standards.

The term network is used to define the wires, terminations, bias networks, and all devices connected as a whole system.

==The RS standards, the OSI model, and the serial port==

In the early 80’s IBM introduced the IBM PC.  This computer had limited functionality with a keyboard and monitor as the primary peripherals.  A serial port could be added with a card that plugged into one of the ISA expansion slots.  This type of port was needed to transfer data from/to a printer, modem, or in rare cases a mouse.  The serial port used a D-sub, B-shell, 25-pin connector (commonly called a DB-25) and RS-232 electrical signal levels, which made it &quot;RS-232 compatible&quot; or compatible with the RS-232 standard.  The term &quot;RS-232 compatible serial port&quot; was often shortened to &quot;RS-232 port&quot;.

The original PC was upgraded with a hard drive and became the PC/XT.  Later it was upgraded again to a 80286 processor and a 16-bit EISA bus and became the PC/AT.  When IBM introduced the PC/AT they also changed the physical format of the serial port connector to a D-sub, E-shell, 9-pin connector (a DE-9 commonly miscalled a DB-9).  When IBM changed to the new connector they also changed the electrical signal levels. The new IBM PC/AT serial port no longer used the RS-232 25-pin connector or signal levels, but IBM took care to ensure that the new serial port’s electrical levels would still work with existing serial port peripherals, requiring only a 9-pin to 25-pin adapter.  The 9-pin connector and electrical levels were eventually documented in EIA/TIA-574. This serial port was no longer a &quot;RS-232 compatible&quot; serial port since the connector and signal levels no longer matched the RS-232 standard.  But, since existing RS-232 compatible peripherals still functioned with it, it was still regularly called an &quot;RS-232 port&quot;.

The original &quot;RS-232 compatible&quot; serial port used a UART to drive the RS-232 electrical signal levels and many came to believe that the UART protocol was a part of the RS-232 standard.  While this is incorrect, many to this day still believe that the RS-232 standard includes things such as baud rate and the bit stream protocol used in the IBM serial port.

Somewhere around this time the [[:w:OSI_model|OSI model]] was developed.  The RS-232 standard resides in layer one of the OSI model, or the physical layer.  The physical layer may include a connector, wires, and electrical levels, but does not include the bit and framing protocol of the UART.  Bit and framing protocols are in layer two of the OSI model.

The RS-232 standard does not include a line length limit, but practical limits of the electrical signal levels prevent long lengths.  The RS-485 standard calls for a differential signaling scheme that will operate over a much longer line length than RS-232 can.  Converters that changed the RS-232 electrical levels to RS-485 levels were developed which allow the serial port to transfer data over much longer distances than the RS-232 levels allowed.  Again many thought that the UART protocol used in the serial port were part of the RS-485 standard, but the RS-485 standard contains even less of the OSI model layer one than RS-232 does. The connector resides in layer one of the OSI model and RS-232 includes the connector.  RS-485 does not include any connector.  Neither standard includes any of the OSI model layer two, where the bit framing protocol resides.  

In summary, the EIA/TIA standards (which are commonly miscalled RS standards) are the physical layer which include electrical signal levels and RS-232 includes the connector.  Layer two of the OSI model includes the bit and framing protocol, which is outside of these EIA/TIA standards.

== RS-232, RS-422, and RS-485 ==
=== RS-232 ===
The [[w:RS-232|RS-232]] standard title is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;.  This standard is for up to 21 circuits on a 25 pin DB-25 connector.  A circuit is a full definition of a signal from the transmitting device to the receiving device, but many now think of these definitions as pin labels.  One circuit (Signal Common) is required for all interface types.  RS-232 defines thirteen &quot;standard&quot; interface types lettered A through M. None of these match IBM's implementation of its serial port.  A fourteenth interface type, lettered Z, is reserved for applications not covered by types A through M.  All of the circuits on interface type Z (except Signal Common) are optional and are to be specified by the supplier.
[[File:RS-232 Network.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|RS-232 network.  One driver and one receiver per circuit.  Signal Common is required for all interface types.  Only Tx Data and Rx Data are shown.  The DB-25 connector is not shown.]]
In addition to the 21 circuits, the shield may be connected to pin 1, pins 9 and 10 are &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Reserved for Testing&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;, and pin 11 is &lt;TT&gt;&quot;unassigned&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;. This defines all 25 pins of the connector.

An interesting point with the RS232 standard is that the serial data is transmitted from the Data Terminal Equipment [DTE] to the Data Circuit Terminating Equipment [DCE] on pin 2, and this pin is defined as &quot;Transmitted Data&quot; for both ends.  RS-232 only defines connecting DTE to DCE, so when two computers are connected together this is outside of the standard.

Many think the RS-232 standard completely defines the IBM PC serial port, but this is incorrect.  The IBM PC serial port is only partially described by the RS-232 standard.  A common and incorrect assumption is that the RS-232 standard defines the bit protocol of the data being transferred asynchronously through the UART.  When configuring an IBM PC’s serial port, the parity, number of data bits, and number of stop bits must be set; therefore, many think this must be part of the RS-232 standard.   But, the RS-232 standard allows for synchronous communications, which is not compatible with the IBM PC serial port, as well as asynchronous communications, which can be.  It can’t be denied that the UART IBM selected for its implementation of the serial port is considered by many as '''''the''''' definition of RS-232, but these parts are not in the RS-232 standard.  

Another example of misunderstanding the RS-232 standard is the 9-pin connector.  RS-232 specifies two connectors, a 25-pin (DB-25) and an alternate 26-pin connector (pin 26 is &lt;TT&gt;&quot;No Connection&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;).  The 9-pin “RS-232” connector used for the IBM PC-AT serial port is not specified in RS-232.  EIA/TIA-574 is the standard for 9-pin connectors, and EIA/TIA-561 is a standard for 8-pin connectors that are commonly used with serial ports.

The RS-232 standard defines a DB-25 and a 26-pin alternate connector, the function of each of the pins in the connector (called circuits), and the electrical characteristics of the signals that are on the “circuits”.  For example, one of the circuits is “AB”.  Circuit AB is on pin 7 and is described as “Signal Common”.  This is a rather convoluted way of saying pin 7 of the DB-25 connector is used as a signal common.  Two circuits are for transmitting and receiving the serial data, circuit “BA” (TX data on pin 2) and “BB” (RX data on pin 3).  A number of circuits are for handshaking and other functions.  The RS-232 standard includes secondary serial data circuits (secondary TX data, and secondary RX data), three clocks (timing elements) for synchronous serial data transfer, Signal Quality Detector, and more.  Clearly not all of these circuits or signals are included in IBM’s implementation (very few implementations use secondary data lines or many of the other circuits).    RS-232 provides a list of circuits and says if you use a circuit; this is what it must do and it must be on this pin of the connector.  

RS-232 defines the voltages of these circuits, and the polarity of the logic generating the voltage.  When a binary 0 is being transmitted (i.e. when the UART is transmitting a zero), the voltage on the TX data circuit is more positive than +3V, and when a binary 1 is being transmitted, the voltage must be more negative than -3V.  Voltages between -3V and +3V are undefined by the standard.  There are other electrical characteristics in the standard, but you should be getting the idea that RS-232 specifies the connector, signals, and electrical characteristics.  It does not specify bit protocols.

RS-232 allows for both a transmit and receive circuit.  If both are implemented then the connection is full-duplex.  If only one circuit is implemented then the connection is simplex or one way.  Half-duplex RS-232 implementations exist but require all of the hardware and wires that a full-duplex network requires.  Half-Duplex RS-232 is usually limited by an additional communications device between the two farthest ends that are communicating.  For example; Two computers communicating with each other over an older modem.  The modem may be limited to half-duplex communications, and therefore the link between the two computers is half-duplex.  But, the RS-232 connection from the computer to the modem would still be full-duplex.  Other reasons that some RS-232 ports were half-duplex: some very old UARTs may be half-duplex limiting the system, and some very old computers drove the RS-232 drivers directly from the processor without a UART.  These old and slow microprocessors did not always have the horsepower to monitor the timing of both the incoming and outgoing bits, limiting the system to half-duplex.  

The UART connected to the RS-232 driver/receiver controls the protocol of the bits being transferred.  This protocol may include things like the start bit, number of data bits, parity and stop bit(s).  Again, this protocol is not part of the RS-232 standard, even though many engineers think of this protocol as “RS-232”.

=== RS-422 ===
The [[w:RS-422|RS-422]] standard title is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;Electrical Characteristics of Balanced Voltage Digital Interface Circuits&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;.  This standard specifies the electrical characteristics of a single transmitter and up to ten receivers on a single pair of wires.  RS-422 does not specify the function of the signal on the wires so the signal can be data, clocking, handshaking, etc.

RS-422 specifies the electrical levels of one transmitter to one of more receivers on a single pair of wires.  Typical UART communications with an RS-422 device, uses both a transmitter and receiver on a network of two balanced pairs of wires for a total of four wires.  Other standards such as [[w:EIA-530|EIA-530]] reference RS-422 for electrical signal levels, and include multiple signals on multiple pairs of wires.  EIA-530 signals include transmit. receive, handshaking and clocking which require all 25 wires.  Not all of the EIA-530 signals use RS-422 levels.  
[[File:RS-422 Network.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|RS 422 network.  May have multiple receivers.  Only one driver per pair of wires is allowed.]]
When two pair of wires are used for full-duplex communications, one pair is used for the interface generator (driver) to talk to the other device(s) on the RS-422 network, and the second pair is the interface receiver used to listen to an other device (not devices, since only one driver can be on this pair of wires) on the network.  RS-422 includes the voltage levels of the two wires when a binary 0 or 1 is on the RS-422 lines, but specifically excludes the logic function of the generator or receiver.  RS-422 specifies a number of other things, but they are all electrical values.  Any bit protocol such as that from a UART is specifically '''not''' included.  RS-422 is inherently simplex on each pair of wires.  When a network with two pair of wires is used as shown in the diagram, the network is full-duplex.  I.e. the two devices on an RS-422 network can talk to each other at the same time.  RS-422 allows for multiple receivers on each pair, but only one driver.  This means that in a master/slave configuration, a master can talk to multiple slaves, but only one slave can talk back to the master.  This limits most RS-422 bidirectional networks to two devices that talk to each other.  

RS-422 does not specify any connector.  EIA-530 and EIA-449 are standards that specify a connector, pin assignments and RS-422 electrical levels.

Since the driver and receiver are differential circuits, the input and output voltages are specified as differential, but these voltages are also referenced to a circuit common. See the section on [[Serial_Programming/RS-485#Grounds_and_Grounding|grounding]] for a discussion of this &quot;extra wire&quot;.

=== RS-485 ===
The [[w:RS-485|RS-485]] standard title is &lt;TT&gt;&quot;Electrical Characteristics of Generators and Receivers for Use in Balanced Digital Multipoint Systems&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;.  This standard is for a network of a single balanced pair of wires.
[[File:RS-485 Network.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|RS 485 network.  Multiple nodes.  The diagram includes a branch line which is not recommended.  All nodes are shown as transceivers, but a node may be a generator, receiver or transceiver.]]
Both the generator (driver) and the receiver of all devices on the network are connected to the two wires.  A third interface is defined as a transceiver, which has both a generator and receiver.  All of the drivers and transceivers must be able to be &lt;TT&gt;&quot;made passive&quot;&lt;/TT&gt; or effectively disconnected from the network to allow other drivers to transmit.  The RS-485 standard includes the voltage levels of the two wires when a binary 0 or 1 is on the two RS-485 wires, but specifically excludes the logic function of the generator or receiver.  RS-485 specifies a number of other things, but they are all electrical values.  Any bit protocol such as that from a UART is specifically '''not''' included.  RS-485 is inherently half-duplex.  I.e. only one device can talk to the other devices on the RS-485 network at a time.  RS-485 allows for multiple devices on the two wires.  This means that in a master/slave configuration, a master can talk to multiple slaves, all of the slaves can talk back to the master, and every device on the network can hear every other device.  Implementing this requires a higher level addressing scheme so the data being transmitted goes to the correct device.  RS-485 does not specify any protocol, addressing scheme, or connector.  

Since the driver and receiver are differential circuits, the input and output voltages are specified as differential, but these voltages are also referenced to a circuit common.  See the section on grounding for a discussion of this &quot;extra wire&quot;.  

Please note that a RS-485 network is a single pair of wires, but there is nothing in the RS-485 standard that prevents more than one RS-485 network from being used by each device.  One RS-485 network can be used for the master to talk to all of the slaves on the network, and a different RS-485 network can be used for all of the slaves to talk back to the master.  This particular implementation of two RS-485 networks is often called 4-wire or full-duplex RS-485.  This implementation is very similar to a 4-wire RS-422 network.   The most significant difference is that more than one slave can talk back to the master.  Another implementation of two RS-485 networks is BitBus, which uses one of the RS-485 networks for bidirectional [[:w:Synchronous_Data_Link_Control|SDLC]] data communications (very different from asynchronous start-stop communications with a UART), and a second, optional, RS-485 network for RTS (direction control if a repeater is used).  

There is no collision detection in RS-485.  If multiple devices start to talk at the same time, the data may be corrupted.  RS-485 does not define a way for a device to detect that the data it transmitted has been corrupted.  This means that a higher-level protocol is usually used to verify that the data has been sent.  A simple example is a query/response protocol.  A master asks a slave for data.  The slave responds to the request providing the master with the information.  If the master does not receive the requested information, it asks for the information again.  If either the query or response is lost through a collision or other error mechanism, the data will end up being retransmitted.  Other error detection mechanisms can be used.  A CRC or checksum can be added to the end of the data being transmitted.  A receipt response verifying valid data received can be sent back to the master.  None of these protocols are part of the RS-485 standard, and implementation is up to the engineer writing the software.

== Physical Layer ==
=== The Wires ===
====RS-232====
RS-232 has one requirement:
*Maximum circuit capacitance of 2500pF
Its annex also states &lt;tt&gt;&quot;It is desirable for proper operation over the interchange cable that the DC wire resistance not
exceed 25 &amp;Omega; per conductor.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; 
Any cable that meets the capacitance requirement can be used.  For long cables, heavier gauge wire may be needed to reduce resistance.  Shielded cable increases the capacitance between wires and reduces the total cable length.

====RS-422 &amp; RS-485====
RS-422 &amp; RS-485 have one requirement
*&lt;tt&gt;&quot;balanced interconnecting media&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; - &lt;tt&gt;&quot;The characteristics of the interconnecting cable are not specified.&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;
Then both standards go on to say things that the cable should have/do:
*&lt;tt&gt;&quot;paired cable with metallic conductors should be employed.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; [yup, both standards really say the wire should be made of metal]
*The performance of the cable should work for the application. - &quot;&lt;tt&gt;maintain the necessary signal quality required for the specific application&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;
*Shielded cable may be used. (RS-422 only - The RS-485 annex says shielded cable may be needed for RFI/EMI or other purpose, but the standard does not mention the word shield)
*120 &amp;Omega; nominal. (RS-485 only)
*Other impedance cable may be used such as 100 &amp;Omega; nominal. (RS-485 only)

Note that the RS-422/485 standards call for &quot;balanced interconnecting media&quot;, not twisted pair.  In reality, the only viable option for long lines is twisted pair, but the standards do not require it.

RS-485 calls out TSB-89 application guidelines for TIA/EIA-485-A.  TSB-89 discusses wire types and effects, but TSB-89 also says &quot;&lt;tt&gt;The designer should empirically determine the performance of the media in these regards.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;

[[File:RS-485 Generator (Driver).png|thumb|upright=0.5|RS-485 Driver RS-485 Figure 1 Shows A and B connected to a receiver, but does not show a connection to C]]
RS-485 usually has a single pair of wires that both the transmitter and receiver are connected to. The data is sent down the wires differentially, or when one wire has a high, the other wire has a low and vice-verse.  In the RS-485 standard, one wire is labeled &quot;A&quot; and the other is labeled &quot;B&quot;, and the wires are twisted together (a &quot;twisted pair&quot;). This allows RS-485 to transmit over longer distances than RS-232.  Due to the confusion of polarity, some commercial device manufacturers have labeled the wire connections &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;, TX(+) and TX(-), etc.  See the section [[Serial_Programming/RS-485#.5BThat_Pesky.5D_Polarity|[That Pesky] Polarity]] for more information.

Figure 1 of the RS-485 standard is a diagram (not shown for copyright concerns) which shows the &lt;TT&gt;&quot;balanced interconnecting cable&quot;&lt;/TT&gt; as a transmission line of two wires.  In this figure the driver has two leads and connects via a stub to the transmission line at points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.  A third point on the driver shown as &quot;C&quot; is labeled as a common, but is not shown connecting to any wire.  There are two other devices in this figure (receiver and transciever) that are connected to the transmission line the same way.  Another figure in the annex (again, the annexes are not considered to be part of the standards) discusses connecting the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Green Wire Ground of Power System&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Protective Ground or Frame Ground&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; to &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Circuit Common or Circuit Ground&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&quot;SC Signal Common&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;.  The annex says this connection can be wired directly or made through a 100 &amp;Omega; resistor.  This &quot;third wire&quot; is not officially part of the standard and is discussed further in the [[Serial_Programming/RS-485#Grounds_and_Grounding|grounds and grounding]] section.

The primary difference between RS-422 and RS-485 is that RS-485 requires two wires in a single pair which all devices transmitters and receivers are connected to, and RS-422 typically uses two or more pair in which only one transmitter and up to ten receivers are connected to a single pair.  However, the specifications are different in many other places.  The annexes are also different.  RS-422's annex has a chart of empirical data using 24 AWG copper UTP telephone cable. POTS telephone cable's impedance is less controlled than CAT cable and can vary from 600 &amp;Omega; at lower audio frequencies to less than 100 &amp;Omega; at higher frequencies.

In the end, the cable you use needs to work for the application where you use it.  The cable's length, impedance, terminations, stub lengths, and data rate will all have an impact on signal quality.  120 &amp;Omega; cable should provide the best performance, but the 100 &amp;Omega; CAT-X cable may you have laying around may also work.  Even POTS telephone wire may work for many applications.  If the length is short enough and the bit rate is low enough, completely unbalanced loose wires will work.  Low capacitance cable becomes important when pushing line length and/or data rates to the maximum.

=== Line Length and Bit Rate ===
====RS-232====

RS-232 is very clear that is intended for a maximum bit rate of 20kbit/s.  The forward recommends EIA/TIA-530, EIA/TIA-561, and EIA/TIA-574 for operation at higher bit rates.  Section 1.3, Data Signalling Rates, states; this standard is applicable for use up to a nominal limit of 20,000 bits per second.  Section 2.1.4 discusses transition times as a percentage of unit interval (bit time) where the unit interval is between 25mS and 50uS.  This unit interval range works out to 40bit/s to 20kbit/s.

Section 3.2 clearly states that &lt;tt&gt;&quot;The maximum length of the cable is not defined&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.   Then it references section 2.1.4 where the maximum capacitance of the receiver side of the interface point, including the cable, shall not exceed 2500pF.  Then suggests seeing appendix A for guidance (again, the appendix states that it is not a formal part of the standard).  The appendix discusses capacitance and resistance of the cable, then gives an example calculation where the capacitance of the cable per foot (30pF/foot) multiplied by the cable's length, plus the capacitance of the receiver (100pF) gives a maximum cable length of 80 feet.  Try to find the capacitance of the cable being used (in pF/foot) and divide 2500 by it.  This should give you an approximate limit for that cable if feet.  If you keep the cable length at 70% or 80% of this limit you should expect the network to work '''with a true RS-232 driver and receiver'''.

If you are trying to get two ancient pieces of equipment (both of which use true RS-232 drivers and receivers) to work with a long cable, the capacitance limit in RS-232 may apply, but RS-232 does not take bit rate into account.  If they don't communicate, reducing the bit rate may make the two devices function together.

In reality either or both the driver or receiver are going to meet the more modern RS-574 requirements and none of the RS-232 limits will apply.  In this case your best bet for defining how long the cable can be is to try it.  Pull a cable between the two devices and see if they can talk to each other.  If the can't, try reducing the bit rate.  If reducing the bit rate is not an option, then you could try an RS-232 to RS-485 converter at both ends.  If you have to know that it will work before you pull the cable, then get the required length of the cable and move the two devices next to each other, connect them and see if they can talk.  There are numerous mentions of &quot;empirically determined&quot; in these standards.  Empirically determined means try it and see if it works.

There is a lot of folklore stating that RS-232 has a 50 or 100 foot limit.  In reality, if you are using relatively modern equipment (say 1990 or later) and a low baud rate, line lengths of {{convert|1,000|ft}} or more are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://aplawrence.com/Unixart/serial.art.html |title = Serial Wiring|year=1992|work=A. P. Lawrence |author =Lawrence, Tony|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====RS-422 &amp; RS-485====

The legends and folklore, not to mention the flat out wrong information that has grown around the line length and data rate limits inherent in RS-485 are truly astounding.  Articles, application notes, even data sheets from semiconductor manufacturers discuss both the data rate and line length limits in RS-485.  Sadly neither of these limits are in the RS-485 standard.

[[File:RS-422 CableLength-DataRate.png|thumb|Data Rate / Line Length chart from RS-422 Annex A &lt;BR&gt;(This chart is not in RS-485)]]
The graph at right, which is often shown in these app-notes, shows a limit of 1200 meters/DC at one end and 14 meters/10 Mbit at the other. This graph is not in RS-485. This graph is from annex A of RS-422.  (again, the annex specifically states that it is not a part of the standard)  Worse is the fact that annex A states that this graph is a conservative guide based on empirical data of 24AWG telephone cable (POTS).  The annex discusses the fact that many applications can handle greater amplitude and timing distortion, and that practical experience has shown that the cable length can be extended to several kilometers at lower data rates.  The graph in RS-422's annex A is not an absolute limit, but a guide to what should always work with cheap telephone wire.

RS-485 has even less information.  The forward to RS-485 references TSB-89 which has topics including data signaling rate vs. cable length, stub length, etc.  RS-485 also has some information in its annex (which is not considered to be part of the standard) RS-485's annex states: &quot;&lt;tt&gt;consideration should be given to some of the problems that may be encountered due to system configuration, data signaling rate vs. cable length, stub length, and grounding arrangements.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt;High data signaling rates and long cable lengths are possible, however, they are mutually exclusive. High data signaling rate applications should be limited to short cable lengths, while low data signaling rate applications may employ long cable lengths.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;  

Low data rates are primarily limited by the DC resistance of the cable (the effects of the DC resistance of the cable are made worse if a termination resistor is used) and high data rates are limited by the AC effects of the cable on signal quality.  There is no graph of cable length vs. data rate in RS-485 or its annex.

RS-485 discusses that it is used for devices up to 10Mbit/S, then says they need not be limited to 10Mbps.  It also states that &quot;&lt;TT&gt;the upper bound is beyond the scope of this Standard&lt;/TT&gt;&quot;.

All of the application guides and data sheets that say RS-485 has a limit of 1200 meters or 10Mbit are flat out wrong.  

It should be noted that RS-422 &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; limited to 10Mb and devices meeting the RS-422 standard do not need to operate over the full range.  Devices may be designed to operate at lower data rates for &quot;&lt;TT&gt;economically specific applications&lt;/TT&gt;&quot;.

That being said, what is the practical line length limit?  It depends on many factors.  Data rate is usually the primary factor.  Since the majority of RS-485 applications are driven by a UART, the data rate is usually below 100kbit.  In this case, POTS telephone wire should work for quite a long line.  If you are pushing the data rate above 100kbit or the line length above 1000 meters, you may want to use a better grade of wire.  The termination resistor has a significant impact on DC losses, so networks with long cable lengths may benefit from tweaking the termination resistor to a higher value.  Many cable manufacturers can recommend a 120 &amp;Omega; cable intended to work with RS-422 or RS-485. 

How fast can you go?  Maxim has an app note that says speeds of 50Mbps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maximintegrated.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/3884 | title = How Far and How Fast Can You Go with RS-485? | publisher = Maxim IC | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; are possible with the right drivers. (and the right cable, terminations, receivers, etc.)  Linear Technology claims 52Mbps with their LTC1695 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linear.com/product/LTC1685 | title = LTC1685 - 52Mbps, Precision Delay, RS485 Fail-Safe Transceiver | publisher = Linear Technology | year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If your intention is to push the cable length or bit rate to extremes, you should pay careful attention to the cable, drivers, and installation.  A conversation with a cable manufacturer can help to define the best available cable for your application.  In addition to using the best cable, there are many different drivers, receivers, and transceivers available.  Not all will provide the same performance.  The RS-485 standard requires a minimum performance, but many drivers exceed this performance and some have quirks such as slew rate limiting.  Slew rate limiting reduces the maximum bit rate, but will improve signal quality on networks with poor characteristics.  And, of course, the installation can make or break the network performance.  Stub length, termination, and biasing resistors can have a significant impact on the performance of the network.  A higher value termination resistor will reduce the DC losses associated with extreme line lengths, allowing for much longer line lengths at the cost of ringing on the wires. The ringing occurs when the data transitions, and will eventually damp out.  This means that low data rates can handle an improperly terminated (or even unterminated) cable better than high data rates.  

Some thought should be given to changing the technology for really long line lengths.  A kilometer of POTS cable can cost a lot, two kilometers twice as much.  Add the cost of pulling the cable and long networks can get very expensive.  A gateway that converts the RS-485 data to run over an existing network may cost less in the end than running a kilometer of cable.

RS-485 gives limits for rise and fall times as 0.3 of the unit interval.  This is a ratio of rise/fall time to bit width.  There are no limits given in time units, so there is no minimum or maximum bit rate associated with RS-485.

=== Grounds and Grounding ===
Grounding of the RS-485 hardware is another contentious issue.  The reason for this is that different installations have different grounding requirements.  No one solution can fit all installations.

The ground between RS-485 devices is often called a &quot;Third Wire&quot;.  This Chipkin article &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chipkin.com/articles/rs485-cables-why-you-need-3-wires-for-2-two-wire-rs485 &quot;RS485 Cables – Why you need 3 wires for 2 (two) wire RS485&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; has some good information on this &quot;third wire&quot;, but notice in the comments how there is disagreement on exactly when this wire is needed.

The RS-485 standard has very little to say about grounding.  The standard defines the common-mode voltage as being referenced to ground, it defines a term &quot;&lt;tt&gt;ground potential difference&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; as the difference in the signal ground between the driver and receiver, but it does not say that this is earth ground or just a a third wire common.  It shows a diagram of the driver and receiver with two wires connecting them, and a third point &quot;C&quot; that is called a common.  There is no wire shown connecting this third point between driver and receiver.  
Then the annex states that consideration should be given to various things including grounding arrangements.  Section A.4 of the annex defines two optional grounding arrangements.  The first is to connect the signal common of the driver/receiver circuit to &quot;&lt;tt&gt;protective or frame ground&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; through a 100 &amp;Omega; resistor.  This frame ground is shown as being connected to the &quot;&lt;tt&gt;green wire ground of power system&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;, more commonly called earth ground.  The second optional grounding arrangement is to connect the circuit common directly to the frame ground without a resistor.  The annex also says that certain applications may cause the resistor to fail so the installation must allow access for inspection and replacement.  I.e., you should be able to change the resistor when it goes up in smoke.

Since the annex admits that the installation can cause physical damage to components, it is not surprising that grounding is a contentious subject.  Anyone who has seen a device go up in smoke, is likely to be very vehement on how to, and how not to wire grounds.  The problem with this is that a particular method of grounding may be required for one installation to function and cause damage at another.

RS-485 requires the driver and receiver to function if the common mode voltage is shifted against circuit common (see the section on voltages for more information).  If the circuit common is truly isolated from earth ground, then scuffing your feet on carpet (to pick up an ESD charge) and touching the wires can cause the wires to shift potential several thousand volts.  In practice this type of isolation is rare.  It would require an isolated power supply and optically isolated drivers.  Or a couple of laptops running on battery power and sitting on an insulated surface.

Consider three different installations.  
[[File:RS-485 Communications 1-Computer 1-Laptop.png|thumb|RS-485 communications between two computers.  One computer is a desktop and one is a battery powered laptop.]]The first is a desktop computer talking to a laptop.  The desktop is connected to earth ground and the RS-485 port is referenced to the earth ground.  The laptop is battery powered and has no connection to earth ground.  An ESD shock to the laptop could cause the two RS-485 wires to increase in potential against the earth ground to several thousand volts.  This far exceeds the RS-485 allowed voltage of +12V and -7V.  If the desktop's port is ESD protected damage may not occur, but there is no guarantee.  This installation should have a third wire connecting the earth ground/circuit common from the desktop PC to the laptop's RS-485 port circuit common.  Since the laptop has no connection to earth ground, there will normally be little current through this third wire.

[[File:RS-485 Communications 2-Computers Close.png|thumb|RS-485 communications between two computers.  The computers are close to each other and the earth grounds have little potential difference between them.]]A second installation has two desk top PC's sitting very close to each other.  The RS-485 circuit common is connected to earth ground in both PC's.  Since the PC's are sitting near each other, they are on the same power circuit,the difference in the earth ground between the two computers is very small.  This installation does not require a third wire, but including one will not hurt.

[[File:RS-485 Communications 2-Computers Seperated.png|thumb|RS-485 communications between two computers.  The computers are separated by a long distance of wire and one of the computers has a ARC furnace near it creating a significant ground potential difference.]]The third installation uses the same two computers as the second example, but they are separated by several thousand feet of wire, and one of the computers is sitting next to an arc furnace that draws several thousand amps when operating.  The difference in earth ground potentials between these two computers may be tens or even hundreds of volts.  This difference in earth ground may be high enough to cause damage to the RS-485 devices, but connecting a third wire between their circuit commons/earth grounds would try to bypass the power earth common (this is often called a ground loop) causing excessive current in the third wire.  The current could cause damage to the wire, or the RS-485 port.  This third example would be a good place to use an isolating RS-485 transceiver.  Isolated transceivers are available in IC packages, modules, and gateways.

A shielded cable may be used.  A shield is sometimes used to reduce EMI in twisted pair, but will reduce the maximum RS-485 operational line length.  The annex of RS-485 states that &quot;&lt;tt&gt;When employed, the shield shall be connected only to frame ground at either or both ends depending on the specific application.&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; Shields usually have a lot more copper (and/or aluminum) than a single wire and can therefore carry a lot more current.  A thousand feet of 24 AWG wire is in the 26&amp;Omega; range.  This helps to limit the current through the &quot;third&quot; wire.  A 10V difference in earth ground potential would only have less than 0.4 amps of current &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;{10V \over 26} = 0.385A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; A shield could have less than 1 &amp;Omega; of resistance.  Using the shield to connect the two earth grounds could result in 10+ amps with a 10V difference.  Beware of ground loops when using the shield as the third wire.

=== Voltages ===
==== RS-232 ====
RS-232 typically has a transmit wire, receive wire and signal common wire.  It may also have flow control signal wires.  The voltages are measured at the signal wire and are referenced to signal common.  

The driver must output between 5V and 15V in magnitude into a load of 3k&amp;Omega; to 7k&amp;Omega;. The driver must not be able to output more than 100mA when shorted to any other conductor in the cable, must not be able to output more than 25V and must be able to handle an open circuit, or a short to any other conductor in the cable.  

The receiver is designed to operate with voltages between 3 and 15V in magnitude (i.e. both positive and negative voltages) but must be able to handle an input of 25V without damage.  

When a binary 1 is transmitted, the signal is spacing, and the voltage on the wire must be more negative than -3V.
When a binary 0 is transmitted, the signal is marking, and the voltage on the wire must be more positive than +3V.
The region between -3V and +3V is undefined.

Older driver IC's commonly used +12V and -12V as their voltage sources.  This limited the open circuit voltage to &amp;plusmn;12V.  Lower voltage drivers are now available to allow operation from battery powered devices and the open circuit voltages may be lower than &amp;plusmn;12V.  If so, these drivers could be RS-232 but could also be EIA/TIA-574.

Note that the logic function of the driver and receiver '''are''' defined.  When the driver is transmitting a 1 (from the UART for example), then the voltage on the wire must be less than -3V.  This is considered &quot;inverting&quot; logic by many engineers.

==== RS-422 ====
RS-422 has one or more pair of wires.  Each pair has two wires to which a driver and one more receivers are connected.  The signals appear differentially on two wires of each pair.  When the driver increases the voltage on one of the wires, it simultaneously decreases the voltage on the other wire resulting in a differential voltage between the two wires.  When 5V drivers are used, the driver typically pulls one wire to circuit common, and the other wire to 5V (and vice-verse for the opposite data). This does not mean the voltages will reach 0V or 5V on these wires.  The exact voltages will depend on the driver, the loading, biasing, termination, and any shift in ground potential between the driver and receiver.

RS-422 voltages are referenced differentially from one wire to the other, but are also referenced to circuit common.  This means the specification has a differential voltage requirement, and a common mode voltage requirement.

The driver must produce a differential voltage between 2 and 10V into a loaded/terminated cable.  The driver must present a low impedance to the cable of 100 &amp;Omega; or less.  The driver must not exceed 10V differential, or 6V common mode (outputs relative to circuit common).  The driver's output current when shorted to circuit common must be limited to 150mA.

The receiver must have an input impedance of greater than 4k &amp;Omega; and function over a common mode voltage range of -7V to +7V.  The receiver must recognize a differential voltage of greater than &amp;plusmn;200mV as a binary value.  Voltages of less than 200mV are undefined.  The receiver may recognize any voltage between -200mV and +200mV as a binary value, but different manufacturers can set the threshold where ever they want.  Hysteresis is typically incorporated in the receiver to improve noise margin, but is not required.  The maximum voltage between either of the wires and circuit common must not exceed 10V absolute magnitude, and voltages up to 10V cannot cause damage to the receiver.

The driver has the capability of driving 10 receivers of 4k impedance, but the actual number that can be driven depend on the actual input impedance of the receivers, bit rate, wire, stub lengths, biasing and termination of the network.

The logic function of the driver and receiver are '''not''' defined, only the binary state of the differential voltages on the wires.  A binary 1 may (or may not) be inverted by the driver before it is output.  See the section on polarity for more information.

==== RS-485 ====
RS-485 has a single pair of wires.  The signals appear differentially on these two wires.  For each device interface, the driver and receiver are both connected to these two wires. The driver must be electrically disconnected or &lt;TT&gt;&quot;made passive&quot;&lt;/TT&gt; when it is not transmitting.  When the driver increases the voltage on one of the wires, it simultaneously decreases the voltage on the other wire resulting in a differential voltage between the two wires.  When 5V drivers are used, the driver typically pulls one wire to common, and the other wire to 5V (and vice-versa for the opposite data). This does not mean the voltages will reach 0V or 5V on these wires.  The exact voltages will depend on the driver, the loading, biasing, termination, and any shift in ground potential between the driver and receiver.

RS-485 voltages are referenced differentially from one wire to the other, but are also referenced to circuit common.  This means the specification has a differential voltage requirement, and a common mode voltage requirement.

The driver must produce a differential voltage between 1.5 and 5V into a loaded/terminated cable.  The driver's impedance (when active) is not specified, but the driver needs to be capable of driving 32 unit loads and a termination resistance as low as 60 &amp;Omega;.  [ this works out to 51.72&amp;Omega; if the unit load is really 12 k&amp;Omega;, but section 4.5.3 puts the total load limit at 54 &amp;Omega;.]  The driver must not exceed 6V differential, or 6V common mode.  The driver's output must be limited to 250mA peak output current, but may be limited to much less.  The driver must not be damaged when the outputs are shorted together, or to any voltage between -7 and +12V.

The receiver's input impedance is specified in terms of a &quot;unit load&quot; where a unit load is specified as input current in mA at a voltage referenced to ground.  It is commonly considered that a 12k resistance is 1 unit load, but unit load is more complex than than a single resistance.  The receiver must function with common mode input voltages [referenced to circuit common] over the range of -7V to +12V.  The receiver must recognize a differential voltage of greater than &amp;plusmn;200mV as a binary value.  Voltages of less than 200mV are undefined.  The receiver may recognize any voltage between -200mV and +200mV as a binary value, but different manufacturers can set the threshold where ever they want.  

The driver has to be capable of driving 32 unit loads. Since a receiver may have a loading of less than one, the actual number of receivers that can be connected depend on the unit load rating of the receivers, as well as the wire, bit rate, stub lengths, biasing and termination of the network.  The maximum number of receivers may be much greater than 32.

The RS-485 driver must be disabled [effectively disconnected from the wires] when it is not transmitting to allow other devices to transmit.  This means there will be times when no driver is connected to the wires.  With no driver connected, the differential voltage on the wires will depend on the termination resistor and biasing.  If there are no biasing resistors on the wires, they will effectively be at 0V differential, which is in the undefined region between -200mV and +200mV.  This can cause a problem if the RS-485 network is using a UART to transmit data.  The UART should function correctly if the receiver considers the undriven voltage on the wires to be the idle condition.  However, if the receiver considers the undriven wires to be a binary 0, when the driver is turned on and set to transmit a start bit, which is also a binary 0, the receiver will not see a transition, and therefore will not see the start bit.  For this application to work, the driver must transmit an idle (binary 1) after the driver is enabled, for some period of time before the start bit is transmitted.  

Some manufacturers get around this problem by setting their receivers input threshold to a slightly biased value, such as -50mV, instead of exactly at 0V.  When the wire pair is not driven, the receiver will see the input as an idle condition (binary 1).  If the transmitter is turned on at the exact same time as the edge of the start bit, the receiver will see the voltage change from idle to start so the UART will always see the first start bit transmitted.  This problem can also be fixed by adding bias resistors to force the line to idle condition when a driver is not connected, but this has to be done on a network basis, not a device basis.  Adding the biasing resistor to every device on the network can cause termination problems.  See the sections on termination and biasing for more information.

The logic function of the driver and receiver are '''not''' defined, only the binary state of the differential voltages on the wires.  A binary 1 may (or may not) be inverted by the driver before it is output.  See the section on polarity for more information.

=== [That Pesky] Polarity ===
Before we discuss polarity lets take a look at logic levels and binary states. 

Logic IC's don't output a precision voltage.  As a general [[:w:logic level|rule]] when the voltage measured (with respect to circuit common) is &quot;high&quot; the binary state is considered to be a 1 and when the voltage is low the state is 0.  There are exceptions to this rule (such as differential logic and negative logic), but for the purpose of this discussion we'll talk about normal logic.  When you turn a switch ON for a lamp, the a voltage is applied to the light bulb and the bulb is on, therefore a voltage is ON and no voltage is OFF.  Digital logic usually uses the same convention (but not the same voltage) as the lamp example.  The exact voltage level that a logic device considers ON or OFF varies by logic type, but when the voltage is high (usually but not always approaching the IC's supply voltage), the output is on and a binary 1 is on the wire, and when the voltage is approaching 0 the output is off and, a binary 0 is on the wire.

In most digital logic a binary 0 is usually considered OFF and a binary 1 is ON. All three of the standards, RS-232, RS-422, and RS485, reverse this convention.  This can create some confusion.

A logic device may have an &quot;inverting&quot; and/or &quot;non-inverting&quot; output.  For normal logic when the input of a driver is a 1 or high, the non-inverting output will go high.  When the input is low or 0, the non-inverting output will go low.  The opposite is true of an inverting output.  When the input is high the inverting output goes low, and when the input is low the inverting output goes high.  The inverting output usually is shown with a bubble on it and the non-inverting output does not have the bubble.  An inverting output is sometimes designated with a &quot;-&quot; and the non-inverting output is sometimes designated with a &quot;+&quot;.

When the input of an RS-485 driver goes high, one of the outputs will go high in reference to circuit common and the other will go low.  The exact voltage of high and low are not usually specified, rather a voltage difference between the two outputs is specified.  But, since one of outputs goes high when the input goes high, it is often called the &quot;non-inverting&quot; output.  Conversely, the output that goes low when the input goes high is often called the &quot;inverting&quot; output.  RS-485 does not use the terms inverting or non-inverting nor have the &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; label on the interface points.  RS-485 simply defines the interface connection points as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; and shows the voltage relationship between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; for the binary states of the two wires, '''not the binary state of the input to the driver'''.

|}
RS-485 figure 2 shows a generator (driver) with two interface connection points labeled &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.  The third point C is discussed in the section on grounding.  Figure 1 also shows the output signaling waveforms, redrawn here in color for clarity.  It also very clearly states &lt;tt&gt;&quot;The logic function of the generator and the receiver is beyond the scope of this Standard, and therefore is not defined.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; 

Now look at the driver schematic symbol you should notice that the &quot;A&quot; output is the non-inverting output and the &quot;B&quot; output is inverting.  You would think that this would mean that when a 1 is being transmitted &quot;A&quot; would be high and &quot;B&quot; would be low.  Yet the signaling waveforms in Figure 1 of the RS-485 standard clearly show that when a binary 0 (ON) is on the wires, the voltage on wire &quot;A&quot; is positive with respect to &quot;B&quot; and conversely, when a binary 1 (OFF) is on the wires, the voltage on wire &quot;A&quot; is negative with respect to &quot;B&quot;.  In other words, to make the symbol match the waveform, the input to the schematic symbol would have to be reversed or inverted at the input to the symbol.  Also note that the symbol does not show the input.  That's because &lt;tt&gt;&quot;The logic function of the generator and the receiver is beyond the scope of this Standard, and therefore is not defined.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;

Stating that the logic function of the generator and receiver are not defined, then showing a symbol and signaling waveform of the wires that are inverted, adds more confusion.  

When an RS-485 driver gets its data directly from a UART (with no added inversion), you would expect the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; wires to match the voltages in the RS-485 standard for the voltages on the wires, but they will not (unless the driver inverts its input).  They will be exactly backwards.  

If both the driver and receiver of the devices on the network have no inversion, (or If both the driver and receiver of the devices are inverted) then the A and B lines of the devices should be connected together.  But some device manufacturers match their A and B labels to the symbol (no inversion), and some match to the signaling waveform (inverted).  

RS-232 states that when a binary 0 (aka ON or Spacing) is being transmitted (from the logic such as a UART) the voltage on the TXData wire is greater than +3V (referenced to the signal common wire).  When a binary 1 (aka OFF or marking) is being transmitted the voltage on TXData must be less than -3V.  Some consider this to be inverting since a 0 is the highest voltage and a 1 is the lowest voltage.  This is not technically correct since RS-232 requires the use of voltages outside those of normal logic, but the [[Media:RS232-UART Oscilloscope Screenshot.png|input and output]] of an RS-232 driver look inverted on an oscilloscope, and most data sheets show the driver as an inverter.  

If an RS-232 to RS-485 converter is used, things start to get even more murky.  If the voltage on the RS-232 line is positive or high, the signal is a binary 0.  Should this signal be inverted back to a low?  See the instructions on the converter you are using.  You may not have the polarity you expect.

Finally there is confusion from the IC manufacturers.  The datasheet for Linear Technology's LTC2850 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linear.com/docs/19198 | title = LTC2850 Datasheet | publisher = Linear Technology | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that when pin 4 (DI - the driver's input pin) is high, the output voltage on pin 6 (The A output) will be positive with respect to pin 7 (the B output).

|}

This is exactly what is expected from the symbol of RS-485 figure 1, and exactly backwards from what is expected based on the  signaling waveform of RS-485 figure 1, because this driver does not invert its input.  Many other IC manufacturers make a drop in replacement for this IC, and many of them (such as the MAX483) use the same labeling.  Some manufacturers have avoided this confusion by changing the name of the output pins labels to X and Y.  There are two things to be noted about this so called &quot;pin mislabeling&quot;.  The first is that RS-485 denies any control of the logic function of the generator and receiver.  The other is that the IC manufacturer's datasheets never state that the IC pin A is the same thing as RS-485's wire &quot;A&quot;.  While it may seem quite rational to assume that an RS-485 driver IC pin that is labeled A matches the RS-485 standard's wire &quot;A&quot;, this is actually an assumption and is in fact not the case.  The designer has to define the logic function of the driver and receiver.

So how do you know what pin is &quot;A&quot; and what is &quot;B&quot;?  Well if you paid attention to the previous discussion, there is no way.  The result of this is that many RS-232 to RS-485 converters have changed the labeling of their devices to (+)/(-), or TD+/TD-, etc.  The good news is that you won't damage the device if you connect it backwards.  If you are running asynchronous start/stop communications (a UART) across the RS-485 wires, it simply will not work if the polarity is backwards.  It is usually a fairly simple matter to reverse the wires and test the communications again.  This is a good first step if the communications are not working.  Of course, many other problems can cause a communications failure and these will be addressed in the troubleshooting section.

For those designing or documenting a system, it is a bit more complicated than simply swapping pins.  The &quot;pin mislabeling&quot; discussed above is a good starting point.  Even though the logic function of the generator and receiver are not defined by RS-485, it makes sense to many engineers to have a binary 1 appear on the RS-485 wires when a binary 1 is being transmitted.  You can design the system to accomplish this if you pay careful attention to logic function of the driver being used, as well as the labeling of the terminal on the device.  Don't assume that the A and B pins of an IC match the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of the RS-485 standard because they can't.  '''The standard does not define the logic function of the driver or receiver'''.  And the symbol in RS-485 figure 1 is opposite of the output signaling waveforms in figure 1.

=== Termination ===
Termination is a less controversial subject than a misunderstood subject.

To understand how to terminate a network (the wires) you must first understand transmission lines.  This is too complicated a subject to go into depth here but a basic tutorial using oversimplified concepts may help. 

[Note that the diagrams below do not take into account phase shift or the ringing that can be induced from the inductance and capacitance of the wires, but this is an oversimplified tutorial and the basic concepts hold.]

A wire has both inductance and resistance.  How much of each depends on the wire.  A pair of wires has capacitive coupling and a very small amount of resistance between the wires.  How much of each depends on the wires and the insulation.  The inductance, resistance, and capacitance of the wires are modeled below.

[[File:TransmissionLine Balanced LCR-Model.png|center|thumb|upright=4.0 |  Balanced Transmission Line, LCR Model]]

Since inductance and capacitance can both be expressed as resistance (actually impedance - not including phase shift), the previous diagram can be redrawn as a purely resistive diagram.  

[[File:TransmissionLine Balanced R-Model.png|center|thumb|upright=4.0 |Transmission Line, Balanced, Resistive Model]]

It should be noted that this model is only valid for one frequency.  Increasing the frequency will increase the inductive reactance, thereby increasing the series resistance in this model.  Increasing the frequency will decrease the capacitive reactance, thereby decreasing the parallel resistance in this model.  For example; at a higher frequency the model's series resistance could increase from 0.5 &amp;Omega; to 1 &amp;Omega; (per wire) and the parallel resistance could decrease from 14.52k &amp;Omega; to 7.32k &amp;Omega;.  None of these values are an absolute, they are going to change with frequency.

Another thing is that different cables have different characteristic impedances at different frequencies.  POTS telephone cable varies from 600 &amp;Omega; at audio frequencies (say 1kHz) to 100 &amp;Omega; at 1MHz, while CAT-5 cable is around 100 &amp;Omega; over a wider frequency range.

There are a number of other things to note with this model.  The first is that if the line is long enough, an AC &quot;ohmmeter&quot; connected to the input of the model will see the &quot;resistance&quot; of the wires as 120 &amp;Omega;.  How long the lines have to be for this to occur depends of the values of the series and parallel resistances (and therefore the frequency being input).  The second thing is that this is effectively an infinite voltage divider.  The longer the wires are, the less signal there will be at the end.  Again the amount of loss depends of the values of the series and parallel resistance and the loss will increase with frequency.  This is why long cables and high frequencies are incompatible.

A final thing to note is that this model falls apart if the lines are not of infinite length.  A signal traveling down the wires will reach the end and [[:W:Reflections_of_signals_on_conducting_lines|&quot;reflect&quot;]] off of it (at the receiver's end).  It then travels back to the source and will reflect off of it (at the driver's end).  Since the signal is attenuated as it travels, the &quot;reflected&quot; signal decreases in amplitude until its level stabilizes.  This phenomenon will appear as [[:w:Ringing_(signal)|ringing]] on the edges of the signal.  If the data bit is sampled while there is ringing it may be sampled as an incorrect value.  This means that it is necessary to wait until the signal has stabilized before the bit can be sampled.

Adding a resistor to the end of the cable that matches the value of the cable's impedance will absorb the signal traveling down the line and reduce or prevent reflection.  This will decrease the amount of time to wait for the signal to stabilize, increasing the possible bit rate.  This resistor will also make any length of cable, even a short length, look like the characteristic impedance of the cable (120 &amp;Omega; in the model) to the driver.  This resistor is called a [[:W:Electrical_termination|termination]] resistor, designated as Rterm in the following diagrams.
[[File:TransmissionLine Balanced R-Model SingleTerm.png|center|thumb|upright=4.0 |Transmission Line, Balanced, Resistive Model, Terminated At One End]]

Since the RS-485 driver is &quot;made passive&quot; (disconnected from the wires) when not transmitting, and the other end of the cable can then drive the network, a termination resistor should be added to both ends.  The result of this looks like two 120 &amp;Omega; resistors in parallel (60 &amp;Omega;) to either end ''or to any point'' on the cable.  So it does not matter where the driver is connected on the cable, it &quot;sees&quot; a 60 &amp;Omega; load.

[[File:TransmissionLine Balanced R-Model DualTerm.png|center|thumb|upright=4.0 |Transmission Line, Balanced, Resistive Model, Terminated At Both Ends]]

This is why RS-485 states &lt;tt&gt;&quot;The use of a cable termination is normally required&quot;.&lt;/tt&gt;.  

RS-422 drivers are always connected and act as their own termination at the driver's end of the wire.  This will reduce the reflections on a RS-422 network to some extent, but RS-422 also recommends a termination resistor at the receiver's end of the wires (well it sort of recommends, depending on the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;data rate&quot;&lt;/TT&gt; or the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;signal rise time at the load end of the cable&quot;&lt;/TT&gt;).  The termination resistor should be equal to the characteristic impedance of the cable.

Any receiver connected at some point in the cable will change the impedance of the cable ''at that point on the cable''.  This will cause reflections both back to the driver and forward to other receivers on the cable.  Termination resistors will reduce the amplitude of this reflection back from the ends which will improve the signal quality.

A few other things to consider are:  
*Faster rise times will result in greater ringing amplitude.  Slew rate limiting drivers will reduce the rise time and decrease the ringing of an unterminated line.
*The signal will eventually stabilize (until the next bit transition) so the slower the bit rate the more time the signal will have to stabilize before it is sampled (usually by a UART).  This means that the lower the bit rate the less termination resistors are needed.
*Branching the cable to a receiver will cause secondary reflections which will cause more and unpredictable ringing of the signal.  Branching on an RS-485 network is always a bad idea, the cable should be daisy chained from device to device.
*Longer cables take longer for the signal to get to the end (and back and forth ...) so longer cables result in longer periods of ringing on the wires, and longer periods of time for the signal to stabilize.  The longer the unterminated wires are the slower the bit rate needs to be.  Therefore the longer the cable length, the more important the termination resistor is to improve '''signal quality'''.
*The longer the cable length, the more effect the termination resistor has on the signal level.  Therefore the longer the cable length is the more the termination resistor decreases '''signal amplitude'''.

If you've been paying attention, you may notice that the last two points are contradictory.  This is why some engineers try to ignore the need for termination resistors.  A termination resistor can increase the signal's quality (reduce ringing), but it will also reduce the signal's amplitude.  There is no way to say that a termination resistor will always increase the line length the network.

A final note on transmission lines is that the termination resistor '''should''' match the characteristic impedance of the cable.  If CAT-5 (100 &amp;Omega; cable) cable is used, the termination resistors should be 100 &amp;Omega;. Unfortunately RS-485 section 4.5.3 states that the total load between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; should be no less than 54 &amp;Omega;.  This limits the load termination and is an argument against using 100 &amp;Omega; cable. However, an incorrect value termination resistor will usually improve the signal quality compared to an unterminated network.  A 120 &amp;Omega; resistor on a 100 &amp;Omega; cable will dramatically reduce the ringing compared to no termination.  And since a 120 &amp;Omega; termination resistor can cause enough signal loss with an extremely long 120 &amp;Omega; cable to stop the network from functioning, a 500 &amp;Omega; or even a 1k&amp;Omega; termination resistor may improve the signal quality enough without causing too much signal loss for the network to function.  If you are pushing any limits, the termination resistor value has to be determined empirically for the individual network.  A decent oscilloscope that is isolated from earth ground (battery operated or powered by an unplugged UPS (if you're good enough with a scope you can also subtract channel 1 from channel 2 to see the differential waveform, or use a differential probe, etc.)) can be a very useful troubleshooting tool.

So are termination resistors required?  Per RS-485 it is &lt;TT&gt;&quot;normally&quot;&lt;/TT&gt; required.  In practice it is often not required.  Lower data rates have more time for the ringing to stabilize so the lower the data rate the less needed this resistor is.  The ringing will also stabilize faster in shorter cables.  If you run a data rate of less than 30kBit and don't need long cables, the termination resistors are probably not required.  The higher the data rate and the longer the cable, the more likely it will be that you have to add termination resistors.

There are a number of termination techniques, all of which may work great under a narrow range of conditions.

Bob Perrin lists the 4 most popular techniques&lt;ref name=perrin&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canarysystems.com/nsupport/ArtScienceRS485.pdf | title = The art and science of RS-485: Termination | publisher = Circuit Cellar | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* '''Unterminated''': This is the simplest system, but only works if both the data rate and length are low enough. A rule of thumb is that if the propagation delay of the data line is much less than one bit width, termination is not needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bb-elec.com/Learning-Center/All-White-Papers/Serial/RS-422-and-RS-485-Applications-eBook/RS-422-RS-485-eBook-graphics-embedded.pdf | title = RS-422 And RS-485 Applications Ebook | publisher = B&amp;B Electronics | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slew rate limited drivers will improve signal quality significantly with an unterminated network.

But, it should be noted that the network running in the reference was running at 300 baud and had other tweaks such as isolated transceivers and high resistance bias resistors on every node. It also had over 10 miles of wire (WOW).  This length of cable would be expected to have significant DC losses if termination resistors were used.
* '''One-way resistor termination''': RS-422 networks should only have one resistor at the receiver end.  Should also be used on RS-485 networks if the driver is always enabled.  
* '''Two-way resistor termination''': Works best on a linear bus, with transmitters anywhere along the bus.&lt;ref name=&quot;perrin&quot; /&gt;
*  '''AC termination''': While AC termination may work well on backplanes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.analogconsultants.com/hints.htm#BusTerminations Bus Terminations]&lt;/ref&gt;, others discourage its use on RS-485 lines: &quot;In practice, I have never seen [AC termination] do anything except butcher signal integrity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;perrin&quot; /&gt;

=== Biasing ===

Biasing has a number of uses on a RS-485 network, but first lets look at what RS422 and RS-485 have to say.

Biasing, sometimes called fail-safe biasing, is discussed briefly in the RS-422 and RS-485 specifications.  But biasing is discussed as an internal receiver characteristic, not an external biasing network.  In RS-485, the receiver's internal biasing will be such that the &lt;tt&gt;&quot;receiver will remain in the intended binary state when a differential voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;R3&lt;/sub&gt;) of &amp;plusmn;0.40 V is applied through matched resistors equal to 1500/nUL 1/2 to each input terminal, as shown in figure 13, with the input voltages VR1 and VR2 (and resulting VR3) to achieve any allowed input condition.&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;.  RS-422's requirement is very similar except the resistors are specified as 499&amp;Omega; rather than a ratio of UL.  This is not external biasing resistors, but a receiver characteristic of limiting induced differential noise due to imbalance of the inputs.

Fail-safe is mentioned twice in RS-485.  The first time is in the total load limit stating that the total load limit of the network including fail-safe provisions, should be no less than 54&amp;Omega;.  This implies that the fail-safe provisions are resistance external to the receiver.  RS-422 is similar (except they leave the hyphen out)  Both standards have a section defining why you may want fail-safe operation, but neither discuss how to implement it.

RS-422 and RS-485 state that some fault conditions that can be detected with fail-safe include:
* generator(s) in power-off condition
* receiver not connected with the cable
* open-circuited interconnecting cable
* short-circuited interconnecting cable
* input signal to the load remaining within the transition region (&amp;plusmn;200 mV) for an abnormal period of time (application dependent)

Which fault conditions are to be detected and what is to be done when a fault is detected is application-dependent.  Like much of the RS-485 standard, fail-safe operation is left wide open and implementation is not part of the standard.

So why do you need to bias the network?  Detecting the faults listed above is one reason, but biasing by itself cannot not detect all of them.  Nor can it differentiate between them.

For example:
An RS-422 network has an always active driver and receiver.  If the driver is transmitting asynchronous start stop data (from a UART and no inversion of the driver's input) the idle condition of the two wires will be a 1.  If you bias the network at the receiver so that the receiver see's a 1, you could not tell when the driver was disconnected (without additional hardware)  If you bias the network to force the two wires to a 0 (when the transmitter is not connected), the receiver will see a 1 on the wires (when the receiver and the driver are connected without an open in the wires).  The receiver can monitor the wires and indicate a fault if a 0 is detected on the wires for an extended period of time.  Determining which fault has occurred would take additional hardware.

This example of biasing would be a bad thing on an equivalent RS-485 network.  As mentioned above in the Voltages section; On the RS-485 network there will be times when the two wires are not driven by a transmitter.  The UART should function correctly if the receiver considers the undriven voltage on the wires to be the idle condition. However, if the receiver considers the undriven wires to be a binary 0, when the driver is turned on and set to transmit a start bit, which is also a binary 0, the receiver will not see a transition, and therefore will not see the start bit.  Forcing the wires to the idle condition when no driver is active is the most common reason to need biasing on the network.

Biasing will also improve noise rejection.  RS-485 puts the voltage between -200mV and +200mV as undefined, but the IC manufacturer can put the threshold for a 0 and a 1 anywhere they want.  They will usually add some hysteresis to the receiver to reduce its sensitivity to noise, but biasing will decrease the receivers noise sensitivity. 

The following example is to bias the network to 200mV.  You may want to bias the network to a higher differential voltage to improve the noise margin.

[[File:RS-485 Biasing DC.png|thumb|RS-485 Biasing.  5V DC, but may be other voltages]]
This figure shows biasing applied to the termination network.  Normally you will want to use a pull-up voltage that matches the driver's supply voltage.  5V is shown in the figure since many drivers are powered by 5Vdc.  Other pull-up voltages can be used and it is not an absolute requirement that the pull-up voltage match the driver's supply voltage. 

The bias and terminations resistors form a voltage divider and several process can be used to calculate the resistor values.  In the following example the desired result is to get 0.2V of bias across R&lt;sub&gt;term&lt;/sub&gt;, and R&lt;sub&gt;term&lt;/sub&gt; is 120&amp;Omega;.  It should also be noted that this example ignores any current from or to the drivers and receivers.

The ratio of resistance will match the ratio of voltage. Since the total voltage is 5V and the desired voltage across R&lt;sub&gt;term&lt;/sub&gt; is 0.2, that leaves 4.8V across the bias resistors &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;5V - 0.2V = 4.8V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The ratio of voltage across the bias resistors to the voltage across the termination resistor is &lt;br&gt;(&lt;math&gt;{4.8V \over 0.2V} = 24&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;br&gt;  24 times the 120&amp;Omega; termination resistor is 2880&amp;Omega;.  Half of this resistance is in each bias resistor, so each bias resistor should be 1440&amp;Omega;.  So if R&lt;sub&gt;bias+&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;bias-&lt;/sub&gt; are 1440&amp;Omega; and R&lt;sub&gt;term&lt;/sub&gt; is 120&amp;Omega; there will be 0.2V of bias across the termination resistor.  

However the bias resistors effect the total termination resistance.

{{clear}}
[[File:RS-485 Biasing Thevenin.png|thumb|RS-485 Biasing.  Thevenin equivelant.]]
The next figure shows the AC Thevinin equivalent of the bias resistors with the termination resistor.  The 5V supply is going to have capacitors on its output.  These capacitors will act as a short to AC signals.  Therefore the total bias resistance is effectively in parallel with the termination resistor as a load to the cable.  The bias resistance needs to be taken into account when selecting the termination resistor.

The total load resistance can be calculated as &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{TotalTerm} = \frac {1}{{\frac{1}{R_{term}}+\frac {1}{R_{bias+} + R_{bias-}}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Using the values from the previous example the total termination resistance with the bias resistors is 115.2&amp;Omega;:

&lt;math&gt;115.2&lt;/math&gt;&amp;Omega; &lt;math&gt; = \frac {1}{{\frac{1}{120}+\frac {1}{1440 + 1440}}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is within 10% of 120&amp;Omega; and these values could be used, or you could tweak the termination resistance to 125&amp;Omega; which would give you a total termination resistance of 119.8&amp;Omega;.  Changing the termination resistance would change the bias voltage across the termination resistor but it would only increase to 0.208V.

In practice you will probably use 5% resistors.  Available 5% values for the bias and termination resistors would limit you to 120&amp;Omega; and 1.5k&amp;Omega;.  This would result in a total termination resistance of 115.4&amp;Omega; and a bias voltage of 0.192V.  Or you could use 130&amp;Omega; and 1.5k&amp;Omega;.  This would result in a total termination resistance of 124.6&amp;Omega; and a bias voltage of 0.208V.

Even if you use 1% resistors, the standard values would be 127&amp;Omega; and 1.47k&amp;Omega;.  This would result in a total termination resistance of 121.7&amp;Omega; and a bias voltage of 0.207V.  Since the tolerance of the resistors means that you will never get the ideal calculated values, don't sweat it.  If you can get within 10%, you can expect it to work.

These examples are for bias resistors that just barely meet the 0.2V differential voltage.  Lowering the bias resistor values will increase the bias voltage which will increase the noise immunity at the cost of increased current from the 5V supply.

These examples are for a single 120 &amp;Omega; termination.  Bias resistors would be required at each end of the network with these values.  A single set of bias resistors could be used at one end of the network, if the resistance was halved to 720 &amp;Omega;.  To add a little extra noise margin, use 680 &amp;Omega; resistors and you have one of the more common biasing networks used on a RS-485 network.

Another thing to note is that biasing may not be required.  Just because RS-485 says the voltage between +0.2V and -0.2V is undefined does not mean the engineer designing the receiver cannot define the exact voltage that switches from a received 0 to a 1.  Some RS-485 IC manufacturers such as Maxim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.maximintegrated.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/763 | title = Guidelines for Proper Wiring of an RS-485 (TIA/EIA-485-A) Network | publisher = Maxim Integrated | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Analog Devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/application_notes/AN-960.pdf | title = RS-485/RS-422 Circuit Implementation Guide | publisher = Analog Devices | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; have set the threshold of some of their receivers so that 0V differential on the two wires results in a 1 being detected.  This provides some noise immunity as well as resolves the problem of missing the start bit, but only for the receivers that implement this internal biasing.  Other receivers on the network that do not have this shifted receive threshold may require that external bias resistors added to the network.

A final note is that RS-485 receivers commonly switch at the +0.2V and -0.2V levels.  When the differential voltage into the receiver goes above +0.2V the receivers output switches to a 1 and when the voltage goes below -0.2V the receivers output switches to a 0. (or vice versa if there is inversion on the receiver)  Since the last bit from a UART will be the stop bit (1), then the transmitter is turned off (the differential voltage goes to 0V, but not having gone less than -0.2V), this should leave the receiver with a 1 being output to the receiving UART.  The first bit a UART transmits is the start bit (0) and the receiving UART should see this transition.  But this is only true if there is no ringing or noise on the line that switches the receiver back to a 0 at the end of the stop bit.  A termination resistor may reduce the ringing on the network enough that biasing resistors are not required.

=== Pinouts ===
====RS-422 and RS-485 [Common Application - Not Part of the Standard]====
The RS-422 and RS-485 standards do not include a connector.  Many connectors and pin assignments exist, but there is no standard.  Clearly a physical connection to the signal is necessary.  The connections range from screw terminals that bare wire is inserted into, to connectors such as a DE-9.  Devices with the same connector but from different manufacturers are probably not directly inter-connectable. Look at the data sheets from each manufacturer to determine what signal is on what pin and if the two devices can be connected either directly or with an adapter.

Other standards may define the connectors and signals on the pins of the connector.  For example; EIA-449 and EIA-530 are connector standards that reference RS-422 for electrical levels.  Two devices from different manufacturers that adhere to the EIA-449 standard should be able to be directly connected together.  But the baud rate and bit framing must also match.

[TODO: add connectors and pins from manufacturers such as NI, B&amp;B, ADAM, etc.  Volunteers?]

====RS-232 and EIA-574====
The following table lists commonly used RS-232/EIA-574 signals and pin assignments.  RS-232 does not define a protocol, but the protocol that is almost always transmitted on these connectors is asynchronous start-stop ASCII (data from a UART).

== Handshaking ==

There is no hardware handshaking in the RS-485 standard and in most cases it is no longer needed. 

The purpose of handshaking is for the receiver to tell the transmitting device to &quot;shut up, I'm full of data and will lose anything more you send me&quot;.  This stopped the data flow to the receiving end, allowing the receiver to process the data in its buffer.  When it was able to receive more data, the receiver would use the handshaking lines to signal the transmitter that it was OK to send more data.

When the microprocessor in the computer was very slow, it was so horsepower limited that this was necessary.  The stop sending / OK to send lines would toggle on and off with every byte sent.  When the microprocessor's in the computers and peripheral's speed was increased to a blistering 1MHz, handshaking was still necessary, but the stop sending / OK to send lines would toggle less often.  The advent of UARTs with buffers helped even more.  The processor could check the level of the buffer and only had to stop the data when the buffer was too full.  Modern processors are fast enough that handshaking is rarely needed.

If handshaking is required, it can be attempted using using X-On / X-Off  handshaking  protocol, but it is unlikely to work.  Since RS-485 is half-duplex, it is difficult for the receiver to tell the transmitter to &quot;shut up&quot; when it can't get a byte into the incoming data.  RS-422 is full duplex so it can use the X-On / X-Off protocol, if needed.

Some RS-232 to RS-485 converters originally used the handshaking signals such as RTS to control the enable of the RS-485 transmitter. The software would set the RTS pin from the serial port active before it would stuff a byte into the UART's transmit buffer.  When the transmitter was empty it would set the RTS pin inactive to disable or &quot;make passive&quot; the RS-485 transmitter.  This allowed other devices on the RS-485 network to transmit.  There are advantages and disadvantages to this.  An advantage is that this allows the software (if properly written) to take control of the network and hold it for a short time before transmitting the data.  This would ensure that the network has a period of marking before the start bit was transmitted, eliminating the need for a bias resistor to force the network to a marking state.  A couple of disadvantages are that the network is being driven without data on it so contention is more likely, and software complexity increases.

Another RS-232 to RS485 scheme is to monitor the data stream going into the the RS-485 transmitter and trigger a one-shot timer when an edge occurs.  The RS-485 driver's enable is controlled by the timer.  This scheme will automatically take control of the network when a byte is transmitted, but there will not be any guaranteed marking time so bias resistors may be required.  Another problem with this scheme is that the transmitter needs to stay enabled during the transmission of all of the data. If a 0x00 (eight 0-bits) is transmitted the timer has to keep the driver enabled long enough to transmit all 8-bits with no edges to be detected.  Since data rates on a PC serial port can vary from 300 baud (26mS for 8-bits) up to over 100k baud (0.08mS for 8-bits), the timer will have to either be limited in the baud rates that it can work with, or keep control of the RS-485 network for much longer than it needs.  The latter significantly increases the probability of collisions.

The entire subject of handshaking is obsolete with modern USB to RS-485 adapters since the PC's driver's and/or hardware handle driver enabling, and a modern PC can handle data rates much faster than can be transmitted over an RS-485 network.

USB to serial converters come with ADDC (Automatic Data Direction Control) to automatically sense and control data direction, making the handshaking control method obsolete. &lt;ref name=&quot;ADDC&quot;&gt;[http://www.usconverters.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=62&amp;chapter=0 &quot;Selecting the Right USB to Serial adapter&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[editors note, the preceding paragraph is legacy and the reference is unclear on a number of things and may not be a good citation]

Hardware handshaking can be added to an RS-485 network by adding extra hardware, software, and wires, but this is outside the RS-485 standard.  If this is required, it can be accomplished by any means desired including RS-485 drivers on an additional network, RS-232 drivers on extra wires, TTL levels, or really anything you can dream up since it won't work with any other RS-485 network except the one you are designing.

== Legacy ==
[All information below this point is legacy and very questionable.  It has been left in at this time to provide a starting point for future expansion of this article (and to show just how misunderstood RS-485 is)]



RS-485 is the physical layer for many higher-level protocols, including Profibus and other fieldbus systems, SCSI-2, SCSI-3, and BitBus.
&lt;ref&gt;
http://interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_RS485.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some RS-485 implementations (in particular, some Ethernet configurations) (also some Macintosh GPIO socket) use 4 wires (2 pairs) for point-to-point communication.
One of the pairs is dedicated to PC-to-peripheral communication.
The other pair is dedicated to peripheral-to-PC communication.
Each pair can transmit at full speed whether or not the other pair is transmitting ([[:w:full-duplex|full-duplex]]).


Typically the bit sequence is generated by a UART inside a microcontroller, which is wired to a RS-485 interface IC (also called a &quot;RS485 Line Driver/Receivers&quot; or &quot;RS-485/RS422 Transceiver&quot;).
Many manufacturers make such interface chips
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Connector_RS485.html &quot;EIA-458 Bus Interface IC Manufacturers&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
.
From there the RS-485 signaling typically travels over CAT-5 cable
&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bb-elec.com/tech_articles/cable_selection.asp &quot;Cable Selection for RS-422 and RS-485 Systems&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
.
At the other end of the cable is (typically) the same thing -- the connectors, the RS-485 interface IC, and a UART inside a microcontroller.

=== RS-485 in the Real World ===
Now being used commonly in the pro audio industry to control digital audio and signal processors such as the DBX driverack and other manufacturers equivalent products. Preferred to RS232 due to cheaper cabling run costs and the common availability of cables (similar to RJ-45).

When wiring a RS-485 network, always connect &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; to &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; to &quot;G&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;basics&quot;&gt;
[http://www.bb-elec.com/Learning-Center/All-White-Papers/Serial/Basics-of-the-RS-485-Standard.aspx &quot;Basics of the RS-485 Standard&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people recommend writing prototype software as if it will be connected to a half-duplex RS-485 network.
Then the software will work unchanged when connected to a full-duplex RS-485 network, a RS-232 network, and a variety of other communication media.

Many people recommend wiring things up on a prototype with Category 5 cable connected as point-to-point full-duplex RS-485.
The CAT-5 cable allows you to relatively quickly switch -- to half-duplex RS-485, or the 3 wires of RS-232, or a variety of other communication protocols -- without pulling any new cables.
The point-to-point full-duplex RS-485 network allows you to get the complete prototype system fully operational quickly, since it is easier to debug and more immune to certain common problems on other systems (noise problems on RS-232, turn-around problems on half-duplex RS-485, etc.).

Applications

==== Nonstandard Connectors and Wiring ====

[[Image:Photo-RJ11-MF.jpg|thumb|see the 4 wires in the socket? Localtalk only uses the outer pair.]]

The [[w:LocalTalk|LocalTalk]] network uses RS-485-compatible differential signaling on standard 4-wire RJ11 telephone connectors and cable.
LocalTalk only connects to the next-outermost pair of wires (the &quot;outer pair&quot; on a standard 4-wire cable).

The innermost pair of wires is ignored by LocalTalk, so the inner pair is often used for standard analog telephones.

''(Is there a similar standard for RS-485 on a RJ45?)''

RJ45 connections are used for RS-485 frequently, due to the ease of using the modular connectors and availability of cables and connectors.  A RS-485 interface will usually use pins 7 and 8 for the two data lines, since they comprise a twisted pair. This avoids conflict with both Ethernet (Pins 1-3, 6) and analog phone (Pins 4-5). Grounding can be problematic depending on the application. Often, use of shielded CAT5/6 cable can give an adequate signal ground, although this is not recommended.

==== Physical Limitations in Practice ====

===== Differences between RS-232 and full-duplex RS-485 =====
(stub)

From a software point of view, full-duplex RS-485 looks very similar to RS-232. With 2 pairs of wires -- a dedicated &quot;transmit&quot; pair and a dedicated &quot;receive&quot; pair (similar to some Ethernet hardware), software can't tell the difference between RS-485 and RS-232.

From a hardware point of view, full-duplex RS-485 has some major advantages over RS-232 -- it can communicate over much longer distances at higher speeds.

Alas, a long 3-conductor cable intended for RS-232 can not be switched to full-duplex RS-485, which requires 5 conductors.

RS-232 is only defined for point-to-point connections, so you need a separate cable for each sensor connected to a host CPU. RS-485 allows a host CPU to talk to a bunch of sensors all connected to the same cable.

===== Differences between RS-232 and half-duplex RS-485 =====

But a lot of RS-485 hardware uses only 1 pair of wires (half-duplex). In that case, the major differences are
* Each RS-485 node, including the host CPU, must &quot;turn off the transmitter&quot; when done transmitting a message, to allow other devices their turn using the shared medium
* The RS-485 hardware generally receives on the receiver every byte that was transmitted by ''every'' device on the shared medium, including the local transmitter. So software should ignore messages sent by itself.

A long 3-conductor cable intended for RS-232 can often be switched to half-duplex RS-485,
allowing communication at higher speeds and at higher external noise levels than the same cable used with RS-232 signaling.

RS-232 is only defined for point-to-point connections, so you need a separate cable for each sensor connected to a host CPU. RS-485 allows a host CPU to talk to a bunch of sensors all connected to the same cable.

Alas, half-duplex RS-485 networks are often more difficult to debug when things go wrong than RS-232 networks, because
* When a &quot;bad message&quot; shows up on the cable, it is more difficult (but not impossible) to figure out which node(s) transmitted that message when you have a shared-medium with a dozen nodes connected to the same single cable, compared to a point-to-point medium with only 2 nodes connected to any particular cable.
* Transmitting data bidirectionally over the same wire(s), rather than unidirectional transmission, requires a turn-around delay. The turn-around delay should be proportional to the baud rate -- too much or too little turn-around delay may cause timing problems that are difficult to debug&lt;ref name=&quot;basics&quot; /&gt;


===== Differences between RS-232 and both kinds of RS-485 =====

RS-485 signal levels are typically 0 to +5 V relative to the signal ground.

RS-232 signal levels are typically -12 V to +12 V relative to the signal ground.

RS-232 uses point-to-point unidirectional signal wires:
There are only two devices connected to a RS-232 cable.
The TX output of a first device connected to the RX input of a second device, and the TX output of the second device connected to the RX input of the first device.
In a RS-232 cable, data always flows in only one direction on any particular wire, from TX to RX.

RS-485 typically uses a linear network with bidirectional signal wires:
There are typically many devices along a RS-485 shared cable.
The &quot;A&quot; output of each device is connected to the &quot;A&quot; output of every other device.
In a RS-485 cable,
data typically flows in both directions along any particular wire,
sometimes from the &quot;A&quot; of the first device to the &quot;A&quot; of the second device,
and at a later time from the &quot;A&quot; of the second device to the &quot;A&quot; of the first device.

==== Alternatives to ASCII UARTs that drive RS-485 signal levels ====

----

I've been told that [[wikipedia:10BASE-T|10BASE-T]] Ethernet and [[wikipedia:SCSI|SCSI]] cables use a bunch of RS-485 pairs -- is that right ?
In the case of 8 bit SCSI this is not the case, the drivers are single wire with a 220/330 &amp;Omega; terminator at each end of the buss.  Half of the conductors in a 50 way cable are ground return wires.  This applies to the 8 bit version of the original 50 way SCSI interface.  Ultrawide SCSI does use differential drive but whether it is RS485 compatible, I don't know.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Porton. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Porton~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

[[Image:Australien Kelpie.jpg|thumb|A dog's waist should narrow after the ribcage ends, as this Australian Kelpie shows.  This is easier to see if you view the dog from above.  This dog has a nice tucked-up abdomen.]]
[[Image:Pug black 600.jpg|thumb|Some dogs, like this tiny Pug, have broader heads, shoulders, and hips than other breeds, but the bone structure should still be visible as in this example and all the rules still apply; however, people tend to spoil their [[w:toy dog|toy]] breeds and overfeed them.]]
[[Image:Pyrenean Mountain Dog 600.jpg|thumb|It is particularly important with very large, heavy breeds, such as this healthy Pyrenese Mountain Dog, to avoid obesity because they already have a tendency towards skeletal problems.]]
Dogs, like people, can become overweight if they eat more [[w:calorie|calorie]]s than they burn through activity.  And, just as obesity can cause health problems in humans, it can cause health problems in dogs, including early [[w:arthritis|arthritis]], heart problems, [[w:diabetes|diabetes]], and much more.  Because dogs' lifespans are so short to begin with, allowing a dog to become obese can significantly shorten its life. 

For [[w:purebred|purebred]] dogs, you can get an estimate of a healthy weight for the dog by reviewing the breed standards published for that breed. Typically, male dogs are slightly larger and therefore weigh slightly more than females of the same breed.  

For all dogs, including [[w:mixed-breed dog|mixed-breed dogs]] or purebred dogs whose height falls outside the breed standard, it is easy to determine whether it is of a healthy weight as follows:
*By feeling along its sides, you should be able to feel the spaces between a dog's ribs without by just lightly running your hands along its sides, pressing only hard enough to feel through the hair coat.  If you can't feel the ribs, your dog is obese and needs to eat less.
There should not be deep indentations between ribs, or the dog needs more calories (more or higher quality dog food).
*By feeling along its back, you should be able to just barely feel the vertebrae in a dog's spine when you run your fingers along the back without pressing (or pressing just hard enough to feel through the fur of a dog with a thick coat).
*By looking down on the dog from above as the dog is standing. The dog's waistline should be thinner than its chest and hips.  You should be able to feel the hip bones with a little fat overlying them.  (Sharp hip bones means your do is too skinny.)
*By visual inspection from the side. For short-coated dogs, such as [[w:Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] or [[w:Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahuas]], you should be able to just barely see the light outline of the ribs through the coat, but they should not be obvious.  In any dog, the abdomen should be tucked up instead of horizontal toward the rear.

Although all dogfoods include printed suggestions for serving sizes for dogs, you must adjust the serving size depending on the amount of exercise that the dog gets and how many other sources of calories the dog has, such as plentiful treats, table scraps after every meal, and so on.  As a rule, dogs should have less than five percent of their diet in treats and table scraps and at least 95 % quality commercial dog food.  Many pet food labels exaggerate how much food your dog needs. Ask your veterinarian for a more reasonable suggestion, or feed just enough to keep your dog in good condition, as judged by the criteria above.

If you do feed table scraps, avoid grapes, raisins, and chocolate, which are highly poisonous to dogs.  Never feed uncooked meat, as dogs are just as likely as humans to get food poisoning.  (It is very difficult to make a homemade diet as complete as a commercial diet... dogs need to eat mostly dog food.)

=Learning Objectives=

Upon completion of this chapter, you will 

* Understand the basics of RSS
* Understand the history of RSS
* Be able to construct a RSS 2.0 document using XML
* Subscribe to an RSS aggregator/reader

=Introduction=
RSS is a simple XML format used to syndicate headlines. It is now popularly used by websites that publish new content regularly and provide a list of headlines with links to their latest content. Content such as news feeds, events listings, project updates, blogger and most recently podcasting, video and image distribution can all be distributed by RSS. RSS feeds are also used by major Internet portals such as Google, Yahoo and AOL for people to personalize and have information that they care about delivered to them, i.e. MyYahoo.

==What does RSS mean?==
RSS is considered a name variously used to refer to three different standards. The three separate branches are the RSS 0.9 branch, the RSS 1.0 branch (which is based on RDF) and RSS 2.0, and the initials have been expanded into three different names: &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot; (RSS 0.9, 2.0), &quot;Rich Site Summary&quot; and &quot;RDF Site Summary&quot; (for RSS 1.0).

Several different versions have been developed by different developers under different names. According to XML.com, seven versions of RSS have been developed (see [http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html/ What is RSS?]). Because RSS is understood as a term referring to many types of syndication protocols, these various RSS protocols have sometimes been accused of being &quot;incompatible&quot; with each other (see [http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/02/04/incompatible-rss The myth of RSS compatibility]). This is an important issue for RSS reader/aggregator developers.&lt;br&gt;

==History==
The original version (version 0.90) of RSS was released by Netscape in 1999. Netscape developers were designing a format for making portals of headlines for news sites. After Netscape released the simplified version of RSS, they lost interest in developing RSS. However, another company, UserLand Software took over with intention to use RSS with their web-logging products and web-based writing software. While UserLand Software continued development with version 0.91, a third non-commercial group split off from the company and designed a new format based on version 0.90, which was a non-simplified version. The new format developed by this non-commercial group became known as version 1.0. In the meantime UserLand Software grew angered at the new 1.0 version, kept developing RSS and released version 2.0. Version 2.0 has become the leader and most widely adopted version of RSS. The 2.0 specification was donated to a non-commercial third party, Harvard Law School. Harvard Law is now responsible for the future development of the RSS 2.0 specification. Below is a table that describes each version, the owner, pros and cons, as well as its current status and recommendation for use.

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;0.92, 0.93, 0.94&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;UserLand&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Allows richer metadata than 0.91&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Obsoleted by 2.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Use 2.0 instead&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Use for RDF-based applications or if you need advanced RDF-specific modules&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2.0&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Extensibility via modules, easy migration path from 0.9x branch&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stable core, active module development&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Use for general-purpose, metadata-rich syndication&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=RSS structure=
A RSS document is often known as RSS feed and can have three different types of file extensions: .RSS, .XML and .RDF. All RSS documents must conform 100% to the XML specification begin with the XML declaration. To identify a RSS document, the top level starts with a &lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;rss&gt;&lt;/font&gt; element, followed by a mandatory version attribute that specifies the RSS version.  Sub-element to the &lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;rss&gt;&lt;/font&gt; element, is the single &lt;font color=&quot;Red&quot;&gt;&lt;channel&gt;&lt;/font&gt; element which contains a brief description of the channel.  Below is a sample of RSS(2.0) from the New York Times.&lt;br&gt;

A channel may contain a number of &lt;item&gt;s. An item may represent a &quot;story&quot; - much like a story in a newspaper or magazine; if so, its description is a synopsis of the story. The link points to the full story. An item may also be complete in itself, if so, the description contains the text (entity-encoded HTML is allowed; see examples), and the link and title may be omitted. &lt;br&gt;
Each RSS channel can contain up to 15 items. All elements of an item are optional,however, an &lt;item&gt; element must contain at least one &lt;title&gt; or &lt;description&gt; element. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=How does it work?=
RSS can be divided into two parts; the reader/ag and the feed. The reader is the program that reads and presents the RSS feed in an understandable format. The feed is the website with its RSS file. RSS feeds are typically identified on webpages with an orange rectangle icon, or an orange icon with the letters RSS written on it. To view the XML code, you simply have to click on the icon. 

==Creating an RSS feed==
A website author can establish a RSS feed for itself in different ways; either by doing it manually, by using software or by online services. Most large websites use content management software to produce their RSS feed.  Every time a change is made on their website, the content management software produce a RSS file of the changes with the new items added and old items removed.

==Subscribing to an RSS feed==
As a RSS subscriber you need a RSS aggregator. By feeding a RSS link, the aggregator will search for information you subscribed and display them. Say that you subscribe on the sport section in the New York Times; each time the NY Times publish a new sport article the article’s headlines, description and the URL will be displayed on your computer. Whenever you are online, the aggregator will search out and sort your list of interests and display them.

==RSS Aggregators==
RSS aggregator (aka RSS Reader) is an application that is used to collect, update and display RSS feeds. Below is a list of some RSS aggregators for different platforms that the aggregator will work properly on.

=Future of RSS=
The future of RSS seems very promising as version 2.0 has become extremely popular with the Internet industry and somewhat the standard of the RSS versions.  Yahoo recently released its new version of Yahoo Maps and the API is based on georRSS version 2.0.  This version of Yahoo Maps allows users to edit the information on the maps, which makes the Maps and Local Search products more effective.  RSS version 2.0 is also very popular with distributing podcasts to the subscriber base along with distributing content Google’s blogger product.  Furthermore, RSS is being utilized in an innovative way for search engine marketers to submit time sensitive content to the engines. The Mozilla Firefox browser already contains an internal RSS aggregator that allows users to view RSS news and blog headlines in the bookmark toolbar or bookmark menu.  This is accomplished through the Mozilla Firefox feature named “Live Bookmarks”.  RSS has quickly become a mainstream technology in a relatively short period and has definitely become a major player in the Internet space.

=Learning objectives=
Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to
* understand the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
* use RDF to define metadata for web resources
* include standards like the Dublin Core for your description
* explore how Adobe is handling metadata 
* create your own individual properties to expand your description

=Introduction=

==Concept==
The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is terminology used to encode, exchange and reuse metadata  in the World Wide Web. Metadata, structured data about data, includes any important type of information about a resource such as author, title, creation date or language. A '''resource''' is everything that can be addressed with a Uniform Resource Identifier ([http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2396.txt URI]). For example, a web page or a distinct type of document. RDF considers '''description''' as the act of making statements about the properties (attributes, characteristics) and inter-relationships of these resources. A '''framework''' is a common model to contain or manage the diverse information about a resource.  


'''Why do we not use XML to describe things?'''&lt;br&gt; 
* XML is too flexible. There are too many ways to describe things. For example, the name of a person (see code example). Each of these XML documents would map into a different logical tree. However, a query ,like what is the name of person x, has to be independent of the choice of the tree. RDF is different because it has a standard way of interpreting XML-encoded descriptions of resources which converts into one logical tree and thereby covers all possible reprensentations of a description.

 &lt;person name=&quot;Pete Maravich&quot;&gt;
or
 &lt;person&gt;
   &lt;name&gt;Pete Maravich&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;/person&gt;
* XML documents follow a schema. The order of elements is restricted, and documents are not extensible without changing the schema. RDF allows to list information regardless of their order or appearence. RDF is also openly extensible. This means if one receives a description about something or someone, one can easily add information without being limited to following a schema. This is a great advantage, particularly for annotation and metadata applications. Besides that, it is intricate to retrieve any semantic meaning from an XML document without knowing the XML schema.
&lt;br&gt;

RDF is an application of XML that enforces the needed structural constraints to provide unambiguous methods of expressing semantics. XML syntax guarantees vendor independence, extensibility, validation and the ability to represent complex structures. RDF extends the general XML syntax and model to be specific for describing resources. Furthermore, RDF uses XML namespaces that allow to scope and uniquely identify a set of properties. With namespaces that point to URIs, one can generate globally unique names for its resources. Unique names need no context to qualify.

==Brief History==

RDF is a result of several metadata communities coming together to build a robust and flexible architecture for supporting metadata on the existing web. The first RDF specification was released 1997 by Ora Lassila and Ralph Swick. Based on that specification RDF interest groups were established in the following years and RDF became a W3C recommendation &lt;br/&gt;([http://www.w3.org/RDF/ W3C RDF]). The potential of RDF was soon realized and once its use is widespread the impacts will be tremendous. Ora Lassila said the following ([http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-rdf-simple-intro W3C_NOTE_1997-11-13]).
&lt;center&gt;''Once the web has been sufficiently &quot;populated&quot; with rich metadata, what can we expect? First, searching on the web will become easier as search engines have more information available, and thus searching can be more focused. Doors will also be opened for automated software agents to roam the web, looking for information for us or transacting business on our behalf. The web of today, the vast unstructured mass of information, may in the future be transformed into something more manageable - and thus something far more useful.''&lt;/center&gt;

==Purpose==
Besides the human-readable display of metadata RDF is intended to enable the exchange of information between different applications without any loss of meaning. The effective use of metadata among applications, however, requires common conventions about semantics syntax, and structure. RDF imposes these conventions that make an unambiguous transfer possible. Application areas include resource description, site-maps, content rating, electronic commerce, collaborative services, and privacy preferences. Earlier one of the major obstacles of metadata interoperability has been the multiplicity of incompatible standards for metadata syntax and schema definition languages. However since RDF is a W3C recommendation and communities provide a standard vocabulary to describe things application designers and developers can create applications that allow metadata exchange in a standardized way.

=The Basic Structure=
==Statements==
With RDF one can make statements about resources. Below you can see an example of a statement that can be made about a web page. The key parts of the statement are highlighted:

&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt; has an &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;author&lt;/font&gt; whose name is &lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Pete Maravich&lt;/font&gt;.

In general a RDF statement is a triple that contains a:
*&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Resource&lt;/font&gt;, the subject of a statement
*&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/font&gt;, the predicate of a statement
*&lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/font&gt;, the object of a statement


RDF is based on the concept that every resources can have different properties which have values. A resources, represented by an URI reference, can be fully described by using properties and their values. Other properties for this web page could be:

&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt; has a &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;language&lt;/font&gt; which is &lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt;English&lt;/font&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;or&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/font&gt; has a &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;title&lt;/font&gt; which is &lt;font color=&quot;darkgreen&quot;&gt; Example_Title&lt;/font&gt;.

==Graphs==
An RDF statement is a structured triple that contains a subject, a predicate and an object. A set of such triples is called a graph where a subject is always a node, a predicate is always an arc and an object is always a node:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

[[Image:Basic_rdf_graph.png|Abstract RDF graph]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 1 - Abstract RDF graph'''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;


The set of example statements can be represented by the following graph:


[[Image:Rdf-graph1.png|Example graph]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 2 - Example graph'''&lt;/small&gt;


&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Subject&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;http://www.example.org/index.html&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;is either an URI reference or a blank node&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Predicate&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/Title&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;is an URI reference&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; Object&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;Example_Title&lt;/td&gt;
 &lt;td&gt;can either be an URI reference, a literal or a blank node&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==RDF/XML==

Natural English sentences and graphs that represent RDF's concept model are very useful pratices to understand the basics of RDF. However RDF uses a normative XML syntax called RDF/XML to put down and exchange graphs. Like HTML, RDF/XML is machine processable and, using URIs, can link pieces of information. But, unlike conventional hypertext, RDF URIs can refer to any identifiable thing, including things that may not be directly retrievable on the Web (such as persons).


The following lines represent the graph in Figure 2 in RDF/XML:

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

          xmlns:property=&quot;http://www.example.org/properties/&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.example.org/index.html&quot;&gt;
         &lt;property:author&gt;Pete Maravich&lt;/property:author&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt; &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.example.org/index.html&quot;&gt;
         &lt;dc:language&gt;en&lt;/dc:language&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt; &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.example.org/index.html&quot;&gt;
         &lt;dc:title&gt;Example_Title&lt;/dc:title&gt; 
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 3 - example_rdf.rdf'''&lt;/small&gt;

Let's examine the lines of code to get a better understanding of the syntax:

*{1} XML declaration, identifies the document as XML in the current version 1.0
*{2} Start of an rdf:RDF element, identifies the following code as RDF - also declares an XML namespace ''rdf'', all tags starting with the prefix rdf: are part of the namespace identified by the URIref ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' which describe the RDF vocabulary
*{3} declares an XML namespace ''dc'', all tags starting with the prefix dc: are part of the namespace identified by the URIref ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - the ''link'' defines a standard vocabulary of terms for metadata
*{4}  declares an XML namespace ''property'', all tags starting with the prefix property: are part of the namespace identified by the URIref ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/properties/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - this URI is fictitious and was chosen to indicate that one can create their own vocaburaly to describe resources
*{5 to 7} represents a specific statement about the resource ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' as seen in the examples - Line 5 declares the subject of the description - Line 6 provides a property element, the qualified name ''property'' is an abbreviation that represents the assigned namespace (line 4), property:author  stands for ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/properties/author&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - embedded in the property tag is the value(object) of the description as a plain literal
  
*{8 to 10} shows another statement - Line 8 again provides the subject - dc:language specifies the predicate for the statement, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/language&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - the literal 'en' is an international standard two-letter code for English

*{11 to 13} shows  yet another statement - Line 10 to identify the subject - dc:title specifies the predicate for the statement, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' - the value Example_Title is the object
*{14} ends the rdf:RDF element

Section 3 has covererd the basic structure of RDF and is intended to provide a fundamental understanding of the topic. The next section will cover some advanced structures and features of RDF.

=Advanced Concepts=
'''Structured Property Values and Blank Nodes'''

As mentioned earlier the object of a statement can be a literal, a blank node or a URI reference. The latter two give RDF more power because they allow to create complex structures, so called '''structured property values'''. For instance you consider describing the address of somebody. An address is a structure that consists of different values such as a street, a city, a state and a zipcode. In RDF one would identify the adress as a resource to allow a more detailed description. 


[[Image:rdf-graph2.png|structured RDF graph]]
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 4 - structured RDF graph'''&lt;/small&gt;


As you can see the value of the property ''creator'' is represented by a reference using the URI ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/members/1234&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. RDF statements (additional arcs and nodes) can then be written with that node as the subject, to represent the additional information like the name of the creator and his address. The property ''adress'' itself is represented by a URI, which allows a detailed description that is aggregated from further statements about the address.

However the URIref ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/address/1234&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' may never need to be referred to directly from outside a particular graph, and therefore may not require a specific identifier. The concept above could also be represented by using a '''blank node''' for the address object. Blank nodes were called anonymous resources, they have no URIrefs and no literals.


[[Image:rdf-graph3.png|structured RDF graph with a blank node]]

&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 5 - structured RDF graph using a blank node'''&lt;/small&gt;


In RDF/XML the concept of structured property values and blank nodes are represented like this:
&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

         &lt;dc:creator&gt;
             &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=&quot;http://www.example.org/members/1234&quot;&gt;
                 &lt;properties:name&gt;Pete Maravich&lt;/properties:name&gt;
                 &lt;properties:address rdf:nodeID=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;
             &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
         &lt;/dc:creator&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;rdf:Description rdf:nodeID=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;
         &lt;properties:street&gt;346 Broad Street&lt;/properties:street&gt;
         &lt;properties:city&gt;Athens&lt;/properties:city&gt;
         &lt;properties:state&gt;Georgia&lt;/properties:state&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt; &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 6 - structured_rdf.xml'''&lt;/small&gt;

Let's examine the lines of code that represent the new concepts:

*{5 to 12} describes the resource ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/index.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' that has  the value ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.example.org/members/1234&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' 
*{7 to 10} displays a way to abbreviate multiple property elements for a resource - usually a node has multiple arcs(properties) coming off and instead of writing one description for each property one can abbreviate this by using multiple child property elements inside the node element describing the subject node
*{9} shows how one can identify a blank node in RDF/XML - it is sometimes necessary that the same  blank node in a graph is referred to in the RDF/XML in multiple places - if so, a blank node identifier can be given to the blank node for identifying it in the document
*{13-17} displays the properties and values for the blank node identified in line {9}

=RDF applications=
==Dublin Core Metadata Initiative==

''The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative ([http://dublincore.org DCMI]) is an organization dedicated to promoting the widespread adoption of interoperable metadata standards and developing specialized metadata vocabularies for describing resources that enable more intelligent information discovery systems.'' &lt;br&gt;
Basically the Dublin Core is a set of elements that are used to describe a document. The goal of the Dublin Core is to provide a minimal set of descriptive elements that support and simplify the description and the automated indexing of document-like networked objects. Discovery tools on the Internet, such as the &quot;Webcrawlers&quot; employed by popular World Wide Web search engines use the metadata set. In addition, the Dublin Core is meant to be sufficiently simple to be understood and used by the wide range of authors and casual publishers who contribute information to the Internet. (also see [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2413.txt RFC-2413])

[http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/ Dublin Core Metadata Element Set] shows a description of all current elements defined in the Dublin Core. In the following example one can see an RDF document that uses the Dublin Core elements to describe an article in a magazine:

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 7 - cio_article.rdf'''&lt;/small&gt;

==Adobe's XMP==

The Extensible Metadata Platform is a specification describing RDF-based data and storage models for metadata about documents in any format. XMP can be included in text files such as HTML or SVG, image formats such as JPEG or GIF and Adobe's own formats like Photoshop or Acrobat. Adobe is making efforts that all of their applications will support XMP. However Adobe claims that ''XMP provides a standard format for the creation, processing and interchange of metadata'', the specification is not a standard.

'''XMP provides the following:'''
*A data model - as a useful and flexible way of describing metadata in documents.
*A storage model - for the implementation of the data model. This includes the serialization of the metadata as a stream of XML and XMP Packets, a means of packaging the data in files.
*Schemas - predefined sets of metadata property definitions that are relevant for a wide range of applications, including all of Adobe’s editing and publishing products, as well as for applications from a wide variety of vendors. XMP also provides guidelines for the extension and addition of schemas.


However XMP metadata vocubularly is relatively small,i.e. the ways to describe a document are limited. To overcome this issue Adobe is using metadata standards such as the Dublin Core and also allows users to define their own metadata vocaburlarly.

&lt;br&gt;
The following screenshot is from Acrobat Professional 6.0 ''Document Metadata'' feature. The description field allows users to define metadata, whereas the advanced tab shows an overview of the metadata. Under view ''Source'' one can see the metadata in RDF/XML.

[[Image:Adobe_xmp_functionality.png|500px|Abobe XMP example]]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 8 - Adobe XMP example'''&lt;/small&gt;

The RDF/XML based representation of the document's metadata can be found [http://mitglied.lycos.de/virtuoso5/xmp/xmp.txt here]. The property funFactor expresses the hilariousness of a document. It was included using the 'load' functionality of Acrobat Professional to test the addition of arbitrary metadata to the properties Acrobat Professional already knew about.

==RSS - RDF Site Summary==

RDF Site Summary (RSS) is also an application of RDF. Please have a look at the Chapter on [[RSS | RSS]] in this Wikibook.

=Creating an RDF Vocabulary=

As seen earlier in the chapter one can create its own RDF metadata vocabulary, despite using standards like the Dublin Core. This section is intended to show a very general approach in creating such a personal vocabulary. For a detailed description please see ''Practical RDF - Powers 2003''.

The first step in creating a vocabulary is to define the domain elements and their properties within the given area interest. This means one has to outline what kind of information about the resource should be described. Let's say we want to save the following facts about a resource:

&lt;table width=&quot;50%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Property'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;'''Description'''&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Title&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Title of the resource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Created&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Date of creation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Author&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Author of the resource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Status&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Current status of the resource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Subject&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Subject/topic of the resource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Format&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Format of the resource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;FunFactor&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;FunFactor of the resource&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The next step is to create a RDF Schema(RDFS) document for the new vocabulary:

[http://mitglied.lycos.de/virtuoso5/elements/1.0/myschema Here] you can see the definition for our desired properties. Using this RDFS one can describe the article seen above the following way:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

             &lt;rdf:Bag&gt;
                 &lt;rdf:li&gt;knowledge management&lt;/rdf:li&gt;
                 &lt;rdf:li&gt;technology investments&lt;/rdf:li&gt;
            &lt;/rdf:Bag&gt;
         &lt;/same:subject&gt;
         &lt;same:format&gt;text/html&lt;/same:format&gt;
         &lt;same:status&gt;active&lt;/same:status&gt;
         &lt;same:created&gt;2004-10-19&lt;/same:created&gt;
         &lt;same:funFactor&gt;3&lt;/same:funFactor&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;small&gt;'''Figure 9 - cio_article2.rdf'''&lt;/small&gt;

== Ethiopian Dishes ==

Most Ethiopian dishes are based on ''[[Cookbook:Berbere|berbere]]'', powdered hot [[Cookbook:Chilli pepper|red pepper]] that also contains a variety of other spices. Spiced, clarified [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] is also commonly used, as are a variety of other spices. Usually several dishes are served at a meal, and [[Cookbook:Injera|Injera]], a flat, pancake-like bread is always included. Stew or &quot;wat&quot; dishes are the mainstay of Ethiopian cuisine. They can be [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], grain or vegetable based, and are usually highly spiced, but not always hot. Perhaps because Orthodox Christian Ethiopians traditionally eat vegetarian food twice a week, the cuisine has developed a large variety of complex vegetarian dishes. The following are some of the most common Ethiopian dishes:

'''MEAT DISHES'''

''Doro Wat'' - [[Cookbook:Chicken|Chicken]] Stew
is a popular Ethiopian dish, Doro Wat consists of chicken stewed in a red hot pepper sauce. The chicken is cooked until it is quite tender and served with the bones in. Hard-boiled eggs are included in the stew, pierced before cooking so that they absorb some of the sauce.

''Siga Wat'' - Beef stew in hot red pepper sauce. The beef is cut into small pieces and stewed until tender.

''Beg Wat'' - Lamb stew in hot red pepper sauce. The lamb is cut into chunks, sometimes with the bone in.

''Kitfo'' - Raw, finely chopped spiced beef.


'''VEGETABLE DISHES'''

''Gomen Wat'' - Boiled collard greens with garlic, onions and sometimes, ginger.

''Mesir Wot'' - Lentils, usually cooked in hot pepper sauce. This dish ranges from hot to very hot. Lentils are cooked until they are quite soft and blend slightly with the sauce.

''Shiro Wot'' - A stew made from toasted and ground split peas.


'''DESSERT'''

Ethiopians do not as a rule eat dessert, although restaurants sometimes offer them as a boon to their non-Ethiopian guests.


'''DRINKS'''

''Tela'' - Unfiltered beer, often homemade. Beer in bottles is called &quot;bira&quot;.

''Tej'' - A Sweet honey-wine. It is often homemade and is of varying strengths, ranging from the very sweet and almost non-alcoholic &quot;''birz''&quot;, to the stronger and less sweet true ''tej''. It is available in bottles, but the taste does not match that served at home by an expert ''tej''-maker.

Coffee - Coffee originated in Ethiopia and drinking coffee involves its own ceremony. Ethiopians hand roast their coffee, often bringing out a pan of sizzling beans so that their guests can smell the aroma. The coffee is then ground and boiled in a clay pot called a &quot;jebena&quot;. The hostess will sit on stool in front of a low table and light chunks of incense, often myrrh. The coffee pot is left to rest until the grinds settle to the bottom. It is then poured into tiny cups and served with sugar. The hostess will make a second pot using the same grinds and the process will be repeated. Sometimes a third pot will be made. Coffee is served at any time during the day and almost always after meals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Actually, I think we have a field here.  Mod 2 arithmetic is the only other field with two elements that I can think of.  Are there any others?  Well, don't want to go off on too much of a tangent.

I need to prove at least some of the assertions made here.  The remainder can be left as an exercise.  The proofs are routine.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The logic of mathematics is pretty well developed compared with the logic of everyday life.  Mathematics is an in vitro environment for logic.

The mathematics of logic is kind of interesting.

I hope this book turns into something that deals with everyday life rather than mathematics.

&gt;I hope this book turns into something that deals with

To get your wish, all you have to do is make sure to include a section on Informal (plain language) Logic

λογος  - greek - can mean word, can mean reason, I think it can mean 'will' as well.

Satz - german - can mean proposition, can mean sentence.

Are Germans and Greeks making conflations, or are English speakers making distinctions without proper differences?

==  &quot;Hello, world!&quot; programs ==

=== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; ===

A common example of a language's [[wikipedia:Syntax_(programming_languages)|syntax]] is the [[wikipedia:Hello_world_program|Hello world program]]. Here is a straightforward Ada Implementation:

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|hello_world_1.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/pk|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Hello {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Hello;

The '''with''' statement adds the package &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO&lt;/code&gt; to the program.
This package comes with every Ada compiler and
contains all functionality needed for textual Input/Output.
The '''with''' statement makes the declarations of &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO&lt;/code&gt;
available to procedure &lt;code&gt;Hello&lt;/code&gt;.
This includes the types declared in &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO&lt;/code&gt;,
the subprograms of &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO&lt;/code&gt;
and everything else that is declared in &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO&lt;/code&gt; for public use.
In Ada, packages can be used as toolboxes.
&lt;code&gt;Text_IO&lt;/code&gt; provides a collection of tools for textual input and output
in one easy-to-access module. Here is a partial glimpse at package {{Ada/pk|Ada|Text_IO}}:

 {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/pk|Ada|Text_IO}} {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|type}} File_Type {{Ada/kw|is}} {{Ada/kw|limited}} {{Ada/kw|private}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
 
    {{Ada/comment| more stuff}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Open{{Ada/dl|(}}File {{Ada/dl|:}} {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} File_Type{{Ada/dl|;}}
                   Mode {{Ada/dl|:}} File_Mode{{Ada/dl|;}}
                   Name {{Ada/dl|:}} String{{Ada/dl|;}}
                   Form {{Ada/dl|:}} String {{Ada/dl|1=:=}} &quot;&quot;{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
 
    {{Ada/comment| more stuff}}
 
    {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Put_Line {{Ada/dl|(}}Item {{Ada/dl|:}} String{{Ada/dl|)}}{{Ada/dl|;}}
 
    {{Ada/comment| more stuff}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Ada{{Ada/dl|.}}Text_IO{{Ada/dl|;}}

Next in the program we declare a main procedure. An Ada main procedure does not need to be called &quot;main&quot;.
Any simple name is fine so here it is ''Hello''.
Compilers might allow procedures or functions to be used as main subprograms.
&lt;ref&gt;Main subprograms may even have parameters;
it is implementation-defined what kinds of subprograms can be used as main subprograms.
The reference manual explains the details in {{Ada/RM|10|2|title=LRM 10.2(29)}}:
&amp;ldquo;…, an implementation is required to support all main subprograms that are public parameterless library procedures.&amp;rdquo; ''Library'' means not nested
in another subprogram, for example, and other things that needn't concern us now.&lt;/ref&gt;

The call on &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line&lt;/code&gt; writes the text &quot;Hello World&quot;
to the current output file.

A '''with''' clause makes the content of a package ''visible by selection'':
we need to prefix the procedure name &lt;code&gt;Put_Line&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;Text_IO&lt;/code&gt;
package with its full package name &lt;code&gt;Ada.Text_IO&lt;/code&gt;.
If you need procedures from a package more often some form of shortcut is needed. There are two options open:

=== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; with renames  ===

By renaming a package it is possible to give a shorter alias to any package
name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ada/kw|renames}} can also be used for procedures, functions, variables, array elements. It can not be used for types - a type rename can be accomplished with {{Ada/kw|subtype}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
This reduces the typing involved while still keeping some of the readability.

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|hello_world_2.adb}}
  
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/pk|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Hello {{Ada/kw|is}}
    {{Ada/kw|package}} IO {{Ada/kw|renames}} Ada.Text_IO;
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    IO.Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    IO.New_Line;
    IO.Put_Line(&quot;I am an Ada program with package rename.&quot;);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Hello;

=== &quot;Hello, world!&quot; with use ===

The {{Ada/kw|use}} clause makes all the content of a package directly visible. It allows even less typing but removes some of the readability.  One suggested &quot;rule of thumb&quot;: {{Ada/kw|use}} for the most used package and {{Ada/kw|renames}} for all other packages. You might have another rule (for example, always {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/pk|Ada.Text_IO}}, never {{Ada/kw|use}} anything else).

 {{Ada/Sourceforge|hello_world_3.adb}}
 
 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/pk|Ada|Text_IO}};
 {{Ada/kw|use}} Ada.Text_IO;
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Hello {{Ada/kw|is}}
   
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    New_Line;
    Put_Line(&quot;I am an Ada program with package use.&quot;);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Hello;

{{Ada/kw|use}} can be used for packages and in the form of {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|type}} for types. {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/kw|type}} makes only the [[Ada Programming/Operators|operators]] of the given type directly visible but not any other operations on the type.

== Compiling the &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program ==
For information on how to build the &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program on various compilers, see the [[Ada Programming/Building|Building]] chapter.

=== FAQ: Why is &quot;Hello, world!&quot; so big? ===

Ada beginners frequently ask how it can be that such a simple program as &quot;Hello, world!&quot; results in such a large executable. The reason has nothing to do with Ada but can usually be found in the compiler and linker options used &amp;mdash; or better, not used.

Standard behavior for Ada compilers &amp;mdash; or good compilers in general &amp;mdash; is not to create the best code possible but to be optimized for ease of use. This is done to ensure a system that works &quot;out of the box&quot; and thus does not frighten away potential new users with unneeded complexity.

The GNAT project files, which you can [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=124904 download] alongside the example programs, use better tuned compiler, binder and linker options. If you use those your &quot;Hello, world!&quot; will be a lot smaller:

  32K ./Linux-i686-Debug/hello_world_1
 8.0K ./Linux-i686-Release/hello_world_1
  36K ./Linux-x86_64-Debug/hello_world_1
  12K ./Linux-x86_64-Release/hello_world_1
 1.1M ./Windows_NT-i686-Debug/hello_world_1.exe
  16K ./Windows_NT-i686-Release/hello_world_1.exe
  32K ./VMS-AXP-Debug/hello_world_1.exe
  12K ./VMS-AXP-Release/hello_world_1.exe

For comparison the sizes for a plain '''gnat make''' compile:

 497K hello_world_1 (Linux i686)
 500K hello_world_1 (Linux x86_64)
 1.5M hello_world_1.exe (Windows_NT i686)
 589K hello_world_1.exe (VMS AXP)

Worth mentioning is that hello_world (Ada,C,C++) compiled with GNAT/MSVC 7.1/GCC(C) all produces executables with approximately the same size given comparable optimisation and linker methods.

== Things to look out for ==

It will help to be prepared to spot a number of significant features of Ada that are important for learning its syntax and semantics.

=== Comb Format ===

There is a ''comb format'' in all the control structures and module structures. See the following examples for the ''comb format''. You don't have to understand what the examples do yet - just look for the similarities in layout.

 {{Ada/kw|if}} ''Boolean expression'' {{Ada/kw|then}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|elsif}} ''Boolean expression'' {{Ada/kw|then}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|else}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};

 {{Ada/kw|while}} ''Boolean expression'' {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};

 {{Ada/kw|for}} ''variable'' {{Ada/kw|in}} ''range'' {{Ada/kw|loop}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
    ''handlers''
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (''parameters'' : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} ''type'') {{Ada/kw|is}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
    ''handlers''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

 {{Ada/kw|function}} F (''parameters'' : {{Ada/kw|in}} ''type'') {{Ada/kw|return}} ''type'' {{Ada/kw|is}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    ''statements''
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
    ''handlers''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} F;

 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|package}} P {{Ada/kw|is}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|private}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|end}} P;

 {{Ada/kw|generic}}
    ''declarations''
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} P (''parameters'' : {{Ada/kw|in}} {{Ada/kw|out}} ''type'');

Note that semicolons consistently terminate statements and declarations; the empty line (or a semicolon alone) is not a valid statement: the null statement is

 {{Ada/kw|null}};

=== Type and subtype ===

There is an important distinction between '''type''' and '''subtype''': a type is given by a set of values and their operations. A subtype is given by a type, and a ''constraint'' that limits the set of values. Values are always of a type. Objects (constants and variables) are of a subtype. This generalizes, clarifies and systematizes a relationship, e.g. between ''Integer'' and 1..100, that is handled ''ad hoc'' in the semantics of [[w:Pascal programming language|Pascal]].

=== Constrained types and unconstrained types ===

There is an important distinction between ''constrained'' types and ''unconstrained'' types. An unconstrained type has one or more free parameters that affect its size or shape. A constrained type fixes the values of these parameters and so determines its size and shape. Loosely speaking, objects must be of a constrained type, but formal parameters may be of an unconstrained type (they adopt the constraint of any corresponding actual parameter). This solves the problem of array parameters in Pascal (among other things).

=== Dynamic types ===

Where values in [[w:Pascal programming language|Pascal]] or [[w:C programming language|C]] must be static (e.g. the subscript bounds of an array) they may be dynamic in Ada. However, static expressions are required in certain cases where dynamic evaluation would not permit a reasonable implementation (e.g. in setting the number of digits of precision of a floating point type).

=== Separation of concerns ===

Ada consistently supports a separation of interface and mechanism. You can see this in the format of a [[Ada Programming/Packages|package]], which separates its declaration from its body; and in the concept of a private type, whose representation in terms of Ada data structures is inaccessible outside the scope containing its definition.

== Where to ask for help ==

Most Ada experts lurk on the [[w:Newsgroup|Usenet newsgroups]] ''comp.lang.ada'' (English) and ''fr.comp.lang.ada'' (French); they are accessible either with a [[w:News_client|newsreader]] or through one of the many web interfaces. This is the place for all questions related to Ada.

People on these newsgroups are willing to help but will ''not'' do students' homework for them; they will not post complete answers to assignments. Instead, they will provide guidance for students to find their own answers.

For more online resources, see the [[Ada Programming#External links|External links]] section in this wikibook's introduction.

===#1 4.1.04===

de : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003#January

inglés: January 1 - Luíz Inácio Lula Da Silva becomes the 37th President of Brazil. 

'''español''': 1 de enero - Luíz Inácio Lula Da Silva es elegido el trigésimo séptimo presidente de Brasil.

inglés: January 1 - Pascal Couchepin becomes President of the Confederation in Switzerland 

'''español''': 1 de enero  - Pascal Couchepin es elegido el presidente de la Confederación Suiza.

inglés: January 15 - The Supreme Court hands down its decision in Eldred v. Ashcroft allowing   
the extension of copyright terms. 

'''español''': 15 de enero - El Tribunal Supremo de Estados Unidos ratifica la decisión en Eldred v. Ashcroft, que permite la extensión del copyright. 

inglés: January 21 - Kevin Mitnick, a famous U.S. hacker, is allowed to use a computer again.
 
'''español''': 21 de enero   - A Kevin Mitnick, un famoso hacker estadounidense , se le vuelve a permitir el uso del ordenador. 
:Put an &quot;A&quot; at the beginning of the sentence. The verb is &quot;permitir a&quot;, like in &quot;yo te permito a tí hacer esto&quot; or &quot;A tí se te permite hacer lo otro&quot;.

sorry for my uncleanness, I have done a lot of little mistakes in copying this time..
but I havent understood this paragraph, what exactly does &quot;se le vuelve a permitir &quot; mean?
:something like &quot;is again granted permission&quot;
:&quot;volver a hacer algo&quot; means &quot;to do something again&quot;: &quot;vuelve a llover&quot; = &quot;it rains again&quot;
:&quot;yo te permito&quot; means &quot;I allow you&quot;, &quot;se te permite&quot; means &quot;you are allowed&quot;

inglés: January 24 - The new United States Department of Homeland Security officially begins  
operation. 

'''español''': 24 de enero   - El Departamento de Defensa del Estados Unidos empieza a trabajar.

inglés: January 25 - Central Line train crashes into the tunnel wall at Chancery Lane station  
in London - 34 injured but nobody dies 

'''español''': 25 de enero- Un tren de la línea céntrica choca contra un muro de un túnel en la Chancery Lane Station en Londres.- 34 heridos, ningún fallecido. 

inglés: January 30 - Iraq disarmament crisis: Facing worldwide criticism and against the wishes of the majorities of their own electorates, leaders of Britain, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Denmark, and the Czech Republic release a statement, the letter of the eight, demonstrating support for the United States' plans for an invasion of Iraq. 

'''español''': 30 de enero - Crisis de desarme Iraquí. Contra las críticas del todo mundo y los deseos de la mayoría de sus propios electores los líderes de Inglaterra, España, Italia, Portugal, Hungría, Polonia, Dinamarca y  República Checa publican una declaración, la carta de los ocho, en la que muestra su apoyo al plan de los Estados Unidos para la invasión de Iraq.


:General statement: Very nice start... maybe reread your accentuation rules :)

Well, I know, this is a problem of me, I have never been able to cope with el accento :(, so I really should focus on that again ;-)

:Accentuation rules are not terribly difficult :) I think you can directly correct this, copy-paste it in its place, and  go for the next month (of course, if you feel like it). It would be nice if you register in the spanish wikipedia and refer to this course in the summary of your contribution :) -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 08:29, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Yes but I usually mistake the i with the í´, especially when writing on paper, but I think I just have to learn the words and the place of the accent..
OK I will register on the Spanish wikipedia, but what do you mean with your last part of the sentence?? thanks for now :) [[User:Sma|Sma]] 14:29, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I meant that you could write in the &quot;Summary&quot; (&quot;Resumen&quot;) something like &quot;Noticias de enero, desde el curso de traducción de la wikiversidad&quot;. That way, the authorship is fully backtraceable (your translation, with my help, of a work in the english version). I think it would be more GFDL-compliant, but mainly, it will make possible, in the future, to see which parts of articles in the wikipedia have something to do with the wikiversity. As sometime in the future we will have to show that wikiversity deserves a separate domain outside wikibooks, this might be handy :) -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 15:52, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)


===#2 6.11.04===

de: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003#February


inglés: February 1 - The Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrates over Texas upon reentry, killing all seven astronauts onboard.

español: 1 de febrero - El transbordador &quot;Columbia&quot; se desintegra en la reentrada en la atmósfera, y mueren los siete astronautas que iban a bordo.


inglés: February 1 - UDA Belfast leader John Gregg is killed by a loyalist faction

español: 1 de febrero - El líder de UDA Belfast John Gregg es asesinado...por un grupo lealista.

(I think grupo is a bit more neutral, because I dont know the actual translation..)
:&quot;de un lealista grupo&quot; -&gt; &quot;por un grupo lealista&quot;

why is it &quot;grupo lealista&quot; ? doesnt it have to be &quot;grupo lealisto&quot; ???
:no, you can't be lealisto, as you can't be comunisto, socialisto, reformisto or egoisto. They're all non-gender adjectives, ending with &quot;a&quot;. (Beware: you can, in fact, be &quot;listo&quot; (smart), it's not in the same family).

inglés: February 5 - Iraq disarmament crisis: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell addresses the UN Security Council on Iraq.

español: 5 de febrero - Crisis de desarme Iraquí: El líder del Departamento de Seguridad de los Estados Unidos, Colin Powell se dirige al Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas sobre Iraq.
:&quot;al&quot; (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;el&quot;, &quot;Consejo&quot; is masculine)

inglés: February 9 - Cricket World Cup begins in South Africa

español: 9 de febrero - El Campeonato del mundo de críquet empieza en Sudáfrica.

inglés: February 15 - Global protests against war on Iraq - more than six million people protest in over 600 cities worldwide, the largest war protest to take place before the war occurred.

español: 15 de febrero - Protestas en todo el mundo contra la guerra de Iraq - Más de seis millones personas protestan en más de 600 ciudades en todo el mundo, la mayor protesta contra la guerra antes de la guerra.

inglés: February 23 - New York City is the site of the 2003 Grammy Awards, with Nickelback, No Doubt, Foo Fighters, Britney Spears and some other bands and performers.

español: 23 de febrero - En Nueva York tienen lugar los Premios Grammy de 2003, con Nickelback, No Doubt, Foo Fighters, Britney Spears and más otros conjuntos y artistas.

:we usually say just &quot;Nueva York&quot; for &quot;New York City&quot;

:&quot;tienen lugar los Premios Grammy&quot; 
(to take place?`)
:exactly, it's the same idea

inglés: February 26 - An American businessman is admitted to the Vietnam France Hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. WHO doctor Carlo Urbani report the unusual highly contagious disease to WHO. Both the businessman and Carlo Urbani die of SARS in March.

español: 26 de febrero - Un comerciante americano ingresa en el Hospital Vietnam France en Hanoi, Vietnam. El doctor Carlo Urbani, de la OMS (Organización Mundial de la Salud), es quien notifica la enfermedad inusualmente contagiosa a la OMS.  El comerciante y Carlo Urbani mueren de SARS en marzo.

What is this WHO stuff? 
 
:World Health Organisation, in English it means, that this doctor Urbani told the WHO there was a dangerous infection or something like that but I found this a bit too hard to translate..

inglés: February 26 - Iraq disarmament crisis: U.S. President George W. Bush talks publicly about his vision of a post-invasion democracy in Iraq. Bush says it will be &quot;an example&quot; to other nations in Arabia

español: 26 de febrero - Crisis de desarme Iraquí: El presidente de los Estados Unidos, George W. Bush habla públicamente sobre su visión de la democracia in Iraq tras la invasión.
Bush dice que será un ejemplo para otros países en Arabia.

&quot;dice que será un ejemplo para...&quot;

What does será mean? And when do you use para and when por ? 
:&quot;será&quot; = &quot;will be&quot;, simple future of &quot;es&quot;
:the &quot;para&quot; vs &quot;por&quot; (vs &quot;porque&quot;) question is a tough one... &quot;para&quot; is generally &quot;para este objetivo&quot;, while &quot;por&quot; is &quot;por esta causa&quot;, but it's a non-trivial issue, so I will give some examples, as I am not sure about the general rule:
 voy a comer porque tengo hambre
 voy a preparar un bocadillo para comérmelo
 voy a preparar un bocadillo para la merienda
 voy a preparar un bocadillo para Juan
 voy al trabajo por la autopista
 voy al trabajo para ganar dinero
 voy al trabajo porque es mi obligación
 trabajo por comida
 trabajo para comer
 trabajo para el gobierno
 dos por tres, seis
 seis dulces para tres amigos, dos para cada uno
 por mí podemos hacer lo que queráis: me da igual
 para mí que su compleaños es hoy, pero no estoy seguro de recordarlo bien
:Maybe we can come to this again later on...

:Ok, this is the next month :) it was actually a bit more difficult than the last one...:)

You are doing OK. I guess you will make some steady, noticiable progress in a matter of days/weeks. -- 4lex 17:03, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC) 

:ok, that is good to hear, but I have noticed it myself actually, for example I do write the dates correctly now ;-) but it is a long way to get good, but this is very good practice, so I am off for the next month :)...

ok, I think I have understood the &quot;para/por&quot; thing, and I will transfer this to my vocabulary too, and could you check my [[User:sma/Listo del Vocabulario|Vocabulary list]] too, because I dont want to remember things wrong :) [[User:Sma|Sma]] 10:14, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:I think everything is OK in February now. I will check your vocabulary list now. Will you copy/paste January and February [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003 here]? -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 10:26, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

ok, thanks, but I have already copied it to [http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enero_de_2003] (without good formating though)..
:Uf. Good work. I didn't remember the situation of the spanish actualidad was so bad back then :-/ I'm sure somebody will do the formatting. The info is there, and that makes a difference! -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 10:50, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)


===#3 7.11.04===

de: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003#April

inglés: April 3 - Passenger bus hits remote-controlled land mine in the Chechen capital, killing at least 8.

español: 3 de abril - Un autobús golpea una mina terrestre controlada remotamente en la capital de Chechenia, por lo menos 8 personas mueren .
:Está bien. &quot;choca contra&quot; en vez de &quot;golpea&quot; también estaría bien. &quot;golpea&quot; looks more intentional, &quot;choca con&quot; looks more accidental.

I left it like that ok? :)
:ok

inglés: April 9 - U.S. forces seize control of Baghdad, apparently ending the regime of Saddam Hussein.

español: 9 de abril - La milicia de los Estados Unidos tiene el control de Bagdad, terminando aparentemente con el régimen de Saddam Hussein.
:Estados Unidos
:better: Bagdad
:&quot;que terminado&quot; no está bien; mejor &quot;terminando&quot;
is terminando translated as &quot;finishing&quot; ?
:yes, terminando or acabando are roughly the same as ending or finishing, terminado or acabado are finished or ended
:(you are still missing an &quot;n&quot;)

inglés: April 17 - The Stevens Report concludes that members of the RUC and British Army cooperated with the UDA against Catholics in Northern Ireland

español: 17 de abril - El Stevens Report concluye que unos algunos miembros de RUC y la milicia británica han trabajado con la UDA contra los católicos en Irlanda del Norte.
:¡Muy bien! Yo quitaría la coma: &quot;concluye que&quot;

inglés: April 21 - Retired U.S. Army General Jay Garner becomes Interim Civil Administrator of Iraq.

español: 21 de abril - El general retirado de la milicia estadounidense Jay Garner llega a ser Administrador civil interino de Iraq.

:I think April is ready to copy-paste

=== Automatically check for updates at startup time ===

Clicking this box causes OsiriX to check for a new version of itself automatically each time the program is run.

=== Transition effect when changing series ===

When this box is clicked, OsiriX will add a zippy little transition effect when moving from one series to the next.  Current choices are:

# Twirl
# Zoom
# Fade
# Random (any of the above, when you least expect them)

=== Always use DCMTK to read JPEG DICOMs ===

=== Play a &quot;pop&quot; sound for each XA frame ===
Retro sound effect reminiscent of the good (?) old Tagarno-like cine film projectors.

=== Hide &quot;Patient Name&quot; in the Database Window ===
This option is useful for maintaining patient confidentiality when doing presentations.

The goal of routing is to forward images received by OsiriX to other Dicom locations.

To set up routing:

#create an iCal calendar with the name you entered in the preferences.
#Next, add a route to a Calendar:
#Create a new Event in the specified calendar.
#*The event location should be in the format:
 Server1 Description:Transfer Syntax/Description:Transfer Syntax/etc

For Example:

 OSIRIX:JPEG 2000 Lossy 10:1

Permissible Transfer Syntaxes are:

*Explicit Little Endian
*JPEG 2000 Lossless
**JPEG 2000 Lossy 10:1
**JPEG 2000 Lossy 20:1
**JPEG 2000 Lossy 50:1
*JPEG Lossless
**JPEG High Quality (9)
**JPEG High Quality (8)
**JPEG High Quality (7)

Proper [[wikipedia:socialization|socialization]] is essential to a happy dog. As a puppy, after all required vaccinations have been given, the dog should be introduced to as many new people, dogs and locations as possible. Doing this helps the dog be less afraid of new situations when they occur later in life. A socialized dog is more likely to have a lower level of aggression towards strangers (both human and canine).

Ask your veterinarian when it is safe for your puppy to interact with other dogs.  It is safe for him to play with humans and probably kittens before his vaccinations are complete.  

Ask your veterinarian about puppy classes, where multiple clients bring puppies and children to play together, learn simple commands, and be exposed to strange objects.  

Regularly handling your puppies paws, rubbing his belly, trimming his nails (have your vet show you how to do this safely), and looking in his mouth will help your puppy be less fearful when he goes to the vet for a check-up.  This applies to adult dogs adopted from shelters as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added several good section on the Soviet Union.  In order to meet such lofty goals as the standards at the page's bottom, this section, as well as the whole project, must be significantly expanded.  I am also going to improve the German and Italian sections, as well as seperate them into two topics of discussion.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 01:16, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Oh what fun, I've now added a section the Weimar Republic (it seems appropriate here) tomorrow I'll spruce up ol' Mussolini and finish up Hitler.  Then on to World War II!  Oh, I think I'll tackle some ancient history tomorrow as well.  But where to put the Great Depression?  I guess it's own article is the way to go.  And since I'm the only big contributor for a month...I am kind of giving myself free reign to take the reins (inline assonance intentional :-) of power for the time being.  I think however, I will begin to aim for AP World History standards (I achieved a 5, so I will call myself well-qualified for the task) rather than the very regional California standards (although they provide an excellent ''baseline''.

alright, i added a basic overview of the spanish civil war. feel free to add some more everyone.

Why is there a section in French on this page?!

==Stalin Picture==
The Stalin propoganda potrait link was dead, so I linked to a propoganda poster instead. --[[User:Linesdata|Linesdata]] 21:31, 2 November 2007 (UTC)</text>

==Hello from Berlin!==
===School in Germany===
*School is not regulated nationwide, but by each Land
*German &quot;Kindergarten&quot; is optional - it translates rather to &quot;play school&quot;, &quot;Vorschule&quot; being roughly the equivalent to &quot;Kindergarten&quot;
*From the age of six on, all Germans attend a &quot;Grundschule&quot; (elementary school) for four or six years, depending on the Land.
*After that, they go to either 
**the &quot;Hauptschule&quot; which is industrially oriented, 
**the &quot;Realschule&quot;, which is skill oriented,
**the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, which is academically oriented,
**or the &quot;Gesamtschule&quot;, or comprehensive school.
*Schooling is obligatory until the age of 16, but the Gymnasium diploma &quot;Abitur&quot; can only be obtained after 12 or 13 years, i.e. at age 18 or 19.
*Latin and sometimes even ancient Greek are regularly taught at the Gymnasium. For the &quot;Abitur&quot;, at least two foreign languages as well as some calculus and analysis classes have to be taken.
*School days often are from 8:00-13:00. In most 'Länder', only the older students have additional classes between about 14:00-15:30 (i.e. 8AM - 1PM and 2PM - 3:30PM) 
*In most schools, Extracurricular Activities are offered, such as Drama Club or School Choir, but they are less common than in the U.S. Though many students feel some sort of identification with their school, most are just happy when they can go home.
*Generally speaking, many schools still are more formal than US or Canadian schools.
*The marking system uses 
**1 (very good, 87,5% or 96%), 
**2 (good 75% or 85%), **
**3 (satisfactory, 62,5% or 65%),
**4 (sufficient 50% or 45%). 
**5 (faulty) is failed or 25%. 
**6 (not sufficient) is only used when the student literally hands in a blank sheet or failed. 
*These marks can be modified with a &quot;+&quot; or a &quot;-&quot; to indicate a tendency, so e.g. 2+ is a fairly good mark that corresponds to about 80%.

==Dialogue==

 Silke: Jetzt haben wir Mathe.
 Torsten: Oh nein, ich habe überhaupt keine Lust dazu.
 Silke: Hast du die Aufgaben gemacht?
 Torsten: Ja, im Bus.
 Silke: Super! Kann ich sie abschreiben?

 Lehrer (Betritt den Raum): Guten Morgen!
 Klasse: Guten Morgen!

 Lehrer: Wer möchte die Aufgaben an der Tafel rechnen? Florian?
 Florian geht zur Tafel, schreibt an und liest vor: 
    &quot;5 plus 8 ist gleich 13&quot;
    &quot;8 minus 5 ist gleich 3&quot;
    &quot;3 mal 8 ist gleich 24&quot;
    &quot;24 geteilt durch 12 ist gleich 2&quot;
 Lehrer: Sehr gut, Florian!

 Die Glocke läutet. Es ist Fünfminutenpause.
 Silke: Schnell, wir müssen zu Musik!
 Torsten: Au ja, darauf freue ich mich schon.
 Silke: Was machen wir heute?
 Torsten: Wir wollen ein Lied von Grönemeyer singen!
 Silke: Welches denn?
 Torsten: &quot;Alkohol&quot;, glaube ich.

 Nach dem Musikunterricht:
 Silke: Jetzt haben wir nur noch Geschichte...
 Torsten: Komm, wir schwänzen und gehen ins Bistro.
 Silke: Schon wieder!

==Und Satz für Satz ...==

 Oh nein, ich habe überhaupt keine Lust dazu.

&quot;Lust (zu etwas) haben&quot; means &quot;feeling like (it)&quot;. &quot;Ich habe keine Lust (dazu)&quot; is &quot;I don't feel like (it)&quot;. &quot;Ich habe ''überhaupt'' keine Lust&quot; emphasizes it, meaning &quot;I don't feel like it at all.&quot;

 Hast du die Aufgaben gemacht?
 Have you the tasks done?

&quot;Did you do your homework?&quot; 

 Ja, im Bus.
 Yes, in the bus.

This is a common practice of students everywhere in the world, I guess... 

Notice the contraction of &quot;im&quot;, which is derived from &quot;in dem&quot;, &quot;in the&quot;.

 Super! Kann ich sie noch schnell abschreiben?
 Super! Can I just quickly copy them?

&quot;Super&quot;, &quot;Cool&quot;, &quot;Toll&quot;, are common exclamations ...  &quot;Noch schnell&quot; is here meant as &quot;while there is still time&quot;



 Lehrer (Betritt den Raum): Guten Morgen!
 Teacher (enters the room): Good Morning!
 
 Klasse: Guten Morgen!
 Class: Good Morning!
 
 Wer möchte die Aufgaben an der Tafel rechnen? Florian?
 Who would like the tasks on the blackboard calculate? 

&quot;Who would like to do these questions on the blackboard?&quot; Note that &quot;Tafel&quot; is related to &quot;table&quot;, meaning a flat surface, and indeed German &quot;Tafel&quot; can also designate a table prepared for a feast.

Don't let the weird order of the words disturb you, even if the phrase seems totally incomprehensible at first. I'll try to construct this bit by bit:

This is the basic question and answer pair:
 &quot;Wer rechnet?&quot; - &quot;Ich rechne.&quot;
 &quot;Who calculates?&quot; - &quot;I calculate.&quot;

To ask, if you want to do something, you use a construction similar to English:
 &quot;Wer will rechnen&quot; - &quot;Ich will rechnen.&quot;
 &quot;Who wants to calculate&quot; - &quot;I want to calculate.&quot;
Note that the &quot;to&quot; is already included in the German word &quot;rechnen&quot;. &quot;Rechnen&quot; is clearly already an infinitive, and doesn't need a &quot;zu&quot; to prove it. This is one of the main reasons why complicated conjugations can survive, they contain information that doesn't have to be expressed otherwise then...

To be a little more polite (or at least seem like it, since our teacher probably wouldn't take a no for an answer)
 &quot;Wer möchte rechnen?&quot; - &quot;Ich möchte rechnen!&quot;
 &quot;Who would like to calculate?&quot; - &quot;I would like to calculate&quot;
This is another example for brevity by conjugation. The word &quot;möchte&quot; contains the &quot;would&quot;, as it is a &quot;Konjunktiv&quot;-form of the word &quot;mögen&quot; which translates to &quot;like&quot;. Don't be discouraged, many Germans don't realize this, and many don't use the Konjunktiv correctly, if ever. However, &quot;ich möchte&quot;-phrases are extremely popular, so just use them, even if you didn't understand yet a word of the explanation above ;-)

Let's introduce objects in our phrase:
 &quot;Wer rechnet die Aufgabe?&quot; - &quot;Ich rechne die Aufgabe&quot;
 &quot;Who calculates the task?&quot; - &quot;I calculate the task&quot;, meaning &quot;Who answers the question&quot;
This is a direct object, &quot;Aufgabe&quot; is in the accusative case. Because this is a feminine noun, this is not so obvious, but the structure is the same as in:
 &quot;Wer sieht den Mann?&quot; - &quot;Ich sehe den Mann.&quot;
 &quot;Who sees the man?&quot; - &quot;I see the man.&quot;

Now, we also have an adverbial expression of the place. This is an expression that defines the verb, thus ad-verbial.
 &quot;Wer rechnet an der Tafel?&quot; - &quot;Ich rechne an der Tafel&quot;
 &quot;Who calculates on the blackboard?&quot; - &quot;I calculate on the blackboard&quot;

Now let's put all this together:
 &quot;Wer rechnet die Aufgabe an der Tafel?&quot; - &quot;Ich rechne die Aufgabe an der Tafel.&quot;
 &quot;Who calculates the task on the blackboard?&quot; - &quot;I calculate the task on the blackboard&quot;

Note that the order expressions is widely interchangeable. You can emphasize something by putting it closer to the end of the question.

And now for the whole phrase in all its glory:
 &quot;Wer | möchte | die Aufgabe | an der Tafel | rechnen?&quot; - &quot;Ich | möchte | die Aufgabe | an der Tafel | rechnen.&quot;
 &quot;Who | would like | the task | on the blackboard | calculate?&quot; - &quot;I | would like | the task | on the blackboard | calculate.&quot;

It wasn't THAT bad, was it?


 Florian geht zur Tafel, schreibt an und liest vor: 
 Florian goes to the blackboard, writes on and reads out:

&quot;Florian goes to the blackboard, writes down and reads out aloud&quot;

&quot;zur&quot; is another contraction, this time of &quot;zu&quot; and &quot;der&quot;. Note that after &quot;zu&quot; follows the dative case, so &quot;der&quot; is not the masculine but the feminine article.

&quot;anschreiben&quot; splits to &quot;schreibt an&quot;, and means literally &quot;writing on&quot;. It is often used when writing legibly on a large, visible surface such as blackboard or a flipchart.

&quot;vorlesen&quot; splits to &quot;liest vor&quot; and translates to &quot;read aloud&quot;.

    &quot;5 plus 8 ist gleich 13&quot;
    &quot;8 minus 5 ist gleich 3&quot;
    &quot;3 mal 8 ist 24&quot;
    &quot;24 geteilt durch 12 gleich 2&quot;

So, as you might have guessed, plus and minus are the same as in English - they are just pronounced German. The verbs &quot;addieren&quot; and &quot;subtrahieren&quot; are probably not difficult either... &quot;Ist gleich&quot; or short &quot;gleich&quot; or just &quot;ist&quot; corresponds obviously to &quot;is equal to&quot; or &quot;equals&quot;.

&quot;mal&quot; means &quot;times&quot;. This is also used in every day phrases, such as &quot;100mal habe ich dir gesagt ...&quot; &quot;I told you a 100 times ...&quot; The corresponding verb is &quot;malnehmen&quot; or &quot;multiplizieren&quot;

&quot;geteilt durch&quot; is literally &quot;divided by&quot;, and the verb is &quot;teilen&quot; or &quot;dividieren&quot;.

Lehrer: Sehr gut, Florian!
Very good, Florian!

Now, that was easy!




 Die Glocke läutet. Es ist Fünfminutenpause.
 The bell rings. It is five-minute-break

Between single classes, there is usually a break of five minutes to allow teachers and students to go from one classroom to another. In most schools, classes such as German, English, History, Philosophy are taught in the classroom. Classes that use special equipment, such as all sciences, music and arts and of course computers and sport are being taught in a specialized lab classes. Roughly every second break is 15 minutes long, and if there are lessons in the afternoon, there's often a break of 45 to 60 minutes for lunch.

 Schnell, wir müssen zu Musik!
 Quick, we must to music!

This sentence sounds strange. This is, because in everyday German, sometimes the verb ''gehen'' can be left out, if it is clear what is meant.  In this case, the complete phrase would have to be &quot;Wir müssen zu Musik ''gehen''&quot;. But since Torsten will not think Silke is going to fly there, there will be no misunderstanding. Additionally, the word &quot;class&quot;, or &quot;course&quot; is missing, which is the usual way of students to talk about their subjects.

Note: In English, the phrase might be &quot;We ''have to'' go to the music room&quot; instead of ''must''. The German translation &quot;Wir haben in den Musikraum zu gehen&quot; would be understood, but is quite formal. Additionally, there is a connotation that the speaker distances himself from the order he is being given.

 Au ja, darauf freue ich mich schon!
 Oh yes, to this look forward I myself already!

Whew, what was that? 

Let's start at the beginning. &quot;Au ja&quot; ist an exclamation meaning &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;that's great&quot;. It has nothing to do with the German equivalent of &quot;ouch!&quot;, which is &quot;au(a)!&quot;

&quot;Sich freuen&quot; means &quot;being happy&quot;. It is ''reflexive'' such as in &quot;I help myself&quot;, because the subject and the object are the same. Some phrases simply are constructed like this, even if there seems to be no real reason to this, and many languages know this phenomenon. The &quot;sich&quot; here is technically the accusative of &quot;he, she, it&quot; and is being changed depending on the person:

 ich freue mich                 I am happy
 du freust dich                 you are happy
 er, sie, es freut sich         he, she, it is happy
 wir freuen uns                 we are happy
 ihr freut euch                 you are happy
 Sie/sie freuen sich            they are happy

Note that &quot;to be happy&quot; actually would be rather translated by &quot;glücklich sein&quot;, but it is the closest English equivalent to &quot;sich freuen&quot;.

&quot;Sich ''über etwas'' freuen&quot; means &quot;to be happy ''about something''&quot;. This is kind of self-explanatory.
But &quot;sich ''auf etwas'' freuen&quot;, literally &quot;to be happy ''on something''&quot; means &quot;to look forward to&quot;. This is a common phrase that uses the ''on'' in the same wide sense as in &quot;''on'' drugs&quot;, or &quot;living ''on'' something&quot; - there is no spatial relation here...

In &quot;darauf&quot; you recognize the &quot;auf&quot;. The &quot;da&quot; is a demonstrative prounoun such as in &quot;''that'' place&quot;. &quot;Darauf&quot; actually is another contraction which developped a long time ago from &quot;da-herauf&quot;. The &quot;darauf&quot; is referencing the word &quot;Musik&quot; from Silke's sentence.

So &quot;Au ja, darauf freue ich mich schon&quot; or &quot;to-this look-forward I myself already&quot; just means &quot;Great, I'm already looking forward to that&quot;

Maybe it comforts you a little that the English phrase in a word-by-word translation to German would be just as unintelligible...

 Was machen wir heute?
 What make we today?

&quot;What we (are going to) do today?&quot; Note again, that &quot;machen&quot; often does not translate to &quot;make&quot;, but to &quot;do&quot;!

 Wir wollen ein Lied von Grönemeyer singen!
 We want a song of Grönemeyer sing!

&quot;We want to sing a song by Grönemeyer!&quot; 

 Welches denn?
 Which then?

 &quot;Alkohol&quot;, glaube ich...
 &quot;Alcohol&quot;, believe I...

Note that adding a &quot;glaube ich&quot; is another common phrase, exacly as &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;I believe&quot; can be added to an English phrase. (Never mind the word order, this is because Alcohol ''is'' the object, so the verb is at the second position in the text)

[[w:Herbert Grönemeyer|Herbert Grönemeyer]] is a very popular German rock singer from the Ruhr region. His most famous songs include &quot;Männer&quot;, &quot;Bochum&quot; (a city in the Ruhr region), &quot;Mensch&quot; and also &quot;Alkohol&quot;. 


 Nach dem Musikunterricht:
 After the music class:

&quot;Unterricht&quot; comes from &quot;unterrichten&quot; &quot;to teach&quot;, and means simply &quot;class&quot;. Better not think about &quot;under&quot; and &quot;right&quot; here, which you might have correctly recognized as the word's components &quot;richten&quot; literally means &quot;to correct&quot;.

 Jetzt haben wir nur noch Geschichte...
 Now have we only still history...

&quot;Now we have only history left&quot;

 Komm, wir schwänzen und gehen ins Bistro.
 Come, we skip and go in the bistro.

&quot;Come on, let's skip class and go to the bistro instead&quot;. As in English, &quot;Komm&quot; can be used to motivate others. 

There is yet another contraction here &quot;ins&quot; is derived from &quot;in das&quot;, meaning &quot;in the&quot;. &quot;das&quot; is the neutral article in accusative case here.

 Schon wieder!
 Already again!

==Background==
At the turn of the century in 1900 the inexorable slide towards revolution in Russia was already taking place.  Russia's economy had started on a rocky road toward capitalism.  Though large growth had occurred, it was not sufficiently large enough to advance a nation the size of Russia.  

===The Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (1900-1903)===
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, more commonly known by his pseudonym V. I. Lenin, was born into a well-to-do Russian family in Sambirsk, Russia.  His elder brother, Alexandar Ulyanov,was executed in May 1887 for an assassination plot against Czar Alexander III.  Vladimir was arrested for revolutionary activity that same year, and expelled from Kazan University where he had been studying law.  Rather than become a lawyer, Lenin became a Marxist and an advocate of violent revolution against the Czars.  In December, 1895, he was arrested by the Okrhana and deported to Siberia.  He married Nadezdha Krupskaya in July 1889.  When his exile ended in 1900, he left Russia and helped to form the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) among Russian emigrants in Switzerland and started publishing the party newspaper ''Iskra'' (The Spark).  In 1903, Lenin caused the split of the party into a Bolshevik (Majoritarian) and Menshevik (Minoritarian) factions, which eventually became permanent

===The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905)===
The Russian Empire, under the Czars, had advanced over the largest territory since the Mongol Empire, encompassing all of modern Russia, Poland, Finland, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Mongolia.  Still, the Czars hungered for more.  Under Czar Nicholas II, Russia attempted to expand its influence by occupying the northeastern Chinese province of Manchuria and then turned its greedy eyes toward Korea.  However, the Japanese, whose army and navy had been modernized to Western standards, was already in possession of the peninsula.  Japan struck first.  Its forces quickly routed the Russians, who had hoped to turn an easy victory in the war into a counter-revolutionary propaganda coup.  The Russian's Baltic Fleet was sent all the way to the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan, only to have all eight battleships destroyed by the Japanese navy in a pitched battle.  The war was concluded with a humiliating peace on September 5, 1905, even as Russia was experiencing its Revolution of 1905.

===Turmoil and Conflict in Russia (1905-1914)===
Lenin's Bolsheviks were one of several  political parties that developed in Russia during this period.  In addition to the Bolsheviks, there were the Social-Revolutionaries, Constitutional-Democrats (Kadets), and Social-Democrats.  In Russia, the situation vacillated throughout the period between bad and worse.  Peter Stolypin, as Minister of Internal Affairs acted to try and salvage the situation.  A reformist conservative, Stolypin saw the necessity of agrarian reform and attempted to help the peasants situation.  In the Czar's court however, people came to see him as a self-interested politician who was gradually losing Nicholas II's favor.  In September 1911, he was assassinated by a Socialist-Revolutionary.  Very probably, this was the nail that sealed the Czar's coffin, though it wasn't yet apparent.

Lenin's own party was only slightly active during this time.  Lenin himself returned to Russia in 1905, but then had to flee yet again when the Okrhana was able to reassert its control.  Within Russia, the Bolsheviks operated a newspaper called ''Pravda'' (The Truth), which was too much about theory for the tastes of most ordinary Russians.  Lenin also was presented with the problem that Marxism traditionally involved a period of capitalist development before socialism and then communism could be achieved.  Lenin tried to convince his colleagues that a single stage, violent revolution, could send the country immediately to the socialist stage of development and completely sidestep the so-called &quot;bourgeois-democratic&quot; revolutionary stage.

In 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated while taking a parade route through the Bosian provincial capital of Sarajev by a Serbian nationalist.  Austria, which produced a set of demands to which Serbia would have to reject, then invaded Serbia before the answer had even arrived.  Russia immediately mobilized to help its ally, Serbia.  However, because the Russian generals insisted that they had to mobilize all of their troops as their plan called for, troops began to appear on the Russian-German border in Poland.  Germany of course told the Russians to stop, but they continued anyway, provoking a German declaration of war.  France then declared war on Germany. Germany decided it would be a good idea to invade through neutral Belgium, provoking a British declaration of war against the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and later the Ottoman Empire).  Russia simply wasn't ready for a war of such a magnitude.  The Russian industrial economy could not stomach the demands put upon it by the war effort.  Prices began to rise, as the Russians suffered severe setbacks on the front.  Soldiers began to desert.  The situation was becoming desperate.

==The slide to revolution (1914 - February 1917)==
The Russians were faced with an impossible situation in the east in 1914.  They were expected to defend and attack both the powerful German Reich and the strong Austro-Hungarian Empire.  They had the strength to do neither.  At the Battle of Tanneburg, 100,000 Russians became prisoners of war and the Germans swept through Poland.  At the beginning of the war, however, there was strong support for the war within Russia, as within the other major combatants.  However, this turn of events would later turn the people vehemently against the war, which nobody expected to be so bloody or to drag on for four years.

The war situation was acceptable at first.  Adequate supplies were available to the troops, however, the urban store houses started to run out of food.  Nicholas II's government introduced price controls on grain and other foodstuffs.  Rationing quickly became the norm.  The thing that really triggered the economic collapse however, was the transportation network, which was woefully inadequate.  While the existence of east-west railroads was sufficient, the north-south links were broken and disjointed.  Shortages of supplies caused industries to suffer, which caused banks to tighten credit.  Each industry aggravated each other's problems.  The Czar also continued to repress liberties and freedoms, especially in the Fourth Duma (remember that he had already dismissed it three times).

The situation come to an abrupt head in February 1917, as strikes broke out on the 22nd at a main armaments plant.  Women textile workers began to strike.  By the 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, a city-wide strike had swept the capital city of Petrograd (changed from St. Petersburg to sound less German).  Nicholas II took counsel with his advisors, and was told that the situation was untenable.

==The February Revolution (February - October 1917)==
On March 2, the Czar abdicated while traveling by train from the front to Petrograd.  Russia literally became a republic overnight.  Several prominent Duma members immediately formed a committee to govern the country, which became known as the Provisional Government.  The head was to be the Prince Lvov, a relative of the outgoing Czar.  The cabinet announced a series of radical social reforms: freedom of speech, faith, assembly, and press.  They promised elections for a Constituent Assembly (parliament) by all adults over twenty-one years of age, including women.  However, the Provisional Government decided, perhaps fatally, that they would continue the war, which many Russians had already begun to oppose.  The Provisional Government should have realized that there was no real hope for governing the country and improving the situation without ending the war.  As it was, their insistence on fighting the war immediately made the Provisional Government unpopular.  By that time, large-scale mass desertions were occurring on the front and the war was probably untenable for any regime.

==The October Revolution (October - November 1917)==

The October Revolution dated to October 25, 1917 (November 7), also known as the Bolshevik Revolution, was the second phase of the overall Russian Revolution of 1917, after the February Revolution of the same year. The October Revolution overthrew the Russian Provisional Government and gave the power to the Soviets dominated by Bolsheviks. 

===The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk===

This was a treaty that prematurely pulled Russia out of WWI before the war had ended. It had harsh economic consequences on Russia and made it ineligible for post-war war talks and treaties.

==The Russian Civil War (1918-1921)==

A civil war fought between the 'Whites' and the 'Reds'. The Whites were against communism and were either capitalists or monarchists. They were also aided by some Western nations who saw them as a way of preventing mass growth of communism in Russia. The reds were pro-communist and fought to establish a permanent communist government, they were called the Bolsheviks. The Bolsheviks won the Russian Civil War.

==The New Economic Policy (1921-1924)==

Lenin's economic policy that was implemented after the failure of &quot;war communism&quot;. It allowed limited private ownership of certain businesses and industries and went against the principles of pure communism. Yet, it improved the nation's economic condition and stabilized industry.

The new economic policy could be said to have been the introduction of capitalism back into the economy.

This plan was introduced as an emergency plan to help the Bolsheviks win the civil war.The peasants benefited immensely from the new economic policy and food distribution improved. It also gave people the chance to vote

==Lenin's Legacy==
Lenin died on 21 January 1924, aged 53. In the four days that the he lay in state, more than 900,000 mourners viewed his body.

Winston Churchill, who encouraged British intervention against the Russian Revolution, in league with the White Movement, to destroy the Bolsheviks and Bolshevism, said:

:He alone could have found the way back to the causeway... The Russian people were left floundering in the bog. Their worst misfortune was his birth... their next worst his death.&lt;ref&gt;Mauchline Roberts, Elizabeth, ''Lenin and the Downfall of Tsarist Russia'' (1966) p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Word order ==
Japanese is a [[w:Subject Object Verb|SOV]] (Subject-Object-Verb) language. English is typically [[w:Subject Verb Object|SVO]] (Subject-Verb-Object). In Japanese, the verb ''always'' appears at the end of clauses and sentences. Japanese parts of speech are usually marked with words called &quot;particles&quot; that follow the word they modify. These particles identify the word's or phrase's function in the sentence—for example, topic, subject, direct/indirect object, location of action, etc.

Japanese is flexible in terms of word-order due to use of particles. Sentences, however, generally have the following structure:
:'''Sentence Topic, Time, Location, Subject, Indirect Object, Direct Object, Verb.'''

== Context sensitivity ==
Japanese is highly ''context-sensitive''. Words or phrases obvious to both the speaker and listener are often omitted. It could be considered a &quot;minimalist&quot; language. For example, the statement: &quot;I'm going to watch a movie.&quot; could be translated as 「映画を見る。」 (''eiga o miru.''); literally, &quot;Movie watch.&quot; [I] is implied, as it is the speaker who is making the statement. Depending on the context, however, this phrase could also be translated as &quot;s/he is going to watch a movie&quot;, &quot;we will watch a movie&quot;, etc.

Japanese has many levels of formality and depends not only on what is said, but also on who is saying it and to whom. The language is so socially striated, that different forms of speech exist for men and women.

== Parts of speech ==

Japanese parts of speech, although no more complicated than those of other languages, do not fit well into typical labels such as verb, noun, and adjective. Keep that in mind over the course of your studies.

=== Nominals ===
==== Nouns ====
{{Further|Japanese/Grammar/Nouns|l1=Nouns}}
Nouns in Japanese are fairly immutable.  They do not take definite or indefinite articles, gender, and do not change for number.

Although there is no true plural in Japanese, a small number of nouns may take one of several collective suffixes.
:''Tanaka-san (Mr. Tanaka), Tanaka-san-tachi (Mr. Tanaka and his group)''

Certain nouns may take a prefix in [[#Levels_of_Politeness|polite speech]].  Most often, native Japanese words (和語) are preceded by &quot;o-&quot; (&quot;お&quot;), and Sino-Japanese words (漢語) are preceded with &quot;go-&quot; (&quot;ご&quot;).  Both are readings of the kanji &quot;御&quot;.  Though primarily used for adding politeness or distance, some words more commonly appear with the prefix than others, and in some cases, never appear without it (e.g., お茶 [''ocha''], &quot;green tea&quot;).

Many nouns may be converted into verbs simply by affixing 「する」 (''suru'') to the end.
: ''&quot;benkyō&quot; ({{furi|勉強|べんきょう}}) is a noun meaning &quot;study/studies&quot; while &quot;benkyō-suru&quot; ({{furi|勉強|べんきょう|する}}) is the verb &quot;to study&quot;.''

Nouns may also function as adjectives when the [[#Particles|particle]] の (''no'') or な (&quot;na&quot;) is appended.
: ''&quot;ki&quot; (木) means &quot;wood&quot; with &quot;ki no tatemono&quot; ({{furi|木|き}}の{{furi|建物|たてもの}}) meaning &quot;wooden building&quot;.''

==== Pronouns ====
{{Further|Japanese/Lessons/Personal pronouns|l1=Personal pronouns}}
Unlike many other languages, Japanese has no true pronouns; since words that are clear from context are usually elided, there is less need for them. In general, natural-sounding Japanese tends to avoid the use of nouns that refer to people except when explicitly needed. This is often a point of confusion for beginners. Pronominals are not grammatically distinct from ordinary nominals: notably, they may take adjectives, which pronouns cannot.
: ''&quot;watashi&quot;, &quot;boku&quot;, &quot;ore&quot;, &quot;watakushi&quot; all mean &quot;I&quot;; and &quot;anata&quot;, &quot;kimi&quot;, &quot;kisama&quot;, &quot;omae&quot; mean &quot;you&quot;''

==== Na-adjectives ====
{{Further|Japanese/Grammar/Adjectives|l1=Adjectives}}
A Na-adjective is a nominal that often precedes a copula (such as 'na'). Due to the common occurrence of na-adjectives, many Japanese dictionaries write nominals with the 'na' included. Na-adjectives are generally adjectival in meaning, as most cannot exist in context without a previously denoted subject; however, one might simply say &quot;げんき　な (genki na)&quot; to describe a subject that is understood within the current conversation's context (this situation is limited to casual or somewhat informal conversation; using full sentences is almost always necessary when speaking to anyone of higher status).
Examples of na-adjectives: &quot;heta na:&quot; unskilled, bad at; &quot;genki na:&quot; healthy, energetic; &quot;orijinaru na:&quot; original

=== Verbals ===

==== Verbs ====
{{Further|Japanese/Grammar/Verbs|l1=Verbs}}
Verbs are where most of the action in Japanese sentences takes place.  They are the primary means for controlling levels of politeness in speech,…

Japanese verbs inflect directly for tense, negation, mood, aspect, politeness, and honorific speech.

Unlike English, conjugation of Japanese verbs is extremely regular, with few exceptions.  The system takes some getting used to, but once the [[Japanese/Kana|kana]] have been learned, a uniform pattern emerges.  Verbs are placed into one of three groups: 五段 (''godan'', aka Type I), 一段 (''ichidan'', aka Type II), and 不規則 (''fukisoku'', irregular).

Only two verbs are generally considered irregular in the modern language, 来る (''kuru'', to come) and する (''suru'', to do).  Despite being such, even they are somewhat regular in their irregularity.

==== I-adjectives ====
{{Further|Japanese/Grammar/Adjectives|l1=Adjectives}}
These inflect for tense, politeness, and honorific speech as well (although not aspect or mood, as they are all stative verbs); an -i adjective will always end in -ai, -ii, -ui, or -oi. (Note that there are also stative -u verbs.)
: ''&quot;utsukushī&quot;: beautiful; &quot;ī&quot;: good; &quot;sugoi&quot;: amazing; &quot;ureshī&quot;: happy

==== The copula ====
Although the copula is not strictly a verb, most of its forms derive from &quot;de aru&quot;, but inflects somewhat irregularly. It retains an &quot;attributive form&quot;, na, used to modify the noun it stands before: however, this form is almost exclusively used after na-adjectives.

=== Other ===
{{Further|Japanese/Grammar/Basic Particles|l1=Basic Particles}}
'''Particles''': Also called '''postpositions''' or ''joshi'', particles show the case of nouns in Japanese: that is, they mark nouns as being the subject, object, indirect object, etc. (English typically uses word order or prepositions for the same effect.) Particles follow the noun they modify.
*''[[wiktionary:は#Particle|wa]]'' ('''は''', topic)
*''[[wiktionary:が#Particle|ga]]'' ('''が''', subject)
*''[[wiktionary:を#Particle|o]]'' ('''を''', direct object)
*''[[wiktionary:の#Particle|no]]'' ('''の''', possession, apposition)
*''[[wiktionary:に#Particle|ni]]'' ('''に''', indirect object marker), to, etc.
*''[[wiktionary:から#Particle|kara]]'' ('''から''') from
*''[[wiktionary:まで#Particle|made]]'' ('''まで''') until, as far as
*''[[wiktionary:で#Particle|de]]'' ('''で''') using, at
Some particles are used after sentences instead:
*''[[wiktionary:か#Particle|ka]]'' ('''か'''), question marker)
*''[[wiktionary:よ#Particle|yo]]'' ('''よ'''), exclamatory marker)
*''[[wiktionary:って#Particle|tte]]'' ('''って''') (quotation marker)

'''Adverbs''': Adverbs typically modify the entire sentence, although most Japanese quantifiers (including numbers) are actually adverbs, rather than adjectives as in English.
*''aikawarazu'' as always;
*''[[wiktionary:少し#Adverb|sukoshi]]'' ('''少し''') a little, few
*''mō sugu'' soon, before long;
*''sō'' thus, so

'''Conjunctions''': Japanese conjunctions typically either apply to nominals (like English &quot;except&quot;) or to predicates (like English &quot;when&quot;), not both (like English &quot;and&quot;).
*''mata wa'' or (n.); 
*''[[wiktionary:然して#Conjunction|soshite]]'' ('''そして''') and then, and also (pr.); 
*''[[wiktionary:が#Particle|ga]]'' but (pr.)

'''Interjections''': Common to every language.
*''wā!'' &quot;wow!&quot;
*''are?'' &quot;huh?&quot;, &quot;wha?&quot;
*''ē to'' &quot;um, er&quot;
*''anō'' &quot;um&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">¡Bienvenido! :) A ver si este curso conseguimos mover esto un poco ;) -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 08:07, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Para empezar: ¿qué te parece la división preliminar de disciplinas de la química que he hecho? Si algo no te convence, lo mueves de sitio o lo reestructuras, ¿vale? Y ¿tienes alguna sugerencia para el plan de trabajo? Lo que he puesto es lo que mejor me pareció, pero un solo cerebro piensa muy mal... Si tienes otras ideas, refléjalas en la página. Si lo que hay te parece bien, pues nos podemos poner a hacerlo. También podemos coger ideas de [[Wikiversidad:C%C3%B3mo_crear_un_departamento_wikiversitario|aquí]] (o cambiar lo que hay, si tenemos otras ideas). -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 08:39, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

===Wikilibros y Wikiversidad===
Veo que ya has empezado, gracias y enhorabuena por tu trabajo :) Tengo una sugerencia: ¿qué te parece si reservamos la wikiversidad para docencia y organización, y ponemos el material tipo libro en wikibooks? No sé si compartes mi visión, pero me imagino a la wikiversidad como un gran centro docente, abierto y libre, donde los profesores y los alumnos se ponen en contacto y trabajan (quizá incluso investigan, en el futuro...), la wikipedia y el wikcionario como obras de consulta colosales a los que referirse en caso de dudas y para dar los primeros pasos, y wikilibros como la gran biblioteca de libros de texto. En esa visión, el material &quot;real&quot; debiera ir a wikibooks, y en wikiversidad se dejarían sólo programas, guías de estudio... ¿Qué opinas tú? -- Alex, desde un navegador que no acepta cookies.

== Atrayendo a más gente ==

Coincido contigo: no se hace una universidad (ni siquiera un departamento) entre tres personas. Está claro que el trabajo que estamos haciendo (o el que vamos a hacer) es de estímulo: mostrar con el ejemplo que es factible hacer algo así. Comenzando wikilibros, estructurando los recursos disponibles en la wikipedia, preparando guías de estudio, proponiendo cursos, aunque al principio no se apunte nadie... A medida que la wikipedia gana popularidad, se hace más fácil que más y más gente se interese por los &quot;otros&quot; proyectos wikimedia. Si conseguimos que este proyecto tenga un aspecto lo bastante prometedor, la gente acudirá. En ese momento, esto dejará de ser un mini-proyecto de un pequeño grupo de compañeros, y pasará a ser un verdadero proyecto de comunidad, como la wikipedia, donde los colaboradores se cuentan al menos por centenares, cuando no por miles. -- [[User:4lex|4lex]] 21:39, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Standard operators ==

[[Ada Programming|Ada]] allows [[w:operator overloading|operator overloading]] for all standard operators and so the following summaries can only describe the suggested standard operations for each operator. It is quite possible to misuse any standard operator to perform something unusual.

Each operator is either a [[Ada Programming/Keywords|keyword]] or a [[Ada Programming/Delimiters|delimiter]] -- hence all operator pages are redirects to the appropriate [[Ada Programming/Keywords|keyword]] or  [[Ada Programming/Delimiters|delimiter]].

Operators have arguments which in the RM are called Left and Right for binary operators, Right for unary operators (indicating the position with respect to the operator symbol).

The list is sorted from lowest precedence to highest precedence.

=== Logical operators ===

; [[Ada Programming/Operators/and|and]] : and &lt;math&gt;x \land y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also keyword [[Ada Programming/Keywords/and|and]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/or|or]] : or &lt;math&gt;x \lor y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also keyword [[Ada Programming/Keywords/or|or]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/xor|xor]] : exclusive or &lt;math&gt;(x \land \bar{y}) \lor (\bar{x} \land y)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also keyword [[Ada Programming/Keywords/xor|xor]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Relational operators ===

; [[Ada Programming/Operators//=|/=]] : Not Equal &lt;math&gt;x \ne y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters//=|/=]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/=|=]] : Equal &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/=|=]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/less than|&lt;]] : Less than &lt;math&gt;x&lt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/less than|&lt;]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/less than or equal to|&lt;=]] : Less than or equal to (&lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/less than or equal to|&lt;=]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/greater than|&gt;]] : Greater than (&lt;math&gt;x &gt; y&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/greater than|&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/greater than or equal to|&gt;=]] : Greater than or equal to (&lt;math&gt;x \ge y&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/greater than or equal to|&gt;=]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Binary adding operators ===

; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/+|+]] : Add &lt;math&gt;x + y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/+|+]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/-|-]] : Subtract &lt;math&gt;x - y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/-|-]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/&amp;|&amp;]] : Concatenate , &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt; y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/&amp;|&amp;]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Unary adding operators ===

; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/+|+]] : Plus sign &lt;math&gt;+x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/+|+]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/-|-]] : Minus sign &lt;math&gt;-x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/-|-]])&lt;/small&gt;

=== Multiplying operator ===

; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/*|*]] : Multiply, &lt;math&gt;x \times y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters/*|*]])&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Delimiters//|/]] : Divide &lt;math&gt;x / y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also special character [[Ada Programming/Delimiters//|/]])&lt;/small&gt;

; [[Ada Programming/Operators/abs|abs]] : absolute value &lt;small&gt; &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;/math&gt; (also keyword [[Ada Programming/Keywords/abs|abs]])&lt;/small&gt;

== Short-circuit control forms ==

These are not operators and thus cannot be overloaded.

; [[Ada Programming/Operators/and#Boolean_shortcut_operator|and then]] : ''e.g.'' &lt;code&gt;'''if''' Y /= 0 '''and then''' X/Y &gt; Limit '''then''' ...&lt;/code&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/or#Boolean_shortcut_operator|or else]] : ''e.g.'' &lt;code&gt;'''if''' Ptr = '''null''' '''or else''' Ptr.I = 0 '''then''' ...&lt;/code&gt;

== Membership tests  ==

The Membership Tests also cannot be overloaded because they are not operators.

; [[Ada Programming/Operators/in|in]] : element of, &lt;math&gt;var \in type&lt;/math&gt;, ''e.g.''  &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|if}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} Positive {{Ada/kw|then}}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also keyword {{Ada/kw|in}})&lt;/small&gt;
; [[Ada Programming/Operators/in|not in]] : not element of, &lt;math&gt;var \notin type&lt;/math&gt;, ''e.g.''  &lt;code&gt;{{Ada/kw|if}} I {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|in}} Positive {{Ada/kw|then}}&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;small&gt;(also keywords {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|in}})&lt;/small&gt;

=== Range membership test ===

 {{Ada/kw|if}} Today {{Ada/kw|not}} {{Ada/kw|in}} Tuesday .. Thursday {{Ada/kw|then}}
    ...

=== Subtype membership test ===

 Is_Non_Negative := X {{Ada/kw|in}} Natural;

=== Class membership test ===

 {{Ada/kw|exit}} {{Ada/kw|when}} Object {{Ada/kw|in}} Circle'{{Ada/attribute|Class}};

A More Formal Approach to Sentential Logic


Our truth table analysis has revealed something interesting about the logical connectives.  In particular, that they behave in some ways like + and . on ordinary numbers.  Our journey into the world of abstraction has dealt some dividends, so now we shall go a little bit further down the path of abstraction.

What we are going to do is to define the propositional calculus as a formal language, rather like a computer programming language.  We will use English, together with one or two Greek letters, to define and talk about the formal language of propositional calculus.  Thus English is the ''metalanguage'', and propositional calculus is the ''object language''.

== Well-Formed Formulae ==

We have introduced logical fomulae.  Some strings of logical symbols make sense and some do not; ' p &amp;or; ' is nonsense as it wants something after the connective.  The ones that do make sense are called ''well formed formulas'' or ''wffs'' for short.  We can introduce some rules for distinguishing wffs from gobbledegook:

* Any sentence letter is a wff.

:So far we have been using p, q and r as sentence letters.  In reality, there is an infinite supply of them. We could write p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so forth, but we shall stay with p, q, and r.

* If φ is a wff, then ¬ φ is a wff.

* If φ and ψ are wffs, then (φ ∧ ψ), (φ ∨ ψ), (φ → ψ) and (φ ↔ ψ)are wffs.

:In our formal treatment we always write the brackets.

* Closure Clause: Nothing else is a wff.

This rules out nonsense strings.  Note that, though the rules are to distinguish that which could be meaningful from that which is not, the rules are purely syntactic.

The other thing to note is that the rules have inverses, which is handy for deciding whether something that has already been written is a wff or not.  We just apply these inverse rules until either we are left with nothing or get stuck.  So we have an effective procedure for generating wffs, and an effective procedure for deciding whether a string is a wff.

We now introduce some ''rules of inference'' for propositional calculus.  In some ways these rules are unnecessary, as we could take truth tables as as fundamental and prove the following rules using truth tables.  However, when we get to predicate calculus, we won't have truth tables to help us, and will have to rely entirely on rules of inference.

== Rules of Inference ==

We now introduce some ''rules of inference'' for propositional calculus.  In some ways these rules are unnecessary, as we could take truth tables as as fundamental and prove the following rules using truth tables.  However, when we get to predicate calculus, we won't have truth tables to help us, and will have to rely entirely on rules of inference.

*Double Negative Elimination: From the wff ¬ ¬ φ, we may infer φ.
*Conjunction Introduction: From any wff φ and any wff ψ, we may infer ( φ ∧ ψ ).
*Conjunction Elimination: From any wff ( φ ∧ ψ ), we may infer φ and ψ
*Disjunction Introduction: From any wff φ, we may infer (φ ∨ ψ) and (ψ ∨ φ), where ψ is any wff.
*Disjunction Elimination: From wffs of the form ( φ ∨ ψ ), ( φ → χ ), and ( ψ → χ ), we may infer χ.
*Bi conditional Introduction: From wffs of the form ( φ → ψ ) and ( ψ → φ ), we may infer ( φ ↔ ψ ).
*Bi conditional Elimination: From the wff ( φ ↔ ψ ), we may infer ( φ → ψ ) and ( ψ → φ ).
*Modus Ponens: From wffs of the form φ and ( φ → ψ ), we may infer ψ.
*Conditional Proof: If ψ can be derived while assuming the hypothesis φ, we may infer ( φ → ψ ).
*Reductio ad Absurdum: If we can derive both ψ and ¬ ψ while assuming the hypothesis φ, we may infer ¬ φ.

== Interdefinability of operators ==

It is possible to define some logic operators in terms of others. For example, the truth table for the formula (φ → ψ) is equal to that of ¬(φ ∧ ¬ψ), so we might want to consider (φ → ψ) nothing more than an abbreviated notation for ¬(φ ∧ ¬ψ).&lt;br /&gt;
The interesting point here is that ''all logic operators in propositional calculus can be expressed in terms of'' ¬ ''and'' ∧. This fact allows us to express the rules for well-formed formulae in a very simple way:

* If φ is a wff, then ¬ φ is a wff.
* If φ and ψ are wffs, then (φ ∧ ψ) is a wff.
* Nothing else is a well formed formula.

We can then define the other operators in terms of these two:

* (φ → ψ) is, by definition, ¬(φ ∧ ¬ψ).
* (φ ↔ ψ) is, by definition, (φ → ψ) ∧ (ψ → φ).
* (φ ∨ ψ) is, by definition, ¬(¬φ ∧ ¬ψ).

If we take into account these definitions (three additional rules), it may seem that we have not gained much by reducing the number of primitive operators. However, when the system of propositional calculus is considered as a whole (as, for example, when we are studying the properties of the system) it is useful to have a description of the system in terms of a very small number of rules. In cases like this we are not interested in particular formulae, so we can drop the additional rules which define the other operators.&lt;br /&gt;
It is also possible to prove that all logical operators can be defined in terms of ¬ and ∨.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is an index to Wikibooks articles, not a book about about programming languages.
The format should support multiple entries for every language.
There's no point to write encyclopedia-style articles about every language on Wikibooks.
The articles on Wikipedia are more mature and should be linked to.

==[[Programming:C plus plus]]==

Initially there used to be one page [[Programming:C plus plus]]. Then I thought it'd be nice to split into modules similar to [[Programming:C]] and started many modules including [[Programming:C plus plus Hello world]] (the rest can be got by successively clicking the next link in the previous module). [[User:Panic2k4]] was of the opinion that the entire book should be in a single module, at least for now, and started contributing heavily to [[Programming:C plus plus]], incl. content from some (not all) of the &quot;Programming:C plus plus *&quot; pages. Since I was opposed to this, and Panic didn't want to argue with me, he started a *shudder* fork at [[Programming: C -/- -/-]], and replaced the link to [[Programming:C plus plus]] on this bookshelf with a link to [[Programming: C -/- -/-]]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 09:30, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Multiple entries for C++ ==
I reformatted the C++ entry to include both books and a Wikipedia article. There are dozens of
about C++ in every book store. There is no reason to have just one book on Wikibooks.
:It depends on what you mean. There is certainly room for several C++ books ''that have different goals/scopes'' on WikiBooks. For example, we'd all be happy to see a complete beginners guide to C++, an advanced software engineering guide with C++, and a complete C++ language reference, and so on. But it's very, very damaging to a creative, collaborative project to have two books with the same goal competing with each other. Would-be contributors might be scared off, thinking that if they spent time contributing to one book it might be wasted. I would even say there is room for C++ books on the same ability level, that cover the same topics to be included, provided that they take radically different philosophies: such as one book that teaches OO concepts first, while another teaches procedural programming first. But [[Wikibooks:Forking policy|they cannot be forks of one another]]. Perhaps it's best to think of WikiBooks as a publisher, instead of a bookstore. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:23, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

== Object-oriented/Imperative Hybrid ==

Having moved the categorised list from [[Programming:List of languages]] I have noticed that the largest category is not mentioned. I mean the Object-oriented/Imperative Hybrids. So should they not get their own group?

; Disadvantage : The Object-oriented catecory becomes very small - there are only a very few true and only OO languages around. Users looking for OO might be disappointed.

; Advantage : The currently most important languages group becomes an exposed position. [UNSIGNED]

I think the term &quot;hybrid&quot; to describe languages has been steadily going out of style. It would probably be best to just have:
*functional,
*procedural,
*logical,
*object-oriented,
*mathematical/scientific,
*domain-specific, and
*scripting.
When creating a categorization of languages, it seems like it would be a failure to have the largest category essentially the same as &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;. I would not have categories for DbC. Perhaps I would put the web languages under domain-specific, or into their own category, &quot;web programming&quot; (similarly with database languages).

A re-org should happen to make this all cleaner. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 22:32, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

== General policy for programming language books ==

Is this the best place to discuss general policy for programming language books ?

In particular, is there a policy that covers statements such as:

&quot;C# is ... is a complete, robust programming language without the limitations that make Java strictly a niche or toy language.&quot; -- [[Programming:C sharp]]

This seems needlessly inflammatory.

All programming languages are niche languages.

In particular, C# works on less than 10 percent of all the CPUs manufactured in 2003. &quot;Less than 10% of all the CPUs sold in the world are 32-bit or more.&quot; -- [[:w:microprocessor]].

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 11:06, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

C# works on more like 90% of systems, if you don't include embedded (Palm) handhelds/smartphones, previous game consoles, and pre-OSX machines, C# has standardization through EMCA, it's .NET components such as WinForms which are the platform-specific issue, Mono implements most through GTK# and Cocoa#.  I agree it's not NPOV, and in a big part platform specific for full functionality, however speaking, the integration and machine compilable ability might be an advantage.  I have to disagree with the 10% part are 32-bit part, everything since 1997 are 32-bit, even ARM.  Mono has only been ported to SPARC and PowerPC though, and is not 64-bit capable afaik, only .NET on Windows is.  To each his own on which platform is more of a toy, though in truth on desktops .NET has a larger install base than Java.

--[[User:sparcdr|James C]] 1:33, 18 Nov 2007 (UTC)

=== NPOV ===

Well the above statement clearly violates the NPOV (Neutral Point of View) and needs to be removed.

Apart from that: There is no place to discuss the advantages/disadvantages of languages - there will always be a flame war.

There is a cross language chapter in [[Computer_programming#Programming_Languages]].

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 08:11, 10 Jun 2005 (UTC)

There should be a place to discuss advantages and disadvantages but it has to be remembered that what is an advantage and what is a disadvantage depends on the context.  Each statement that language X is better than language Y needs to state the situation in which the advantage exists.  For instance the oft touted superiority of Fortran over, say VB6, for numerical calculations is irrelevant if the task at hand is string processing.  It is the total performance of code written for a specific purpose that counts and this is a matter of immense importance and surely need not generate a flame war.  Whether such a discussion belongs on Wikibooks is another question.  [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 18:00:51, 2005-09-06 (UTC)

== [[Meta-languages_bookshelf]] vs. [[Programming languages bookshelf]] ==

I see that PostScript has been moved to the [[Meta-languages_bookshelf]].
Why? I thought we kept all [[:w:Turing-complete]] languages (such as PostScript), on the [[Programming languages bookshelf]], and put non-Turing-complete languges (such as XML) on the [[Meta-languages_bookshelf]]. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 09:24, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: PostScript is [[:w:Turing-complete]]? If so in a more theoretical way (you '''could''' write a Speadsheed using PostScript) or in a practical way (you '''would''' write a Speadsheed using PostScript). --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 08:09, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

:: Turing-complete means &quot;theoretical&quot;.  Every turing-complete language could theoretically replace any other turing-complete language.  However, every language is ''optimized'' for a particular range of tasks and designs.  You could write a spreadsheet in PS, but it'd be better to use a language more suited for that. --[[User:RandalSchwartz|Randal L. Schwartz]] 13:07, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

Why are these languages called Meta languages?  Meta usually means ''about'' or ''concerning'' as in metadata on web pages, it is data that says something about data.  And as for Postscript, there are plenty of tasks that Postscript is suitable for but they tend to belong to the ''domain'' of ''typesetting'' so why change the name from ''Domain Specific'', which is clear and unambiguous,  to ''Meta-languages'' which isn't. [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 17:53:09, 2005-09-06 (UTC)

== Object Orientated? ==

In the bookshelf area, object oriented is refered to as object orientated (east facing).  I did not see a way to edit this title.  Am I missing something? 

[[User:Christine Frayda|Christine Frayda]] 23:24, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

:Fixed.  The thing to do is click the tab to edit the page and then scroll down until you see the list of templates used (right at the the bottom).  Click the relevant template and edit that.  In standard British English non-technical uses ''orientated'' is the usual form but jargon uses prefer ''oriented''.  It has nothing to do with ''east facing'' but rather it is related to ''orientation''.  See http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutgrammar/oriented?view=uk.  [[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 07:02:12, 2005-09-06 (UTC)

== Objective-C ==

Objective-C is listed under the Macintosh-specific section. I do not think it should be there; although it is predominantly used with Cocoa, it was not introduced on the Mac, and compilers, runtimes, and kits are available for a great many platforms.

== other wiki ==

Many languages already have a dedicated wiki.
If there is a Wikibook for that language, please link to that remote wiki in the &quot;For further reading&quot; section of its Wikibook.

But what about languages that don't already have a Wikibook (such as Lua)?
For the convenience of people looking for information on such languages,
I'm going to stick links to their remote wiki here on the programming languages bookshelf. OK?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 21:23, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

== API Specific Books ==

I've noticed that there isn't a bookshelf/subsection for API specific books. What about Direct X, Open GL, Win32, Linux, ect programming books?

Also, many API's are often language specific, or have a specific set of libraries for a programming language. So finding exactly where they should go will be quite a trick.


== naming convention for books on the Programming languages bookshelf ==

Are there any special conventions for naming and organizing programming-related books that go beyond the regular
[[Wikibooks:Naming conventions]]
?
In particular, it seems that many early wikibooks began with the &quot;Programming:&quot; pseudo-namespace, but that no longer seems to be popular for newer books.
(I suspect this may have already been discussed to death -- please give me a link to that discussion.)
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 12:54, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

In particular, which name is the best -- [[Programming:Java]], [[Java Programming]], or [[Java]]?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 01:22, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

:From what I can see, either [[Java Programming]] or [[Java]] work (although the former seems quite popular).  [[Programming:Java]] is right out.  I tend to prefer things like [[Java]] or [[Haskell]] myself. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 16:46, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

==Source Tags?==

The page mentions source-tags. Where can I find information on how to use them? (Or could someone explain shortly?) [[User:Otus|Otus]] 15:58, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

:You can find information on the syntax highlighting extension [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight GeSHi|here]], which uses '''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source language=&quot;lang&quot;&gt;...&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' to format programming code with language-specific syntax hightlighting. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:33, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

== free compilers ==

The majority of languages on our bookshelf are mentioned in the
[http://idiom.com/free-compilers/ &quot;Catalog of Free Compilers and Interpreters&quot;].

I'm thinking about going through each book on the programming languages bookshelf, and add a link to the appropriate section of that catalog.

Is this a bad idea? If so, please tell me now before I waste too much time on this project.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 07:26, 26 September 2007 (UTC)

:If you do so, be sure to include it in the right place for each book. If your not sure of where such a link should go in a book, I would suggest not doing it for that book or only suggest that a link to be added on the book discussion page. Otherwise it may just end up being removed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:50, 3 October 2007 (UTC)

==book listings==

php does support object oriented programming, yet it is not placed under the object oriented category.  maybe someone could do this?

* Basic object orientation has been part of PHP since PHP3. [[User:Tinned Tuna|Tinned Tuna]] ([[User talk:Tinned Tuna|talk]]) 15:29, 7 January 2009 (UTC)

== Visual Basic? ==

Why does the table of contents list # 1.5 PHP – Visual Basic .NET when the last alphabetical entry is XForms? &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Anon1171|Anon1171]] ([[User talk:Anon1171|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Anon1171|contribs]]) 2008-03-04T00:53:36&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Thanks, now fixed. [[User:Webaware|Webaware]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Webaware|talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:27, 3 March 2008 (UTC)

== ColdFusion link missing? ==
Oh master of this index page... Can you please add in the link to this page:
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming:ColdFusion

== Cobol ==

I think that list misses Cobol

== New Scheme book ==

I've recently been working on a new book to cover the Scheme programming language, since there was no book on it. It is in need of expansion, clean up, and so on. I don't think it's ready for this bookshelf yet, but I think it's worth having some other people look at it with me. Stylistically and structurally it draws heavily from the [[C Programming|C Programming]] book.

Nand and Nor

Our connectives &amp;not;, &amp;and;, &amp;or;, &amp;rarr;, fit easily with our every day way of reasoning about things.  For the reductionists out there, it turns out that we can get a single connective to do all the work of our familiar connectives.  Indeed there are two ways we can do this.

The first way is using ''joint denial'', known in electronics circles as ''nand''.  Its truth table is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
  A B Output
  0 0    1
  0 1    1
  1 0    1
  1 1    0
&lt;/pre&gt;

We can see that &amp;not;p is the same as p nand p.  etc.  ...


The other candidate is ''alternative denial'' or ''nor''.

Electronics people like nand and nor.  I think it is because it gives them a one-size-fits-all chip, which they can connect up how  they like to get the other connectives.

Is there are an advanced civilization on some distant planet that does all its reasoning using nand or nor?  If so, would cause and effect ever have become a big issue for them?

Cut the Crap: Example; (above paragraph without crap)

Book will contain zero extra wordage

Information will be compact, concise, to - point.

:Of course there is an weighing between compactness and readability. My point was rather that the book should not contain &quot;affirmations that these techniques will work even for you and so on&quot; and &quot;No unscientific testimonials&quot;. I believe that a book written like above would not be very valuable. Unfortunately a lot of rambling has been introduced in the book. Maybe in a couple of years the book will be better.

hello, I am interested in, and an expert on, the Topic of &quot;Psychonautics.&quot;
(And by this, I do not mean merely the drug using justification)

I may be interested in adding to your book, it certainly sounds like
the direction i have thought of taking.

The Title of the book has some distinct advantages and disadvantages
over the standard Title for the science as I understand it. 

cons; 
*Sounds a little new agey
*is two words long

Pros
*may have a better ability to communicate content to the average
reader.
*Doesn't carry with it the luggage of habit justifying drug users.

:&quot;yo ocurro&quot; can only make sense if spoken by a abstract being, like an earthquake. You can construct every person (tú ocurres, él ocurre, nosotros ocurrimos, vosotros ocurrís, ellos ocurren), but it makes not a lot of sense to put an effort in learning them, as the probability of encountering them is extremely low.

==For the Historians==
So you want to learn about World History, huh?  Well, we plan to help you do just that, but before we begin there are a few things we should discuss.  First of which is the standard on which this project was and is being developed.  The AP World History Standard provides an outline of history as well as stipulations concerning the structure of any such project.  As such, the text should be sufficient, if one knew most of it, to provide the reader with a strong possibility of getting at least a 3 on his or her AP World History Exam.  However, the addition of parts relating to the writing of historical essays, especially based on the AP World History Standard, is far off.  However, multiple-choice type tests are planned for each section dealing with the kinds of analytical and &quot;big-picture&quot; questions likely to appear on an AP World History Exam.  Well, you might say, that's all well and great but I just wanna do some history.  Perfect, but first, please read this page, as it will cover a great number of frequently asked questions and provide a good basis for the study of history.  So without further ado, let the quest for knowledge begin!

==Structurally speaking==
The structure of this project is meant to divide the scope of world history into manageable chunks.  However, the number of chapters will probably expand in the future.  In addition to the chapters, we have some special sections which are present to make it interesting.  Let's see what they are, shall we?

*[[Image:Bulbgraph.png|20px]]  This image denotes a section of especial interest which we thought would be nice to delve deeper into.  It's probably something you're already familiar with, like the pyramids in Egypt.
*[[Image:Lautsprecher3.png|15px]]  This image shows off a first-person narrative or commentary that we have.  It puts issues in some context, and helps you understand how the people actually felt.
*[[Image:Open_book_01.svg|20px]]  This image shows a link to a non-fiction text on an event or period by an author who says it particularly well, such as Spielvogel might.  Might also contain essays written by contributors on possible points of interest.

==The Big Picture==
Did you know that there is a word for the study of history?  Well there is.  It's called Historiography.  You may not know it, but you and I are historiographers. Adolf Hitler was a historiographer.  Karl Marx was a historiographer.  Anyone who tries to delve into the big picture of history, develop patterns, and analyze cross-cultural historical trends is a historiographer.  And that's what's important about reading this text.  Keep the big picture in mind.  Don't let one thing get you too far off the ball, and for heaven sakes, try not to become overly euro-centric.  This will hurt your viewpoint and contaminate any hope for you understanding history correctly for a long time.  Because one of our primary concerns was structure, the layout of this text does not exactly help the matter.  So, what can you do to keep the big-picture in mind?  Start with these tips:
*Look at and note the dates, don't just read them.  They can help you tell what cultures existed at the same time.  Then you can know better what to compare and when.
*Review events outside of the Western Hemisphere more than once, to make sure they sink in.  Try to become interested in at least one or two civilizations/events/movements which occurred entirely or primarily outside of Europe and the United States.  Then you'll at least know something that doesn't have Western culture stamped all over it.
*Things change throughout time (well, duh).  Note the changes in a time period not only in a culture or civilization, but across the world as a whole.  How did things change and how did they stay the same (continuities)?

==Terms you should know==
There will be a few important terms that keep cropping up so you'll want to be sure and take note.  Better yet, learn them now, while they're listed right here on your screen.  Instead of going alphabetically, they are listed together in sets of like terms.

*Writing systems
**Pictogram- The simplest form of writing, consists of pictures representing what they mean, such as a tree for a tree and such.
**Ideogram- The next evolutionary stage of a system of writing is ideograms, which, if confronted with their origin look like what they represent, but on the surface just look like symbols with some idea attached to them.  Chinese uses ideograms.
**Phonetic alphabet-  Your own English alphabet is phonetic.  Such a system consists of a finite set of letters (usually less than 40 or so) and each represents a sound in the language.  For instance the letter &quot;I&quot; does not mean just yourself, it can be used in the word &quot;illumination&quot;.
*Languages
**Indo-European- Comprises the languages of Europe, and much of Iran, Pakistan and the Indian sub-continent.
***Romance- Languages almost entirely based on Latin, most speakers can understand one or more of the same group, the three most pure Latinically speaking are Romanian, Italian, and Spanish
***Germanic- Like the word suggests, those languages based on German and the languages which developed in that area, examples include German, English, and Dutch
***Balto-Slavic- Those languages of Eastern Europe and Russia which share common Slavic sounds.  Like the Romance group, most speakers can understand at least one other language of the Balto-Slavic group.  Some examples are Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish.
***Albanian- This language is widespread and different enough to warrant its own mention, and is spoken in Albania as well as Kosovo and far northwestern Greece.
***Greek- Spoken in Greece and still very similar to its ancient form
***Uralic- These odd languages are distantly related.  They include Hungarian (&quot;Magyarian&quot;), Finnish and Estonian.
**Altaic- A controversial language grouping that is not accepted by all historical linguists
***Turkish, Tatar, Azerbaijani, borrows from both Western and Eastern (primarily Arabic) sources
*Culture words
**Occidental- Another name for Western culture
**Oriental- Another name for Eastern culture
*Region words
**Turkey (the nation today)
***Asia Minor- What the Romans called this peninsula, used commonly in Roman times and the Middle Ages
***Anatolia- What the Greeks called it, used predominantly in ancient times
**Mesoamerica- Literally middle-America, consisting of the Panama isthmus north to the area of Mexico just south of the Yucatan peninsula
**Latin America- Central and South American nations, so-called because Spanish and Portuguese languages are heavily based on Latin
**West Indies- It's the 400 year-old mistake (Columbus didn't know any better. We do).  These are islands which are found in the Caribbean Sea and are only called the West Indies because Columbus thought he had landed in the East Indies (hence the name Indians for Native Americans).
**East Indies-  The groups of islands located in the Pacific Ocean including Indonesia, Micronesia, Malaysia, and others.  Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Spice Islands&quot;, these were what Columbus was looking for.  He obviously didn't ever find them.

==Dates==
The AP World History Standard has adopted the date system of using the terms C.E. for Common Era and B.C.E. for Before Common Era, which are identical to the the terms A.D. (anno domini, Latin for &quot;In the year of our Lord&quot;) and B.C. (before Christ).  However, their use is not widespread and therefore the use of A.D. and B.C. is retained in this text.  Also, it seems a little silly to invent such names because of religious concerns when they are identical to the religious periods.  In addition, if dates are given as &quot;800 A.D&quot; or &quot;1950 B.C.&quot; then they are often a guess or approximation.  These dates are almost universally preceded by the words &quot;about&quot; or &quot;around&quot;, or the more intellectual &quot;circa&quot;.

Also, a note about calendars.  The Julian calendar was in use throughout the Western world for much of history, until it was discovered that it had become over a week inaccurate.  So, we switched to Gregorian calendar to correct the problem.  Actually, in Russia it wasn't even introduced until Lenin took power; the October Revolution actually happened in November on the Gregorian calendar.  So dates in the chapter [[World History/The Russian Revolution|The Russian Revolution]] might be a bit hazy before 1918.

==For the &quot;Historians&quot;==
Some people might question our setup, layout, or the choice of included facts or they might find something wrong or in dispute.  Great, we welcome suggestions and comments.  And there's a place for it, on the [[World History]] discussion page.  As for factual inaccuracies, etc., put them on the offending page's talk page, and we'll get to it as soon as we can (or see it).  However, don't just criticize us, it's not constructive, and we don't care how you'd do it all that much, and this is the way ''we'' did it.  So please don't just say the whole thing's stupid and we don't know what we're talking about.  We'll probably have a few choice words to say back to you.  Or maybe we'll just openly laugh and make fun of you.  Either way you lose, and we win.  So follow our [[World History/Golden Rule|Golden Rule]], assume good faith and play nice.  And now, on to World History...

==The AP World History Exam==

Advanced Placement World History is a course offered by many high schools within the United States of America.  The curriculum and course structure are determined by the College Board, a non-profit organization which develops all Advanced Placement (AP) curricula and exams.  The course structure is in the area marked [[World History/AP World History Standard|AP World History Standard]].  Below is an overview of the exam.

The AP World History Exam is divided into two sections, a multiple-choice test and an essay section.  Both count for 50% of the total exam grade.  Like all AP exams, the exam is scored on a scale of 1 - 5, with 3 being the accepted rate of passing.  Many colleges give credit for scores of 3 or above, although private colleges may require a 4 or even a 5.  Also, because of this scale, most people will receive a 3 or a 4.  In 2004, 48,558 students took the exam. The exact averages for each score in that year were: 22% of test-takers received a 1, 23.2% a 2, 27.8% a 3, 16.1% a 4, and 10.9% a 5.  The mean test grade was a 2.72 (not a score, just an average). As you can see, only a small fraction of the test-takers achieve the highest score, and this should not necessarily be your goal. 

The test is designed to cover four specific periods of history: c. 8000 B.C.E. to 600 C.E. (also called &quot;Foundations&quot;), 600 – 1450 C.E., 1450 – 1750 C.E.,  1750 – 1914 C.E., and 1914 C.E. – Present.  C.E. stands for Common Era and B.C.E. stands for Before Common Era, and each corresponds precisely to A.D. and B.C., respectively, in this text.  (This may be a lapse in the College Board's judgment-they are not in wide use, and are an attempt to be as politically correct as possible).

===The Multiple-choice Section===

The multiple-choice section of the exam is made up of 70 questions.  The section counts for 50% of the total exam grade.  The main purpose of this portion of the test is not to test knowledge, but to test knowledge of connections, also known as the &quot;big-picture&quot;.  Comparison questions (for instance, there will always be a question asking what was similar about Ancient Rome and Han China) are notable.  There are also a small number (3-5) of questions which provide a picture or graph/chart and ask a question that sometimes requires outside information.

The section is graded similarly to the SAT (also by the College Board) in that credit is deducted for wrong answers.  For each correct answer, a student is awarded 1 point and for each wrong answer a student loses 1/4 of a point.  For answers left blank, no points are awarded or deducted.  While this might lead one to believe that it is a poor choice to guess (in layman's terms, you are actually losing 1 1/4 points for each wrong answer), this is incorrect.  Mathematically, if you can narrow a question down by eliminating two wrong answers, there is a statistical advantage to guessing the answers on those questions that will give you a positive net change in score.

**note: As of the 2011 exam, no points are deducted for incorrect answers.

Strategies for this section:

*You won't know the answer to every question, or even something about every question, so don't be afraid to leave these questions blank: remember, you will not lose any points for doing this.
*Be definite- if you feel that an answer is wrong, assume it is and move on with the other answers: remember, your first, gut instinct is often correct.
*Don't change answers often.  Unless you come across information elsewhere in the test that indicates you were wrong in choosing your original answer, your first reaction is more likely to be correct than that given at second thought (such as in the previous strategy's situation).
*If you can eliminate two or more answers, make an educated guess and move on: remember, you have a statistical advantage of raising your score in this situation.
*Many answers are logical, and can be deduced even without prior knowledge the question's topic.  Remember that the College Board exam writers want to write as logical a test as possible, it's in their natures to craft questions that may be guessed by attentive students.
*Be mindful of your time.  You are unlikely to finish every question.  Hopefully your proctor will provide you with time updates, or better yet, a stop clock which lists remaining time.  Don't spend too much time on a single question (a trite strategy, but still true).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Antivirus==
The cyberworld is full of threats to computer security. Among the most common are '''computer  viruses'''.

Broadly speaking, a computer virus is a program that when executed attempts to &quot;infect&quot; other programs by modifying them (embedding a copy of themselves in the code) or by changing their execution path system-wise (so that a request to run program ''X'' causes the viral code to be executed too).
Usually it stays active in memory, infecting programs run by the user.

Being self-replicating is damaging enough (they tend to clog the system's resources) but since virus writers are mostly malicious, they often include a '''payload''' - a damaging action triggered by an event the coder decided upon.
The payload may cause data loss, damage to Windows' integrity and/or leakage of valuable information (passwords, email addresses, credit card numbers).

An active '''antivirus''' is a necessity when connected to the Internet, since some modern viruses (in the like of Sasser, MyDoom, etc.) try to exploit known security flaws (hopefully patched with a Windows security update... eventually) to remotely infect a computer without any user interaction.

Windows XP does not include built in antivirus functionality, but many products, free and commercial, exist to protect your computer in real time.
Here is a short list of software that does the job.

*[http://www.grisoft.com/ AVG™ Antivirus] (Commercial product but includes free version)
*[http://www.clamwin.com/ Clamwin Free Antivirus] (GNU GPL - opensource project)
*[http://www.avast.com/ avast! Antivirus] (Commercial product by Alvil Software, offers free &quot;Home&quot; edition)
*[http://www.free-av.com/ Avira Antivirus] (Commercial product by Avira, offers free &quot;Personal&quot; version)
:Has an incremental update feature, ideal for slow Internet dialup connections
*[http://www.symantec.com/nav/nav_9xnt/ Norton™ Antivirus] (Commercial product)
:Bundled on many OEM PCs. A rather heavyweight suite of programs.
*[http://uk.trendmicro-europe.com/consumer/products/products.php?prodgroup=4&amp;family=7&amp;id=44&amp;rightnav=0,0 Trend Micro™ Antivirus] (Commercial product)

Trend Micro™ also offers a free [http://housecall.trendmicro.com/ web-based scan].

Keep in mind however that all antivirus products essentially do a best-effort attempt to recognize and remove &quot;code patterns&quot; in an executable that resemble '''known''' viruses (some also use heuristics and behavioral analysis to guess if viral activity is taking place). Therefore:
*The viral definitions must be updated regularly for the software to remain effective
*They cannot detect all possible viruses, so always use caution with unknown executables (consider the circumstances: e.g. if emailed to you from someone you know ask the sender anyway before opening them)

For more information on the various Antivirus products, and for test results by independent bodies, visit: [http://www.av-comparatives.org/ AV-Comparatives] and/or [http://av-test.org/ AV-Test]. Also check the [http://sunbeltblog.blogspot.com/2008/03/march-test-results-of-antivirus.html Sunbelt blog] periodically, where clearly summarized results from AV-Test.org are published regularly.

==Firewall==
A firewall basically monitors and filters network activity directed to and from your computer.
It is first of all a security concept which involves a security policy, software and/or hardware components.

*By filtering Ping ICMP requests from the Internet (that mean &quot;Is anybody there?&quot;) your computer will stay silent and hidden from hackers.
*Malformed messages may cause undesirable behavior if, as usual, there are known glitches in the software to exploit.

The main feature of the personal firewalls (e.g. Norton, McAfee etc.) is to block open ports so that they cannot be accessed from the Internet. This allows you to deny suspicious requests.
The (very basic) Windows XP firewall does this too, and versions after the Service Pack 2 update should be sufficient to protect most home users with basic needs.

Since software firewalls also check outbound traffic, they should in theory prevent '''Trojan horse''' programs that have breached the system from sending data to their creator.
Unfortunately certain advanced malware is capable once in control of disabling specific firewalls (and antiviruses).

A '''hardware firewall''' is a physical device that interfaces two network segments.
Most routers have one built-in that is sufficient for most home networks when used in conjunction with a good software firewall.
If you need better security a dedicated firewall can be used (like Cisco Pix if the budget allows it) or for instance a Linux-based firewall system run on a older computer (e.g. [http://www.ipcop.org/ IP-Cop]).

Most hardware firewalls also support VPN (Virtual Private Network) connections and are capable of NAT  (Network Address Translation), a feature that hides the real IP addresses of your network's computers from the outside world.

Some '''personal firewall programs''' (software firewalls):
*[http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/download_firewall.html Comodo Firewall] (Free. Commercial Pro-Plus version also available)
:Comodo's firewall has come to be regarded as one of the best free firewalls available by many experts. Having said that, it is more suitable for advanced users as it is highly configurable and produces more frequent warnings - which requires more decision-making by the user than other firewalls. Also included with the comodo firewall are a Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) and a feature called &quot;Clean PC Mode&quot;, which profiles a new PC and its applications and registers the existing applications as safe. From then on, only applications that are specifically allowed by the user, or those listed on Comodo's white-list of trusted applications are allowed to be installed on the PC.

*[http://www.zonelabs.com Zone Alarm] (Free. Commercial &quot;Pro&quot; version also available)
:The Zone Alarm firewall is relatively easy to use, but it has become slightly bloated over time with tutorials, wizards, et cetera. It is an improvement over the Windows XP firewall though. '''Update:''' The Zone Alarm firewall now comes bundled with the [http://www.google.com.au/search?q=ask+toolbar&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;client=firefox-a#Toolbar Ask toolbar]. This toolbar has been rumoured to border on spyware, and is produced by InterActiveCorp (IAC), which is a company with a dubious past. Although the former is open to debate, the option to install the ask toolbar is pre-checked during the installation of Zone Alarm, which in any case renders the ask toolbar [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foistware foistware] in many security analysts' view.

Unfortunately, these personal firewalls implement some features in a highly ineffective way (e.g. &quot;stealthed ports&quot;) and some other security measures employed by them can be avoided quite easily, like ZoneAlarm's privacy protection. &lt;!-- I'm not sure if this still applies? Besides, shouldn't a note be added explaining that if you have a good hardware firewall then port stealthing doesn't matter? --&gt;

==Anti-Spyware==
The term '''spyware''' refers to a relatively new breed of malicious software (that first came under scrutiny around 1999) that focuses on stealing personal information and valuable data for unsavory purposes like identity theft.
('''Adware''' is a slightly tamer version of spyware that tracks your web surfing and sends you targeted advertisement, usually in the form of popup windows.)

Spyware typically installs on a computer without the user's informed consent, either bundled with another program or by exploiting one of the many bugs of Microsoft's Internet Explorer (the mammoth web browser bundled with Windows) to perform a &quot;drive-by download&quot; on visiting a specially crafted web page.

Antiviruses and firewalls have a hard time with these programs.
Once compromised the computer may be instructed to download more spyware.
The user will then experience massive slowdowns and system instability.

To cut a long story short, prevention is the best strategy. The point is to try reducing your computer's &quot;window of exposure.&quot;
A passable, free solution could consist in the following programs that complement each other:

*[http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/ Ad-Aware] (Commercial, free &quot;Personal&quot; edition)
:Can fix most spyware issues. To enable preemptive blocking you would have to buy the payed-for version.
*[http://www.safer-networking.org/ Spybot S&amp;D] (Free program distributed under a &quot;Dedication License&quot;)
:Slightly glitchy. Detects known malware using heuristics. It has several features (mostly accessible in &quot;Advanced mode&quot;). Useful ones are the 'Immunize' function, the download-blocker BHO, and a blacklist of &quot;bad&quot; URLs that can be added to your [[w:en:Hosts_file|HOSTS]] file.

Note: to minimize the hassle of updating you can insert the following commands into a batch file (.bat or .cmd extension) (replace %SBPATH% with the installation path):

 @echo off
 CD %SBPATH%
 SpybotSD.exe /taskbarhide /autoupdate /autoimmunize /autoclose

Consider also trying Microsoft's [http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx Windows Defender] (freely downloadable if you use a &quot;genuine copy&quot; of Windows).

If you discover that you are '''heavily''' infected (with &quot;advanced spyware&quot; that self-repairs and/or kills known anti-spyware products), also consider if making a backup of your files, erasing your hard drive and reinstalling a clean version of Windows would be less time-consuming than trying to recover a completely compromised system.

==Note==
Beware of &quot;rogue&quot; security applications! Rogue security applications are programs that pretend to clean and protect computers from malware, when in reality they are themselves malicious. Visit Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_software Rogue Software] Article for more information on rogue applications. For a frequently updated list of rogue programs, visit: [http://www.spywarewarrior.com/rogue_anti-spyware.htm#products Spywarewarrior] and Wikipedia's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_anti-spyware_programs list] of fake anti-spyware programs. As a general rule, stick to well-known and trusted security applications such as the ones mentioned in this wikibook.
